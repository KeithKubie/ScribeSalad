00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.940
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: Talking to Terry, it's been
very obvious this passion for the quality

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.590
of what they want to see, and they would not
do it on the Web unless they can create an

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.890
immersive experience like that.
So it's really possible to do this in the

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.060
browser, using HTML5. And we really hope you
and everyone watching this build showcase

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.480
applications like what we just saw.
So what does it mean to build on the Chrome

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.730
Web Store?
It means that you can reach over 70 million

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.500
users. These are primary users of Chrome as
of today.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.110
And in June of last year when we talked about
Chrome OS, we said we had 30 million years.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.410
As of today, we have over 70 million users
and the number is growing fast. These people

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.940
will be able to have the Web Store right on
their New Tab page and discover both free

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.070
and paid applications.
So it's also important to remember that this

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.070
Web Store will also be there in Chrome OS
as well. So the Chrome Web Store will work

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:10.880
on Chrome on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Chrome
OS. It will support both free and paid applications.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.939
It will work in over 40 languages and over
70 countries.

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.119
We will be bringing this in the Chrome dev
channel soon and we will have a whole session

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.850
at I/O to talk about this.
One thing I want to add is we support standard

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.420
Web technologies, and so applications written
for Chrome Web Store will also continue to

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.909
work on every other modern browser out there.
So it's been really exciting to talk about

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:41.869
HTML5. We have always believed that the future
of Web is HTML5. And over the course of the

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.670
last few months, it's been very exciting to
see every major browser vendor share that

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.920
opinion as well.
So with that, I am going to invite Lars Rasmussen,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.460
who spoke to you last year about Google Wave,
an amazing example of what's possible in the

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.630
browser, to give a future update on HTML5.
[ Applause ]

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.810
&gt;&gt;Lars Rasmussen: Good morning.
Good morning, everyone.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.650
So, the Web has grown up.
And Google Wave is starting to grow up as

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.150
well.
It's been a full year since we showed you

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.209
what was really our vision for hour real-time
communication and collaboration could work

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.180
on the Web.
We showed you right here on this stage with

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.180
an 80-minute demo last year.
And today, Google Wave is a product that people

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.040
are starting to use to get real work done
all over the world.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.260
And we're going to show you that today with
a 90-minute -- I'm just kidding.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.879
We're not going to do that.
[ Laughter ]

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:40.000
&gt;&gt;Lars Rasmussen: What we are going to do
is this: We're going to open up Wave to everyone

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.860
today.
So you no longer need an invitation to use

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.990
Wave.
Just go to Wave.google.com and log right in.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.560
Thank you.
[ Applause ]

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.250
&gt;&gt;Lars Rasmussen: Thank you.
So we're making -- we're making Wave part

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.890
of Google Apps, where particularly ambitious,
you might even say crazy services start their

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.019
life.
Maps, my last project, started there five

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.549
years ago.
Wave has been in an invitation-only preview

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.250
for half a year.
We've gotten tons of great feedback.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.280
Thanks so much for that.
And more than anything, we've learned that

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.280
Wave really shines as a place to get work
done, in particular, if you have a group or

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.390
a team of people that use Wave to collaborate
on all manners of projects.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:24.110
And the thing we hear a lot -- and this actually
matches our own experience -- is that Wave

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.890
changes the way you work, sometimes in subtle
and unexpected ways.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.620
And we hear this in many different contexts.
Of course, lots of programmers use Wave to

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.629
coordinate their work.
But we hear things like a fifth-grade teacher

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.159
has her students do all the research in Wave.
And the kids love the live typing.

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:43.120
It feels like you're talking to the other
participants on the Wave.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.250
And the teacher loves it because she can see
in real time what they're doing and jump right

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.819
in and provide guidance.
Brick-and-mortar businesses like this hotel

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:58.989
here, they use Wave exclusively to track and
discuss all of their tasks during the day.

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:04.069
They tell us how Wave stops issues from falling
through the cracks and helps keep everyone

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.760
on the same page every day.
Deloitte is a good example.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.790
They have a new project team that's spread
over four or five countries.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.170
And they use Wave to coordinate all of the
work and tell us how Wave actually saves them

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.850
money in travel and VC cost.
And so since Wave is about getting work done,

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.350
it's important for us to get Wave -- make
Wave available at work and at schools.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.270
So also today, we're making Wave part of Google
Apps.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.180
If you have an apps domain, you or your administrator
can easily enable Wave for all of your users

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.600
at no extra cost.
[ Applause ]

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:47.569
&gt;&gt;Lars Rasmussen: Thank you.
And let me just say this: If you tried Wave

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:52.639
already, in particular, early on during the
preview, and you found it wasn't quite ready

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.110
to get work done, now's a good time to come
back and give it a second try.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.780
Wave is a lot faster and it's a lot more stable
than when we started the preview.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.669
We put a lot of work into the basic preview
things.

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:08.870
You can now get e-mail notifications when
 -- we have found it easier to navigate the

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:16.949
unmet pieces of the Wave.
We have added tutorials and templates to help

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:20.580
new users get started.
You can have -- remove a participant if you

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.569
add them by mistake.
If you have a group or team and you're working

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:31.099
on a project together, try out Wave.
I think you will find it makes you more productive.

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:35.430
Now, this is a developer event.
And I think already some of the coolest things

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.690
about Wave are things you guys are built.
We really, really appreciate that.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.960
And continuing to improve our APIs are hugely
important to us.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.590
Just a few months ago, we launched an entire
new version of our robot API that lets robots

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.300
create waves and push content into waves on
their own schedule.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.720
We also made it a lot easier to embed a wave
on your own Web site.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.810
We even made it possible for a non-Wave user
to see a public wave that you embedded on

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:08.360
your Web site.
Today, we're checking off a bunch of top-requested

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.230
features or APIs.
For starters, we're rolling out a change that

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.580
means that robots no longer have to live on
Google App Engine.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.860
They can live anywhere on the Web, which makes
it a lot easier to integrate Wave with your

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:26.270
own application.
We're also launching a new Wave data API designed

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:31.830
to let you build things like notifiers, but
also lightweight clients, in particular, for

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.599
mobile devices.
We're adding media and attachment features

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:41.629
to both our robot and gadget APIs so you can
integrate with places like Picasa and Flickr

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:45.530
and so on and build inline viewers for media
types in Wave.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:51.259
We're also adding a bunch more hooks for your
extensions to integrate into our client.

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:54.600
And if you want to see some of the cool things
people have already built, join us out on

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.669
the floor in the developer sandbox.
For example, Salesforce.Com is with us today,

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:05.629
showing how they're embedding waves into their
new product, Chatter.

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:11.250
Also, we've always wanted Wave to be an open
technology so that anyone should be able to

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:16.180
build their own Wave service and have it interoperate
in real time with Google Wave.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:21.319
And so we were super excited late last year
when Novell announced their new product, Pulse

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:26.819
is going to support the Wave Federation protocol.
And today, SAP is announcing that their new

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:31.000
product, StreamWork, will also support the
Wave Federation protocol.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.370
Both companies are with us today, out on the
floor and at a session later, where we'll

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:39.250
show demos of how our different Wave services
are starting to be able to talk to each other

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.319
in real time.
And to make this sort of thing easier for

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:47.449
others to build their own Wave systems, we
are today open-sourcing additional components

00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:52.669
of our production code, in particular, the
in-browser editor, which is one of the hardest

00:07:52.669 --> 00:07:55.860
pieces to write.
We're also publishing --

00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:01.080
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Lars Rasmussen: Thank you.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.409
We're also publishing -- and this is another
top-requested feature -- we're publishing

00:08:05.409 --> 00:08:09.879
the beginnings of a client/server protocol
so that you guys will be able to build any

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:14.580
Wave client you want and put it on top of
any Wave services that speaks this new protocol,

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:20.530
which, of course, will include Google Wave.
Now, just to end off, I want to remind you

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.580
that we're using Wave at this conference here.
There's a couple of waves allocated for each

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:28.069
session.
You can use them to ask questions of the presenter.

00:08:28.069 --> 00:08:31.699
Someone will take live notes, and you can
discuss the session in there.

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:36.159
I really hope to see you later, either out
on the floor, at one of the many sessions

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:39.200
that we have today and tomorrow, or, of course,
on Wave.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:44.229
Happy Waving, everyone.
[ Applause ]

00:08:44.229 --> 00:08:50.040
&gt;&gt;Lars Rasmussen: Thank you.
And so just like Wave is getting to work,

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.029
our next speaker will talk about the Web going
to work.

00:08:53.029 --> 00:09:03.040
Please welcome Google director of engineering,
David Glazer.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:10.010
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;David Glazer: All right, all right.

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:18.590
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;David Glazer: So Sundar showed you how open

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:22.959
standards are leading to innovation in the
consumer Web, with the help of people like

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:29.240
Terry and Kevin and Hakon, showed you how
open standards have always allowed more choice,

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.920
which has always led to more innovation.
Lars showed you how that's true with Google

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.720
Wave.
And he showed you how Google Wave is now heading

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.839
off to work.
Well, I'm going to spend the next 45 minutes

00:09:39.839 --> 00:09:44.500
showing you more about how is the Web making
work better, what are the things that we can

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:49.320
do to help the Web transform what we all do
at work, what our customers do at work, what

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.910
our partners do at work, how can the Web help
there.

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:56.600
The good news is, the Web is already transforming
the way we work.
