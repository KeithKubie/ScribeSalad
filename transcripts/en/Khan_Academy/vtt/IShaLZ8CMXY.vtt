00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:02.308
- [Tutor] I have a rectangular prism here.

00:00:02.308 --> 00:00:04.450
We're given two of the dimensions.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.001
The width is two, the depth is three,

00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:10.110
and this height here, we're
just representing with an h.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.224
And what we're gonna do in this video

00:00:11.224 --> 00:00:13.024
is think about how does the volume

00:00:13.024 --> 00:00:15.107
of this rectangular prism change

00:00:15.107 --> 00:00:17.423
as we change the height.

00:00:17.423 --> 00:00:19.897
So, let's make a little table here.

00:00:19.897 --> 00:00:20.730
So, let me

00:00:22.813 --> 00:00:24.085
make my table.

00:00:24.085 --> 00:00:25.687
So, this is going to be our height,

00:00:25.687 --> 00:00:28.993
and this is going to be
our volume, V for volume.

00:00:28.993 --> 00:00:31.553
And so, let's say that the height is five.

00:00:31.553 --> 00:00:33.564
What is the volume going to be?

00:00:33.564 --> 00:00:36.769
Pause this video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.783
Well, the volume is just going to be

00:00:38.783 --> 00:00:41.628
the base times height times depth,

00:00:41.628 --> 00:00:44.465
or you can say it's going to
be the area of this square,

00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:48.274
so it's the width times
the depth which is six

00:00:48.274 --> 00:00:50.042
times the height.

00:00:50.042 --> 00:00:53.760
So, that would be two
times three times five.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.260
So, two times three times five

00:00:57.356 --> 00:00:59.559
which is equal to six times five

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.642
which is equal to 30, 30 cubic units.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.185
We're assuming that these
are given in some units,

00:01:06.185 --> 00:01:08.250
so this would be the units cubed.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.513
Alright, now let's think about it

00:01:10.513 --> 00:01:13.274
if we were to double the height.

00:01:13.274 --> 00:01:16.265
What is going to happen to our volume?

00:01:16.265 --> 00:01:18.934
So, if we double the
height, our height is 10,

00:01:18.934 --> 00:01:19.918
what is the volume?

00:01:19.918 --> 00:01:22.861
Pause this video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:24.756
Well, in this situation,

00:01:24.756 --> 00:01:26.915
we're still gonna have two times three,

00:01:26.915 --> 00:01:29.998
two times three times our new height,

00:01:31.194 --> 00:01:32.027
times 10.

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:36.784
So, now it's gonna be six
times 10 which is equal to 60.

00:01:36.784 --> 00:01:39.919
Notice, when we doubled the height,

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:42.409
if we just double one dimension,

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.465
we are going to double the volume.

00:01:45.465 --> 00:01:47.259
Let's see if that holds up.

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.051
Let's double it again.

00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:52.510
So, what happens when
our height is 20 units?

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.903
Well here, our volume is still gonna be

00:01:54.903 --> 00:01:56.986
two times three times 20,

00:01:57.864 --> 00:01:59.864
two times three times 20

00:02:02.384 --> 00:02:05.107
which is equal to six times 20

00:02:05.107 --> 00:02:07.685
which is equal to 120.

00:02:07.685 --> 00:02:10.374
So, once again, if you
double one of the dimensions,

00:02:10.374 --> 00:02:11.771
in this case the height,

00:02:11.771 --> 00:02:13.604
it doubles the volume.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.211
You can think of it the other way.

00:02:16.211 --> 00:02:19.126
If you were to halve, if you
were to go from 20 to 10,

00:02:19.126 --> 00:02:21.702
so if you halve one of the dimensions,

00:02:21.702 --> 00:02:23.012
it halves the volume.

00:02:23.012 --> 00:02:24.845
You go from 120 to 60.

00:02:26.258 --> 00:02:28.254
Now, let's think about
something interesting.

00:02:28.254 --> 00:02:29.856
Let's think about what happens

00:02:29.856 --> 00:02:32.773
if we double two of the dimensions.

00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:35.158
So, let's say.

00:02:36.343 --> 00:02:39.686
So, we know, I'll just
draw these really fast,

00:02:39.686 --> 00:02:43.103
we know that if we have a situation where

00:02:45.675 --> 00:02:49.883
we have two by three
and this height is five,

00:02:49.883 --> 00:02:54.469
we know the volume here
is 30, 30 cubic units.

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.317
But now, let's double
two of the dimensions.

00:02:56.317 --> 00:02:59.444
Let's make this into a 10 and
let's make this into a four.

00:02:59.444 --> 00:03:02.131
This is gonna look like this.

00:03:02.131 --> 00:03:04.024
This is going to be a four.

00:03:04.024 --> 00:03:07.168
This is still going to be a three.

00:03:07.168 --> 00:03:09.580
And our height is going to be a 10.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.427
So, it's gonna look something like this.

00:03:12.427 --> 00:03:15.221
So, our height is going to be a 10.

00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:17.390
I haven't drawn it perfectly to scale.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.611
Hopefully, you get the idea.

00:03:19.611 --> 00:03:22.028
So, this is our height at 10.

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:24.859
What is the volume gonna be now?

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.410
Pause this video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.243
Well, four times three

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:33.082
is 12 times 10 is 120.

00:03:35.642 --> 00:03:39.547
So notice, when we doubled
two of the dimensions,

00:03:39.547 --> 00:03:42.035
we actually quadrupled,

00:03:42.035 --> 00:03:44.589
we actually quadrupled our total volume.

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:48.626
Pause this video and think
about why did that happen.

00:03:48.626 --> 00:03:50.319
Well, if you double one dimension,

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.816
you double the volume.

00:03:51.816 --> 00:03:53.807
But here, we're doubling one dimension

00:03:53.807 --> 00:03:55.209
and then another dimension,

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.608
so you're multiplying by two twice.

00:03:58.608 --> 00:04:00.019
So, think about what would happen

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.472
if we doubled all of the dimensions.

00:04:02.472 --> 00:04:04.485
How much would that increase the volume?

00:04:04.485 --> 00:04:06.358
Pause the video and see if
you can do that on your own.

00:04:06.358 --> 00:04:09.698
In general, if you double
all of the dimensions,

00:04:09.698 --> 00:04:11.015
what does that do to the volume?

00:04:11.015 --> 00:04:13.027
Or if you halve all of the dimensions,

00:04:13.027 --> 00:04:15.694
what does that do to the volume?
