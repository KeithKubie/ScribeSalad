&gt;&gt;Hello YouTube and all internet. The question
that is being asked is at the same time very

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.340
simple and very complex. What can we do to
make the world a better place? Of course this

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:28.929
list is huge. We have issues of poverty, issues
of distribution,issues of growth, shortages

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:35.360
in various commodities and resources. So there's
no one single thing that you can do to make

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.430
the world a better place. There's a whole
collection of things. And in my mind the most

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:49.920
important ingredient for all the measures
that are available out there to improve the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.780
world. The most important ingredient is cooperation.
We need to keep talking to each other. We

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.470
need to coordinate our policies,we need to
coordinate our actions, we need to coordinate

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:19.110
our countries. As long as you systematic concertation
process around decision makers,around groups

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.890
of countries and around institution in the
civil society,can we achieve the amount of

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.680
convergence necessary for our policies to
work all in the same direction. Thank you

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.299
very much.
