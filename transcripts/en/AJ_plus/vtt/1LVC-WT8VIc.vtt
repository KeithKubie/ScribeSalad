00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.259
We're going to run campaigns, be field directors.

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:16.499
We're going to be affiliated with the arts.

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:18.370
We're going to seek public office.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.009
We're going to be journalists.

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:13.610
wanted us to be.

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:12.220
No longer are we just going to be doctors,
lawyers and engineers as our parents always

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:09.560
service.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:08.569
And as we mature, you'll see us kind of spread
throughout various fields, including public

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.479
We're a fairly young population in America.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.759
But it's also, no in truth, we are coming
and we are going to be engaged like any other

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:59.810
American, and you're going to respect our
voice like you respect anybody else's.

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:50.249
And the hashtag that I used was #TheMuslimsAreComing.

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:51.590
And that's in jest, right?

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:47.289
So I recently hosted the Michigan Muslim Capitol
Day in Lansing.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.819
That's why I want them to take the lead.

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:40.080
When it comes to our generation, we're afraid
to say what's on our mind, but they're not.

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:31.159
Our community is people that are in their
30s, in their 20s.

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:35.249
But a lot of our parents' generation now,
they trust us to lead.

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:28.099
Our community is no longer just one voice.

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:25.569
I've literally lived in this house on Miller
since I was born.

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:22.629
I was born and raised here.

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:21.629
I'm just as American as anyone else.

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:20.449
Although I'm Muslim, I'm American.

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:16.689
doing.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.689
people with President Donald Trump as their
president, [to] see themselves in what I'm

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.360
people, young people, who are worried about
this moment, who have to grow up as young

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:07.360
I like to think that in doing this, I have
the opportunity to show a number of other

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.530
And I pray a certain way, and I'm fully comfortable
in being that guy.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.550
I have had a beard since I was 19.

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:51.900
And, so, I am Abdul.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.229
And that's the only person I can govern as.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.680
I'm not interested in governing as anybody
else but me.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.280
being Athiest, being whatever they [are],
LGBTQ, whatever it is — I don’t ever want

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.120
Have you ever thought about changing your
name?

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.380
anybody to feel like they have to hide it.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.730
I don’t want anybody, whatever their faith,
being Jewish, being Muslim, being Catholic,

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.140
I’m embracing being a Detroiter.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.070
I’m embracing being Arab-American.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.990
I’m embracing being Muslimah.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.990
I’m embracing being Palestinian.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.990
They're seeing me.

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:24.990
The candidates we spoke to aren't shying away
from being Muslim-American.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.969
I think it’s about time you give us a chance.”

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.690
I think it’s time for us come and fix the
gun crisis, fix the education system.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:18.690
You had your chance.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.250
Clear out the room.

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:12.250
We’re waiting for that time where it’s
like, “You know what boys?

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:09.659
So, I think with women, we’re much more
analytical.

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:06.009
And look what we got.

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:05.009
You know?

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.009
gonna run for president.”

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.910
You know, we tend to wait when we’re needed,
where men kind of get up and say, “I’m

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.010
You know, women tend to be reactionary.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.010
engaged.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.010
also a lot more Muslim-American women, who
are not just running, but who are politically

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.340
You know, we've heard there's a lot more Muslim-Americans
running, but it really feels like there's

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:47.979
office.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.979
She was a state representative in Michigan
for six years and now she's running for national

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.780
One of those women is Tlaib.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.620
community.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.020
of amazing powerful Muslim women who have
spearheaded a lot of the changes within our

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.280
We keep saying Muslim-Americans, but I think
it's also very important to note the amount

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.729
What would you say is the reason why there's
Muslim-Americans running?

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:23.789
The high school we went to was literally named,
well, not named, like far-right extremists

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.400
used to call it “Hezbollah High.”

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.569
When 9/11 happened, that was kind of like
a wake-up call for all of us.

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.239
So that's what triggered a lot of us to step
up in that way.

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:08.709
The election of Trump for a lot of us was
a reminder of that.

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.769
And that was nowhere that we ever wanted to
be again.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.839
Obviously, a lot of our rights were taken
away as a community.

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:03.010
None of us ever felt insecure in this nation,
or in this country as a community, until 9/11.

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.109
Zainab, was [his] campaign manager, so she
basically ran the helm.

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.049
Ghida, who's run a lot of campaigns.

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.049
But Abdullah Hammoud is the one we're most
proud of.

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.829
Are you all in politics like inherently, or
how does it work?

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.269
We usually get together [and] talk politics.

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.329
After Iftar no one has anything to do.

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.829
During Ramadan, it's when all our schedules
collide.

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.269
Why do you guys meet?

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.260
Why are we here?

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.040
about politics [and] have some tea.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.840
We're at Hussein Dabajeh's house, and some
young Muslim-Americans are gathering to talk

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.700
Right now we're in Dearborn.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.780
other regardless of any religion, identity,
ethnicity or the color of their skin.

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:16.669
I'll take you to Alter Road, where our mosque
neighbors our churches.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.180
I'll take you to our middle and elementary
schools, where our youth play amongst each

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:13.339
I invite any and everyone that would like
to, to come down to the city of Dearborn and

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:09.419
And that all you have to do is reach out to
ask questions.

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:06.059
To anybody that shares those sentiments, I'd
say that willful ignorance is radical.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:56.659
right now, and that's largely because many
of us have stood out of the arena.

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.589
What would your message be to people who share
Patrick's kind of sentiments?

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.090
I think division is the tool of small people,
and there are a lot of small people in leadership

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.579
targeted their sights on me.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.219
I knew that when I jumped into this, there
were going to be a lot of hateful people who

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.540
el-Sayed was part of a Muslim plot to start
a civilization jihad.

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:32.609
In April, a video by a Republican candidate
for governor, Patrick Colbeck, surfaced, claiming

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:25.379
And incidents targeting mosques increased
10-fold from 2009 to 2016.

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.859
Hate crimes against Muslims have spiked in
the last two years.

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.599
And that’s why it’s important that I'm
out here door-knocking because that direct

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.749
human contact is important.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.829
The faith alone, Islam, is so misunderstood
by so many.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.759
Michigan House had never ever worked with
a Muslimah or American-Muslim.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.740
But I also see such opportunity, because 109
of my colleagues on the House floor of the

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.960
So, you’re going to get that backlash.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.159
Write that name down because we don’t want
to send Rashida to Lansing to bomb it.”

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
“Vote for Santa Claus.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
You know?

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.000
I also got, “Oh, don’t vote for Rashida”
at a polling location.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.729
you're fighting just for today.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.540
That this, you know, utopia where everyone
is treated equally, is a distance away, but

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.580
That you're not there yet.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.470
You just have to tell yourself that the work
must continue.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.260
How does this make you feel?

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.460
and slammed the door back in my face.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.660
running for state representative,” he said,
“I'm disgusted that you're my neighbor,”

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.930
My own neighbor, I recall, when I knocked
his door and said, “Abdullah Hammoud, I'm

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.320
But being a Muslim in politics comes with
its challenges.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.220
state.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.220
I’m not running to be the first Muslim anything,
I'm running to be a great governor for my

00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:16.270
the responsibility to be engaged and to raise
voices matters a lot.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.051
And I think for the Muslim-American community
in particular, there is so much to lose that

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.270
I was really frustrated with governance at
both the local level and the state level.

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.969
Yeah, I mean, it was sorta the icing on the
cake for me.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.739
Did Trump having anything to do with you wanting
to run?

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.070
Michigan is also a swing state that some blame
for putting Donald Trump in the White House.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.300
Many of them are here in Michigan.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.010
At least 90 Muslim-American candidates are
running for office nationwide.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.320
House — more Muslim-Americans are running
for office than ever before.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.200
Despite a surge in hate crimes and all the
anti-Muslim rhetoric coming from the White

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.100
You're removable, I'm not.”

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.120
are my rights.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.869
But at the same time, on the flip end, that's
also empowered folks to say, “No, these

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.910
who's there that doesn't really see me as
an equal American?”

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.750
Folks are saying, “Are my rights protected
in the same way now that we have a president

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.460
It's unfortunate that Trump is in office,
but he might have been a catalyst to create

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.460
this awakening.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.030
And that was when I realized I can’t be
outside of the ring anymore.

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:08.109
And my heart sank.

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:25.830
And as we, you know, kind of mature within
the American culture, I think we'll just continue

00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.740
My son walks in the room and says, “Mama,
don’t worry.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.559
If anybody asks me, I will lie and tell them
I’m not Muslim."

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:26.330
to rise.
