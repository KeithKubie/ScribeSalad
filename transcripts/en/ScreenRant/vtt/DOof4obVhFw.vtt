10 Movies That Made Fans Choose Sides

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.630
In the world of Hollywood it’s all about
the drama.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.360
And perhaps the greatest compliment a filmmaker
can receive is the knowledge that fans are

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.650
going to leave the theatre talking about their
movie.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.200
But what happens when the discussions start
to heat up?

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.440
Over the past few years, audiences have watched
all sorts of conflict play out on screen.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.260
Wether it’s born out of genuine conversation,
or the flames being fanned by marketing people,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.920
sometimes picking a side is half the fun of
watching a movie.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.180
And viewers don’t have to go very far to
find others’ opinions either.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.620
Sometimes a quick scroll through the comments
section is all it takes to start a war.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.640
These are 10 Movies That Made Fans Choose
Sides.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.850
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice
Three Oscar-winners have played big-screen

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.110
Batman at this point, and every new casting
decision comes with its own round of outrage.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.940
Nobody can seem to get it quite right.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.989
So when it was revealed that Ben Affleck would
be dawning the cape and cowl in Zack Snyder’s

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.059
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, the internet
exploded, and battle lines were drawn.

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.750
But Afflecks casting was only the first of
many hot debates surrounding the film.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.500
Right down to the poster, everything about
the movie is designed to have audiences picking

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.159
a side in the fight between Batman and Superman.

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.969
After opening to VERY mixed reviews, it seems
the actors are divided themselves- with Jeremy

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:20.469
Irons recently speaking out in favor of the
film’s bad reviews while other cast members

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:21.679
remain mum.

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:25.780
Chances are, you have an opinion about some
element of this movie… even if you haven’t

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.380
seen it.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.829
Inception
We’ve all heard the saying “perception

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:30.829
is reality.”

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.380
And in 2010, director Christopher Nolan gave
audiences yet another controversial ending

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.899
to argue about.

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.439
Viewers watch with anticipation as Cobb (Leonardo
DiCaprio) spins a top.

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.850
By paying attention to how the top behaves,
the audience can keep track of where the characters

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.020
are: in a dream, or in reality.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.439
And after seemingly faltering, the movie fades
to black.

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.180
Fans have bantered amongst themselves about
what it all means.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.520
Was the whole thing a dream?

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.939
Did Cobb wake up?

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.039
The director has acknowledged the endings
ambiguousness, but maintains that that’s

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:02.039
what makes it powerful.

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.029
And has encouraged fans to pay less attention
to the top, and more attention to the fact

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:08.750
that Cobb doesn’t care if it falls over
or not.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.150
If his surroundings feel real then, to him,
they are real.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.350
The Twilight Saga: New Moon
In the mid-to-late 2000’s, the decades-long

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.420
war between vampires and werewolves came to
a head.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.430
And all of us were casualties.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.830
The conflict affected millions of teens worldwide
as they chose one of two teams: Team Edward,

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:27.830
or Team Jacob.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.860
Thanks to a clever marketing team, Twi-hards
were able to pledge their allegiance with

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.880
t-shirts, body pillows, and other crazy merchandise.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.850
The love triangle between Bella and her two
mythical beast boyfriends is the main theme

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.510
in the franchises second installment, New
Moon.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.120
After being ditched by Edward (Robert Pattinson),
Bella (Kristen Stewart) finds happiness in

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.570
her friendship with the charming, wolf-next-door
type Jacob (Taylor Lautner).

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.820
Some fans saw this as disloyal, and the rift
was born.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.960
Wether you believe it’s a testament to the
power of advertising, or a legitimate stance

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.540
worth defending in bumper-sticker form, the
Team Edward/Team Jacob drama really boils

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.540
down to this: abs versus eyes.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.750
The Hunger Games
A boom in the success of books aimed at young

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.380
adults led to a lot of big-screen adaptations.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.240
And one of the most successful franchises
to come out of this era is The Hunger Games.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.250
The story follows Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer
Lawrence) a young tribute representing her

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.220
district in a competition that usually ends
in death.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.930
Over the course of Katniss’ adventure, we
meet her lifelong friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth)

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.240
and fellow-tribute Peeta (Josh Hutcherson),
and watch her flip-flop between being in love

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.320
with both of them.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.900
Fans of the books and movies alike have strong
opinions on which one of them deserves to

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.010
be the Mockingjay’s bae.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.010
If you’re still unsure whose side you’re
on, there are more than a few online quizzes

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.640
that can help you figure it out.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.810
Man of Steel
Superman is known for many things, but chief

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.760
among them is his moralistic approach to fighting
crime.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.819
In 2013’s Man of Steel, director Zack Snyder
and writer David S. Goyer tackled the legendary

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.319
characters origin story.

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.210
And the response was mixed.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.040
The film was criticized for being all style
and no substance, and all too reliant on its

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.310
action scenes.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.560
But many fans of the character took issue
with something else entirely- the ending.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.880
Instead of sending him back to the Phantom
Zone, Superman (Henry Cavill) kills General

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.370
Zod (Michael Shannon), leading some fans to
cry foul.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.650
The hero’s history of taking the high road
in all situations was completely overturned.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.540
Even though, as one Screen Ranter pointed
out Superman made the same decision all the

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.810
way back in 1980’s Superman II.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.120
Iron Man 3
For many fans, seeing how an actor interprets

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.370
a character is a nerve-wracking event.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.741
So when The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) finally
showed up in 2013’s Iron Man 3, audiences

00:04:31.741 --> 00:04:33.180
braced for impact.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.650
Sir Ben Kingsley is a veteran actor who’s
used to the pressure of playing well-known

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.560
characters, but he probably wasn’t ready
for the backlash his performance would cause.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.240
Some believed that director Shane Black’s
reimagining of the character as merely an

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.990
oddball pawn was an insult to the character.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.460
Fans might have been willing to overlook some
of the inconsistencies so long as they could

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.430
see The Mandarin’s ten rings of power in
action.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.060
But those were changed too, from rings into
a network of terrorists.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.770
Talk about a bait-and-switch.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.810
Both the actor and director stand by the adaptation
, but they might be the only ones.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.580
Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope
Since it was began in 1977, the Star Wars

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.550
franchise has produced some of the most iconic
moments in popular culture.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.830
Legions of fans, young and old, can quote
every installment word-for-word.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.509
Even the bad ones (Phantom Menace!).

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:23.509
And in a group with that kind of passion,
canon is king.

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.110
So when George Lucas went messin' around with
the editing of the Cantina scene in A New

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.710
Hope, people noticed.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.960
Some re-releases feature an alternate sequence
of events in the showdown between Han Solo

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.960
(Harrison Ford) and Greedo.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.379
Many argue that with each edit, the director
put Solo’s character development in jeopardy.

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:42.539
The fan reaction was so pronounced that it
catapulted another phrase into infamy: Han

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:44.750
shot first.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.099
Star Wars: Episode VI- Return of the Jedi
It’s safe to say that more than a few people

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:52.529
were looking forward to George Lucas’ second
chapter.

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:56.470
And fans couldn’t wait to take another trip
to the galaxy far, far away.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.349
Audiences were able to lose themselves in
the elaborate settings while being amazed

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:02.740
by the creative alien races being depicted
onscreen.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.539
But when the story took viewers to the forest
moon of Endor, things got a little heated.

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:12.059
Some pundits argued that the Ewoks added nothing
to the storyline, and instead acted as a marketing

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:13.779
tool to sell toys.

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:17.180
Others just found their appearance distracting-
maintaining that there’s no way something

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.029
that cute could also be deadly.

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:23.529
Wether you love or hate them, the furry little
fighters throw one heck of a BBQ.

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:26.789
Casino Royale
Audiences have come to expect that the role

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:29.620
of James Bond is going to be re-cast every
couple of movies.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.719
Yet, when it happens, someone always gets
offended.

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:37.699
From Connery to Brosnan, casting for the iconic
role has always generated lots of attention.

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:41.139
When it was announced that Daniel Craig would
be the next Bond, some opponents were quick

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:45.449
to remind everyone that it’s James BOND
not James BLONDE.

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:49.889
Beyond hair color, audiences were expecting
a certain degree of goofiness from 007, and

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:54.210
some Bond buffs took issue with Craig’s
drier, darker take on the character.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.300
But it seems that no one wants it to be over
faster than Craig himself, who threw the entire

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.400
junket for Spectre (2015) to the wolves, and
declared his resentment at having to reprise

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.210
his role as the super spy.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.199
One thing is for certain, whoever comes next
has a big tuxedo to fill.

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:11.889
Captain America: Civil War
It seems like a fair fight is hard to find

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:12.889
these days.

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:16.960
And while many people enjoy comic book movies,
others can’t get past the blatant lack of

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.969
superhero accountability.

00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:22.009
Leveling entire cities and suffering no repercussions.

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:27.289
Thankfully, Captain America and Iron Man are
here to buck both of those big screen trends.

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:30.180
In many ways, Civil War is a discussion about
accountability.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.490
Told from both angles of an ideological rift,
each team is worth rooting for.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.270
But everyone has a favorite Avenger so, naturally,
fans are choosing sides.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:42.020
The drama extends beyond the storyline, as
some audience members have noticed more than

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.589
a few parallel themes running between Civil
War and Batman v Superman.

00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:50.800
And if the discussion dissolves into the tired
“Marvel versus DC” debate, the internet

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.840
is bound to have its own civil war in the
comments section.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.680
Sometimes the most interesting arguments are
the ones where everyone’s right.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.419
What do you think of our list?

00:07:58.419 --> 00:08:00.569
