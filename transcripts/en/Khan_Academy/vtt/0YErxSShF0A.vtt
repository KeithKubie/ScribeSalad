00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:01.880
Solve for z.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:07.280
5z plus 7 is less
than 27 or negative 3z

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.710
is less than or equal to 18.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.200
So this is a
compound inequality.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.340
We have two conditions here.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.350
So z can satisfy this or z
can satisfy this over here.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.600
So let's just solve each
of these inequalities.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.610
And just know that z can
satisfy either of them.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.242
So let's just look at this.

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:27.950
So if we look at just
this one over here,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.890
we have 5z plus 7
is less than 27.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.680
Let's isolate the z's
on the left-hand side.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.520
So let's subtract 7 from both
sides to get rid of this 7

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.920
on the left-hand side.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.680
And so our left-hand side
is just going to be 5z.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.550
Plus 7, minus 7--
those cancel out.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.740
5z is less than
27 minus 7, is 20.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.300
So we have 5z is less than 20.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.221
Now we can divide both sides
of this inequality by 5.

00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:01.470
And we don't have to swap
the inequality because we're

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.470
dividing by a positive number.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.180
And so we get z
is less than 20/5.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.742
z is less than 4.

00:01:10.742 --> 00:01:12.450
Now, this was only
one of the conditions.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.580
Let's [? look at ?] the
other one over here.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.230
We have negative 3z is
less than or equal to 18.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.020
Now, to isolate the
z, we could just

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.730
divide both sides of this
inequality by negative 3.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.540
But remember, when
you divide or multiply

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.660
both sides of an inequality
by a negative number,

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.900
you have to swap the inequality.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.610
So we could write negative 3z.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.870
We're going to divide
it by negative 3.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:38.745
And then you have 18.

00:01:38.745 --> 00:01:40.800
We're going to divide
it by negative 3.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.000
But we're going to
swap the inequality.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.750
So the less than or equal
will become greater than

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.730
or equal to.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.440
And so these guys cancel out.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.630
Negative 3 divided
by negative 3 is 1.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.370
So we have z is greater than
or equal to 18 over negative 3

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.020
is negative 6.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.530
And remember, it's this
constraint or this constraint.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.220
And this constraint right
over here boils down to this.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.340
And this one boils down to this.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.020
So our solution set--
z is less than 4

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.210
or z is greater than
or equal to negative 6.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.350
So let me make this clear.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.110
Let me rewrite it.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.410
So z could be less than
4 or z is greater than

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.360
or equal to negative 6.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.220
It can satisfy
either one of these.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.240
And this is kind of
interesting here.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.525
Let's plot these.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.500
So there's a number
line right over there.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.480
Let's say that 0 is over here.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.690
We have 1, 2, 3, 4
is right over there.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.680
And then negative 6.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.440
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.500
That's negative 6 over there.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.260
Now, let's think about
z being less than 4.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.760
We would put a circle around
4, since we're not including 4.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.615
And it'd be everything
less than 4.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.430
Now let's think
about what z being

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.800
greater than or equal to
negative 6 would mean.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.960
That means you can
include negative 6.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.570
And it's everything-- let me
do that in different color.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.895
It means you can
include negative 6.

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:18.177
I want to do that--
oh, here we go.

00:03:18.177 --> 00:03:19.510
It means you include negative 6.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.440
Let me do it in a
more different color.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.660
Do it in orange.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.930
So z is greater than
equal to negative 6.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.440
Means you can
include negative 6.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.260
And it's everything greater
than that, including 4.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.180
So it's everything
greater than that.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.640
So what we see is
we've essentially

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.450
shaded in the
entire number line.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.130
Every number will meet either
one of these constraints

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.036
or both of them.

00:03:43.036 --> 00:03:44.660
If we're over here,
we're going to meet

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.696
both of the constraints.

00:03:46.696 --> 00:03:48.070
If we're a number
out here, we're

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.180
going to meet this constraint.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.710
If we're a number
down here, we're

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:51.800
going to meet this constraint.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.050
And you could just try it
out with a bunch of numbers.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.060
0 will work.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.440
0 plus 7 is 7, which
is less than 27.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.920
And 3 times 0 is less than 18,
so it meets both constraints.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.100
If we put 4 here, it should only
meet one of the constraints.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.756
Negative 3 times 4 is negative
12, which is less than 18.

00:04:09.756 --> 00:04:12.380
So it meets this constraint, but
it won't meet this constraint.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.250
Because you do 5
times 4 plus 7 is

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.540
27, which is not less than 27.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.740
It's equal to 27.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.089
Remember, this is an or.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:22.200
So you just have to meet
one of the constraints.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.020
So 4 meets this constraint.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.330
So even 4 works.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.270
So it's really the
entire number line

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.100
will satisfy either one or
both of these constraints.
