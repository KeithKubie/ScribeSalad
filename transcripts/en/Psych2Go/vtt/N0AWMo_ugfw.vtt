00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.190
Oh

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.410
It's obvious that men and women are wired differently.

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:22.368
We tend to generally just do things differently than the opposite sex: we use the bathroom differently, eat differently

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.489
express our emotions differently, and so on.

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.309
Therefore, it's quite obvious that women also fall in love differently than men.

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.930
But in what ways?

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.680
How do these unique differences set them apart and how does it change the course of a relationship?

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.369
Here are five ways that women fall in love:

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.739
Number one: she needs to get to know you as a person.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.750
Sure you guys may have had a few classes together, and maybe even gone on a few dates, but does she really know you?

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.839
How many deep, heartfelt

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.510
conversations have you two had?

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.800
Have you discussed that one time in the fourth grade when you got your head stuck in a fence?

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.489
Not yet? Well, it'll come up, and it will definitely be essential for this relationship

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.210
to prosper.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.550
See, women have a greater need to build memories with someone first

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.890
before falling in love with them, including sharing secrets and stories with one another.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.690
Men, on the other hand, need the initial attraction first,

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.080
whereas women can learn to fall in love over time by getting to know someone on a deeper level.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.220
Sometimes, these types of relationships tend to last longer and be stronger,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.240
since once the initial physical attraction becomes numb, there's nothing left for you too.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.300
Looks can only go so far, because we're all bound to grow old and our bodies are forever changing.

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:58.259
In the end,

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.859
personalities that click are the true driving force for anything real and long-lasting.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.479
Number two: she needs to know what you think.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.529
With estrogen known as the female sex hormone,

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.979
it's coincidentally also linked to memories, learning abstract concepts and webbed thinking.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.869
It's all about stimulating the brain, since these are so important to her and traits she already acquires.

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.139
Subconsciously, she wants to know that men are capable of logic and deep thoughts

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.099
It's an...

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:42.529
instinctive habit with wanting to know if your potential mate is going to be able to care for you and protect you.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.089
While it's fun to go on dates and do fun activities together,

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.069
the most attractive quality is someone's unique way of thinking.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.910
"Do we have similar views politically?" "Socially?"

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:03.649
"Religiously?" "Do we have similar perspectives on life?" "Is he more logical oriented or

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.299
artistically inclined?" "Does this way of thinking challenge my views and ideals?" "Do we play devil's advocate

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
successfully from one another?"

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.569
Intelligence is important; and though you don't need a man who is a certified genius who has the answer to all the questions,

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.439
she does need to know that he's smart enough to help her in her time of need and also fend for himself.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.769
She needs to know that she can be with someone who is willing to explore life's philosophies with her.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.910
Number three:

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.809
She needs to know that you're a good conversationalist

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:48.420
No matter what you decide to discuss, you both need to enjoy talking to one another, you need to be able to have interesting

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.030
conversations that don't feel forced or dragged on about things the other doesn't care about. Obviously,

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.610
this is completely subjective,

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.749
because different people have different ideas or what a good conversation entails.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.030
Some people like talking about everyday matters: like the weather and what happened at work that day,

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.280
while others like debating for fun, and others like to discuss the what if some

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:18.750
potential future outcomes of the world. Through the best conversations, you bond closer with someone and become more intimate with them.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.989
Although good verbal skills are important when getting to know someone,

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.320
silence is just as important. You should be able to have comfortable silence with another person.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.079
Someone should not have to always be talking.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.180
It's nice to have people who not only engage in good banter and debates,

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.039
but also who can use words to teach things without coming off as being conceited.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.539
Number four: she needs to know that you're reliable.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.859
Since women are biologically programmed to be child bears,

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.249
they have a subconscious need to know that every mate is capable of potentially caring for a child with her.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.579
Since getting pregnant is very possible for most women,

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.140
it's a major concern that her mate will be worthy of fathering her potential child.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.979
Bearing a child will affect their lives in a huge way.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.349
Therefore, women are more selective with who they choose a partner for survival purposes.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.109
They need to be sure that the person

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:22.320
they're with is reliable, and can provide for the family, if the situation calls for it in the future.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.240
And... Number five:

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.600
She needs to know that she can be herself in front of you.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:36.839
This does indeed pertain to both sexes, but it's especially important for women when trying to determine whether or not they're falling in love.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.249
Vulnerability is important when having general feelings for someone.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.940
She needs to know that she can be her full true self around him, even in her most embarrassing and private moments.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:54.780
A lot of women tend to build walls up, and the men in their lives need to prove that they're going to be

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.690
there for them always, in order for them to open up.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:05.220
Women are truly unique creatures, and earning their love takes time and patience, but it's well worth the wait.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.379
And those are the five ways that women fall in love do you agree with this list?
