00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.928
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.951
SCOTT MAXWELL: So Emily,
this is your first book.

00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:14.950
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: It is.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:15.610
SCOTT MAXWELL: You
didn't want to start

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.229
with something simpler?

00:00:17.229 --> 00:00:18.520
A brief history of time, maybe?

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.000
I mean, I know that's been done.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.040
But, as you write
in the book, this

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.929
is the most complicated
robot ever sent

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:27.970
to another planet-- in
fact, ever sent off Earth.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.310
Why did you want to
write about this,

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.870
and why do you say that
it's the most complicated?

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:33.580
EMILY LAKDAWALLA:
Well, I think it's

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.350
fair to admit that
I didn't realize

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.440
what I was getting into when
I started writing this book.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.640
In fact, as I explain
in the introduction,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.470
it's not actually the book that
I meant to write to begin with.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.480
I was approached by
Springer to write a book

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.160
about the Curiosity mission.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.620
And I wrote, and I
wrote, and I wrote.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.220
And I wasn't finishing,
and I wound up

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.350
with a tremendous
quantity of material

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.700
and wasn't able to wrap it up.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.110
And I finally figured
out that the reason

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.568
I was having so much trouble
was because I had accidentally

00:01:01.568 --> 00:01:02.590
written two books.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.810
And so this is
actually just the first

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.687
of a pair of books on Curiosity.

00:01:06.687 --> 00:01:08.770
The second one is going
to be coming out next year

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.353
and will be about
the science mission.

00:01:10.353 --> 00:01:13.270
So I kind of was able to
partition the engineering

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.840
stuff into one book and the
science to another book.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.330
And basically, this is the
book that I needed in order

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.430
to be able to understand
the Rover well enough

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.470
to be able to write about
its science mission.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.159
And so now I'm writing
about the science.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.700
I've got a copy on
my desk and I keep

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.970
on referring to it all the time.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.220
How many of this
thing does it have?

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.053
And how long did it,
and when did this fail?

00:01:32.053 --> 00:01:34.506
And it's all in there.

00:01:34.506 --> 00:01:36.130
SCOTT MAXWELL: So
tell us a little more

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.960
about why it is the
most-- what makes it

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.740
the most complicated robot
we've ever sent off this planet?

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.750
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: It's
sort of the culmination

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.510
of a long history of
NASA's exploration of Mars.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.890
And I think that the
key to its complexity

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.420
is that NASA builds from
one mission to the next.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.680
You begin with a very basic,
broad set of questions.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.550
What is Mars?

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.932
And you map it, and you
find out some more things

00:02:00.932 --> 00:02:01.640
about what it is.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.348
And then you ask more
detailed questions.

00:02:03.348 --> 00:02:04.900
Was water ever
important on Mars?

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.510
And Spirit and Opportunity
were sent with this mantra,

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.380
"follow the water."

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.790
Try to understand how water
was active on Mars in the past.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.590
Curiosity's questions are
more subtle than that.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.300
We know that there
was water on Mars,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.960
but did they ever have
a habitable environment

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.460
that microorganisms might
have been able to live in?

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.527
And so as the
questions get subtler,

00:02:24.527 --> 00:02:26.110
the investigations
that you have to do

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.820
to try to answer those
questions get more detailed,

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.254
more complicated.

00:02:30.254 --> 00:02:32.170
It's not enough just to
snap pictures anymore.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.690
You have to have much more
detailed kinds of data.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.050
Curiosity has these two highly
sophisticated laboratory

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.290
instruments that are designed
to ingest solid samples

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.400
and perform x-ray diffraction
and x-ray fluorescence.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.050
It performs gas chromatograph
mass spectrometry

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.074
with a tunable
laser spectrometer

00:02:50.074 --> 00:02:51.490
and a quadruple
mass spectrometer.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.620
It's got all of these
laboratory instruments

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.170
that have been miniaturized
to fit inside the Rover.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.020
And so just supporting
that hardware

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.570
requires a host
of subsystems that

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.450
are necessary to
keep the thing alive.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.450
You also have to have a mission
that lasts a lot longer.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.460
The warranty on
Spirit and Opportunity

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.822
is famously only 90 days.

00:03:10.822 --> 00:03:12.280
And of course,
Opportunity is still

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.610
going after 5,000
and something sols.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.825
Do you know off the top
of your head how many?

00:03:16.825 --> 00:03:18.700
SCOTT MAXWELL: Let me
check my Mars time app.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.375
Why, it's 5,107
sols today, Emily.

00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:22.000
EMILY LAKDAWALLA:
All right, very good.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.800
So yeah, Curiosity has not
lasted nearly so long yet.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.300
And in fact, it's quite
likely that Curiosity will not

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.920
last as many sols
as Opportunity does.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.010
It's almost certain.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.220
But anyway, the point is
that Opportunity was only

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.304
warranted to last 90 days.

00:03:40.304 --> 00:03:42.720
It was supposed to be able to
accomplish its prime mission

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.870
in that amount of time.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.780
Curiosity's warranty ran
out after a first year.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.694
And so you have to
build much more robust--

00:03:48.694 --> 00:03:50.110
SCOTT MAXWELL:
First Martian year.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.770
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: --systems.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.686
First Martian-- yeah,
first Martian year, yes.

00:03:52.686 --> 00:03:54.480
That's correct.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.230
You have to build much
more robust systems

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.710
to be able to
support all of that.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.920
And so that also made it
more complex because you

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.680
have a lot of redundancy
and other things built in

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.414
to make it just last so long.

00:04:04.414 --> 00:04:07.080
SCOTT MAXWELL: And famously, one
of those two labs that you were

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.160
talking about, the
Sample Analysis at Mars,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
or SAM instrument, I think
was Rick Welch who pointed out

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.490
that that instrument alone is
larger than the entire chassis

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.810
of the Mars exploration Rovers.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:17.620
EMILY LAKDAWALLA:
That's right, yeah.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.161
And it's big.

00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:19.929
It's heavier than the
Sojourner Rover was.

00:04:19.929 --> 00:04:21.470
I mean, it's the
size of a microwave,

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.010
which, in Earth terms, for
a laboratory instrument,

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.600
it's amazingly miniature.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.060
But in terms of what
a mobile Rover has

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.790
to support on the surface of
another planet, it's enormous.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.140
It has high power demands.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.450
It has exacting
temperature requirements.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.150
And it's just a very
complicated piece of machinery.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.660
SCOTT MAXWELL: I
think that might

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.400
be the size of the entire first
Rover that we sent, Sojourner.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.250
It's like SAM is the
size of Sojourner,

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.210
bigger than the chassis of
the Mars exploration Rovers.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.250
So you did an enormous
amount of research.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.510
It shows, and it pays off
really well in this book.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.343
This, by the way, is
the first technically--

00:04:53.343 --> 00:04:55.450
I've read a lot of
technically-oriented books

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.908
in my life, and this is the
first technically-oriented book

00:04:57.908 --> 00:05:00.430
that I've read that uses
terms like "stubborn gunk."

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.817
I think it does a very
good job of making

00:05:02.817 --> 00:05:05.275
these very complicated things
accessible to a lay audience.

00:05:07.477 --> 00:05:09.810
And that's kind of an outgrowth
of the work that you do.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.799
You are the Senior Editor
and Planetary Evangelist

00:05:12.799 --> 00:05:13.840
at the Planetary Society.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.750
Do you see this as kind of
an outgrowth of that work?

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.124
EMILY LAKDAWALLA:
Oh, absolutely.

00:05:17.124 --> 00:05:20.370
So I see what I do at
the Planetary Society

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.325
as kind of a
translation function.

00:05:22.325 --> 00:05:23.700
There are so many
exciting things

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.616
happening in science and
engineering and space

00:05:25.616 --> 00:05:27.460
exploration right now.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.750
And while I was a grad student
exploring these things,

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.520
I thought, this
stuff is really cool,

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.649
but nobody learns about it.

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:35.940
And one of the main reasons
that nobody learns about it

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.970
is that the ways that scientists
and engineers communicate

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.490
with each other are really,
frankly, kind of horrible.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.620
Science papers are just bad.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.680
They're boringly written.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.054
They're difficult to understand.

00:05:49.054 --> 00:05:50.970
But when you train as a
scientist or engineer,

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.950
you learn that
language and you become

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.230
capable of reading it
and understanding it.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.110
And you learn to use
a whole new vocabulary

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.107
of terms that have very
specific and precise meanings.

00:06:01.107 --> 00:06:02.940
But when you use that
same language to speak

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.279
to a member of the
public, you are basically

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:07.320
speaking a language that's
foreign to that member

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.903
of the public.

00:06:07.903 --> 00:06:09.180
So you have to translate.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.310
And one of the
phrases that I hate

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.890
the most in public
communication is "dumbing down,"

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:18.870
because you're not
making things stupider.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.300
You are translating
to a language

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.100
that you can use to
communicate with other people.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.580
And so it's perfectly
possible to get

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.324
across complicated concepts.

00:06:29.324 --> 00:06:31.740
You just have to use the words
that people can understand.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.573
So when I need to write
about stubborn gunk,

00:06:33.573 --> 00:06:35.947
I write about stubborn gunk
because that's exactly what

00:06:35.947 --> 00:06:36.780
we're talking about.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.154
We're talking
about material that

00:06:38.154 --> 00:06:40.200
is sticking to the
sides of an instrument

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.990
that you can't get off
even by shaking it.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.910
And that's what
the Phoenix Lander

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.300
was dealing with in the section
that I wrote that about.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.470
And you know, you've all
dealt with that problem

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.390
in your own homes and
lives, I'm quite sure.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.840
And it's just it's better to
write about it in that way.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.160
It's more exciting.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.860
It is just as effective
at communication

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.610
as saying, I don't know,
high viscosity material that

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.040
has adsorbed onto the walls
of the sample collection

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.430
device or something like that.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.140
You could say it that way.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:08.664
But why?

00:07:08.664 --> 00:07:10.830
SCOTT MAXWELL: I wonder if,
instead of dumbing down,

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.159
we could say that this is a
smarting down of the Rover?

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:14.700
EMILY LAKDAWALLA:
Just a translation.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.160
It's a translation
of how everything

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.570
works to make it more
accessible to people

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.630
who are non-native
speakers of science.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.980
SCOTT MAXWELL: And you're
well-positioned to do that,

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.340
having trained as a
scientist yourself.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.570
That's also your background.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:27.960
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: Yeah.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.070
So I'm a planetary
geologist by training.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:34.020
So as an undergrad,
I did field geology.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.580
I got to walk
around on mountains

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.380
and whack things
with rock hammers

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.070
and draw pencil and color
pencil maps and things.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.700
And then, in grad school,
I studied geology on Venus

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.410
using radar images
from the Magellan

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.720
Orbiter, which is
just-- it's such

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.790
an underappreciated mission.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.650
It ended in the early '90s.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:56.250
It mapped all of Venus
in radar wavelengths.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:58.260
And Venus is a
fascinating-looking planet,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.870
and I really wish NASA would get
a mission back there sometime

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:01.370
soon.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.690
But it's hard to
study because of

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:07.950
the insanely high temperatures
and the sulfuric acid clouds.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.530
And the pressure at
the surface is the same

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:12.755
as at a mile beneath
the ocean, so it's

00:08:12.755 --> 00:08:14.880
tough to build hardware
that survives for very long

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.490
on Venus.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:15.690
SCOTT MAXWELL: Yeah.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.064
I wouldn't want
to be the guy who

00:08:17.064 --> 00:08:20.190
has to design the Rover that can
rove around where temperatures

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.127
will melt lead.

00:08:21.127 --> 00:08:21.510
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: Yes.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:22.290
SCOTT MAXWELL: That
doesn't seem like fun.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:23.248
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: Yeah.

00:08:23.248 --> 00:08:25.140
Solder is not going to work.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.230
And the Russians succeeded in
exploring the surface of Venus

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.341
by essentially building--

00:08:30.341 --> 00:08:32.549
I mean, it's an exaggeration,
but they were basically

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:33.690
clockwork spacecraft.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:36.120
I mean, they were
mechanical spacecraft

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.370
because you can build
mechanical components that can

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:39.960
work at very high temperatures.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.030
Electronics, especially
in the 1970s,

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.420
were not ready to operate at
those kinds of conditions.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.430
And the Russians,
being the Russians,

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.680
built these big,
robust spacecraft

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.530
that basically worked with
these mechanical systems

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.720
and were able to
take measurements

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.200
after landing on the surface for
a matter of minutes to an hour

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.730
or so before the
spacecraft failed.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.360
And that's how we know anything
about the surface of Venus.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.490
SCOTT MAXWELL: So
returning our attention

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.280
to Mars, one of the things
I think you do really

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.096
well in this book--

00:09:10.096 --> 00:09:12.720
which I greatly enjoyed reading
and enthusiastically recommend,

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.082
by the way--

00:09:14.082 --> 00:09:16.290
one of things I think you
really do well in this book

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.251
is you don't just translate
all of the technical jargon

00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:21.750
in terms that people
can understand.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.710
But you also recognize--
and this is, again,

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:26.870
part of your work at the
Planetary Society, I think--

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.081
that you can't talk about
this Rover just as a machine.

00:09:30.081 --> 00:09:31.830
It's not just that the
Rover is a machine.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.020
It's that the Rover
carries with it

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.920
a lot of human
hopes and ambitions.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.100
And I think you kind of
communicate that, as well,

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.500
what we're were hoping
and dreaming to explore

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.180
on the surface of Mars.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.200
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: Yeah.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.949
There's a book that
was written, actually,

00:09:44.949 --> 00:09:48.180
by a sociologist named Janet
Vertesi, who has embedded

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:53.730
with several of NASA's
JPLs operations teams

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:54.720
on space missions.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.230
And she studies the sociology
of how teams work when

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.430
they work on these missions.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:00.930
And one of the most
striking things

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.810
that she observed that really
made me sit back and go, huh,

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:09.240
is the pronoun that JPL
engineers and scientists use

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.580
when they refer to the Rover.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.100
Sometimes some
people do say "it."

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.910
It can be traditional to call
ships of exploration "she,"

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:21.360
like ocean-going ships are
often referred to as "she."

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.700
But it's not actually
very common to use

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.290
that pronoun for Curiosity.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.780
The most common pronoun is "we."

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.270
And so think about
that for a minute, what

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.690
it means to be referring
to this machine as "we."

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.320
It means that we are exploring
Mars, we drilled today,

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.570
we are driving across that hill.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:41.900
It's not just one machine.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.820
It's the embodiment of all
of the people participating

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.380
together on this mission.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.930
And it's such a team
thing, especially

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:52.080
because of the way that there
are all these operational roles

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.090
on the mission, and
many different people

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:57.940
who can fill those operational
roles on any given day.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.690
So it feels more like--

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:04.530
I don't know, it feels kind
of like being on a ship

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.960
on the ocean, in a way,
where there is a captain,

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.070
but there's all these other
commanders and everything else.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:13.230
And every person has their part
to contribute to make it going.

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.800
And together, you're on this
great ship of exploration.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.210
And that's what
Curiosity feels like.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:22.290
And so it kind of
feels like there

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:25.590
is a false dichotomy between
human and robotic exploration

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.620
because this is
human exploration.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.030
We are seeing the
surface of Mars.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:32.220
We're exploring places
that humans could never go,

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.660
at least not now.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.030
And we're doing it through
the eyes of robots.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:41.280
And I think that, as virtual
reality gets more commonplace,

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.720
as we decrease the
separation between humans

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.469
and the machines and the
software that we use,

00:11:48.469 --> 00:11:50.010
we're actually going
to see a merging

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:53.190
of human and robotic
exploration, where we may have

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.140
human exploration of
the surface of Venus,

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.870
except that it'll be humans in
an orbiting spacecraft using

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:00.060
robotic avatars to
explore the surface.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.490
And it sounds science
fiction-y, but it's really not

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:04.980
that far-fetched, given
current technology,

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.170
and would be a much
more efficient way

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:13.920
for us to get human brains into
environments that are really

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.560
hard for humans to survive.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.470
Terrible radiation
environments, terrible heat,

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:22.050
crushing pressure,
all of those things.

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.570
We just put robot
bodies down there.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.590
And if we can manage to use our
human brains effectively, then

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:28.410
that's, I think, the
future of exploration.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:28.650
SCOTT MAXWELL: Right.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.240
And then you haven't gone
down into the gravity well

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.710
and say, no, I have to get
the people boosted back

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:32.070
off the planet.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:32.700
EMILY LAKDAWALLA:
Also that, yeah.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.408
SCOTT MAXWELL: So you
can land the humans

00:12:34.408 --> 00:12:37.710
on Phobos or something and have
them tele-operating a mission

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:39.300
on the surface below them.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.320
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: It
turns out to be harder

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.000
to do aerial synchronous
orbits-- that's

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.510
Mars geosynchronous
orbits-- than it

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:46.830
is to do Earth geosynchronous
orbits because Mars's gravity

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.360
field is a lot lumpier.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.720
And so it's hard to do station
keeping with your spacecraft,

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:57.300
to keep it positioned over
a single spot on Mars.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.819
But there are two stable
positions in longitude,

00:13:00.819 --> 00:13:01.860
or meta stable positions.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.401
So you have to really want to
explore the part of Mars that's

00:13:04.401 --> 00:13:06.520
underneath those two
stable positions.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.520
SCOTT MAXWELL: So you
were talking about the way

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.610
that we embody the Rover,
that we are the Rover,

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:14.160
and the language that's used.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.350
But another thing that
Janet Vertesi pointed out

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:20.550
was that, in the same way
as we by embody the Rover,

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.160
we also use our bodies to
communicate about the Rover.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.260
And so, for example, with
Spirit and Opportunity,

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.217
we'll talk about the
solar panels by--

00:13:27.217 --> 00:13:29.550
you bend your body forward,
you splay your arms backward

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:30.900
in this position
because that's what

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.100
the solar panels look like.

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.880
When you talk about the
solar panels, you do that.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.280
When you talk about
the mobility system,

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.680
you kind of move your arms
in this characteristic way,

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.214
and steer the wheels like this.

00:13:40.214 --> 00:13:42.630
And when you talk about the
robotic arm, you use your arm,

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.499
and it's always the left arm
because they're left-armed.

00:13:45.499 --> 00:13:47.040
Did you find yourself
doing that when

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.165
you were writing this book?

00:13:48.165 --> 00:13:50.249
Did you kind of inhabit
the Rover's body that way?

00:13:50.249 --> 00:13:51.998
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: I
did that a little bit.

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:54.637
But I actually find myself doing
it a lot less with Curiosity

00:13:54.637 --> 00:13:56.220
than I do with Spirit
and Opportunity.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.270
SCOTT MAXWELL: Everybody
else does, too.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.228
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: Yeah.

00:13:58.228 --> 00:14:00.300
Spirit and Opportunity
have this--

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.680
they're much more human scale
and they're symmetrical.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.990
It's much more easy
to imagine them

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:09.690
as having the body plan of a
person or a donkey or a dog

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:11.670
or whatever you
want to imagine it.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:17.397
Curiosity is not
nearly as symmetrical.

00:14:17.397 --> 00:14:18.480
It's not nearly as pretty.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.688
And to be honest, I really
didn't like the appearance

00:14:20.688 --> 00:14:22.770
of Curiosity when I
first started doing

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:23.959
the research on this book.

00:14:23.959 --> 00:14:25.500
I often feel like--
you know, there's

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.930
these three
generations of Rovers.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:31.050
There's Sojourner, Spirit and
Opportunity, and Curiosity.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:33.810
And I feel like Sojourner was
sort of a loyal little dog.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.274
It couldn't ever go any farther
out of sight of the lander

00:14:36.274 --> 00:14:38.440
because it didn't have its
own communication skills.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.023
So it just kind of
poked around rocks.

00:14:40.023 --> 00:14:42.780
You could even see these images
of it lifting its leg on a rock

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:45.180
because it drives up,
and it kept driving.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.670
And there's actually an image
of the Rover perched almost

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:50.130
sideways on a rock like this.

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.620
And then Spirit and Opportunity
are much more surefooted.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:53.040
They're bigger.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.081
They're more human scale.

00:14:54.081 --> 00:14:56.580
So in my extended
animal metaphor,

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.800
they're the burrows,
or the donkeys

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.260
that used to accompany the
western geologists as they

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.020
explored the geology
in the American West.

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.750
And then, what does
that make Curiosity?

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.333
It's the animal
designed by committee.

00:15:07.333 --> 00:15:08.360
It's a camel.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.950
It's a ship of the desert.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:13.690
It moves slowly and steadily
across the desert landscape,

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.800
carrying its lumbering
load with it.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.910
And that's what
Curiosity is like.

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:20.860
And like I said, I
didn't really love it

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.210
when I first saw the design.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.240
But that changed, actually.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.960
The JPL had an
opportunity for the media

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.900
to come into the clean room
and see Curiosity before it got

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.700
shipped to Florida for launch.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.530
And so I was actually
able to put on--

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:38.020
they call it a bunny suit,
the white suit and the cap

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.100
and everything else--

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.261
and go in and see
Curiosity face to face.

00:15:41.261 --> 00:15:43.760
And I have to say that I kind
of fell in love with Curiosity

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.510
when I had the opportunity
to sit there and meet

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:47.830
it face to face.

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:52.630
But yeah, I don't feel like
I embody Curiosity nearly as

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:54.550
much because it's so ungainly.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:56.920
It's a different
kind of creature

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.020
from Spirit and Opportunity.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.090
SCOTT MAXWELL: And that
seems to be kind of

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:02.381
widespread on the project, too.

00:16:02.381 --> 00:16:05.369
Ashwin Vasavada talks about
that, about how people have--

00:16:05.369 --> 00:16:06.910
he feels like people
have emotionally

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:09.220
connected with Curiosity
less than with Spirit

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.740
and Opportunity.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.900
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: I
think, also, it may partly

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:17.710
be because of the way that
Spirit and Opportunity are

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:21.139
much more responsive, in a way.

00:16:21.139 --> 00:16:22.930
You come in on a morning,
you plan the day,

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:23.810
and then that's it.

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:26.860
Whereas Curiosity has to be
planned by committees, as well,

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:31.510
where you have as many
as four parallel planning

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.300
processes that are happening
at the same time operating

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.350
on different time scales.

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:37.210
You do have a
tactical operations

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:40.090
team that is planning
every day of operations.

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:42.130
But then there is a
look-ahead planning team

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:44.620
that is planning a couple
of days of operations.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.230
There is a long-term planning
team that's looking out months.

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:48.896
And then there's a
project science group

00:16:48.896 --> 00:16:51.430
that is kind of keeping
track of all of the mission

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:52.720
requirements.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.630
And unlike Spirit
and Opportunity,

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.820
most of the decisions
for Curiosity

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.610
get made many more
days in advance.

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:02.980
So it's much less responsive.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.420
So it feels, in
a way, a lot more

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.280
like some of the other
big NASA missions,

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.220
like Cassini, or these
other things that

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.300
need to be planned
much longer in advance.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.770
SCOTT MAXWELL: It's kind of
this weird hybrid for that,

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:16.720
and also for project
management reasons

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.180
because it has lots of PIs
for the different instruments,

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.239
instead of one PI overseeing
them all, as on Spirit

00:17:22.239 --> 00:17:22.930
and Opportunity.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:27.364
And so there's this kind
of council of monarchs who

00:17:27.364 --> 00:17:28.530
are kind of in charge of it.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:30.613
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: I call
it the council of elders.

00:17:30.613 --> 00:17:32.720
They're all the men, by
the way, which I hate.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.150
It's really bad.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.960
So there's this group of 12
PIs, and they're all men.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.740
There's a lot of awesome
women working on this team.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.198
SCOTT MAXWELL: A lot of great
engineers working on the team

00:17:43.198 --> 00:17:44.690
and working on
operations, as well.

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:47.148
And in fact, one of the things
I was going to ask you about

00:17:47.148 --> 00:17:48.220
was--

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.300
you cite some of those
women in the book,

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.300
the women who designed
the SA/SPaH, for example,

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.720
the sample acquisition
and handling system.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.480
Are you hoping that--

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.874
as you are well-known for
your science outreach,

00:18:00.874 --> 00:18:03.040
you're also well-known as
being an advocate of women

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.165
in science and engineering.

00:18:04.165 --> 00:18:06.880
And are you hoping that one of
the many effects of this book

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.860
will be to encourage women to
go into science and engineering,

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.320
to see that there's a role
for them in this kind of work?

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.720
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: I don't
think that that's something

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.920
that I see coming as an
outcome of this book.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.060
I think the book is designed
to feed people's insatiable

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:22.270
curiosity about
what Curiosity is.

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:24.264
And honestly, as a
parent of two daughters,

00:18:24.264 --> 00:18:25.930
I don't see any
problems with the number

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.430
of women who want to go into
science and engineering.

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:28.120
SCOTT MAXWELL: Yeah, sure.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.380
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: It's whether
science and engineering wants

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.870
to keep them there,
really, ultimately.

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:36.820
These missions are really
hard because they operate--

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:43.060
when you first land on Mars,
the amount of time you spend,

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.949
just continuous hours
working on these missions,

00:18:45.949 --> 00:18:46.990
it's kind of nightmarish.

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:50.710
And I don't really go into
that that much in this book.

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:52.780
If you're interested
in books where

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.565
the life of being on
a mission is central,

00:18:55.565 --> 00:18:57.190
there's another
recently published book

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.398
by Alan Stern and David
Grinspoon called "Chasing New

00:18:59.398 --> 00:19:00.326
Horizons".

00:19:00.326 --> 00:19:02.200
It's about the New
Horizons mission to Pluto.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.850
And at every stage
of that mission,

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:06.100
it was like, we thought
we were all in before,

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.630
but we had to get
even more all in.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:09.940
And then I started
working 16 hours a day

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.590
and getting by on
three hours of sleep.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:13.530
And it's like the four
yorkshiremen sketch

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.280
from "Monty Python."

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.000
It just keeps on
getting worse and worse.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.310
And you wonder how people
can last like this.

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:22.810
And people with families can't
last like that for very long.

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:24.460
So you have primarily
young people

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.610
working on missions, at
least on tactical operations.

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:29.200
It's difficult.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.565
Now, over time, on
a mission like this,

00:19:32.565 --> 00:19:34.690
they were able to change
the operational structure.

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:40.630
So first, after 90 days,
they went off of Mars time.

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:43.480
So Mars time is where
you set your clock

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.150
to the rotational
rate of Mars, which

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:48.459
has days 40 minutes
longer than Earth days.

00:19:48.459 --> 00:19:50.500
And Scott, you're always
my example of the weirdo

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:54.790
who loves Mars time because
if you are a person who's

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:57.100
a night owl with no children--
you have children now,

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.391
of course-- but if you are
a night owl with no children

00:19:59.391 --> 00:20:01.390
and you love to
sleep in, what's not

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:03.680
to love about sleeping in
40 minutes later every day?

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.690
It sounds great.

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:07.969
But if you have any connection
with the rest of humanity--

00:20:07.969 --> 00:20:09.510
SCOTT MAXWELL: Which
I totally don't.

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:11.343
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: It's
absolutely miserable.

00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:15.250
If you have children or
a spouse or partner who

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:17.680
wants to see you during
ordinary daylight hours,

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.820
it's absolutely miserable.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.020
It's also kind of dangerous.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.870
I was on Mars time with
Spirit and Opportunity

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:23.800
for a little while.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.440
And because the schedule
slips around the clock,

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.890
you wind up sleep-deprived
driving home

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.890
after being up all night
during morning rush hour,

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:35.362
or on empty highways,
and you fall asleep

00:20:35.362 --> 00:20:36.820
while driving and
get into a wreck.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.890
And Steve Squires was actually
really concerned about this

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:41.110
and did all kinds of training
for the operations team

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:42.580
before the mission started.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.250
But anyway, after 90 days,
they knew this mission

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:47.080
was a marathon, not a sprint.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.630
They quickly went
off of Mars time.

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:53.105
After 180 days, they
stopped working on Sundays.

00:20:53.105 --> 00:20:55.480
After another 90 days, they
stopped working on Saturdays.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.979
And what that means is that it
really builds up your Friday.

00:20:57.979 --> 00:21:01.300
You have to produce a three-sol
plan, a three-day plan,

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:01.847
on a Friday.

00:21:01.847 --> 00:21:03.430
And sometimes it
means that you're not

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.070
taking advantage of the full
capability of the Rover.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:10.270
But they do clever things,
like some of these instruments,

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.180
like the SAM instrument,
has to cook samples

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.360
in an oven that is
tremendously power-demanding.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.776
So you might, say, cook them
in an oven on a Saturday

00:21:18.776 --> 00:21:20.650
and just take Sunday
off to let the batteries

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.140
recharge because the Rover
would have to do that anyway.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:24.640
So you might as
well do it at a time

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.980
when you don't want to
double up on your planning.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.690
And so over time,
they have actually

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.240
managed to get the
operations requirement down

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.160
to about nine hours a day.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.410
It's still a little
bit long work day.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.880
They still do play with
the calendar a bit,

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.900
so sometimes you have to come
in and work at 6:00, 7:00 AM

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.720
because that's when you
need to get the commands up

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.582
to the Rover before 2:00
PM or whatever it is.

00:21:46.582 --> 00:21:48.040
Sometimes you have
to come in late.

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:52.720
But now they allow everybody
to have a good night's sleep,

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.760
except for the
poor ChemCam team.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.680
ChemCam is one of
the instruments,

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.610
and it's operated from France.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:01.820
So now that they're
on Earth time,

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.210
the poor ChemCam team
primarily works overnight,

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:05.800
and it's kind of
misery for them.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.870
But they trade off.

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:10.390
They work into operational
roles over time.

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:12.280
They might have two
days on ops per week,

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.600
and then the rest of the
week they're not on ops

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.840
and they don't have
to do that schedule.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:20.230
And so I find that, as
these missions go on,

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:22.950
you find a lot of older--

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:24.070
a lot more women--

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:28.360
people coming into operations
because the work time

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.070
is much more predictable,
and it's much easier

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.070
to balance it with all
the other obligations you

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.330
may have in your daily life.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.830
SCOTT MAXWELL: So to your point
about families on Mars time,

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:39.730
you'll remember that
when Curiosity landed,

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:42.490
there was an engineer,
David Oh, who--

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:44.890
he and his wife and
their two kids all

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:47.560
went on Mars time
together because the kids

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.920
didn't have to be back in
school for a month or a month

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:50.750
and a half or
something like that.

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:52.380
And so they all just
went on Mars time.

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:53.580
The whole family was
living on Mars time,

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.215
which was the first of
those that I've heard of.

00:22:55.215 --> 00:22:56.360
EMILY LAKDAWALLA:
Yeah, they had a blog.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.220
SCOTT MAXWELL: But your point
is well-taken about that

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.690
doesn't work for
everybody all the time.

00:22:58.690 --> 00:22:59.230
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: It
was actually great.

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:00.604
They talked about
what can you do

00:23:00.604 --> 00:23:02.680
in Los Angeles with
two young children

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.666
at midnight, at 2:00 AM?

00:23:04.666 --> 00:23:06.290
And they found all
kinds of interesting

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:08.050
walks they could do with
lights and things like that.

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:09.508
It was actually a
pretty cool blog.

00:23:09.508 --> 00:23:11.980
Going to the beach overnight
is really interesting.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.480
And so they had a good time.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.860
They saw lots of
interesting wildlife.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:17.657
They went to various
all-night restaurants

00:23:17.657 --> 00:23:18.490
that the kids loved.

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:20.799
So they actually had
a good time with that.

00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:22.840
SCOTT MAXWELL: So you
studied all the instruments

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:28.617
on Curiosity in excruciating
detail for this book.

00:23:28.617 --> 00:23:30.700
In that process, did you
come out with a favorite?

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:31.930
What's your favorite
instrument on Curiosity?

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.180
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: I
never have favorites.

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.220
SCOTT MAXWELL: She lied.

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:35.762
But go ahead.

00:23:35.762 --> 00:23:38.303
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: I do have to
say that MAHLI is pretty cool.

00:23:38.303 --> 00:23:39.880
MAHLI is a really
cool instrument.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.630
So MAHLI stands for the
Mars Hand Lens Imager.

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:44.110
It's M-A-H-L-I.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.990
It's the camera that's on
the end of the robotic arm.

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:51.850
And for reasons that I go into
exhaustive detail in the book,

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:54.850
it turns out to be the widest
angle color camera, also,

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:58.480
that the Rover has, so it
can take the broadest views.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.690
And because it's on the
arm, the whole point of it

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:06.217
is to take images of targets
that they do their in-situ work

00:24:06.217 --> 00:24:07.300
on with their instruments.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.114
And so they'll use
MAHLI to take an image

00:24:09.114 --> 00:24:10.780
from about a foot
away, and then they'll

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.405
zoom in and take one from about
five centimeters away, and then

00:24:13.405 --> 00:24:15.890
another one from about one
or two centimeters away.

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:18.940
And that gets you a
nested set of images

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:22.420
at increasing resolution
that helps you see

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.980
what's going on in the rocks.

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.520
But because it's a
focusable camera,

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.330
it can also focus at infinity.

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.459
So you can take long distance
views and, of course,

00:24:31.459 --> 00:24:33.250
you can turn it back
and look at the Rover.

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:38.500
And so it's the first Mars
Rover to demonstrate capability

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.320
of taking a self-portrait
on Mars, although notably,

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.170
Opportunity recently took
a self-portrait on Mars.

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:47.610
It, too, has an
arm-mounted camera.

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:50.530
Its camera is not
focusable, so the images

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:52.270
that it took of itself
were very blurry.

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:54.360
But it's still
unmistakably the Rover,

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.275
and it was really quite
a thrill to see that.

00:24:56.275 --> 00:24:58.720
But yeah, it's become part of
standard operating procedure

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:02.800
for Curiosity to take a selfie
whenever it's at a drill site.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.320
And so we have these
self-portraits of Curiosity

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.220
across the surface of Mars.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.234
And you can see it getting
increasingly dusty.

00:25:09.234 --> 00:25:10.900
The one that you're
seeing on the screen

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.890
up here is a special one.

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:17.620
The first self-portrait,
actually, that Curiosity

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.410
took was just of the
wheels on the surface.

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:23.170
And you want to do that so
that you can check and see

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.340
how the wheels are
contacting the surface,

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.960
check and see the condition of
the wheels after the landing.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:33.550
And in order to
do that, they have

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:35.380
to have the arm
very low, obviously,

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.270
underneath the
undercarriage of the Rover.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:40.840
Most of the selfies are
shot at an altitude that's

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.930
similar to the altitude
of the MastCam cameras

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:46.660
so that it's taking
a self-portrait.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.790
But this one, they were
actually at a drill site

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:51.230
where the ground
sloped downward,

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:54.890
which made life, actually, quite
difficult for the drill team.

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:56.890
But because the ground
was sloping downward away

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:59.020
from the Rover, they were
able to turn the turret

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.990
and take a full selfie
from that low perspective.

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:05.020
So that's what gives you
this very low perspective

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:06.250
on the Rover.

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:07.670
And those
self-portraits are cool.

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:10.990
And some people on
the science team,

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:13.240
or on the engineering
team, were dubious.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:17.860
But when the MAHLI principal
investigator, and a couple

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:20.579
of the workers on that
mission, simulated

00:26:20.579 --> 00:26:22.120
what it could look
like and showed it

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.286
to the engineering team,
they were like, oh, my god,

00:26:24.286 --> 00:26:25.156
we have to do this.

00:26:25.156 --> 00:26:26.530
And so like with
everything, they

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:28.510
have to do it on Earth before
they can do it on Mars.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:30.010
And so the first
selfie was actually

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:34.660
taken by the Earth copy,
the Earth twin of Curiosity,

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:38.067
inside its little garage
in the Mars Yard at JPL.

00:26:38.067 --> 00:26:40.400
And you can see there's two
engineers in the background.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.525
One of them is Vandi Verma.

00:26:41.525 --> 00:26:45.095
She's peeking around
the corner as the camera

00:26:45.095 --> 00:26:45.970
image is being taken.

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:47.851
It's pretty cool.

00:26:47.851 --> 00:26:49.600
SCOTT MAXWELL: I'm
surprised that you said

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.766
the MAHLI was your favorite.

00:26:50.766 --> 00:26:53.880
Because everybody, when you ask
what their favorite instrument

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.294
on Curiosity is, everybody
always says the laser,

00:26:57.294 --> 00:26:58.210
because pew, pew, pew.

00:26:58.210 --> 00:26:58.804
Come on.

00:26:58.804 --> 00:27:00.970
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: It's a
Rover with a frickin' laser

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:02.110
beam on its head.

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:03.370
What's not to love about that?

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:03.850
SCOTT MAXWELL: Exactly.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:06.340
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: And
actually, it is kind of fun.

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:09.910
There's very imaginative
artworks of Curiosity

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:10.930
zapping various things.

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:12.790
My favorite one,
actually, is one

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:15.130
that I first saw
in a ChemCam team.

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:17.860
ChemCam is the instrument
that has the laser.

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:19.450
They were doing a
team presentation

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:21.010
at a science meeting.

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:24.400
And they had a photo
of Curiosity shooting

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.520
a laser and a full on
Michael Bay explosion

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.710
happening at the
end of the laser.

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:33.970
So no, I like pictures.

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:34.600
What can I say?

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.780
Pictures tell us stories.

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:37.360
And I really like
the MAHLI pictures.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:38.734
One thing ChemCam
has, though, is

00:27:38.734 --> 00:27:42.307
it does have a camera on it to
take context images of where

00:27:42.307 --> 00:27:43.390
they zap with their laser.

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:45.280
And later on in
the mission, they

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:48.190
trained the camera to be
able to focus at infinity

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:50.830
so that you can take
long distance photos.

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:53.080
And the camera has
this circular baffle

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.900
so it's the highest
resolution camera.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.400
It can take the
most distant photos.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.950
So it's just like
taking a spyglass

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:02.320
and seeing these long
distance features.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.110
Ahoy, there's that
valley network

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:06.860
that we were going to
visit in the future.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.980
And so I always kind of
feel like a ship's captain

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:10.762
every time I see those
ChemCam pictures.

00:28:10.762 --> 00:28:12.220
SCOTT MAXWELL: Just
so it's clear--

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:13.460
I didn't mean to disagree
with you about the MAHLI

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.209
because I think it's
a very strong choice.

00:28:15.209 --> 00:28:18.250
MAHLI also has a flashlight
on it, which is--

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:21.790
Kim, my wife, who
works on Curiosity--

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:24.490
her favorite is the flashlight
attached to the MAHLI.

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:25.960
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: There's
actually two flashlights.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.790
And the reason for that
is because, if you're

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:30.070
a geologist working in the
field with your rock hammer,

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:32.528
you smash off a piece of fresh
rock to look at the crystals

00:28:32.528 --> 00:28:35.500
inside and try to identify
what minerals are present.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:37.180
You'll do this with
the rock sample

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:39.430
to try to catch
glints from the sun

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:41.420
to see if there's
reflective surfaces

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:43.420
and what the angles
are to each other.

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.070
Well, Curiosity can't do that.

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:48.060
But what it can do is take its
two little flashlights on MAHLI

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.768
and go blink, blink,
blink, blink, blink,

00:28:49.768 --> 00:28:52.270
blink to do lights coming
from two different directions.

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:55.540
And so that's what it does to
try to catch crystal glints.

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.700
I don't know that it's
ever worked that way.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:00.880
But they do use the flashlights
at night because that way,

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:04.240
they have a light source of
known illumination properties.

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.124
And so all the night
images that they've

00:29:06.124 --> 00:29:07.540
taken of all of
their drill sites,

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.305
they can compare the
color to each other

00:29:09.305 --> 00:29:10.930
because they're all
taken under exactly

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:13.310
the same illumination
conditions.

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:15.982
SCOTT MAXWELL: So in addition
to the laser on the Rover,

00:29:15.982 --> 00:29:18.440
I actually learned from your
book--this is not a thing that

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.600
I realized before
reading your book--

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.460
but I learned from
your book that DAN,

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:25.660
the Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons
experiment, has an ion cannon.

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:27.450
So we've got a laser
and an ion cannon,

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:28.990
and now all we need is a
Rover with a light saber,

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:30.280
and we've got the trifecta.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:33.144
EMILY LAKDAWALLA:
That's right, yeah.

00:29:33.144 --> 00:29:34.810
SCOTT MAXWELL: Another
really cool thing

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:36.610
I learned about the
science instruments

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:39.190
from reading the book
was about the rad, which

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:42.040
has the scintillating
plastic detector.

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:42.750
I love that name.

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:44.874
I've decided that scintillating
plastic detector is

00:29:44.874 --> 00:29:47.592
the name of my muse cover band.

00:29:47.592 --> 00:29:48.550
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: Yeah.

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.350
There's all kinds of fun terms.

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:54.250
And they tend to squeeze all
of these terms into acronyms.

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:57.070
And so you talk about
SAMs, TLS, and QMS

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:59.320
and doing GCMS on
all of the samples.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.000
And I think it's
actually a lot more fun

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.550
to say gas chromatograph
mass spectrometer.

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:07.390
It sounds like Star Trekese.

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:10.430
Let's fire things up in our
oven and send them through--

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:12.370
what is it, the manifolds?

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:14.170
There are many
manifolds inside SAM,

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:17.585
and you send it with your helium
carrier gas through manifold A

00:30:17.585 --> 00:30:19.960
and send it off to the
tunable laser spectrometer.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.460
And it's just fun.

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:24.372
There's a lot of fun terms.

00:30:24.372 --> 00:30:26.830
SCOTT MAXWELL: So again, having
studied all the instruments

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:30.610
in this exhaustive detail,
as you say, which of them

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:34.570
do you think was the most
complicated instrument

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:35.830
of all of them on the Rover?

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:37.000
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: That
one's easy to answer.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.660
But the first thing
I want to answer

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:40.810
is when he says
exhaustive detail,

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:43.150
exhaustive is the
most common adjective

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:44.350
used to describe my book.

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:47.560
And I'm just glad that
it's not exhausting.

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:48.430
So yeah.

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:50.550
SCOTT MAXWELL: It's
fascinating, but exhaustive.

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:51.550
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: Right.

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:55.570
So definitely, without question,
the most complicated instrument

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:56.590
is the SAM instrument.

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.810
So SAM means Sample
Analysis at Mars.

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:00.937
It's one of two
laboratory instruments.

00:31:00.937 --> 00:31:02.770
And it's interesting
that the two laboratory

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:05.830
instruments, one of them
is really very simple

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.360
and that's CheMin.

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.140
That's an instrument
that has a laser that it

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:13.330
shines through a little
sample of powder.

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:16.540
And it shakes the powder
so that those crystals all

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:19.342
toss around in various
different orientations.

00:31:19.342 --> 00:31:20.800
And the crystals
scatter the light,

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.750
and you get a diffraction plot.

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:26.170
It's the same kind of technology
that Rosalind Franklin

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:28.120
used to figure out
the structure of DNA.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.430
You're doing x-ray
crystallography, basically.

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:32.110
And that's all it is.

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:34.504
You take a picture
of the diffraction,

00:31:34.504 --> 00:31:36.670
and then you download that
picture, and you can say,

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:38.230
ah, these minerals are present.

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:39.160
And that's it.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.370
And that's one of the two
laboratory instruments.

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:43.750
But then there's SAM.

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:45.850
And SAM is ridiculous.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:48.760
I cannot believe they actually
built this instrument and put

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.440
it on a Rover on Mars.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:56.690
It has a carousel of more
than 70 little quartz cups.

00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:59.080
It can rotate this carousel
under two different inlets

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.210
to receive samples.

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:05.200
Then it rotates the carousel
and lifts a cup into an oven.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:09.010
In the oven, it can heat
things up to 500 degrees.

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:10.510
It can heat it in steps.

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:11.710
It can heat it with a ramp.

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:14.150
It can heat it for a little
bit, then hold it or not.

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:15.280
It can heat it all the way.

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.570
It can heat it partway.

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:20.120
It can take it down and
bring it back up again.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.510
And then there is a
little helium tank

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:25.330
that takes all of the gases
that come off of the oven

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:28.690
and sends them into one of
numerous possible different

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:29.200
instruments.

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.575
But before that, it sends them
into these little chambers

00:32:31.575 --> 00:32:33.130
called manifolds.

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:34.750
A manifold is a
place where you have

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.970
lots of things intersecting.

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:40.430
And by opening and closing one
of dozens of different valves,

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:42.580
they can send the material
on to different getters

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:47.830
and scrubbers, which take
certain stuff out of the gases.

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:50.200
They can turn on a getter
for a little while,

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.404
and then heat the getter
to release the stuff again.

00:32:52.404 --> 00:32:55.070
And then they send that into one
of three different instruments.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:56.710
So there's all these valves.

00:32:56.710 --> 00:33:01.210
There's all these different
ways, all these knobs to turn.

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:02.920
They actually
developed, basically,

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:07.256
a programming language that the
SAM team can use to send things

00:33:07.256 --> 00:33:08.380
through the SAM instrument.

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:09.880
One of the wackiest
things, I think,

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.860
is that the PI on
the SAM instrument

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:15.425
was very proud of the fact
that he programs it in Basic.

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:22.032
I was like, I know very little
about programming languages,

00:33:22.032 --> 00:33:23.740
but I know enough to
know that that's not

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.012
something to be proud of.

00:33:25.012 --> 00:33:26.470
SCOTT MAXWELL: It's
not widely used

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:27.150
at Google, that's for sure.

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:28.600
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: I'm sure.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:31.570
So anyway, it's
incredibly complicated.

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:36.820
And to most people, it's just
a box that the SAM team asks

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:39.160
for knobs to be turned,
and they turn the knobs,

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.030
and data comes out.

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:42.190
And then, even once
you have the data,

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:45.225
you still don't have answers
because the kinds of things

00:33:45.225 --> 00:33:46.600
that they're trying
to figure out

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.420
are so complex that the only way
to be sure that you've figured

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:54.190
it out right is to create a
sample of known composition

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:56.560
and put it through a
duplicate of the instrument

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.670
in a lab on Earth under
Martian conditions.

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:01.090
So that's temperature
and vacuum.

00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:04.210
So SAM results-- there's
actually going to be a press

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:09.010
conference tomorrow concerning
a science paper that--

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:10.905
one of the main people
on the press panel

00:34:10.905 --> 00:34:13.030
is Paul Mahaffey, who is
the principal investigator

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:14.050
on this instrument.

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:17.260
And so I'm sure that
the paper concerns

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:20.260
data that was taken at least six
months ago, probably years ago,

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:22.270
because that's just
how long it takes

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:24.864
to understand the results
from this instrument.

00:34:24.864 --> 00:34:26.530
Fortunately, there
are other instruments

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.484
that produce much more
rapid results, and make

00:34:28.484 --> 00:34:31.150
things a little more interesting
for those of us following along

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:32.110
in the mission.

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:34.443
SCOTT MAXWELL: So the SAM
instrument has another talent.

00:34:34.443 --> 00:34:36.040
If there were a
talent show on Mars,

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.989
Curiosity's entry
would be singing.

00:34:37.989 --> 00:34:38.290
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: That's right.

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:39.969
SAM famously sang
"Happy Birthday"

00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:41.710
to itself using
its SAM instrument.

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:44.860
I actually don't know
the details of what

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.840
was vibrating or making noise.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.790
Was it an FPGA or something?

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:50.473
SCOTT MAXWELL: I don't
know the details.

00:34:50.473 --> 00:34:52.389
My wife is the instrument
engineer for the SAM

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:53.930
instrument, and so
she could probably

00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:56.219
tell us about that
in exhausting detail.

00:34:56.219 --> 00:34:58.010
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: So
anyway, but this story

00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:00.290
does surface once a year.

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:03.310
But I am here to tell you it
does not sing "Happy Birthday"

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:04.390
to itself every year.

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:05.680
It did that once on Mars.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:10.304
It was a cute little
stunt, and that's it.

00:35:10.304 --> 00:35:12.720
SCOTT MAXWELL: So we've been
talking for about 40 minutes.

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:16.800
Let's throw it out for
audience questions, as well.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.095
And while we're getting--

00:35:18.095 --> 00:35:19.470
oh, have you seen
our microphone?

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:20.610
This is really cool.

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:23.280
The microphone's in a
little box, a soft box,

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:27.139
and they can just throw
the box around the room.

00:35:27.139 --> 00:35:29.180
But while we're waiting
for that, let me ask you.

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:30.540
You were saying the SAM
instrument is the most

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:31.498
complicated instrument.

00:35:31.498 --> 00:35:33.360
Was it also the
hardest to explain?

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.280
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: It was
absolutely, by far, the hardest

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:35.760
to explain.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.800
You'll find about 50 pages
of this book on the SAM

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.299
instrument.

00:35:38.299 --> 00:35:42.720
And I wore Paul Mahaffey out
asking him questions about--

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.790
because when I first
started writing this,

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:50.850
I envisioned, you heat
stuff up, you get a gas,

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:53.562
and it goes through the
machine and comes out.

00:35:53.562 --> 00:35:55.020
But that's not how
it works at all.

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.827
You heat it up, you get a
gas, it goes into one place,

00:35:57.827 --> 00:35:59.910
then you open a valve and
it goes into this place.

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:01.870
Then you might be turning on
something that pumps slightly,

00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:02.578
but not too much.

00:36:02.578 --> 00:36:04.260
And you get a gradient going.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:07.800
It's so incredibly complicated
that the main comment

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.560
that I get from people on the
mission who are not on the SAM

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.600
team is, thank god
somebody finally

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:16.865
explained this to me because
I had no idea how it worked.

00:36:16.865 --> 00:36:18.240
AUDIENCE: So I
was wondering, how

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.240
does the delay
between Earth and Mars

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.952
affect the teams that
operate the Rover?

00:36:22.952 --> 00:36:25.410
Is it a lot easier to do work
when Earth and Mars are close

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:26.394
together?

00:36:26.394 --> 00:36:27.810
EMILY LAKDAWALLA:
So no, actually.

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:28.768
That's a good question.

00:36:28.768 --> 00:36:32.040
So Mars and Earth have a
widely differing distance

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:35.100
to each other, which affects
the communications lag.

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.910
But the fact of the matter
is that because the lag is

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:42.390
many minutes, regardless
of the relative distances,

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:43.890
there's no real-time commanding.

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:47.970
So you are always doing a
full sol worth of sequencing

00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:49.410
at a minimum.

00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:52.860
The Rover receives its commands
at 10:00 AM every morning,

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:53.980
Mars time.

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:55.890
And so the reason
that they do that

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:59.820
is because Earth is always
up in Mars's sky at 10:00

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.050
AM local time.

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:03.430
Earth is closer to
the sun than Mars is,

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:07.050
so it's always somewhere
relatively close to the sun.

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:09.429
And so if you're doing your
commanding at 10:00 AM,

00:37:09.429 --> 00:37:11.970
Earth will always be up in the
sky, although sometimes it can

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:13.900
be a little low on the horizon.

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:18.330
And so the Rover executes its
one sol's worth of commands.

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:20.880
And then in the
afternoon, there are

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:24.120
overflights by two Mars
orbiters, Mars Odyssey and Mars

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.710
Reconnaissance Orbiter.

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:29.310
And it sends its data
through a UHF connection

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:31.990
up to the orbiter,
which receives the data

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:33.810
and then relays it onto Earth.

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:36.450
And there's also overnight
passes by the orbiters.

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:41.340
And so you wind up having to
command at minimum one sol

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:42.370
increments.

00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:44.220
And so it really
doesn't matter how close

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:50.310
Mars is, except that you can
get much higher bandwidth

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:52.380
in your transmissions
between Mars and Earth

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:53.550
when Mars is closer.

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:56.580
So you do get more data
returned from the orbiter

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.590
because it can
communicate faster.

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:00.720
You can use a higher data
rate when they're close.

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.900
And so you'll see these
seasonal spikes in data rate

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:05.476
that are not actually seasonal.

00:38:05.476 --> 00:38:08.100
They happen when Mars is nearer
opposition, when Earth and Mars

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.550
are close to each other.

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:12.390
And then, on the opposite side,
when Mars gets into conjunction

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:13.920
with the sun, you
actually have three weeks

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.870
where you're not allowed to
talk to the Rover at all.

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:17.040
Because if there
were a problem, you

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.456
couldn't be sure
that your message

00:38:18.456 --> 00:38:21.870
would get through ungarbled
to be able to save the Rover.

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:24.090
So all the spacecraft
kind of hunker down

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:25.740
and go into a fairly
low activity mode

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:28.510
during conjunction.

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:31.140
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:33.570
Are there pieces of
the Rover that it

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:35.490
can separate from itself?

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:38.280
Like, in the selfie
picture, I don't

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.010
see how there's
something attached to it

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:41.400
that would take the selfie.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.400
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: Right.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.000
So the question of
who took the picture

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.620
and how the selfie
works is one that

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:49.410
pops up every single
time I post a selfie.

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:53.220
The issue is that, although
the field of view of the MAHLI

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:55.787
camera is fairly wide, it's
not anywhere near as wide

00:38:55.787 --> 00:38:57.870
as the kind of camera you
have on your cell phone.

00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:59.250
It's actually very narrow.

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:02.430
So in order to take a
selfie, the Rover actually

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:05.550
takes about 70
pictures of itself

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:08.550
in kind of a matrix sort of way.

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:11.970
And it repositions the arm
to keep the arm out of view.

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:14.280
It would never be able to
photograph its whole arm

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.580
regardless.

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:20.250
And so you wind up
mosaicing an image together

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:22.590
like this out of multiple
different images.

00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:26.862
And they just do it in a way so
that the arm is not constantly

00:39:26.862 --> 00:39:29.070
poking into view from all
these different directions.

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:35.070
Because when you
do take the selfie,

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:37.260
you will see the arm
in multiple images.

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:41.051
And so you have to come up with
a way of neatly cutting it off.

00:39:41.051 --> 00:39:43.050
You actually see more of
the arm in this picture

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:45.270
than you see in most
of the self-portraits.

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:47.460
Usually they chop it
off at the shoulder.

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.410
Because otherwise,
it would be crossing

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:51.459
the front of the Rover.

00:39:51.459 --> 00:39:53.250
But because of all
those multiple pictures,

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:55.540
you wind up being able
to get the arm out of it.

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.800
And there's no
real sensible way.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.390
One of the more disconcerting
images that I've seen

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:03.510
was a self-portrait taken
by the MastCam, which

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:05.880
is the only way that
Opportunity and Spirit can

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.620
take self-portraits.

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:11.250
You can get a mosaic of
the deck of the Rover

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:14.234
by shooting multiple
images with the MastCam.

00:40:14.234 --> 00:40:15.900
And in those images,
of course, the mast

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:19.086
is missing because it can't
photograph the MastCam.

00:40:19.086 --> 00:40:20.460
It can't photograph
its own mast.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:23.040
And so you get a
great view of the arm,

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.724
but the Rover's headless, and
it's really kind of disturbing.

00:40:29.642 --> 00:40:31.225
AUDIENCE: Wasn't
this the one that had

00:40:31.225 --> 00:40:33.100
the really difficult landing?

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.480
Like, it was really complicated,
and they were really

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.759
worried about it?

00:40:36.759 --> 00:40:39.050
SCOTT MAXWELL: She goes into
a lot of detail about that

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:39.710
in the book, by the way.

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:40.717
It's really fascinating.

00:40:40.717 --> 00:40:41.675
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: Yeah.

00:40:41.675 --> 00:40:43.360
So it's kind of funny.

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.200
It was a really
complicated landing.

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:48.890
It's a Rube Goldbergian landing.

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:50.450
The problem with
landing on Mars is

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:53.250
that it has enough
atmosphere to burn you up,

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:55.580
but not enough atmosphere
to slow you down.

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:57.650
So it's easier to
land on the moon.

00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:00.080
It's easier to land on Earth.

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.430
On the moon, no atmosphere.

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:03.554
You just streak in, blast
with retrorockets, boom,

00:41:03.554 --> 00:41:04.970
you're on the
surface, no problem.

00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:06.800
On Earth, parachute
and heat shield

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.300
slows you down
enough where you just

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:09.530
kind of coast into a landing.

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:11.240
That's what the
space shuttles did.

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.550
That's what all the
Apollo capsules did.

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:15.710
On Mars you have to combine
all of those things.

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:18.080
So you have a heat
shield that takes you

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.240
from interplanetary
travel speeds down

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.634
to supersonic speeds.

00:41:21.634 --> 00:41:23.300
Then you have a
parachute that takes you

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.700
from supersonic to subsonic.

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:27.470
Then you have
rockets that slow you

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:31.040
down from subsonic to still.

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.750
And then you have to touch down.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:34.640
And different missions
have accomplished

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.960
this in different ways.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.880
Most Mars missions are landers.

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.860
And so what the landers
typically do is they

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:40.070
get down to--

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:41.000
SCOTT MAXWELL: Landers
as opposed to Rovers.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.625
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: As
opposed to Rovers.

00:41:42.625 --> 00:41:43.610
Yeah, sorry.

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:46.430
So they get pretty
close to the surface.

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:49.370
And then, usually, they
cut off their rockets

00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:51.650
right above the
surface because you

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:55.460
don't want to be blasting the
surface with a lot of rocket

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:56.360
exhaust.

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:59.100
And so they'll have
crushable legs.

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.800
That's what Phoenix
and Insight have.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.372
They have legs that can take
up that last bit of drop.

00:42:03.372 --> 00:42:05.330
Or you'll have what Spirit
and Opportunity had,

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:06.920
which are the
airbags surrounding,

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:10.110
and it actually bounced to a
halt, which I think is nutty.

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:12.860
I mean, take a ridiculously
expensive machine

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:15.690
and whack it on the
surface multiple times.

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:18.470
That's what Spirit and
Opportunity and Pathfinder did.

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:21.690
And so Curiosity's approach--

00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:25.220
Curiosity was already too big to
have any extra lander hardware.

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:28.010
And so it said it had a
rocket-assisted backpack

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:32.120
that it lowered the
Rover on a rope,

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:35.310
and then gently let the
Rover touch the surface.

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:37.160
And there's slack on the cables.

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:39.200
And once the machine
detected that there's

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.420
slack on the cables,
it cuts the cables

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:43.580
and flies the jet pack away.

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:47.760
You can just imagine, it's just
like in a Wiley Coyote cartoon.

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:48.690
Whew, clunk.

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:50.940
and then there's a big
explosion and a boom and stuff.

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:51.830
SCOTT MAXWELL: Which
we got a picture of.

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:52.850
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: Which we
actually got a picture of.

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:53.760
SCOTT MAXWELL: It was amazing.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.890
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: The
first Curiosity image

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:57.200
from the surface of Mars was
taken by its rear hazcam.

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.359
And you see this plume
of dust on the horizon.

00:42:59.359 --> 00:43:01.400
And they later figured
out that that was probably

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:04.460
the plume from the
explosion of the jet pack

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:08.030
when it crashed on the surface,
which I think is just great.

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:10.714
So it's an incredibly
complicated landing.

00:43:10.714 --> 00:43:12.130
But as I explain
in the book, it's

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:13.670
actually not really
out of family

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:16.310
from what had been done before.

00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:18.097
Hanging the Rover on
a rope was actually

00:43:18.097 --> 00:43:20.180
exactly what they did with
Spirit and Opportunity.

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:25.150
That airbag thingy was hanging
on a rope off of the retro

00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:26.360
rockets.

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:31.110
And so the landing
looked ridiculous.

00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:32.720
But it was very well-modeled.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:36.560
And after they had the
two-year launch delay,

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:39.129
I have never seen engineers
as confident as I saw.

00:43:39.129 --> 00:43:41.420
I mean, engineers, as a rule,
are not confident people.

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:43.711
They're like, well, it might
work if all the conditions

00:43:43.711 --> 00:43:44.690
are right, bla bla bla.

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:46.481
They don't want to tell
you it's absolutely

00:43:46.481 --> 00:43:49.320
going to work because, as they
say in the rocket business,

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:52.132
there's 1,000 ways for a
launch to go wrong, only one

00:43:52.132 --> 00:43:53.090
way for it to go right.

00:43:56.120 --> 00:44:01.130
But they had the last two years
to really prepare and throw

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:03.860
all kinds of situations at it.

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:07.220
You know, dust storms
and bad navigation

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:10.250
and failure of one of the
rockets and all kinds of stuff.

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:12.482
And the machine, in
their simulations,

00:44:12.482 --> 00:44:13.690
performed with flying colors.

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:16.900
And in the final event, it was
just straight down the middle.

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:19.424
Everything was nominal,
nominal, nominal,

00:44:19.424 --> 00:44:21.590
except for one little detail
that maybe I'll let you

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:22.548
guys read the book for.

00:44:25.372 --> 00:44:26.830
SCOTT MAXWELL: So
software people--

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:28.130
while the mic is going
to the next person--

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:29.546
software people
like us understand

00:44:29.546 --> 00:44:32.285
the concept of Easter eggs.

00:44:32.285 --> 00:44:34.880
Little hidden things in,
maybe, your web browser.

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:37.490
You hit Control-Alt-Shift-S and
it pops up a flight simulator

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:38.150
or something like that.

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:39.149
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: Right.

00:44:39.149 --> 00:44:41.570
SCOTT MAXWELL: And Curiosity
has one of those Easter eggs,

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:43.710
as well, in the wheels.

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:46.130
Before they had
not-on-purpose holes in them,

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:48.420
they had on-purpose
holes in them.

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:49.711
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: That's right.

00:44:49.711 --> 00:44:51.770
So if you look at the
wheels of the Rover,

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:53.978
you can see that there are
deliberately a whole bunch

00:44:53.978 --> 00:44:55.310
of holes punched in them.

00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:58.190
This is kind of a callback
to Spirit and Opportunity.

00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:00.020
They were connected
to their lander

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:03.795
with these bolts that were fired
and separated after landing.

00:45:03.795 --> 00:45:06.170
And so there are holes on
Spirit and Opportunity's wheels

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:08.060
that are there
just as an artifact

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:10.841
of the method by which they
were attached to the lander.

00:45:10.841 --> 00:45:13.340
But they turned out to be really
useful for the science team

00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:15.860
because you can see the little
mark that the holes left

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:19.370
in the wheel tracks to
actually measure distances.

00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:22.280
You can also use it to see how
much the Rover wheels slipped

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:22.962
during driving.

00:45:22.962 --> 00:45:24.920
So you can kind of measure
distances in one way

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:27.560
and then in a different way, and
see how long or short it was.

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:29.720
And the Rover
actually got to where

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:31.100
it was using this for odometry.

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:32.850
It could actually use
its own wheel tracks

00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:34.850
to help understand how
far it had traveled.

00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:38.420
So they wanted to include
some kind of odometry marking

00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:41.330
on the wheels on
Curiosity to make sure

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:44.210
that it would be easy to tell
how many wheel turns there

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:45.890
had been in the Rover tracks.

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:48.139
And so the first thing they
did was that they actually

00:45:48.139 --> 00:45:50.580
machined the letters JPL into
the wheels, into the treads.

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:54.380
And so there's a picture in my
book of an early set of wheels

00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:57.494
that has JPL on it, so it
left tracks, JPL, JPL, JPL,

00:45:57.494 --> 00:45:58.160
as it was going.

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:00.300
And NASA was like, you
guys can't do that.

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:02.840
So they came up
with another plan,

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:06.350
which was to put the letters
JPL in the wheels in Morse code.

00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:07.850
So that's what you see.

00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:09.530
There's three rows
there, and they

00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:12.050
have narrower and
wider gaps, and that's

00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:15.560
the letters JPL in Morse code.

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:17.810
AUDIENCE: So this isn't
actually a Curiosity question,

00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:19.643
because there's something
else you mentioned

00:46:19.643 --> 00:46:21.290
earlier that's been bugging me.

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:25.310
You said the Russians landed
a mostly mechanical lander

00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:27.834
on Venus, and the
electronics wouldn't stand up

00:46:27.834 --> 00:46:29.000
to the surface temperatures.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.790
How did they communicate
the information

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:34.234
off the planet to us?

00:46:34.234 --> 00:46:35.900
EMILY LAKDAWALLA:
Well, I don't actually

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:40.010
know enough about how
those missions worked.

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:44.660
They did have a pressure vessel,
a temperature-safe vessel,

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:47.960
on the inside that had
the limited electronics

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:48.980
that there were.

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:51.479
And they did do radio
communications direct to Earth.

00:46:51.479 --> 00:46:52.895
They didn't have
orbiters, so they

00:46:52.895 --> 00:46:53.780
were doing it direct to Earth.

00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:55.660
But then, Venus is actually
relatively close to Earth,

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:57.535
so you don't have to
have very powerful radio

00:46:57.535 --> 00:46:59.600
to get that data back.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.670
I'm afraid I'm not an
electronics person myself,

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:03.795
so I don't really know the
answer to that question.

00:47:08.254 --> 00:47:10.670
SCOTT MAXWELL: We're starting
to run a little low on time.

00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:11.760
And it kills me
that we're not going

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:13.770
to get to all the questions
I want to ask you.

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:15.120
Maybe we should take one
more audience question,

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.740
and I'll ask you a wrap-up here.

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:17.940
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: OK.

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:19.770
AUDIENCE: So my question
is, what happens

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:21.360
if something mechanical fails?

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.660
Is there any self-repair
kind of capability?

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:26.070
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: There is not.

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:28.050
But there's a lot of
redundancy-- a lot

00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:29.850
of redundant capability.

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:33.570
So there's a lot of
planning done to figure out

00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:36.420
how the Rover can still
accomplish its mission even

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:39.600
if this, that, or
another component fails.

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.270
So the computer systems
are fully redundant.

00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:44.580
There's an A side and a B
side, and various components

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:45.955
are cross-strapped
to each other.

00:47:45.955 --> 00:47:48.720
So when a computer fails, as
actually happened 200 days

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:51.420
into the mission, they
can swap to the backup

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:54.090
and operate on the backup while
they repair the prime computer.

00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:57.516
And so they've done that with
the main computer already.

00:47:57.516 --> 00:47:58.890
It actually took
them a long time

00:47:58.890 --> 00:48:02.040
to bring the backup back
online, which was kind of scary.

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:04.170
There have been mechanical
problems like problems

00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:05.010
with the wheels.

00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:08.470
And so you get through
that through robustness.

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:11.100
Basically, any one of
the wheels, the motors

00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:15.480
are powerful enough to raise
the entire Rover's weight

00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:16.080
vertically.

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:18.330
So if you attached a rope
to it, you could wind a rope

00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:20.415
on one of the
wheels, and the motor

00:48:20.415 --> 00:48:24.005
is strong enough to be able
to lift the whole Rover.

00:48:24.005 --> 00:48:26.380
This actually became important
for Spirit and Opportunity

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:28.980
because both of them have
had different kinds of wheel

00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:29.601
failures.

00:48:29.601 --> 00:48:32.100
And so Spirit, in particular,
was dragging one of its wheels

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:33.670
for a long time.

00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:35.660
But the Rover was still
able to drive that way.

00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:36.330
SCOTT MAXWELL: And
it's a good thing

00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:38.490
because we made some science
discoveries because of that.

00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:38.760
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: Yeah.

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:40.770
And so the biggest
problem that Curiosity

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:43.620
has been dealing with lately
is a major mechanical failure

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:44.640
in the drill.

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:47.369
So the drill used to operate
with a pair of prongs

00:48:47.369 --> 00:48:48.660
that it pressed against a rock.

00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:50.160
And then there was
a feed mechanism

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.140
that pushed the
drill into the rock

00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:54.150
while everything
else stayed still.

00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:57.260
And the feed mechanism
failed almost completely.

00:48:57.260 --> 00:48:58.937
It was very sticky.

00:48:58.937 --> 00:49:01.020
They couldn't get it to
move backward and forward,

00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:02.370
which is critical for drilling.

00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:05.520
And so over the period
of more than a year now,

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:09.040
they've managed to get the bulky
feed to extend all the way.

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:11.280
So now the feed is
permanently extended.

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:14.534
And they-- just a couple of
weeks ago-- for the first time,

00:49:14.534 --> 00:49:16.950
managed to do what they call
feed-extended drilling, where

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:19.170
instead of using the
feed mechanism, which

00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:22.680
no longer works, they're
now using arm motors.

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:24.420
So it's like taking
a drill and trying

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:25.750
to drill into a wall like this.

00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:28.530
You can imagine, it's
hard, but Curiosity's arm

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:29.280
is pretty strong.

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:30.960
And so they just kind
of lean on the arm

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:33.460
and they push the drill into
the rock, and it worked.

00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:36.030
So it's taken them a
long time to fix it.

00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:40.860
But these engineers are really
ingenious at solving problems.

00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:44.760
And so a lot of what you
do on an extended mission,

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:46.440
and extended extended
mission, which

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:48.600
is what Curiosity is
on now, is figure out

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:51.240
how to make the most of
an aging machine that does

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:54.040
have problems but can still
do great science where it is.

00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:57.540
And so all these people
have a lot of experience

00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:01.042
in making old,
groany machines work.

00:50:01.042 --> 00:50:03.000
I mean, I'd like to write
a book about Galileo,

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.650
about all the things
they had to keep

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:07.070
that thing going after
radiation fried it

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:08.980
at Jupiter multiple times.

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:11.190
And so Curiosity's still
got a lot of life in it.

00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:14.460
They'll have problems.

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:17.230
They wish the problems weren't
there, but they're like,

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:20.450
OK, this is our new reality,
and we'll keep going.

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:21.780
That's how it works.

00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:23.280
SCOTT MAXWELL: So
it's killing me

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.140
that I've got, like,
20 more questions here

00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:26.306
and we've got three minutes.

00:50:26.306 --> 00:50:28.810
So that's not enough
time, I'm thinking.

00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:32.010
But maybe we can
end on this note,

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:36.300
by asking you what do you
hope readers will take away

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:38.010
from this gorgeous,
terrific book

00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:40.560
that I could not more
highly recommend?

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:43.311
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: Oh, gosh.

00:50:43.311 --> 00:50:45.810
I guess I hope that people will
take away the fact that they

00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:49.690
can understand this is a
very complicated machine,

00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:52.170
but what it's doing, why
it's there, and how it works

00:50:52.170 --> 00:50:55.530
are not inaccessible
to everyone.

00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:58.170
And that's one of the great
things about space exploration,

00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:01.530
I think, is that it's easy to
explain why we're doing it,

00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:03.990
the fundamental questions
we're trying to answer.

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:07.320
Was there ever life on Mars,
are we alone in the universe?

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:09.600
That kind of stuff.

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.386
And it's fairly
easy to understand

00:51:11.386 --> 00:51:13.260
how we're going about
solving those problems.

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:15.855
We're sending a robot with a
drill that's sampling rocks,

00:51:15.855 --> 00:51:16.980
and we put them into a lab.

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:19.570
And all of these things you
can communicate with children.

00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:21.694
You can communicate with
science-interested adults,

00:51:21.694 --> 00:51:22.960
as well.

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:26.632
And it's just very accessible,
and everybody can kind of

00:51:26.632 --> 00:51:28.590
participate in the
adventure by following along

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:29.590
with what they're doing.

00:51:29.590 --> 00:51:32.220
They share their raw
images straight from Mars

00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:34.890
directly on the internet
that, every day,

00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:38.130
you can tune in at JPL and
see what they've been doing.

00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:41.150
I highly recommend
midnightplanets.com.

00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:46.110
It's an enthusiast-built
website that

00:51:46.110 --> 00:51:48.630
aggregates all of the images
from the different rovers

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:50.910
and puts them up in ways
that are easy to see.

00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:54.400
And it's just a fun adventure,
and we're all part of it,

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:55.560
basically.

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:58.620
SCOTT MAXWELL: Emily, I'm so
sad that we're out of time.

00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:01.072
But I enthusiastically
recommend this book.

00:52:01.072 --> 00:52:03.280
The book is "The Design and
Engineering of Curiosity:

00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:05.462
How the Mars Rover
Performs Its Job."

00:52:05.462 --> 00:52:07.420
All the stuff you've
heard us talk about today,

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:09.070
and a whole lot more
stuff, is in there.

00:52:09.070 --> 00:52:09.945
It's really terrific.

00:52:09.945 --> 00:52:11.030
I highly recommend it.

00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:13.762
EMILY LAKDAWALLA: It's also on
my blog at planetary.org/blog.

00:52:13.762 --> 00:52:16.220
You'll find I write updates
about every two or three months

00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:17.344
on what Curiosity is doing.

00:52:17.344 --> 00:52:20.160
I'll probably have a new one
out in a couple of weeks.

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.460
SCOTT MAXWELL: I wish we
had another hour to talk,

00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:23.001
but maybe you'll be
able to come back

00:52:23.001 --> 00:52:24.340
