1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,470
Um, well, I think we should start
the story on June 25th, 1969. Well,

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:07,740
first you should say who you are. I'm
Susie Lichtenberg. I'm Janet. I'm Rod.

3
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:11,190
This is more perfect. Okay. So
why, uh, why June 20? When was it?

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,240
June 25th, 1969, uh,

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,100
Supreme Court Chief Justice
Earl Warren is retiring.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,780
Earl Warren of the Warren Court. Is
that a big court? Yeah, that's really,

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,270
no, come on human re, I think if you
think of legendary Supreme Court justices,

8
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:29,340
he's probably in, I
don't know, the top five.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,650
So he was one of the Mount Olympians.
He's a big deal. All right,

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,180
so he's retiring. So he's retiring.

11
00:00:35,181 --> 00:00:39,230
He's been on the court for 16 years and
he's in an interview and he's asked,

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,650
what'd you list Mr Chief Justice as the
supreme court's most important decision

13
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:47,460
in your 16 years here? And he says
something that is kind of astounding.

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,250
I think the reapportionment
not only of state legislatures,

15
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:52,890
but for sure

16
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,780
before you hear the answer. Yeah.

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,430
I think that you need to know that he
could have said all kinds of cases.

18
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:04,040
He was the chief justice
during, I don't know, Miranda,

19
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,660
either of his rights to
remain silent. That's,

20
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:07,800
you have the right to remain silent.

21
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:10,480
Clarence Earl Gideon petition

22
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,850
or Gideon versus Wainwright.

23
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,700
It is the beauty of the space,

24
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,790
which is you have the right to an attorney
that seems big or has no place in our

25
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:22,890
democracy. Brown vs
board of Education. Okay.

26
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,660
I know that one. I know
desegregating the schools of state.

27
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,350
It could be bigger than that. He doesn't
say any of those. What does he say?

28
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,880
He says this little
case called [inaudible]

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,560
the baker versus Carr case.
Baker versus Carr. Huh.

30
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,380
I think that uh,

31
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:45,880
that that case is perhaps
the most important case that
we've had since I've been

32
00:01:45,881 --> 00:01:46,714
on the court.

33
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,230
He thought that case, whatever it is,

34
00:01:48,231 --> 00:01:53,000
is more important than the case that
desegregated the schools. He did. Wow.

35
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,800
So what the hell is it
exactly? No, really what is it?

36
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:02,310
It's this case that was so dramatic and
so traumatic that it apparently broke

37
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:04,060
two justices.

38
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,120
There was an instance in which my brother
found my father going upstairs to get

39
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:13,030
a shotgun. Wow. More perfect.

40
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,903
The auto,

41
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,870
all the chief justice and the associate
justices of the Supreme Court of the

42
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:23,600
United States. All Da da.

43
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,610
Yeah. But before the

44
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,270
[inaudible] the draw in Aaron

45
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,933
[inaudible]

46
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,873
[inaudible].

47
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,010
Okay. So this is more of perfect
a mini series about the supreme

48
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,260
court. Just to frame the story
we're about to hear for a second.

49
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,210
As we were putting the show together, um,

50
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:09,430
we hosted a panel discussion and a couple
of us were on stage and a woman in the

51
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:13,300
audience asked the following
question. Yes. Could you, um,

52
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,360
address what I see is the increasing
politicization of the court,

53
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,570
the apotheosis of which I
guess was, uh, you know,

54
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:27,571
voting or electing Bush
to be our president.

55
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,130
Has the court always been this way?

56
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:33,970
Is this just my perception that
it's becoming more politicized?

57
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,150
So this turns out to be really
interesting question. Uh, it turns out,

58
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,500
I didn't know this until Susie started
looking into it, that there was a moment

59
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,170
when the Pandora's box
just got ripped open.

60
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,230
So I think to understand
that moment in this story,

61
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,060
you have to get to know three characters.

62
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,840
And these aren't necessarily the three
most important justices of all time.

63
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,290
Okay.

64
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,640
Because at that time you had Chief Justice
Earl Warren [inaudible] and William

65
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,370
Brennan on the court. And these were
kind of giants of the Supreme Court.

66
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,820
Gotcha. But for this story,
these three guys are key.

67
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,110
One of them is on the right.

68
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,340
One of them is on the left and one of
them is just stuck right in the middle,

69
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,660
tragically in the middle.
So on the conservative side.

70
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:14,181
So Ryan,

71
00:04:14,181 --> 00:04:17,630
what difference does it make when it
in the constitution or in any other

72
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,400
expression or action by the state?

73
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,720
You had a guy named Felix Frankfurter.

74
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,140
So Justice Frankfurter was one of the
most great is really his name was really

75
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,770
framed further. Yes. One of the most
influential justices of all time. I,

76
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,720
that's Tara Grove.

77
00:04:30,721 --> 00:04:33,750
She teaches constitutional law at
William and Mary Law School. Um,

78
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:38,370
he was a very influential scholar at
Harvard law school before he became a

79
00:04:38,371 --> 00:04:41,700
justice, was a close advisor to
Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Um,

80
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,280
he was extremely smart, towering figure.

81
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,960
But as a person just as
just justice frankfurter,

82
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,350
he wasn't necessarily the nicest person.
I heard that from everyone I talk to.

83
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,910
I always call him a Bantam Rooster.
Uh, he was a difficult crusty figure.

84
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,880
He was short, a little
bit of a pouch on him.

85
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,990
It was one of the most condescending
egotistical of justices.

86
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,540
He was a tough customer when a,

87
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,770
when a clerk would come to the u s supreme
court chambers to deliver a message,

88
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:18,000
and the person at the door tried to
hand justice frankfurter the paper,

89
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,270
Frankfurt or would inevitably
let it drop to the ground.

90
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,510
So the person had to bend down and pick
it up to hand it to him again. Dude,

91
00:05:26,511 --> 00:05:30,560
that's a Wainer man. And by the way,

92
00:05:30,561 --> 00:05:33,920
the voices you heard besides terra
grove are professors. Mike Seidman,

93
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,730
Georgetown University Law Center, because
Sam is that girl from NYU law school.

94
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,290
Craig Smith, California, University of
Pennsylvania and x Supreme Court clerk.

95
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,050
Alan Cohen, column K La Chan. Okay.

96
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:49,400
So Frankfurter is on one side of the aisle
and his nemesis is a gentleman on the

97
00:05:49,401 --> 00:05:50,234
other side of the island,

98
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,100
a liberal named William O. Douglas

99
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,280
here is Justice

100
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,060
Douglas now and the Supreme
Court chambers. He said yes,

101
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,480
this is a recording from a 1957
interview with Justice Douglas.

102
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,900
It looks very well as
the faceless 10 rugged,

103
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,770
his eyes sparkle Douglas was this
mountain climbing environmentalist big on

104
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,633
civil liberties.

105
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,460
I think that the coming generation is
more aware of the importance of civil

106
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:21,470
liberties and perhaps like generation low

107
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,760
and like Justice Frankfurter
Douglas was a prick

108
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,220
to everybody around him. Everybody
hated him. All those same adjectives,

109
00:06:30,221 --> 00:06:33,970
condescending, egotistical,
abrasive, applied.

110
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,890
Here's how the New York
Times described him.

111
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,250
Oh, habitual. A womanizer, a heavy
drinker, and uncaring parents.

112
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,030
Douglas was married four times cheating
on each of his first three wives with

113
00:06:43,031 --> 00:06:48,010
her eventual successor. Do you believe
in kissing your bride, sir? Oh,

114
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,290
sure. Do you mind,

115
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,600
this is footage from his last
marriage to his wife Kathleen.

116
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,990
He was 67 she was 22

117
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,483
Oh yes.

118
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,220
So yes, yes. That is. That is William
Douglas. So you have these two guys,

119
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,030
Frankfurt or the Bantam Rooster. Douglas
the prick. And as you can imagine,

120
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,440
they hated each other. They
just despised each other.

121
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,030
So Frankfurter had this
habit of monologuing and
while he would go on and on,

122
00:07:15,031 --> 00:07:18,270
Douglas would just pull out a book right
in front of him and just start reading.

123
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,900
You know, he was just open and
his disdain for Frankfurter.

124
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,350
I actually found a series of interviews
that were done with Douglas in the early

125
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,480
sixties, where he basically
calls frankfurter names.

126
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:32,490
No, see evil, utterly dishonest.

127
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,580
Intellectually. He was
very great, devious.

128
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,180
He spent his time going
up and down the holes,

129
00:07:39,181 --> 00:07:41,930
putting the poisons in everybody's sprawl.

130
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:47,220
Wow. Why did they hate each other so
much? Well, according to Mike Seidman,

131
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:51,610
some of that comes from maybe
their difference in background.

132
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,990
Frank footer was a Jewish
immigrant from Austria.

133
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,510
A Douglas was a westerner,

134
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,580
but according to him, the core of
their hatred actually was ideological,

135
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,270
had reflected, um, a
really important split

136
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:12,120
over how powerful the court should
be. Though for frank footer,

137
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,850
courts just ought not to intervene.

138
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:19,260
He believed that in many matters should
be left up to the political process and

139
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,110
the courts should stay
out of those issues.

140
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,360
It's Douglas. Um, he
thought just the opposite.

141
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:28,080
He thought that courts want to
intervene to protect, for example,

142
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:31,950
minority groups, free speech
rights, things of that sort.

143
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,700
So you had this personal feud going.

144
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:38,210
You had this ideological war that was
brewing in the court and into the middle

145
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:39,230
of all this

146
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,173
[inaudible]

147
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,390
Lux, Charles, whatever you
might call them, the swing vote.

148
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:55,050
Okay. This is Alan Colton.
I was a supreme court clerk.

149
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:00,410
Justice Whitaker from 1957 to 1958
Whitaker grew up in a small town in Kansas

150
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:06,630
called Troy. The activist is a flashy,

151
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,390
this is his granddaughter kicked you
tend to kind of a one room school house.

152
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,010
Verby a little red school house.
Worked on the farm, but he,

153
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,270
he, he determined that
was not the life for him.

154
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,830
Kate says when he was around 16 he became
obsessed with the idea of becoming a

155
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:26,400
lawyer and she says he would
actually practice law to the animals.

156
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,020
Can you imagine, you know,

157
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:32,760
pushing the plow along in the fields and
then lecturing and arguing cases to the

158
00:09:32,761 --> 00:09:34,410
cows or to the horses or whatever.

159
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,410
Did you really hear that
he was lecturing dude? Yes.

160
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,270
Oh and on the side he was, he would
hunt, he would hunt a squirrels, possum,

161
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,860
raccoons, dunks,

162
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,540
and he'd sell the pelts for a few dollars
and he amassed I think $700 with that

163
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,340
money you put himself through law school.

164
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,870
My understanding is that he simultaneously
went to law school and high school

165
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,900
what, which is just
mind boggling, but yeah,

166
00:09:58,901 --> 00:10:01,960
apparently he went to the head of the
law school in Kansas City and he's like,

167
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,450
I don't have a high school
diploma, but you need to let me in.

168
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,470
The Dean just saw how ambitious he was
and he was impressed and he's like,

169
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:10,830
all right, you're in. I love this
guy. He's like, Mr bootstraps.

170
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,930
Totally any how to make
a long story short,

171
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,550
sone became a top lawyer and Alan Cohen
says that's because he would do better

172
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:20,370
than all of his opponents. He would
outwork them out, prepare them,

173
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:22,050
great attention to detail,

174
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:26,490
great presence before a jury and
then he becomes a judge. First,

175
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,220
a federal district judge and
then an appeals court judge.

176
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,280
Then in February of 1957 he gets the call.

177
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,170
Carla was in the evening and they asked
if he could be in Washington. Yeah,

178
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,410
and the next morning, and this is
Kentwood a group, Charles Whitaker's son.

179
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:45,580
He should certainly, but my best blue
shoot deals at the cleaners tonight.

180
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,240
What did he wear? I, as a matter of fact,

181
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,690
my mother or someone else got
the cleaners to open up at night

182
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:59,610
in the first stern must be allegation
tending to show that the corporation's

183
00:11:01,511 --> 00:11:04,750
right dog exercise of free
will let them destroy.

184
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,820
This is one of the first times that
Whitaker spoke on the bench and he

185
00:11:07,821 --> 00:11:11,420
interjects with a question for the
attorney and he is the Midwestern plate.

186
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,760
Yes. I guess the,

187
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,900
you've had so many interruptions
but I have a question or two.

188
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:20,470
I wonder if I might have the
privilege of asking sir. I think

189
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,300
the thing that's crazy to me is that
he walked into the highest court in the

190
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:26,550
land and he didn't even go to college.

191
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:31,430
I think it's important to understand
that he had no formal education really.

192
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,221
In other words,

193
00:11:32,221 --> 00:11:36,870
he never took history or political
science or social science,

194
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,560
but he loved the law. My
father was not an ideal law.

195
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:46,750
He expected the court to be an arena
in which there were lively arguments on

196
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,550
legal issues and that's
what he enjoyed. What he,

197
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,070
what's really good at

198
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,340
what he loved as Kent Whittaker puts it.

199
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,720
His Dad was kind of the walking embodiment
of that thing that chief justice John

200
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,870
Roberts said back in 2005 during his
confirmation hearing your chairman,

201
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:09,160
I come before the committee with no
agenda. He was sort of a blank slate.

202
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,120
It's my job to call balls and
strikes and not to pitch or bat.

203
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:18,630
My father was not interested
in advancing a cause or a fury,

204
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:22,390
but frankly that seems
how a justice should be.

205
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:26,440
That you are approaching it without a
political agenda and you're deciding it.

206
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:31,460
In theory. That's exactly
right, but in practice,

207
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,490
so many of their cases,

208
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,040
there is no wall to turn
to to decide those cases.

209
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,280
Ken says that his dad
quickly discovered that law,

210
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,290
the Supreme Court is never
clean. Cut cases make it there.

211
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,480
Precisely because the law isn't clear.

212
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,530
Many of their cases are just without
precedent, and it's in those cases,

213
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,660
at least you have must have.

214
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:59,950
Your ideology is a as a starting point,

215
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:04,140
and the fact that he didn't have an
ideology that left him vulnerable,

216
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,250
he was definitely getting lobbied from
both sides, Frankfurt or on one side,

217
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,300
Douglas on the other.

218
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:13,920
You were the new kid on the block
and was being pulled by each one.

219
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:18,950
He didn't like the way the judges
bullied for votes within his first three

220
00:13:19,981 --> 00:13:22,290
months. He found himself in the
middle of a death penalty case.

221
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,360
She was found in her bedroom by firemen
taken outside and soon thereafter

222
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,750
pronounced that

223
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,490
a guy had been tried for arson and murder
and Douglas and the liberals wanted to

224
00:13:32,491 --> 00:13:33,810
intervene to help them.

225
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,050
They felt like he'd been treated
unfairly by the lower courts,

226
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,840
but frankfurter in the Conservatives
thought that the supreme court should be

227
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,410
cautious. They should honor precedent.
Now, according to Justice Douglas,

228
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,390
justice Whittaker was undecided all the
time. Douglas would tell him one thing,

229
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,070
oh, well, yeah, that seems right.

230
00:13:50,071 --> 00:13:52,980
And then just as frank herder would say
something else and you say, oh gosh,

231
00:13:52,981 --> 00:13:53,700
that sounds right.

232
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,700
I think there was some thought that he
might side with the guy who talked with

233
00:13:58,981 --> 00:14:00,150
him last, you know,

234
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:04,350
he ends up being so undecided on this
death penalty case that he forces the

235
00:14:04,351 --> 00:14:08,070
court to delay the vote until the next
term and there were a series of cases

236
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:08,410
like [inaudible],

237
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,610
this Halbert ill tro,

238
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,940
where the law would be fuzzy
ideologies would harden and Whitaker.

239
00:14:13,941 --> 00:14:18,140
He would be right in the middle of the
physical depictions of him in that first

240
00:14:18,141 --> 00:14:20,060
year from people who saw him,

241
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,880
described somebody who was
restless, terribly unhappy.

242
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:30,920
I had lost a lot of weight. Nervous
was agitated most of the time.

243
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,570
It was a lot of stress on him.

244
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,660
I mean, I took,

245
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,190
this was just quicker that in normal
course on the California procedure,

246
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,810
the medical, yeah.

247
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,270
Great. Perfect. Over the next few years,
he bounces back. He finds his feet.

248
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,580
Yeah.

249
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:48,880
You say that the judgment
on probation, his

250
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,040
production increased substantially in

251
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,730
his third year, his fourth year
and part of his fifth year.

252
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,380
He wrote as many opinions
as any other judge.

253
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:05,600
He wrote as many dissenting opinions as
any other judge. He was one of the nine.

254
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:10,430
He was fully implied and he wrote some
very important opinions during that

255
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:15,431
period of time and along came a
baker versus Carr and it broke them.

256
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,163
[inaudible] it's coming up.

257

272

40 hours a year. Hey,

Hey, this is more perfect.
I'm jet apple. I'm Rod.

279
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:04,070
Let's get back to our story from Susie
Lichtenberg about the case that broke two

280
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:04,904
justices.

281
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:10,340
[inaudible] number 180 Trey
Charles w your banker at out,

282
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:14,260
but tell him a balance versus
Joe C car and Allen [inaudible].

283
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:17,030
Okay, so it's April 19th, 1961

284
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,500
does chief justice man please the court,

285
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,080
the supreme court is
hearing Baker versus Carr.

286
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,990
Yes,

287
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,990
it is an individual voting rights case
run by 11 qualified voters in the state

288
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:33,474
of Tennessee.

289
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,331
Now on the surface,

290
00:17:35,331 --> 00:17:38,420
Baker versus Carr was about districts
and how people are counted in this

291
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:39,230
country.

292
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,890
And this is one of the most basic ways
that political power gets assigned in

293
00:17:42,891 --> 00:17:45,950
America. Yeah. Like you know,
as populations grow in size,

294
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,010
that growth should be reflected
in the number of Congress people

295
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,350
that are representing
them. But at that time

296
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,750
in Tennessee, Tennessee hadn't
changed its legislative district.

297
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,310
The last reapportion
months, one in 19 and one

298
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:04,160
since 1901, which was
60 years earlier. Well,

299
00:18:04,161 --> 00:18:09,161
this created big problems for urban areas
like Memphis because in those 60 years

300
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,540
people had moved to the cities in droves
and rural areas were getting smaller,

301
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:18,320
but the Tennessee state legislature
had refused to update its count. Right.

302
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,730
And it was still giving more
representation to those rural areas

303
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:26,850
in Tennessee. Um, the
figure was 23 to one,

304
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:30,180
NYU law professor Sam is that girl.
For people that don't understand that,

305
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:33,150
how does it actually dilute your vote?
Well, I mean, this is very simple.

306
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,940
You have one district that has, uh,

307
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:40,620
one person in it and you have another
district that has 23 people in it.

308
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,910
The district that has one person gives
all the power to that one person,

309
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
the district that has 23 people, uh,

310
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:51,930
spreads it out over all 23. Wait, what?

311
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,150
All right, think of it
this way. At that time,

312
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:58,710
a person in the city in Tennessee had
one 23rd as much of a voice in the

313
00:18:58,711 --> 00:19:01,050
legislature as a person
living in the countryside.

314
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,550
And heres sort of the
insidious underbelly of that,

315
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,780
it just so happened that the people
living in the countryside are mostly white

316
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,260
and a large percentage of the people
living in the city were black.

317
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,390
Underlying all of the reapportionment
litigation, at least in the south,

318
00:19:16,391 --> 00:19:18,040
was white supremacy.

319
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,053
That's Doug Smith

320
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,700
historian and the author
of on Democracy's doorstep.

321
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,000
This was deeply tied to white supremacy
and the maintenance of Jim Crow.

322
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:32,040
It was a method of making sure that rural
white legislatures continue to control

323
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:32,874
the power structure.

324
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,890
So you had this situation,

325
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:37,580
he says were a small minority
was choking the majority,

326
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,510
choking the the cities and the growing
suburban areas from any source,

327
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,510
any sorts of funds.

328
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:45,370
The cities couldn't get the money
they needed for roads, education,

329
00:19:45,371 --> 00:19:48,430
social services. So the question
at the supreme court was,

330
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,590
and they would actually tackle
this in two separate hearings,

331
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,480
what should they do about this,

332
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,330
Aaron, you have your back

333
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,510
and here's where you get to
the ideological smackdown
liberals on the court,

334
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,770
like Douglas basically agreed
with the plaintiff when they are,

335
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:08,980
I say there's nothing in
the congregational United
States of America that are

336
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,820
nothing in the constitution of Tennessee.

337
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:17,320
That state government must remain an
agricultural commodity and there's nothing

338
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:21,780
good either one of those constitution
that said it takes 20 city residents to

339
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,950
equal one farm.

340
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,750
Liberals were like, yeah,
this is clearly an injustice.

341
00:20:25,751 --> 00:20:27,430
People in the cities are getting screwed.

342
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:33,050
Their voting rights have been alluded and
debates to the point of nullification.

343
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,740
Well, the conservatives
are like, yes, people are

344
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:40,260
getting hurt, but we're not going to do
anything about it. We can't. Frankfurter

345
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,920
may affect the does a rotten rejoice
in doesn't mean a call today.

346
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,440
Most specifically said we cannot
get involved at as bad. This is,

347
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,380
there was not an issue that the court
should get involved in. Why now?

348
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,420
I do have to think of the
road that I'm going on.

349
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,220
What kind of role you're inviting me.

350
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,050
He was like, think of
where this will lead.

351
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:03,510
Considering the fact that this is
unique and if the situate isn't a unique

352
00:21:03,511 --> 00:21:04,550
Tennessee situation.

353
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,100
If we end up doing this in Tennessee,

354
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:09,700
pretty soon we'll be intervening
in California, South Carolina.

355
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,300
Pretty soon we'll be rewriting
the entire U s legislative map.

356
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:18,120
Have to think of a lot of states,
and this is just fantasy for me.

357
00:21:18,121 --> 00:21:20,070
This is the United States, not Tennessee.

358
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,880
Yeah, so basically he felt like this
would force the courts to get involved in

359
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:29,590
politics and he really believed that the
courts should never ever get involved

360
00:21:29,591 --> 00:21:31,330
in politics. This is a,

361
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,260
this is an idea that goes way back
to something called the [inaudible]

362
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:38,240
political question doctrine. Political
question doctrine. Political question.

363
00:21:38,241 --> 00:21:43,241
Doctrine says no federal court
can decide this issue at all.

364
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:48,140
The courts simply had no business
getting into what were considered to be

365
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:51,290
fundamentally political questions and
what could be more fundamentally political

366
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,640
than the makeup of a legislature.

367
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:57,730
It's a philosophy rooted in the notion
that unelected lifetime judges should not

368
00:21:58,971 --> 00:22:03,971
be substituting their will for the will
of the people's elected representatives.

369
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,270
Frederick felt like even if you
have a terrible political situation,

370
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,300
if the justice has stepped in
and overruled the legislature,

371
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:14,810
that would be worse than doing nothing
at all because it would be fundamentally

372
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,030
undemocratic. He viewed,

373
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,740
he viewed the political question doctrine
is a crucial limitation on the federal

374
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:24,050
judicial power and he wasn't alone.

375
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,460
The courts had followed this guideline
for about 150 years and even with the

376
00:22:28,461 --> 00:22:29,720
current case in Tennessee,

377
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:34,420
the federal court that first heard
the case recognized the situation and

378
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:35,740
actually referred to it as an [inaudible].

379
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,760
The evil is a serious one,

380
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,730
but should be corrected
without further delay in quote.

381
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:43,940
All right. You said that this is
a, this is a political question.

382
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,900
Malapportionment is a political question
and only the political branches can

383
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:48,570
handle this, right?

384
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:53,570
Of course they have no
power to do anything about
protecting and enforcing the

385
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,950
voting rights of these plaintiffs.

386
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,003
So

387
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,410
Belize the myth, man, that's cool.

388
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,180
When the lawyer for
Tennessee got up there,

389
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:04,440
I am not here defending the legislature.

390
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:08,160
He didn't try to defend how Tennessee was
counting or not counting. It's people.

391
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,890
He basically said, yeah,
what we're doing is bad,

392
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,140
but it's nobody's job but ours to fix.

393
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:19,020
Is it worth for the
legislature of Tennessee not
to reapportion or is it worse?

394
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,400
Well, the Federal District Gourds,

395
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:30,220
finally the age old doc separating,

396
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,770
he basically said, if you step in,

397
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,140
you're going to screw up the
balance of power in America.

398
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,740
The power in America comes from
we, the people, not the courts.

399
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:43,820
So this matter should be left up to the
people of Tennessee and their elected

400
00:23:43,821 --> 00:23:46,400
representatives. Wait a
second. If the whole problem

401
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,440
is that you don't have a
voice in the legislature,

402
00:23:48,441 --> 00:23:52,580
then how can you suddenly just have
a voice in the legislature? I mean,

403
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:55,610
the only way to change it would be if
the legislature itself were to give up

404
00:23:55,611 --> 00:23:57,980
power and why would they
do that? Because of course,

405
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,080
once elected officials are in power,

406
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:04,430
they have a vested interest in keeping
their districts exactly as they are

407
00:24:04,431 --> 00:24:08,280
because those were the districts
that elected them. And fundamentally,

408
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:12,630
electoral representatives knew
that if they redrew the lines,

409
00:24:12,631 --> 00:24:14,610
that they would be, um,

410
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,010
voting themselves out of political power
that Ski Charles Professor Duke Law

411
00:24:20,011 --> 00:24:24,390
School. So they had an incentive
not to do anything about this.

412
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,130
So for the liberals on the court,

413
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,040
they felt like this was a fundamental
flaw in our democracy that needed to be

414
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:32,790
fixed and nobody was going to fix it if
they didn't fix it. But for Frankfurter,

415
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:34,770
he's like, if you fix this one,
you're gonna have to fix it.

416
00:24:34,771 --> 00:24:38,640
That one and that one and that one and
that one. And where's it going to stop?

417
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:41,520
If you do this, there is no way out.

418
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:42,920
[inaudible]

419
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,460
the court's going to get stuck
in what he called [inaudible]

420
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,820
political thicken. Ah,

421
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,420
the political thicken of the court
must not enter the political thicket.

422
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,790
That sounds like frankfurter.
He must've written those words.

423
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,330
And the imagery at the
thicket is that, uh, you know,

424
00:24:56,331 --> 00:25:00,800
the deer very proudly with his
new horns goes into the thicket,

425
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,910
gets entangled and can never get out.

426
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,170
Frank for years, claim was
once the courts are in,

427
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,200
there will be nothing beyond
it and someday the courts
will be forced to declare

428
00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:17,840
winners and losers of very
high profile elections.

429
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:21,790
[inaudible]

430
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,820
okay. So after the oral arguments
are over in Baker vs Carr,

431
00:25:24,821 --> 00:25:26,500
that justice is headed to conference.

432
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,770
That's a meeting with just the nine
and when they went into the conference,

433
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:35,010
basically the court would divided right
down the middle and Charles Whittaker,

434
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,230
he was a potential swing
vote. Whitaker was deeply torn

435
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:40,940
[inaudible]

436
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,920
he'd been leaning Frankfurter's way, but

437
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:48,020
if there is a clear constitutional
right that's being violated

438
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,660
during those first, that first argument,

439
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,900
he asked a number of questions
that suggested a great
deal of sympathy with the

440
00:25:53,901 --> 00:25:54,140
plaintiff.

441
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,180
Sam Is there not

442
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,680
power and duty in the court to
enforce that constitutional rights?

443
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,120
There was a lot of thought that he
might actually come down on the side of,

444
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:09,710
of the plaintiffs in that case. And I
think that's where frankfurter really,

445
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,240
really began to to rip into him

446
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:16,250
Justice Frankfurter right after the first
oral argument during the conference,

447
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:21,680
even 90 minutes speech, so talked
for 90 plus straight minutes,

448
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,920
darting around the room,
pulling books off the shelves,

449
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,730
holding books off the shelf,
reading from prior cases,

450
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,050
just sticky collating wildly to make
his point and the whole time looking

451
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:34,280
directly at Whitaker.

452
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,310
There was one account that I heard where
frankfurter went on for four hours,

453
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:45,210
four hours really lecturing Whitaker
really, really belittling him.

454
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,350
This guy, yes it was. It
was horribly intimidating.

455
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:55,560
At one point, one of the justices on
the liberal side, Justice Hugo black,

456
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,450
he took Whitaker aside.

457
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:01,150
Black was trying to make him feel
better and black said to Charles,

458
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,990
weird occurred. Just remember,
we're all boys grown tall.

459
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,550
We're not the gods who sit
on high and dispense justice,

460
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,580
but it's very difficult not
to see yourself in that role,

461
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:19,440
particularly if your vote might be
the vote that decides everything.

462
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,170
This started to weigh
heavily on Whitaker's mind.

463
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:25,280
[inaudible].

464
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,590
He was disturbed by the,

465
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,840
by having the way to the
supreme court on his shoulders.

466
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:31,820
[inaudible]

467
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,010
according to his family, Kate and Ken,

468
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:39,040
my mother tells me that he at that time
was under a lot of stress and spoke as

469
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:45,020
though he were dictating,
spoke his punctuation.

470
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:48,970
Hello Judith Comma, it's very
nice to meet you, period.

471
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:54,020
Clearly thinking about everything
that he might say being recorded.

472
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:59,740
I remember his stating that it felt
like all the words that he uttered were

473
00:28:00,201 --> 00:28:04,670
being jeweled in stone as a result
of which he said you don't talk much.

474
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,413
[inaudible]

475
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,360
so after they heard the case the first
time [inaudible] couldn't make up his

476
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,840
mind. And actually incidentally
there was another justice

477
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:24,690
justice Stewart who was the other swing
vote in the case who also couldn't make

478
00:28:24,691 --> 00:28:25,524
up his mind.

479
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:26,630
Okay.

480
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:30,590
The court decided to hear the case again
in the fall just because they needed

481
00:28:30,591 --> 00:28:31,424
more time

482
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,860
and over the summer, interesting.

483
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,750
Halfway to Chris said he remained deeply
divided that he'd actually written

484
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,570
memos on both sides of the
issue. Doug Smith says,

485
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,400
Whittaker wrote both an opinion for

486
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,050
intervening and bigger versus car and a
descent against intervening and bigger

487
00:28:48,051 --> 00:28:50,210
versus car at the same time.

488
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,250
Meanwhile, as he's doing this,

489
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:58,690
justice frankfurters circulates a 60
page memo explaining how this was a

490
00:28:58,741 --> 00:29:01,860
political question that should
not be decided by the courts.

491
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,940
Scott, you know a fire in his
belly. He's not gonna let this one

492
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:11,060
number six, Charles Deputy
Baker, that was tell him

493
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,460
Monday, October 9th,

494
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,620
1961 it's 10:00 AM and
the court is back again.

495
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,410
Does that change justice and please,

496
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,780
hello, you're arguing the case against
the Tennessee legislature begins,

497
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,250
Tennessee voters seek
federal court protection.

498
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,380
Frankfurter sits quietly for
about five minutes listening

499
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,913
without the light,

500
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,040
and then you don't mean to him
because if you start to go wrong,

501
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,360
you start to look the same time I
add no right for the fifth time,

502
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:42,130
I did not miss the justice right ratio.
You gave a minute. My child's again,

503
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:46,340
termination of the state. I wasn't
trying to deal with that. The problem

504
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,010
doesn't include any state. It's
different when you and much more, well,

505
00:29:52,011 --> 00:29:55,990
it's passed on it by denying or right
under it. If that isn't passing on it.

506
00:29:55,991 --> 00:29:59,080
I don't know. Why does pappy, of
course not. Mr. Justice Frankfurter

507
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,580
Frankfurter hammers the attorney's with
questions during the course of oral

508
00:30:03,581 --> 00:30:04,414
arguments.

509
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:09,250
He speaks approximately 170 times 170 170.

510
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:11,830
Damn Charles Whittaker.

511
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:16,830
You have some system for the allocation
of its legislate doors to districts or

512
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,200
county

513
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,250
17 times.

514
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,590
Well, uh, essentially

515
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,330
after nearly four hours of oral arguments,

516
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,243
the race has now

517
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,630
the justice is recess
and go into conference.

518
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,570
Frankfurter needed desperately.

519
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:37,810
He had a good Winokur and he would kept
after him like a dog after a bone trying

520
00:30:41,511 --> 00:30:46,100
to persuade them and that harassing
he got, I have to make a point here.

521
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:51,320
It was a nightmare and
I saw the nightmare.

522
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:57,780
How so? Describe it to me. Well, he was

523
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,773
okay.

524
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:06,290
A nervous wreck and like a cat
on a hot tin roof. I found out,

525
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:10,370
I don't know if he told me or his wife
told me he was on tranquilizers to try to

526
00:31:10,371 --> 00:31:14,570
overcome what he thought was
just work related stress. Well,

527
00:31:14,571 --> 00:31:19,571
clearly something was taking hold of
him who had trouble concentrating.

528
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,440
Highly fraught.

529
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:26,530
I would characterize his eventual
breakdown as something of a slow descent

530
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:29,960
[inaudible]

531
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,520
by the early spring after the court
had returned from its winter recess,

532
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,210
a Whitaker was absent from the court.

533
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:44,470
You mean like he just didn't, he like
didn't show for work one day apparently.

534
00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:47,650
So it's clerks didn't
know where he was. Um,

535
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,100
the other justices didn't
know his whereabouts.

536
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:56,460
He just disappeared really in the middle
of what's going to become one of the,

537
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:02,740
you know, monumental decisions of
the 20th century. He disappears.

538
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,960
He had to escape. Where did he go? Well,

539
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:13,590
he went to really what would be a cabin
in the woods in the middle of Wisconsin

540
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,770
and he,

541
00:32:15,771 --> 00:32:19,900
he called up one of his former
law associates in Kansas
City to come up and join

542
00:32:19,901 --> 00:32:20,690
him.

543
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:25,160
And according to Craig Smith, he
in this guy whose name was Sam ob,

544
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:30,560
they would just sit there
on the bank of the lake

545
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,133
in silence.

546
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:44,450
[inaudible]

547
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:47,840
they would sit for hours on
end, not talking to each other,

548
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,620
just waiting for the justice to speak.

549
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:10,240
No cause for pride and
what has happened. And so,

550
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,920
you know, we have no way of knowing
what he was thinking at that moment.

551
00:33:13,921 --> 00:33:15,420
But I imagine

552
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:18,780
he was just sitting there and he was
thinking about these two realities that

553
00:33:18,781 --> 00:33:22,680
could unfold. Like on the one hand,
if the court stepped into politics,

554
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,023
they could protect him.

555
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:36,610
[inaudible]

556
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:40,560
but on the other hand, it's gonna
precedent with this set. It's a sad deal.

557
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:44,530
Mr President, when we weekend, would
it make the court too powerful?

558
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,050
Marsha Richard, shiny versus Albert Gore,

559
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:52,210
in which case your Bush protect the
people as received president of the United

560
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:55,960
States 200 and images. Mine went
back and forth, back and forth. Yeah.

561
00:33:56,370 --> 00:34:01,360
Well, and when Whitaker decided that
he really had to get back to work,

562
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:06,480
then this protege would say to him, no,

563
00:34:06,481 --> 00:34:10,300
just relax dude. Just
take it easy. And, um,

564
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:13,740
get yourself together before
you decide to go back.

565
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,240
After three weeks, justice
Whitaker returns to DC

566
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,100
back to Washington, uh, for a few days.

567
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:26,470
That's Ken Tigan, his son. [inaudible]

568
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,480
well, you found my father
to be really in Extremis,

569
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:36,430
uh, a debate and, and I
think a borderline suicidal.

570
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:39,480
When you said he was
suicidal, what do you mean

571
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:41,211
there?

572
00:34:41,211 --> 00:34:46,211
There was an instance in which my brother
found my father going upstairs to get

573
00:34:47,631 --> 00:34:48,464
a shotgun.

574
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:52,283
Yeah.

575
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,010
A few days later, Charles Woodpecker
checks himself into a hospital.

576
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:05,310
There is some evidence that it was really
justice Douglas who convinced Whitaker

577
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,600
to go to the hospital.

578
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:12,650
I do recall that. I have
a nervous breakdown.

579
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,340
That's justice William Douglas again.

580
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,453
Yeah.

581
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,100
He was at Walter Reed Hospital

582
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:24,610
and I've been up to see him
that she had been up to see him.

583
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,653
[inaudible]

584
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,490
he wasn't very current physical
condition. Very worried and

585
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:38,610
depressed. Yes. I thought he should do.

586
00:35:38,611 --> 00:35:43,611
I told him I didn't think that he was
being in a position to decide what he

587
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:45,420
should do until they get well.

588
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,433
A few weeks later,

589
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,440
March 29 1962 the presidential press
conference from the new State Department

590
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,520
Auditorium, Washington d c
several announcements to make.

591
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:09,380
It is with extreme regret that I announced
the retirement of associate justice

592
00:36:09,381 --> 00:36:11,750
of the Supreme Court, Charles Evans,

593
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,440
Whitaker effective April
1st justice Whitaker.

594
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:20,330
I remember the Supreme Court for nearly
five years and of the federal judiciary.

595
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:25,400
Vanilli eight years is retiring at the
written direction of his position or

596
00:36:25,401 --> 00:36:26,480
reasons of disability.

597
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,440
I know that the bench and the bar of the
entire nation join me in commending Mr.

598
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:38,000
Justice Whitaker for his devoted service
to his country during a critical period

599
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,210
in it's history. Next,

600
00:36:41,211 --> 00:36:44,810
I want to take this opportunity to stress
again the importance of the tax bill

601
00:36:44,811 --> 00:36:46,340
now before the House of Representatives.

602
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:50,400
Wow. Just being made and whatever happened
with the case with they can record.

603
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:53,530
Well, Whitaker didn't
vote on bigger versus car,

604
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:57,340
so you could say that this case
that essentially broke him,

605
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:01,600
his vote didn't count. Wow. Not around
the time that he was in the hospital,

606
00:37:01,601 --> 00:37:05,260
there was sort of this liberal coup at
the court where Frankfurter lost a couple

607
00:37:05,261 --> 00:37:09,700
of other votes. So in the
end, the decision actually
wasn't very close at all.

608
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:13,870
What was it? It was six
to ah, Frankie. Yeah.

609
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,350
And Brennan wrote the majority opinion
and he says that this whole kind of

610
00:37:17,351 --> 00:37:21,280
cluster that we've been fighting over
of how states and Tennessee count their

611
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:24,940
voters, that this is something
the courts can and should look at.

612
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,080
So in other words, they decided to lower
their Ahrens and go into the thicket.

613
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:33,690
Oh, Yay. They did. No. Yay. Um, and
just one or two final questions. Um,

614
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,350
what happened to Justice Frankfurter?

615
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,310
Well, the,

616
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:41,230
the thing that I find perhaps
most extraordinary is it
less than two weeks after

617
00:37:41,231 --> 00:37:43,630
the decision in Baker vs Carr came down,

618
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:48,960
Felix Frankfurter was working at his
desk at the Supreme Court and Frankfurter

619
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:53,860
Secretary found him sprawled on the
floor of his office from a stroke.

620
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:58,330
He suffered a massive stroke and
then never returned to service.

621
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,690
And while he was in the
hospitals, solicitor general,

622
00:38:01,691 --> 00:38:06,040
Archibald Cox visited
Frankfurter. And Frankfurter. He,

623
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,530
he was in a wheelchair
and could barely speak,

624
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:13,830
but he apparently conveyed to Archibald
Cox that the decision maker versus car

625
00:38:15,851 --> 00:38:17,860
had essentially caused his stroke.

626
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:26,890
He felt so passionately that the court
should stay out of the case that he

627
00:38:27,531 --> 00:38:32,120
physically physically deteriorated
after the court had gone the other way.

628
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,743
[inaudible]

629
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,160
after Baker versus Carr,

630
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:53,450
President Kennedy essentially had two
Supreme Court vacancies to fill now

631
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:54,230
Whitaker seat.

632
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:58,100
He filled with a guy who turned out to
be a moderate Frankfurter's vacancy.

633
00:38:58,101 --> 00:38:59,390
That second vacancy.

634
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:04,540
It's that vacancy that will lead to
the appointment of a man named Arthur

635
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,303
Goldberg.

636
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:12,430
That is the fifth vote that the four
liberals would are regarded as the four

637
00:39:14,361 --> 00:39:14,901
liberals.

638
00:39:14,901 --> 00:39:19,670
That becomes the fifth vote that they
need really to create what has come to be

639
00:39:19,671 --> 00:39:21,980
regarded as the Warren court revolution.

640
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:27,040
[inaudible]

641
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,580
this is when the supreme court basically
became an agent for social change.

642
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,270
That revolution that
begins with the 1962 term.

643
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,340
That's the revolution that is going to
change this dark tower that at one man,

644
00:39:39,341 --> 00:39:42,130
one vote, the way we withdraw
our political boundaries.

645
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:47,160
Then the prosecutor withheld and fashion
the way we think of criminal justice

646
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:53,110
[inaudible] small black armband,
the way we treat first amendment,

647
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:57,130
religious education, religious
and obscenity issues.

648
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,640
That's the war in court
that people remember.

649
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:06,430
And that's the court that came into
existence with Felix Frankfurter left.

650
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,410
And so just thinking about that question
that that woman asked all the way at

651
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,230
the beginning of the
story. Yes. Could you, um,

652
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:21,290
address what I see is the increasing
politicization of the court,

653
00:40:21,481 --> 00:40:25,500
the apotheosis of which I
guess was, uh, you know,

654
00:40:25,501 --> 00:40:30,501
voting or electing Bush
to be our president.

655
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:35,540
You can kind of draw a line from this
moment in Baker vs Carr all the way to

656
00:40:36,511 --> 00:40:38,000
December 9th, 2000

657
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,050
block here on the east. The polls
in six new states have just closed.

658
00:40:42,051 --> 00:40:47,051
And the lead story at this hour is the
state of Florida is too close to call.

659
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:53,240
I think fields from, for to with
us said C. And what we found was,

660
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:55,430
and that's what I told you,
that's what would happen,

661
00:40:56,090 --> 00:41:00,650
is that eventually you will, you
will be deciding a partisan question,

662
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:05,920
which presidential candidate essentially
received the most votes for those who

663
00:41:06,861 --> 00:41:10,010
felt themselves on the
losing side of pushy core.

664
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,710
This was just this Frankfurter's revenge.

665
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,470
This was the moment that a
Baker v Carr had opened up.

666
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:24,430
And when I teach this to students, uh,

667
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:28,840
and particularly in the decade
after Bush v Gore, when, uh, the,

668
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,920
the, the center sent to Ben Sentiments
about this were still quite,

669
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,360
I would say to them, well, is
this was frankfurter, right?

670
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:43,550
And I remember a student, uh, in
the mid two thousands who said, uh,

671
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,950
in class, I never
thought I would say this,

672
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:49,010
but because I hated the
outcome and Bush Free Gore,

673
00:41:49,011 --> 00:41:51,080
I was so angry when the court interceded.

674
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:57,070
But if push Sri Gores the price
we have to pay for the courts,

675
00:41:57,081 --> 00:42:02,081
making the overall political system
work somewhat more tolerably properly.

676
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,460
It's a price I'm willing to pay.

677
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,493
Oh,

678
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,830
before we totally sign off
what happened to Douglas,

679
00:42:11,831 --> 00:42:15,430
we sort of lost track of him. So
after Baker versus Carr was decided,

680
00:42:15,431 --> 00:42:19,360
he went on to be a supreme court justice
for 13 more years. And to this day,

681
00:42:19,361 --> 00:42:23,650
he actually holds the record for being
the longest serving justice of all time,

682
00:42:23,651 --> 00:42:25,960
36 years. And Frankfurter.

683
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,430
So Baker vs Carr was the
last case that he ever heard,

684
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:35,440
and he died a few years afterwards
and, and, and Charles would accrue.

685
00:42:35,441 --> 00:42:38,770
Did he ever recover? Well, after
Whitaker retired from the court,

686
00:42:38,771 --> 00:42:40,900
he moved back to Kansas
City with his family.
