JEREMY STERN: Good afternoon
and welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.730
I'm Jeremy Stern
with Google Fiber.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.410
And our guest today
is Shaluinn Fullove.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.090
Shal's been a
Googler for 13 years.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.710
She started at Google
Search and moved

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.280
onto a number of other products,
and then became a Sloan fellow

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.440
at the Graduate School
of Business at Stanford,

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.860
returned after her
fellowship and worked

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.409
on apps and business
and Gmail, and then came

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:37.790
to join Google Fiber about
three years ago with me.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.510
And when she's not
a full time Googler,

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.940
she is a full time mom
and a world class runner

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.110
and endurance athlete.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.450
Let me share with you some
examples of her long list

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.970
of accomplishments in running.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.750
Her personal record
running a marathon

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.090
is two hours, 41
minutes, and 57 seconds.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.540
Think about that.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.540
26.2 miles in under two
hours and 42 minutes.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.020
That was her personal record set
in December at the California

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.760
International Marathon, and
it was a key race getting her

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.140
to this day.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.010
And so we'll talk
more about that.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.270
She also ran a
1,500 meter, a mile,

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.920
in under four minutes
and 35 seconds

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.270
in the US Track and
Field Pacific Association

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.430
Championships a few years ago.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.360
She's in Los Angeles today for
the US Women's Olympic Track

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.380
Team Marathon Trials, on
the road to Rio in 2016.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.940
This is a really big race
this Saturday for Shal,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.240
and we're really lucky
to have her here.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.500
Please join me in welcoming
Shal to Google Venice Beach.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.204
And also her husband Ramsey and
daughter Elise and mom Marianne

00:02:00.204 --> 00:02:01.370
are in the audience with us.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.890
So welcome also to
Google Venice Beach.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.280
Welcome.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.430
It's been fun as a Google
Fiber teammate of yours

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.920
to follow your path here.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.490
But I'm really excited
to have you here

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.200
and to share with the Google
audience and the YouTube

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.960
audience a little bit more about
you and your racing career.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.322
So can you tell us a little
bit about-- first of all,

00:02:26.322 --> 00:02:27.780
you're on the Google
Fiber project.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.400
Tell us a little bit about
what Google Fiber is.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.950
SHALUINN FULLOVE: Google Fiber
is high speed internet and TV

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.700
for your home or small business.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.000
And it's a gig, which is
a really big deal, right?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.760
So it's a lot faster
than most of us

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.094
have unfortunately at our homes.

00:02:45.094 --> 00:02:47.093
And I've been on the team
for about three years,

00:02:47.093 --> 00:02:48.720
like you mentioned earlier.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.110
JEREMY STERN: So over
13 years at Google.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.232
What inspired you to
move from other projects

00:02:56.232 --> 00:02:57.690
to come join the
Google Fiber team?

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.535
What was interesting
about the opportunity?

00:02:59.535 --> 00:03:02.160
SHALUINN FULLOVE: I've worked on
a lot of projects and products

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.034
since I've been here.

00:03:03.034 --> 00:03:05.136
I think it's maybe
more than 12 products,

00:03:05.136 --> 00:03:07.690
A lot of that is because
at the time, at Google,

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.470
we were launching a lot of
new products in early 2000.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.220
So lucky to just be able
to move on to new products

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.186
that they were launching,

00:03:17.186 --> 00:03:21.055
After almost 10
years at Google, if I

00:03:21.055 --> 00:03:22.430
was going to
continue to be here,

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.290
I wanted to be
working on something

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.255
that was very audacious,
and a little bit scary.

00:03:30.255 --> 00:03:33.460
And launching a new fiber
network seemed to kind of fit

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.600
that description, right?

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.066
So it's not an easy
problem to solve.

00:03:41.066 --> 00:03:43.060
And we're chipping away at it.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.470
So I'm really excited.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.250
I've learned a ton about
the TV business and internet

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.980
and fiber.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.742
So it's really kept me excited
to keep learning all this time.

00:03:51.742 --> 00:03:53.700
JEREMY STERN: What do
you do on the Fiber team?

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.990
SHALUINN FULLOVE: I sit on
the business development team.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.739
And I work in the
strategy and operations.

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.080
I work closely with
yourself and Irv

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.220
and the content licensing
team to better understand

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.370
what we've signed up
for on the deal side,

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.450
and help product and
engineering understand

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.410
how to built a roadmap
around those obligations.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.010
JEREMY STERN: So you're a full
time Googler, a full time mom.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.880
How do you find time to be
a world-- how in the world

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.840
do you find time to become
a world class marathoner?

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.090
SHALUINN FULLOVE: Well it's
not certainly not just me.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.997
My husband, who's
here, who's also

00:04:28.997 --> 00:04:31.413
a Googler, who's been at
Google as long as I have,

00:04:31.413 --> 00:04:34.090
maybe longer, we're
definitely a team effort.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.550
There's a ton of
people that help us

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.340
get everything done every day.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.180
The schedule is every
day a game of Jenga

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.725
about who's going
to work out when,

00:04:42.725 --> 00:04:44.800
who's going to take
Elise to school,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.830
what's dinner going to be like.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.160
We have help at home
too, which is great.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.150
But we work together.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.020
And it's a lot of working out
on the bookends of the day.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.440
But I do get a chance to
work out at work a lot.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.320
There's a great group of mostly
guys, the Mountain View Lunch

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.490
Run Group.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.156
They're not watching
right now, probably

00:05:04.156 --> 00:05:06.530
because they're on a run.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.510
So sometimes I'm able
to get into running

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.160
during the workday.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.360
JEREMY STERN: So the
race on Saturday,

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.340
February 13th, to qualify
for the US Olympic team,

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.590
it's Saturday in Los Angeles.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.060
Tell us a little bit about the
Olympic qualifying process.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.018
SHALUINN FULLOVE: Sure.

00:05:23.018 --> 00:05:25.720
So there's basically two
standards that get set.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.790
The Olympic standard is set
by the International Olympic

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.170
Committee, and then
individual countries

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.760
have their own standard.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.530
So initially, the Olympic
standard was 2:43,

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.330
and for the US, we
usually have a time that's

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.675
equal to the Olympic standard.

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:43.050
So if you've met
the US standard,

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.175
then you've automatically
met the Olympic standard,

00:05:45.175 --> 00:05:47.849
so you already have that,
at least for the marathon.

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:49.390
It's a little bit
different in track.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.610
So initially the
standard was 2:43,

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.050
and I just missed the standard.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:01.031
I ran 2:43:33 in 2013,
so just by like a little

00:06:01.031 --> 00:06:03.280
over a second in the mile I
missed the standard, which

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.970
was a little bit heartbreaking.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.010
But I ran a good race, and
I was happy about that.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.630
And so then in 2015,
I went and ran 2:41

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.680
and hit the 2:43 standard.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.960
And then two days later, my
family and I were in Hawaii,

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.880
and the Olympic
committee announced

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.450
that they'd changed the
standard to two minutes slower,

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.656
so they changed
it to 2:45, which

00:06:26.656 --> 00:06:28.030
is great news for
a lot of women,

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.961
because that meant they just
qualified for Olympic trials.

00:06:31.961 --> 00:06:32.460
Sorry.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.410
The Olympic committee
changed it to 2:45,

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.120
and then the US committee
a couple days later

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.320
agreed to change
it again to 2:45

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.350
to meet the Olympic standard.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.707
So it's a little bit
unusual this year.

00:06:44.707 --> 00:06:45.665
Initially, it was 2:43.

00:06:45.665 --> 00:06:46.354
Now it's 2:45.

00:06:46.354 --> 00:06:48.020
JEREMY STERN: Does
that mean there'll be

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.600
more women racing on Saturday?

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.980
SHALUINN FULLOVE:
So I think something

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.990
like eight new qualifiers were
allowed to come into the race

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.500
after they moved the standard
back about two minutes, which

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.950
is great news all in all.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:04.020
And then on Saturday,
the way it works

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.470
is there's a little less
than 200 people in the men's

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.270
and women's race, and
the top three finishers

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.160
will be the US Olympic
team that goes to Rio,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.510
and the fourth place finisher
will be the alternate.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:21.590
So it's a very
democratic process.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.565
Yeah.

00:07:23.565 --> 00:07:25.940
JEREMY STERN: Where is the
race taking place on Saturday?

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.880
SHALUINN FULLOVE: It
is down by LA Live.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.280
It's roughly a five-loop course.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.290
There's a two-mile
loop to begin with,

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.020
and then we do
four by six miles.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.060
So it's a very
spectator-friendly course.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.393
JEREMY STERN: So it's different.

00:07:40.393 --> 00:07:43.010
The big LA Marathon
is Sunday, and that's

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:44.650
from Dodger Stadium to the sea.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:45.760
SHALUINN FULLOVE: Right.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.176
JEREMY STERN: Not
a straight line,

00:07:47.176 --> 00:07:50.024
but A to B. This is a completely
different course than that.

00:07:50.024 --> 00:07:50.940
SHALUINN FULLOVE: Yep.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.282
It's definitely set up for
spectators to see a lot of us,

00:07:54.282 --> 00:07:55.740
and it's not even
like a real loop.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.115
It's almost like
an out and back.

00:07:57.115 --> 00:08:00.890
So we'll be able to see a lot
of the spectators quite a bit,

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.780
which is nice for
such a long race.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.370
JEREMY STERN: So have
you studied the course?

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.200
How do you prepare for
a particular race course

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.731
when you're getting your
game set, game mind going?

00:08:11.731 --> 00:08:14.230
SHALUINN FULLOVE: They've had
a really good interactive maps

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.729
online.

00:08:14.729 --> 00:08:16.555
They posted that awhile ago.

00:08:16.555 --> 00:08:20.800
They didn't finalize the
course until not too long ago,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.384
and they've had a
couple opportunities

00:08:22.384 --> 00:08:24.841
for you to come down around
the course with some officials,

00:08:24.841 --> 00:08:27.360
and I think I will probably try
to do a couple shakeout runs

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.350
on Thursday and Friday.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.600
JEREMY STERN: Step back and
tell us about your journey

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.720
to this incredible day.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.789
This isn't your first
Olympic trial, right?

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:36.789
SHALUINN FULLOVE: Right.

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:38.530
I qualified in 2008.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.062
JEREMY STERN: So tell us
about your prior efforts.

00:08:42.062 --> 00:08:44.020
SHALUINN FULLOVE: Yeah,
so I qualified in 2008,

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.103
and they were in Boston,
which was really special.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.780
In 2005, I was diagnosed
with thyroid cancer

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.270
and overcame that.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.200
It took about a year, so
I had to overtake that,

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.500
and it went really well.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.090
I had great doctors,
but personally, I

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:03.556
felt like I wanted to prove that
I was like the same or better

00:09:03.556 --> 00:09:04.930
than I was before
I got diagnosed

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:06.910
with this horrible disease.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:10.540
And I decided I was going
to take some audacious goal

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.259
to prove that I had come
back stronger from that,

00:09:13.259 --> 00:09:14.800
and qualifying for
the Olympic trials

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.250
marathon was what I chose.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.760
JEREMY STERN: That's
pretty extraordinary.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.820
SHALUINN FULLOVE: So
it was a hard road.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:25.670
I had three attempts, and I
qualified just seven weeks

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.210
before the actual
Olympic trials in 2008

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.662
at the Napa Valley marathon,
so I had seven weeks

00:09:30.662 --> 00:09:31.870
to turn around and come back.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:35.590
And it was a great day, and
to have it be in Boston,

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.150
which is such a marathon
mecca-- Joanie Samuelson

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.637
was in the race that year.

00:09:40.637 --> 00:09:42.970
I actually ended up running
a lot of the race just ahead

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:46.420
of her, but Boston went
crazy every time she came by.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.420
So I felt like I had
support the whole time,

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.690
and every time we
came down Boylston,

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:54.190
because it was a
four-loop course,

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.189
so we came down
Boylston four times,

00:09:56.189 --> 00:09:57.730
and the crowds were
just going crazy.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.646
It was the day before
the Boston Marathon too,

00:09:59.646 --> 00:10:01.830
so it was a really
great experience.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:05.029
And then I stepped out of
2012, because I was still

00:10:05.029 --> 00:10:05.820
on maternity leave.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.864
I had a little baby,
and I decided, well,

00:10:09.864 --> 00:10:11.030
I wanted to go for it again.

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.830
So eight years later I
decided to tackle it.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.682
JEREMY STERN: What
inspired you to do it?

00:10:15.682 --> 00:10:16.890
SHALUINN FULLOVE: To do 2016?

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.044
JEREMY STERN: 2016.

00:10:19.044 --> 00:10:20.960
SHALUINN FULLOVE: I think
you did it one time,

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.330
and you kind of want to say,
OK, did I just get lucky,

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:24.530
or was it just a fluke?

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:25.450
Do I still have it?

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:30.670
I think the time was
three minutes faster,

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:34.930
and I was going to be eight
years older, and I thought,

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.599
that seems like a
really hard goal.

00:10:36.599 --> 00:10:37.224
I should just--

00:10:37.224 --> 00:10:38.100
JEREMY STERN: An audacious goal.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.170
SHALUINN FULLOVE: Maybe I
should just go for it and see.

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.753
Sure, maybe I wouldn't get it,
but maybe I'd get pretty close.

00:10:42.753 --> 00:10:47.010
And in 2013, I mean, I just
missed it by 33 seconds,

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.610
so I was like, I
have to try again.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:55.700
So I was injured in 2014,
and I tore my hamstring

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.330
in early 2015.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.690
So there's definitely been
some challenges along the way,

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:07.620
but I can be bullheaded at
times when it's helpful.

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:10.055
JEREMY STERN: So the race
in December in Sacramento--

00:11:10.055 --> 00:11:11.010
is that where it was?

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:15.200
The California
International Marathon.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.940
Your personal record,
extraordinary result--

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.957
tell us a little bit about that
race and the experience of what

00:11:23.957 --> 00:11:24.790
it was like for you.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:25.470
SHALUINN FULLOVE: Sure.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:26.850
I was really nervous that week.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.340
The training had
gone really well,

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.870
but I was really nervous,
because the couple

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.380
years before when I ran it,
it was a really hard day.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.960
It was 27 degrees, and I had
all of this horrible memory

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.070
of like-- I mean the
last mile and a half,

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:42.410
I was losing my vision.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.560
It was just horrible.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.454
So even though I
was fit this time,

00:11:45.454 --> 00:11:46.870
you just think
about how much it's

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:50.360
going to hurt, that last 5K.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.130
But my friends were
really supportive

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:53.260
and keeping my spirits up.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.190
My coach is fantastic.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.530
And basically, the gun went
off, and you're just kind of

00:11:58.530 --> 00:11:59.553
out there.

00:11:59.553 --> 00:12:03.050
In full honesty, I was kind
of grumpy the first 10 miles.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:07.980
It was rainy, and it was dark,
and I was just like, oh, gosh.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.610
It was crowded, and
all the water stops

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:13.091
are crowded, because we
hadn't strung out yet.

00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:15.090
There were two pace groups,
and we were all kind

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.180
of just one at that time.

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.900
But I remember at
like 10K, I kind of

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:26.480
was in a group kind of settling
in [INAUDIBLE] in chunks.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.280
So after the first 10
miles, like 11 to 15

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.120
is kind of the roll-y part, and
by that time, I'm like, well,

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.030
I'm out here.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:35.520
So we're just going to be out
here and see what happens.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.640
And 16 to 20, you get
a nice little downhill,

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.590
and I was feeling
good at that point.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:43.900
I just remember my coach
saying, get to 20 under control,

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:48.310
because you can really open up
that last 10K if you feel good.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.730
And after 20, I just kept
waiting for the wall.

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:53.160
I kept thinking about two
years before, where I just was

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.290
like dying and like
losing my vision.

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:00.910
But it never came, and
I couldn't believe it.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.620
And actually my fastest
mile was mile 26.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:08.210
I ran a 5:54 last mile, and I
just was gunning it for home.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:12.770
And at mile 26, one of my best
training partner friends was

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:14.380
like, you've got to go now.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.440
And I had my Garmin
on, and I knew

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.710
I was averaging like
6:10, 6:11, and I

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:20.460
was like, I think I got it.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:25.460
But I needed to
run 6:13s or 6:12s,

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.550
so we were at like 6:10
or 6:11 the whole time,

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:29.967
and I had picked it up
the last three miles.

00:13:29.967 --> 00:13:32.050
But she was screaming at
me like I didn't have it,

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:33.450
and I had to run 400 meters.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:34.965
So I just started
running as hard

00:13:34.965 --> 00:13:37.360
as I could, which was great
because I dipped right

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.820
under 2:42, which was great.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.690
JEREMY STERN: That's
extraordinary.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:49.560
So to get to that level of being
able to run at a 6:10, 6:11

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:55.090
pace for 26 miles, there's
a lot of endurance athletes

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:58.269
in this office
and across Google.

00:13:58.269 --> 00:14:00.310
Tell us a little bit about
your training regimen.

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:06.410
What was it like and how did
you set your training regimen up

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:09.590
to hit that goal?

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:11.600
SHALUINN FULLOVE: My
coach is fantastic.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.700
He's really a
marathon specialist.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.940
His name's Michael
McKeeman, and I've

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.090
been training with him
for about three years.

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:20.830
And his training is very
different than any training

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:21.509
I did before.

00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:23.050
So in college, I
was middle distance.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:23.820
I loved the track.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.760
I loved my 400s, maybe
some I'll repeat.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.220
His training is
nothing like that.

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.410
His training is a lot of
tempo work, a lot of grindy,

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.605
sit in it race simulations.

00:14:36.605 --> 00:14:38.670
So we do a ton of tempo.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:42.130
All of my long runs have
marathon pace integrated

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:47.390
into it, so the hardest long
run I'll do is 22 miles,

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:51.850
and the last eight to
10 are at marathon pace.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.840
So we do a lot of that work,
so when the race comes,

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.120
you feel very familiar
with what is going on.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.712
And you're tapered,
so you feel great.

00:14:59.712 --> 00:15:01.170
JEREMY STERN: So
do you start out--

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.390
I mean, how many
miles a week-- You're

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:04.650
six months out from the race.

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:06.192
How many miles a
week do you run?

00:15:06.192 --> 00:15:08.400
SHALUINN FULLOVE: I'm actually
relatively low mileage

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.108
for a marathoner.

00:15:09.108 --> 00:15:11.800
I never go over 75 miles
a week, but all the work

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.602
we do during the week
is very high quality.

00:15:15.602 --> 00:15:17.060
So I don't do a
lot of double days.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:20.740
I do one double day a week,
and it's only three miles.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.360
But I do a lot of tempo work.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.799
But all the work
is a progression.

00:15:23.799 --> 00:15:25.840
JEREMY STERN: I'm just
doing the math in my mind.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.180
That's more than 10 miles a day.

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.330
I get tired thinking about that.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.663
SHALUINN FULLOVE: Well, a lot
of women that'll be racing

00:15:33.663 --> 00:15:34.640
is on Saturday.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.940
They run 100 to 140-mile weeks.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.960
I mean, their full
time job is to run.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.270
But I find that at
75 miles, things

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:44.020
start to get a little
frayed on the edges,

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.210
and I don't feel-- you
start to risk injury.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:50.200
We do a lot of high
quality tempo work.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.700
I told him after
this race, whatever

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.770
the next race we do, it has to
require a lot of 400 repeats,

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:58.162
because I don't want to do a
lot of tempo work for awhile.

00:15:58.162 --> 00:15:59.620
But it's always a
progression, so I

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.050
don't start trying at 22
miles and every other week we

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:02.570
alternate.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:06.110
So if it's not a
tempo long run, we'll

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:09.140
do it so that the last half is
alternating like an easy mile,

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.090
a race pace mile.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:15.050
Those are his easy long runs.

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:17.870
JEREMY STERN: What
else besides running?

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.030
Do you add any other
fitness into your program?

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:25.410
SHALUINN FULLOVE: I do a
little bit of yoga and Pilates.

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:29.730
I have recently learned that
my core needs a lot more work,

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:32.910
so I've been trying to integrate
a little bit more of that,

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:36.970
especially after
having a kid and just

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.171
being a little bit older.

00:16:39.171 --> 00:16:42.860
You really need to focus
on that strong core.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.290
JEREMY STERN: So
what about diet?

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:51.830
Do you have a program for
maintaining your metabolism

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:57.840
and your physiology for
maximum race performance?

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.180
SHALUINN FULLOVE: The one
thing about marathon training

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.226
is carbs.

00:17:02.226 --> 00:17:05.259
You have to have a
lot of carbs, so--

00:17:05.259 --> 00:17:07.300
JEREMY STERN: There are
good carbs and bad carbs.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:07.550
SHALUINN FULLOVE:
Yeah, when you're

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:10.609
marathon training though,
it's just kind of all carbs.

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:12.400
You can eat all the
stuff that they usually

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.220
tell you not to eat, because
you're going to burn it up,

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.440
and your body uses that fuel.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.295
So I don't spend a ton of
time like measuring food,

00:17:19.295 --> 00:17:20.670
but I just try to
think generally

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:22.630
to make sure I'm
getting that protein.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.780
I do think a lot about what I
eat immediately after the runs.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:29.900
I found that if after a really
long hard workout or long run,

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:33.000
if I am able to get a
protein shake within 30

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.688
minutes of finishing, it goes a
long way to helping me recover.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:43.370
JEREMY STERN: So what are
some of the sacrifices

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:44.340
along the way?

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.440
I mean, it's a marathon.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.164
It's a long preparation course.

00:17:50.164 --> 00:17:52.080
What are some of the
sacrifices that you have?

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.700
SHALUINN FULLOVE: Probably a
better question for my family,

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.783
since they have to put up
with every weekend being

00:17:55.783 --> 00:17:58.920
a long run, and my
husband bikes with me,

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.700
and he pulls the
buggy with a leash,

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.085
and they laid at the
three-mile mark with my water,

00:18:03.085 --> 00:18:07.730
so their weekends are kind of
taken up with Mommy's running.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:10.189
But I don't really
see the sacrifices.

00:18:10.189 --> 00:18:11.480
I'm really focused on the goal.

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:18.820
I had my 15-year Stanford
reunion during the buildup,

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:22.690
so I had to miss a couple
of the things there.

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:25.830
But my roommates on the team,
they definitely understand.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.717
They're so supportive.

00:18:27.717 --> 00:18:29.300
I don't really think
about sacrifices.

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.060
I just think these
are the things

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.600
you have to do if you're
going to get your goal.

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:42.870
JEREMY STERN: One
of the things you're

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:48.420
mentioned in one of your
races like almost losing

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.600
your vision at the end, is
there's an extraordinary amount

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.890
of suffering and
endurance racing,

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:59.300
whether it's open water
swimming or running or biking

00:18:59.300 --> 00:18:59.850
or triathlon.

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:05.490
How do you prepare
your mind for that?

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:11.430
I mean, a lot of
endurance athletes

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:13.760
that have written or
spoken about the subject

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.900
say there's a huge
part of the mind

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.900
game in terms of preparing.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:23.150
So tell us about that, both
in training and racing.

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:24.390
SHALUINN FULLOVE: Yep.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.895
The mental game is
huge, definitely,

00:19:26.895 --> 00:19:28.880
especially when you're
putting your body,

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.770
pushing your body to its max.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.685
And I think one
of the reasons why

00:19:32.685 --> 00:19:34.560
I was able to improve
so much in the marathon

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.542
over the last three years is
the training that I was doing,

00:19:37.542 --> 00:19:39.750
not only physically where
we're obviously stimulating

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.980
the right system in those long
runs and those tempo efforts,

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.734
but you're really getting your
mind into that hurt zone, where

00:19:45.734 --> 00:19:47.650
you're like, how am I
going to deal with this?

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:50.840
And there were definitely-- the
night before these long runs,

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:51.890
I'm emailing my coach.

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:53.885
I'm like, oh, I don't know.

00:19:53.885 --> 00:19:55.830
And after three weeks
in a row of that,

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:57.996
you're kind of like, god,
I feel kind of burned out.

00:19:57.996 --> 00:20:00.310
But I think mentally it's
training that mental muscle

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:01.480
to get prepared for that.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:05.696
And I think sometimes you
break it into smaller chunks.

00:20:05.696 --> 00:20:07.590
So like I did this year at CIM.

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:10.770
It was like the first 10 miles
and 11 to 15, and 16 to 20,

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:12.850
so it was little baby
steps to get there.

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:15.379
I think on Saturday,
having it be a loop course,

00:20:15.379 --> 00:20:16.920
I'll be doing a lot
of that, so like,

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.086
can I get the two-mile loop?

00:20:18.086 --> 00:20:19.542
Can I get the first
six-mile loop?

00:20:19.542 --> 00:20:21.250
And I'm just taking
it one step at a time

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:27.060
and really not trying to consume
the whole 26 miles at once.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.940
I think also having
teammates and training

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.365
partners is critical.

00:20:30.365 --> 00:20:31.740
Some of these
workouts are almost

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.410
impossible to do by
yourself, but I've

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:36.570
been really fortunate to
loop in some Googlers,

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:39.004
some of the guys on
the MV lunch run,

00:20:39.004 --> 00:20:41.510
and some old teammates
of mine from Stanford

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.770
have been able to
come out and help.

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:47.280
So it's not one silver bullet.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.535
It's a lock in the mental game.

00:20:50.535 --> 00:20:53.880
But I actually read the
book, "Flow," this buildup

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.130
of the CIM, which is really
helpful to think about how

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.565
to get in this flow state,
where you're effortlessly

00:20:58.565 --> 00:21:02.110
losing yourself in the
moment and thinking about not

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:08.190
pushing too hard but trying
to find some flow, fluidity.

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:12.900
JEREMY STERN: So have you
ever felt that flow in a race?

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:18.520
I mean, because
clearly, there are

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:22.033
barriers, physical and
mental and weather.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.809
Have you felt that flow, and
how do you keep yourself there?

00:21:27.809 --> 00:21:30.350
SHALUINN FULLOVE: Yeah, I think
sometimes it comes in spurts,

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:31.660
especially in the marathon.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:35.180
I wasn't feeling any flow the
first 10K to 10 miles at CIM.

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:38.026
I was like, I'd rather be doing
almost anything else right now

00:21:38.026 --> 00:21:40.280
than doing these first 10 miles.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.950
But yeah, kind of
in the middle, you

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:45.030
start to kind of-- your
body starts to remember.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:46.420
You realize you're here.

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.770
You're working with people.

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:51.620
You realize you're
getting closer.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.030
I was holding back a
little bit that last 10K,

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:57.090
because I was bracing myself for
the wall to hit me pretty hard.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.460
But then with the last 5K,
I realized it wasn't coming,

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.043
and I really just
needed to go for it,

00:22:01.043 --> 00:22:05.060
so I started to embrace
it and really push.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:08.890
But the truth is there are more
races where you don't feel flow

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:09.740
than when you do.

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:14.750
So when you feel it, you really
embrace it and try to enjoy it.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.680
But more times than
not, you're grinding.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.180
It's hard.

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:18.810
It's going to hurt.

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:23.990
JEREMY STERN: So I guess the
opposite of flow is suffer.

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:29.360
How do you-- you're
suffering at mile 15.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.990
What inspires you, and how
do you-- because it's not

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:34.530
just your legs and arms moving.

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:37.720
It's your mind, again, taking
it back to the mental game.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.680
How do you pull
yourself out of that?

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.620
SHALUINN FULLOVE: You've
got to stay positive.

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.453
In the marathon, it's
going to ebb and flow.

00:22:44.453 --> 00:22:47.950
Mile 15 could feel horrible,
and then mile 16 and 17,

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:50.000
you could feel like
a million bucks.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.320
So I think you just really
have to tell yourself

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.330
this is going to pass.

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:55.746
One of the things
we do in yoga is

00:22:55.746 --> 00:22:57.710
you notice when you're
uncomfortable and acknowledge

00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:59.710
that I don't feel great, and
I'm going to let go of it,

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.430
and I'm going to
keep moving forward.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:03.900
You just have to keep
pressing and believing that.

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.116
You've train for this.

00:23:05.116 --> 00:23:06.240
Other people are suffering.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.500
We're working together.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:11.510
Just keep getting to the
next mile and next mile.

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:14.650
But the reality is
the running, it hurts.

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:16.200
Racing hurts, and
it's not hurting,

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.600
you're probably not doing it
right, so you kind of just

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.491
have to accept that
it's going to hurt.

00:23:20.491 --> 00:23:20.990
Admit to it.

00:23:24.985 --> 00:23:26.110
You can't run away from it.

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:29.020
If you don't want to hurt, you
probably shouldn't try to race

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:30.080
or do running.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.800
You should probably
do something else.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.746
I coach a high school
team in Palo Alto,

00:23:33.746 --> 00:23:36.432
and we talk a lot
about the pain cave.

00:23:36.432 --> 00:23:37.390
JEREMY STERN: What is--

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:38.931
SHALUINN FULLOVE:
The pain cave, it's

00:23:38.931 --> 00:23:41.420
like how the deeper you go
in the pain cave, that's

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.390
how you reintroduce yourself
to like new stimulus

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:46.850
and new pain, and throughout
the course of the season,

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:49.535
we talk about how we've already
gotten this far into the pain

00:23:49.535 --> 00:23:51.910
cave, so now this time, we're
going to try to go further,

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:52.980
and by the time we get
to the championship,

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:55.605
we're going to commit ourselves
to going the deepest we've ever

00:23:55.605 --> 00:23:57.237
been into that pain cave.

00:23:57.237 --> 00:23:59.320
So it works for the high
school girls [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.310
They like it.

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:08.520
JEREMY STERN: What has been
the most challenging part

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:13.155
of maintaining this level
of performance for so long?

00:24:13.155 --> 00:24:15.030
SHALUINN FULLOVE: I
think I've been fortunate

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:18.860
that if you mapped
it in broad strokes,

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.410
it's been a really
nice progression.

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:22.980
So I came out of college being
a middle distance runner.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:25.480
My coach, my marathon
coach initially, we

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.850
did a ton of track
work, so that felt

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:28.990
like a natural progression.

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:32.180
And now I'm with a new
coach who does a lot

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.580
of marathon-specific training.

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:34.790
I don't think right
out of college

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:36.581
I could have jumped
right into the training

00:24:36.581 --> 00:24:39.430
that I'm doing now, and
I've been fortunate enough

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:42.910
to not have many
injuries along the way.

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:45.990
I've had a couple just
in the last two years,

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:48.420
but I've been able to
overcome those as well.

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.210
So it's been a
natural progression.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:50.740
I love it.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:54.150
I have a ton of
friends that do it.

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:56.735
Stanford actually
has upwards of nine

00:24:56.735 --> 00:24:59.540
or 10 athletes that are going
to be competing on Saturday,

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.565
so it's been really great just
after all this time to still

00:25:02.565 --> 00:25:05.032
have that camaraderie
from the Stanford team.

00:25:07.772 --> 00:25:09.230
JEREMY STERN: Do
you have any words

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:14.280
of wisdom for the endurance
athletes here in this audience

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:21.240
and in our TV audience
on how to keep going,

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.620
how to keep inspired?

00:25:24.973 --> 00:25:26.431
SHALUINN FULLOVE:
I don't know if I

00:25:26.431 --> 00:25:29.430
have a lot of words of wisdom
or inspiration to share.

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:33.790
But I think for me, being
surrounded by teammates

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:37.786
and training partners is
like the number one thing.

00:25:37.786 --> 00:25:39.784
I run for an all women's team.

00:25:39.784 --> 00:25:42.060
They're actually an apparel
brand named Oiselle.

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.730
We have the most women at
the trials on Saturday.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:47.880
We have 18 women who
qualify, and being

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.770
a part of that
community has pushed me

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:54.990
and helped me reignite
a fire for this sport

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:57.380
that I've been doing since
I was-- I've been competing

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.200
since I was five years old.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:02.570
But it's been so amazing to be
surrounded by so many women who

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:06.172
are-- we have at least woman
who has a really good chance

00:26:06.172 --> 00:26:06.880
to make the team.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.750
She made the team
in 2012-- to women

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:13.480
who just run on the weekend, and
we all on social or at meetups

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:19.170
support each other equally,
which is fantastic.

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:22.195
For me personally, having
a coach is critical.

00:26:22.195 --> 00:26:24.070
There is no way I could
write a training plan

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:27.450
and be a mom and work, so
having a coach that I can really

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:31.370
trust who's invested in me
and who I can just fully trust

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:33.316
the process with is important.

00:26:35.942 --> 00:26:37.650
JEREMY STERN: What
are qualities that you

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:40.492
look for in your coach?

00:26:40.492 --> 00:26:41.700
SHALUINN FULLOVE: It's funny.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.280
So I was friends with friend
with-- Michael McKeeman

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.190
is my coach.

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:48.320
I was friends with him from
another training partner

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.080
of mine, and I literally was
wishing him happy birthday

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.897
on Facebook on his
wall, and then realized

00:26:52.897 --> 00:26:53.980
that he was also coaching.

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:56.240
And I just said,
will you coach me?

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.430
And he was like, sure.

00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:01.060
But he has amazing experience.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:04.690
He actually was Deena
Kastor's training partner

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:05.960
for many years up in Mammoth.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.160
She's an American record holder,
so we spent a ton of time

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:13.740
learning from some of the best
marathon coaches in the US.

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:16.200
So someone who just has
a ton of experience,

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:20.540
someone who understands me
as a whole person, not just

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:21.270
an athlete.

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:23.617
I think sometimes
it's easy for coaches

00:27:23.617 --> 00:27:25.200
to just think about
you as an athlete,

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.660
but he respects that
I work full time,

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:33.809
that I have parental duties,
but he doesn't let me back down

00:27:33.809 --> 00:27:36.100
from trying to go for these
really big audacious goals.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:40.720
So he doesn't pull back my
workouts just because I work

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.219
and be a mom, which is great.

00:27:42.219 --> 00:27:44.010
JEREMY STERN: What's
your favorite workout?

00:27:47.915 --> 00:27:49.290
SHALUINN FULLOVE:
I love porters,

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:51.012
which I don't have
to do very much when

00:27:51.012 --> 00:27:53.630
I'm doing marathon training.

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:57.610
But the best workout
leading into the marathon,

00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:01.370
we build up to a
12-mile tempo run, where

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:04.870
the first 400 of every
mile is at about 10K pace,

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:07.370
and the last 1,200
is at marathon pace.

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:09.960
And what's awesome about
that is it breaks it up,

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.900
so you kind of start
to think about, oh,

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:16.067
I'm just doing 400s with
a 1,200-meter recovery,

00:28:16.067 --> 00:28:17.400
but you end up running 12 miles.

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.275
I think I did this two
weeks before the race,

00:28:19.275 --> 00:28:24.780
and I did 12 miles at
6:05 pace in practice,

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.050
which we did it at Google
with Matt Cook, who's

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:28.180
a fellow Googler.

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:31.805
And when you nail that
workout, you feel really good.

00:28:31.805 --> 00:28:32.680
I emailed my coaches.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.346
I can't believe I
just did that workout.

00:28:34.346 --> 00:28:37.980
You know you're ready to race.

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.670
JEREMY STERN: Before
I open the floor up

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:44.350
for questions from
the audience, let

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:49.430
me ask you some fun questions.

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:50.916
SHALUINN FULLOVE: OK.

00:28:50.916 --> 00:28:53.040
JEREMY STERN: So we talked
a little bit about diet.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.310
Sounds kind of flexible,
but did you ever

00:28:55.310 --> 00:29:03.070
cheat on your diet in the
lead-up to this big race?

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:08.000
SHALUINN FULLOVE: I think around
Thanksgiving and my birthday,

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.070
I think we went up
to Napa to celebrate,

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:13.040
and I think maybe I
had a little more wine

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.468
than I normally would.

00:29:14.468 --> 00:29:15.928
You've got to stay
hydrated, so I

00:29:15.928 --> 00:29:18.160
try not to drink too much
wine while I'm building up.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.560
But I'm a big believer
in treating yourself,

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:25.340
so after big workouts--
like every weekend,

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.830
I go to the same restaurant
and get a big stack of pancakes

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:30.230
and butter and syrup
and all that stuff.

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:34.750
But yeah, I don't
cheat too much.

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:37.300
JEREMY STERN: So what's
your favorite food

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.420
after finishing the race?

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.111
Where are you going
to go after this race?

00:29:42.111 --> 00:29:43.944
SHALUINN FULLOVE: That's
a popular question.

00:29:43.944 --> 00:29:45.568
So one of my favorite
restaurants in LA

00:29:45.568 --> 00:29:48.610
is Rustic Canyon,
and they have--

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:51.970
or they at least used
to have a great burger.

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:53.070
It's not on the menu.

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:55.890
If you ask for it, they
have it, and it's delicious.

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:58.890
And I booked that reservation
like the day after I qualified,

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:03.530
so we're going to Rustic
Canyon on Saturday night.

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:06.350
JEREMY STERN: Tell us about
your funniest race or training

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:10.150
experience, if there can
be a funny race or training

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:11.726
experience in a marathon.

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:15.620
SHALUINN FULLOVE: I
don't know it's funny,

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:20.070
but in 2008-- I mentioned this
a little bit earlier-- in Boston

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:22.510
at the trials, I was
running basically

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:26.570
just a couple meters ahead of
Joanie Samuelson the whole way.

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:29.320
And I thought, oh, maybe-- I
don't know what I was thinking.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.200
Of course, she's going to
just be as strong as nails

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.366
and be there the whole time.

00:30:32.366 --> 00:30:36.110
But she just kept being
there, and it came down

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:39.260
to like the last 400 meters,
and we're on Boylston,

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:41.580
and the crowd is going crazy.

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:47.110
There's a giant screen on
the road, and I look up,

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:48.890
and I can see her
like behind me,

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:52.410
and she is just crushing
like the last 200 meters.

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:55.680
I had to run a 38-second
last 200 meters just to not

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:59.886
get caught by Joanie, who I
think broke the 50-year-old age

00:30:59.886 --> 00:31:01.530
group record that day.

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:03.990
So I remember just
running for my life trying

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:05.940
to not-- in my
mind, I'm like, I'm

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:07.850
going to be a gold
medalist in the marathon.

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:11.252
But obviously,
that was not real.

00:31:11.252 --> 00:31:12.210
That really did happen.

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:15.560
I have awesome photos from the
Jumbotron on Boylston of that.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.080
JEREMY STERN:
That's pretty cool.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:21.370
So let me turn it
over to the audience.

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:23.780
Anybody have any
questions for Shal?

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:27.585
Please join us at
the microphone.

00:31:27.585 --> 00:31:31.140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] do
a race, what do you do?

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:32.940
What's your schedule
like, and long

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:35.945
does it take to
recover and everything?

00:31:35.945 --> 00:31:37.861
SHALUINN FULLOVE: I
usually take about a month

00:31:37.861 --> 00:31:39.650
where I'm doing
just almost nothing

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:42.900
of very unstructured work.

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:45.235
I usually like to go to
Hawaii right after marathons.

00:31:45.235 --> 00:31:48.270
I don't like to run in Hawaii,
so I like to go like the week

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:50.490
afterwards, and we
just kind of veg out.

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:52.810
So we actually did that
after CIM this year.

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:55.015
We went for a week and
just hung out on the beach.

00:31:55.015 --> 00:31:57.753
And then the next three weeks
is just very unstructured,

00:31:57.753 --> 00:31:59.022
staying loose.

00:31:59.022 --> 00:32:01.370
And then it's a very
gradual buildup again.

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:05.514
We don't hit it very hard
probably for another few weeks.

00:32:05.514 --> 00:32:07.920
This time was a little bit
different and for '08 too,

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.128
because I had seven weeks
between '08 and the trials,

00:32:10.128 --> 00:32:12.845
and this time I had 10.

00:32:12.845 --> 00:32:16.842
So we didn't have as much
downtime as we wanted to.

00:32:16.842 --> 00:32:19.300
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned that
some of the Olympics trials

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:21.580
seemed to take place
the day before one

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:25.065
of the large marathons, so is
there some reason why they've

00:32:25.065 --> 00:32:26.885
been avoiding the
crowds that just

00:32:26.885 --> 00:32:30.950
don't do the trials
on the regular course?

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:34.120
SHALUINN FULLOVE: I
think that it's just

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.150
more spectator-friendly
to have the loops.

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:42.010
There may be a rule, some kind
of international standard rule

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:43.820
that they do it that
way for some reason.

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:47.800
But I think having it the day
before a big race like Boston

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:51.360
or LA, it helps bring a lot of
the fanbase out. [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.960
get huge support.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.400
I suppose they could, but
those races are quite large.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.990
We're talking like
30,000 to 50,000 people,

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:02.470
and there's only going to
be 200 people in this race.

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:04.910
So it's nice that
they kind of create it

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:07.340
as a special kind of
celebration for people

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:08.813
going for the Olympic team.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.080
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.685
Do you have a story
of how your training

00:33:16.685 --> 00:33:23.910
or how running the
marathons has helped

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:26.822
you develop professionally?

00:33:26.822 --> 00:33:27.780
SHALUINN FULLOVE: Sure.

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:29.321
Let me think about
that for a second.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:36.615
I think a lot of the
qualities that you

00:33:36.615 --> 00:33:37.990
develop as an
athlete, especially

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:39.364
being an athlete
your whole life,

00:33:39.364 --> 00:33:42.970
are things that transfer well
into other parts of your life.

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:44.840
So even before I was
a working professional

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.950
being a student athlete,
your dedication, your ability

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:52.130
to stay focused on the goal,
even when things aren't going

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:53.927
perfectly, or you're
in that midspot where

00:33:53.927 --> 00:33:58.040
it's kind of grindy, and
it's not always the most fun.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:01.002
I think also being an
athlete, every time you race,

00:34:01.002 --> 00:34:02.960
there's an opportunity
to win, but there's also

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.130
an opportunity to lose.

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:07.690
And how do you deal with
failure and learn from that

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:09.730
and get up again and go?

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:13.670
And so I think with Google,
we push really hard.

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:15.389
We want to fail
fast, learn, iterate,

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:19.449
and I think being an
athlete, that transfers over.

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:20.679
That's very relatable to me.

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:23.220
It wasn't something that was
new to me when I came to Google.

00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:26.400
I'd been doing that since
I was five years old.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.969
So I think those
elements of being

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:32.010
an athlete transfer really well
into your professional life.

00:34:35.696 --> 00:34:36.570
JEREMY STERN: Please.

00:34:39.272 --> 00:34:39.980
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:41.578
More than one question.

00:34:41.578 --> 00:34:45.469
Do you have a favorite
marathon course?

00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:47.510
SHALUINN FULLOVE: I think
I've run six marathons.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:50.689
I haven't run that many.

00:34:50.689 --> 00:34:54.371
I guess I've run Cal
International the most,

00:34:54.371 --> 00:34:55.954
and it's been the
most friendly to me,

00:34:55.954 --> 00:34:58.684
so I think that's probably
my favorite right now.

00:34:58.684 --> 00:35:00.730
It's close to my
house, and it's fast,

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:02.524
and they do a great
job organizing it.

00:35:02.524 --> 00:35:07.164
But I haven't run that
many, so I run it the most,

00:35:07.164 --> 00:35:09.096
so I guess I would go
with Cal International.

00:35:09.096 --> 00:35:11.028
But anyway, if you're thinking
about doing a marathon,

00:35:11.028 --> 00:35:12.010
it's a fantastic marathon.

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:12.843
They do a great job.

00:35:12.843 --> 00:35:15.310
It's small, well-organized,
and it's fast.

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:30.351
AUDIENCE: Do you have any
advice for people who have never

00:35:30.351 --> 00:35:32.680
done any exercise in
their life but started

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:36.160
doing some running in their
30s or 40s for the first time?

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:39.338
SHALUINN FULLOVE:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:35:39.338 --> 00:35:42.891
I would recommend getting
together with a group.

00:35:42.891 --> 00:35:45.182
It doesn't have to be someone
who has a dedicated coach

00:35:45.182 --> 00:35:47.304
or anything, but there are so
many good running communities

00:35:47.304 --> 00:35:49.200
to just motivate you
and help you and help

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:52.050
you to learn so that you can
kind of go at your own pace

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:53.850
and have fun with it.

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:56.076
I think if it's not fun,
you won't stick with it.

00:35:56.076 --> 00:36:00.170
And the pain part isn't
so much fun all the time,

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:01.970
but it is often
the most rewarding,

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:04.570
so you'll have a team around
you to help you get through that

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:05.070
and push.

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:07.905
So I would recommend trying to
find a local community group

00:36:07.905 --> 00:36:12.049
or even just weekly
runs at shoe stores

00:36:12.049 --> 00:36:13.840
often are very helpful
ways to get started.

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:22.160
Hi, Herb.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.160
AUDIENCE: Did you race
any other distances

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:27.205
competitively,
and then what made

00:36:27.205 --> 00:36:31.190
you transition to start doing
the marathon piece side of it?

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:33.190
SHALUINN FULLOVE:
Yeah, I started

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:34.987
running middle distance.

00:36:34.987 --> 00:36:36.570
JEREMY STERN: What
is middle distance?

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:38.028
SHALUINN FULLOVE:
A middle distance

00:36:38.028 --> 00:36:41.297
is-- so when I was in college,
it was the 1,500 and 3K.

00:36:41.297 --> 00:36:43.380
That was before they had
the 3K steeple for women.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.660
So now they have a 3K steeple,
and then there's the 1,500,

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:49.280
and the 5K is typically
middle distance.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.220
I think I always really
wanted to be a miler.

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:53.160
A mile is such a great distance.

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:58.285
But I think when I
ran my first marathon,

00:36:58.285 --> 00:36:59.660
I just wanted to
tackle something

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.868
that I hadn't done before,
so there was no precedent,

00:37:01.868 --> 00:37:02.910
no comparison point.

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:04.492
The marathon seemed big.

00:37:04.492 --> 00:37:06.075
If you can do that,
you feel like even

00:37:06.075 --> 00:37:08.533
if it wasn't like an awesome
time, you ran a full marathon,

00:37:08.533 --> 00:37:10.337
so that's great.

00:37:10.337 --> 00:37:12.170
I think if you watch a
lot of the people who

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:15.416
are racing on
Saturday, eventually,

00:37:15.416 --> 00:37:16.790
everyone arrives
at the marathon.

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:18.700
Eventually, they just keep
moving up in distance.

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:20.350
If you're a 400-meter
runner in high school,

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:22.350
you're going to run the
eight and 15 in college,

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:27.460
and after college, you're
going to run the five and 10.

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:30.460
So in some ways, you kind of
always end up in the marathon,

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:33.642
but for me, it was just more
of like, can I really do this?

00:37:33.642 --> 00:37:35.095
My training for
the first marathon

00:37:35.095 --> 00:37:37.660
was definitely more
middle distance training.

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:40.690
I thought three by a mile
was like the big workout.

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:44.239
So I survived that marathon,
but I learned that that really

00:37:44.239 --> 00:37:45.434
wasn't marathon raining.

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:56.100
JEREMY STERN: When you were--
what's your fastest mile time

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.090
ever when you were doing--

00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:01.370
SHALUINN FULLOVE: I think I run
the equivalent of like 4:52,

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:06.080
which isn't-- for a miler
is not amazing, but for me,

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.450
it was the best I could do.

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:09.200
Maybe that was also a
reason why I decided

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:09.920
to go back to the marathon.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.260
I realized the mile really
wasn't working out for me.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:13.320
It really wasn't.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.050
It didn't have that turnover.

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:17.682
As much as I loved the
work training for it,

00:38:17.682 --> 00:38:18.890
it really wasn't working out.

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:23.520
JEREMY STERN: So I
remember us talking

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:28.640
about this in terms of
motivation, getting ready,

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.380
and you said to me
once that there's

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.950
nothing like putting
a race on a calendar

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:35.780
to get you motivated to train.

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:49.890
So when you decided
to go for it in 2016,

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:53.720
what were the key dates
for your thinking?

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:56.720
SHALUINN FULLOVE: So I had
an injury in April and May.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.172
I actually had a
torn hamstring, which

00:38:59.172 --> 00:39:03.480
is one of the worst runner
injuries you could probably

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.308
ask for.

00:39:05.308 --> 00:39:06.990
So we had that as
a starting point.

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:10.724
I actually had PRP
to help that repair,

00:39:10.724 --> 00:39:12.140
and so we knew
that that was going

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.598
to be eight to 12 weeks until
I could start training again,

00:39:14.598 --> 00:39:17.240
and then we needed X
amount of time for buildup,

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:20.380
so we're looking
at a fall marathon.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.986
So there were maybe three
marathons that we looked at.

00:39:22.986 --> 00:39:26.033
We thought about Chicago,
which was kind of early, maybe

00:39:26.033 --> 00:39:28.958
Philadelphia, which is
really close to CIM,

00:39:28.958 --> 00:39:30.935
and we just thought,
give us a little bit

00:39:30.935 --> 00:39:33.420
of extra time in case we missed
a couple weeks of training.

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:37.947
And CIM is so close to my
house, so it was actually

00:39:37.947 --> 00:39:39.780
pretty straightforward
to try to figure out,

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:41.180
because we had
some pretty locked

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.819
in time frames
based on the injury

00:39:42.819 --> 00:39:43.860
that we had to work with.

00:39:48.489 --> 00:39:49.280
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:54.200
Thanks for the celebration
in Hawaii and Rustic Canyon.

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:56.470
But what are some of
the rituals that you

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:57.640
go through the morning of?

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.670
It's game day or
right in the moments

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:01.790
before you start, what
are some of the things

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:07.012
that you need to do to
get you in that mindset?

00:40:07.012 --> 00:40:08.470
SHALUINN FULLOVE:
This time around,

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:10.896
I spent a lot of
time journaling.

00:40:10.896 --> 00:40:13.037
I record a lot of my
training on Strava online,

00:40:13.037 --> 00:40:14.120
which is great for visual.

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:19.120
But I've been spending a lot
of time in my Believe journal,

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.010
where I write down a lot
of the qualitative aspects

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:23.400
and write letters to myself.

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.900
And I was really
nervous going into CIM,

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:27.400
because I have a
couple page letter,

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.030
where I was just like
talking to myself,

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:31.660
telling myself to believe.

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:34.160
I spent a lot of time going
back and looking at the workouts

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.752
that I've done to just remember
all the work that you've done

00:40:36.752 --> 00:40:38.793
and that you've actually
prepared for this moment

00:40:38.793 --> 00:40:42.364
and you're ready.

00:40:42.364 --> 00:40:44.784
Other than that, there's
a lot of carbo loading,

00:40:44.784 --> 00:40:46.236
especially as you get
closer to three days out,

00:40:46.236 --> 00:40:47.980
which is fun, so I
try to like constantly

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.900
be eating carbs to the point
where you get to race day,

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.320
and you're like, I don't
want any more carbs.

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.795
I don't want anything that
looks like a carb or tastes

00:40:55.795 --> 00:40:58.010
chewy or anything.

00:40:58.010 --> 00:41:00.640
But the journaling and the
reflection and that piece

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.098
is a really important part.

00:41:02.098 --> 00:41:02.590
That's just the mental game.

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:03.950
There's nothing else
to do physically.

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:05.590
You can only do
harm at that point.

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:13.365
JEREMY STERN: So on race
day, Saturday, you wake up.

00:41:13.365 --> 00:41:14.740
What time is the
race by the way?

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:17.882
SHALUINN FULLOVE: The women's
race I think is at 10:22.

00:41:17.882 --> 00:41:19.840
It's a little bit later
than you would normally

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.650
have for a marathon,
and you guys

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:25.434
are having some hot
weather right now.

00:41:25.434 --> 00:41:29.434
I think the men go at 10:00
and the women go at 10:22,

00:41:29.434 --> 00:41:32.620
so at least I get to
sleep in and like wake up

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:35.609
at a decent hour and have some
breakfast and digestion and all

00:41:35.609 --> 00:41:36.108
that.

00:41:39.186 --> 00:41:40.060
JEREMY STERN: Please.

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:41.814
Any other questions for Shal?

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:47.130
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:48.905
Since your mom is
here, I want to know

00:41:48.905 --> 00:41:50.830
that you run really fast.

00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:55.730
I cannot even think about
running one mile at four

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:56.290
minutes.

00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:58.581
I want to know, where do you
think this is coming from?

00:41:58.581 --> 00:42:03.440
Genes or this is coming from--
your mom run marathons too?

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:06.442
SHALUINN FULLOVE: I come
from a very athletic family,

00:42:06.442 --> 00:42:09.360
but almost everyone in my
family were basketball players.

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.860
Both my parents played
basketball in college.

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:16.150
My brother was a very successful
basketball player at UCSD.

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:22.530
I think my mom started to run
track in college a little bit.

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:24.970
She ran a bunch after
when I was growing up,

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:26.850
which was hugely influential.

00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:28.500
I actually thought
a long jump pit

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:30.815
was a sandbox for the kids
whose parents were running

00:42:30.815 --> 00:42:32.940
on the track. [INAUDIBLE],
and I went to the track,

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:35.866
and I would just go sit in
the long jump pit and play.

00:42:35.866 --> 00:42:38.885
So certainly, I think
genetics for sure, definitely.

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:43.460
AUDIENCE: So besides
marathons, do

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:46.634
you run other professional
sports like, as you said,

00:42:46.634 --> 00:42:49.692
middle distance, 5K, 10K?

00:42:49.692 --> 00:42:51.316
SHALUINN FULLOVE:
The last couple years

00:42:51.316 --> 00:42:52.732
I've been focused
on the marathon,

00:42:52.732 --> 00:42:54.725
but I'm looking
forward to running

00:42:54.725 --> 00:42:58.240
some personal bests and
some shorter distances

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.253
like the 5K and the 10K.

00:43:00.253 --> 00:43:02.512
I've dabbled in
track a little bit,

00:43:02.512 --> 00:43:04.730
but all the track races
right now are college,

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:08.753
and I just feel like an old lady
out there with those college

00:43:08.753 --> 00:43:09.253
athletes.

00:43:09.253 --> 00:43:10.503
So I don't know.

00:43:10.503 --> 00:43:12.211
I'm going to probably
stick to the roads.

00:43:12.211 --> 00:43:13.782
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:13.782 --> 00:43:14.990
SHALUINN FULLOVE: Oh, before?

00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.906
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:22.774 --> 00:43:27.081
So I'm saying when you were
in college, high school,

00:43:27.081 --> 00:43:29.645
did you run other professional
sports like [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:29.645 --> 00:43:32.020
SHALUINN FULLOVE: I did grow
up playing different sports.

00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:33.415
I dabbled in soccer
a little bit.

00:43:33.415 --> 00:43:35.280
That didn't last super long.

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:39.860
I played basketball in high
school for a couple of years.

00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:44.180
I swam my age group when
I was really little,

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:46.820
kind of before high school.

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:49.396
But I've done running
most consistently.

00:43:49.396 --> 00:43:53.075
I put on my first uniform when
I was five or six years old.

00:43:57.035 --> 00:43:58.391
JEREMY STERN: Suzanna.

00:43:58.391 --> 00:44:00.140
AUDIENCE: I have a
longstanding prejudice.

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:05.520
Whenever I hear a marathoner,
I think that person is crazy.

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:09.478
So far, you have gone quite
a ways to dispel that notion,

00:44:09.478 --> 00:44:11.908
but I'm still a
little bit suspicious.

00:44:11.908 --> 00:44:13.852
Can you please explain it to me?

00:44:13.852 --> 00:44:16.179
How are you not crazy/

00:44:16.179 --> 00:44:18.095
SHALUINN FULLOVE: I never
said I wasn't crazy.

00:44:20.792 --> 00:44:22.916
I actually just had this
conversation with somebody

00:44:22.916 --> 00:44:25.760
in the last couple weeks.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:28.130
My crazy comes out the
closer we get to the face.

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:31.110
You can talk to my husband
maybe after the talk.

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:32.610
See how crazy I get.

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:35.305
It took me about a zillion
hours to pack last night,

00:44:35.305 --> 00:44:37.165
to think about all the
things we had to do.

00:44:37.165 --> 00:44:41.430
So yeah, I mean
there definitely is

00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:46.576
a bandwidth of crazy probably
amongst all of us runners.

00:44:46.576 --> 00:44:50.322
But I don't know.

00:44:50.322 --> 00:44:51.280
There's a little crazy.

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.735
There's a little crazy to go
out there and try to do this,

00:44:53.735 --> 00:44:56.200
and to put yourself
through so much pain.

00:44:56.200 --> 00:45:00.448
But I've been in this
sport a really long time.

00:45:00.448 --> 00:45:01.864
I'm very fortunate
for that, and I

00:45:01.864 --> 00:45:05.190
think you learn to
enjoy the ups and downs,

00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:07.690
and you really do
focus on the long.

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:10.110
I want to be running
well beyond Saturday.

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:14.450
I want to be running
when I'm much older.

00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:17.010
I want to set a good example
for the athletes that I coach.

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:19.434
So you think about all those
things, and my daughter,

00:45:19.434 --> 00:45:20.600
she's going to be out there.

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.183
I want to set a good
example for that.

00:45:22.183 --> 00:45:24.910
So that helps make sure that
you kind of check yourself

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:26.910
on how you're
approaching things,

00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:30.156
and I also have a
great group around me--

00:45:30.156 --> 00:45:32.567
coaches and doctors
and teammates, who

00:45:32.567 --> 00:45:34.523
I can use as a sounding board.

00:45:41.295 --> 00:45:42.836
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
you said that when

00:45:42.836 --> 00:45:45.036
you ran your first
marathon that it maybe

00:45:45.036 --> 00:45:47.740
didn't go quite as
well as you had hoped,

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:49.842
and at least my
experience when you

00:45:49.842 --> 00:45:53.706
start getting into
different sports

00:45:53.706 --> 00:45:56.696
or into a different
aspect of that sport

00:45:56.696 --> 00:45:58.608
is you meet people
who are much better.

00:45:58.608 --> 00:46:02.910
And so how did you go
from like, oh, I did this,

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:04.546
and I didn't quite
do as well as I

00:46:04.546 --> 00:46:07.130
wanted to really being
at the elite level

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:09.374
that you're at right now?

00:46:09.374 --> 00:46:14.314
SHALUINN FULLOVE: I've been
lucky to-- some of my teammates

00:46:14.314 --> 00:46:17.780
now, we've been teammates
since we were-- gosh,

00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:19.213
almost 20 years.

00:46:19.213 --> 00:46:23.190
And I've been lucky to be
[INAUDIBLE] a long time.

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:25.690
So I think any time
you try a new distance,

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:28.654
you're going to open yourself
up to a lot of learning.

00:46:28.654 --> 00:46:30.618
We'll call it learning.

00:46:30.618 --> 00:46:37.010
But I think you learn
from that, and then

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:39.185
you meet people like you
said, and you talk to them,

00:46:39.185 --> 00:46:42.712
and you try to learn about that
new distance or that new part

00:46:42.712 --> 00:46:45.786
of the sport that you're
trying to get after.

00:46:45.786 --> 00:46:48.522
But I've been really
lucky to be in the sport

00:46:48.522 --> 00:46:52.128
with some of the best
for a very long time.

00:46:52.128 --> 00:46:54.558
Like my time at
Stanford, I'm just

00:46:54.558 --> 00:46:58.932
so honored to be included
in that list of alumni.

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:05.392
AUDIENCE: You've spent
a lot of time preparing

00:47:05.392 --> 00:47:08.278
for the marathon, and this
time around, the weather

00:47:08.278 --> 00:47:10.150
isn't the most
optimal, shall we say,

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:12.490
for running a marathon,
or some time or another,

00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:13.806
maybe you're not feeling well.

00:47:13.806 --> 00:47:15.740
How do you adjust
your expectations

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:18.482
after months of training
for an exceptional goal,

00:47:18.482 --> 00:47:20.620
and then maybe everything
isn't as conducive as you

00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:21.708
might want it to be otherwise?

00:47:21.708 --> 00:47:22.644
SHALUINN FULLOVE:
The weather is always

00:47:22.644 --> 00:47:25.218
a factor in the marathon,
and it's always something

00:47:25.218 --> 00:47:26.856
we have zero control on.

00:47:26.856 --> 00:47:29.683
So we try not to think
too much about it,

00:47:29.683 --> 00:47:32.016
and then we just try to deal
with the circumstances that

00:47:32.016 --> 00:47:32.515
were given.

00:47:32.515 --> 00:47:34.530
This time around
for Saturday for me,

00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:36.950
it's been a bit of an
unconventional buildup,

00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:38.950
because we've had
a short buildup.

00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:41.432
It's only been 10 weeks
since my last marathon.

00:47:41.432 --> 00:47:44.841
I've had a small injury
that's come up the last three

00:47:44.841 --> 00:47:47.216
weeks that we've had to really
change the training around

00:47:47.216 --> 00:47:47.841
to accommodate.

00:47:47.841 --> 00:47:49.316
And then we have
this big wrinkle

00:47:49.316 --> 00:47:53.480
that it's going to be
in the 80s on Saturday.

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.950
So we've done a lot
of recalibrating,

00:47:55.950 --> 00:48:00.800
and at some point, you
can have a game plan.

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.467
You can have your A, B,
and C goals, but in the day

00:48:03.467 --> 00:48:05.821
you get out there, you
have to trust yourself.

00:48:05.821 --> 00:48:07.362
That was the advice
my coach gave me.

00:48:07.362 --> 00:48:10.066
We were just talking
yesterday about why we

00:48:10.066 --> 00:48:11.470
do a lot of unstructured runs.

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:14.237
You have to know how your
body feels and trusts,

00:48:14.237 --> 00:48:17.111
and you know what
you can do, and just

00:48:17.111 --> 00:48:19.506
to run within yourself.

00:48:19.506 --> 00:48:22.870
AUDIENCE: How have you felt
in all this preparation,

00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:25.230
and how far has
it taken you away

00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:29.196
from your normal routine
with your family?

00:48:31.923 --> 00:48:34.048
SHALUINN FULLOVE: There 's
definitely been moments.

00:48:34.048 --> 00:48:36.368
I've been really lucky to be
able to do a lot of racing

00:48:36.368 --> 00:48:39.890
close to home and to have such
great, great, great training

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:41.940
grounds really
close to my house,

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:44.375
and some of the best
doctors and physios

00:48:44.375 --> 00:48:47.840
are in our neighborhood,
so that's been awesome.

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.096
Google actually has
been really supportive,

00:48:50.096 --> 00:48:51.470
so the last couple
summers, we've

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:53.780
actually been able to
go to the Boulder office

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:56.896
for an extended stay and work
a little bit from the Boulder

00:48:56.896 --> 00:48:58.315
office and train at altitude.

00:48:58.315 --> 00:49:01.153
So I've been really fortunate
to be able to take my family.

00:49:01.153 --> 00:49:03.340
Elise is not quite
school age yet,

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:06.123
so we're able to spend a lot
of time not having to work

00:49:06.123 --> 00:49:07.890
around a school schedule.

00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:10.225
So that's been fantastic.

00:49:10.225 --> 00:49:12.766
I did have this injury come up
a little bit in the last three

00:49:12.766 --> 00:49:14.406
weeks, so I've had to do
a little bit more travel

00:49:14.406 --> 00:49:16.374
to go see some
specialists about that.

00:49:16.374 --> 00:49:18.540
And luckily, they've just
been extremely supportive,

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:20.770
and we just try to make it
as efficient as possible

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:22.796
to go down there and do
the work and come back.

00:49:22.796 --> 00:49:26.200
Work's been extremely
accommodating as well.

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:30.540
JEREMY STERN: One
of the things you

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:36.330
learn both in work and athletics
is envisioning an outcome.

00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:43.130
What do you envision on
Saturday at the finish line?

00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:44.694
Are you thinking about it?

00:49:44.694 --> 00:49:46.402
SHALUINN FULLOVE: I
am thinking about it.

00:49:46.402 --> 00:49:49.680
I feel a little bit like
I need to crystallize

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.900
that over the next 72 hours
definitely, maybe 48 hours.

00:49:55.951 --> 00:49:59.260
It's been an
unconventional buildup.

00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:01.690
This injury's been a
little bit of a wrinkle.

00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:03.532
The heat's going to be a factor.

00:50:03.532 --> 00:50:04.990
I think ultimately,
where I'll land

00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:06.750
is I'm going to try
not to overthink it.

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:09.351
I'm going to get out there
and run really smart,

00:50:09.351 --> 00:50:11.430
and not forget to
enjoy it, because this

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:15.846
is quite a moment that won't
come again until-- maybe never

00:50:15.846 --> 00:50:17.220
again, but it's
not going to come

00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:19.405
before four years from now.

00:50:19.405 --> 00:50:21.392
So I need to spend
some time in my journal

00:50:21.392 --> 00:50:25.900
and around my teammates, who
all get into town tomorrow,

00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:28.616
and that'll probably help
me start to think about it

00:50:28.616 --> 00:50:31.440
and feel good about it.

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:34.360
JEREMY STERN: Well, Shal, on
behalf of everyone at Google,

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:36.730
we wish you the best
of luck in this race.

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:40.100
It's an extraordinary
opportunity on the road to Rio,

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:44.900
and thank you so much for
joining us on Talks at Google,

00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:48.370
and wishing you
the best of luck.

00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:49.254
So thank you so much.

00:50:49.254 --> 00:50:50.420
SHALUINN FULLOVE: Thank you.

00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:51.586
JEREMY STERN: Very exciting.

00:50:51.586 --> 00:50:54.920
[APPLAUSE]
