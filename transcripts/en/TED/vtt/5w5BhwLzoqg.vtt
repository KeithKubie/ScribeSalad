00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.416
With me here today

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.160
I brought something beautiful.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.576
This is a feather from one of the most
beautiful birds we have in Kenya,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.560
the crested guinea fowl.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.536
But this feather is more than just that.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.816
If you've taken time when you are outdoors

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.736
to look at the feathers around you,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.976
you'll have noticed

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.736
that there is this huge variety
of different sizes,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.960
shapes and even colors.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.536
The feather is one of the most
astonishing pieces of technology

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.096
invented by the natural world,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.136
and for centuries, this feather
has helped birds to keep dry,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.040
to keep warm and even power flight.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.360
Only one section of the tree of life
can actually make a feather.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.336
Among all the world's animals,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.536
birds are the only ones
who can make something

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.894
like what I'm holding today.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.336
I personally have given them a nickname,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.800
and I like to call them the feathermakers.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.816
It is the major difference between birds
and any other animals we have on earth,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.456
and if you can't make a feather,
you cannot call yourself a bird.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.696
(Laughter)

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.816
For us humans, who are earthbound,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.520
birds represent freedom.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.656
This feather has enabled birds
to conquer gravity

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.736
and take to the air
in an extraordinary way.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.840
Don't you sometimes wish
you could fly like a bird?

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.296
Birds are my passion,

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.696
and I want to change the way
each one of you thinks about them.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.280
The easiest reason I love them so much
is because they are beautiful.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.616
There are 10,000 species in the world,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.000
and each one of them
is uniquely beautiful.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.680
Birds are amazing,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.176
and this talk is dedicated
to all the birds of the world.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.776
(Laughter)

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.536
(Applause)

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.096
Indeed, these birds have been
part of our lives and cultures

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.776
all over the world for centuries,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.936
and every society has a story about birds.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.656
You probably have heard
childhood stories of different birds

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.656
and how they relate with man.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.496
I personally recently learned

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.296
that our human ancestors
would follow flocks of vultures

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.736
and then they would help them

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.216
to identify where carcasses
have been dropped by large carnivores,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.600
and these humans will scavenge
and eat part of that meat.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.456
Birds have been used as brands
and labels all over the world.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.816
You know the bald eagle?

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.616
It was chosen as the national
emblem for the US

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.776
because of its majestic strength,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.016
beautiful looks

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.560
and even a long lifespan.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.056
And just like us humans

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.616
who have managed to live
in virtually all habitats of this earth,

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.056
birds have also conquered the world.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.016
From birds such as
these beautiful penguins

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.456
that live in the cold ice caps

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.536
to even others like the larks,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.696
who live in the hottest deserts
you can imagine.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.240
Indeed, these species
have conquered this world.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.976
Birds also build houses like us.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.096
The real pros in housebuilding

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.240
are a group of birds
we call the weaverbirds,

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.456
and this name they were given

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.000
because of the way
in which they weave their nests.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.296
An interesting one:

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.696
birds also love and date
just like us humans.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.576
In fact, you'll be surprised to know
that males dress to impress the women,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.176
and I'll show you how.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.736
So here we have a long-tailed widowbird,

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.016
and this is how they would normally look.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.456
But when it comes to the breeding season,

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.776
everything changes,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.776
and this is how he looks.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.096
(Audience murmurs)

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.360
Yeah?

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.976
Birds also, multiple species of them,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.576
do love to touch and cuddle
just like humans.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.896
And I know you're
wondering about this one.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.336
Yes, they kiss too,

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.056
sometimes very deeply.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.296
(Applause)

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.896
Some have even learned
to cheat on their spouses.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.936
(Laughter)

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.936
For example, the African jacana:

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.375
the females will mate with multiple males

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:31.336
and then she takes off
to find other males to mate with

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.536
and she leaves the male behind
to take care of the chicks.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.176
(Laughter)

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.360
(Applause)

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.336
And birds help us so much,

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.616
and they play very crucial roles
in our ecosystems each day.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.896
Vultures clean up our environment

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.296
by literally digesting
disease-causing pathogens,

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.176
and they finish carcasses
that would otherwise cost us lots of money

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.096
to clear from the environment.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.056
A sizable flock of vultures
is capable of bringing down a carcass

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.376
the size of a zebra straight to the bone

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.320
within just about 30 minutes.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.856
Owls help to rid
the environments of rodents

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.696
and this helps us a lot
because it saves us money --

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.096
we don't lose our crops --

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.016
and secondly, we don't have
to buy harmful chemicals

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.800
to handle these rodents.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.496
The beautiful sunbirds
we see in our environments

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.936
are part of nature's pollination crew,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.296
and they help our plants to form fruits.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.896
Together with other
pollinators like insects,

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.456
they have actually helped us

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.320
to get most of the food crops
that we depend on for many years.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.496
Unfortunately, the story of birds
is by far not perfect.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.136
They are faced by numerous challenges
every day wherever they live.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.856
Top on the threats facing birds

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.336
is habitat loss

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.760
and reduced food availability.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.936
Birds are also hunted,
especially migratory species

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.480
and ducks that congregate in water bodies.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.296
Poisoning is happening
to flocks that like to stick together,

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.520
especially in places like rice schemes.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.136
Moreover, power lines
are electrocuting birds

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.536
and wind farms are slicing birds

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.480
when they fly through the blades.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.336
Recently, we've heard the talk
of climate change

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.176
making a lot of headlines,

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.216
and it's also affecting birds,

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.616
because birds are being forced to migrate
to better breeding and feeding grounds

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.776
because unfortunately
where they used to live

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.000
is no longer habitable.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.496
My own perspective
towards birds was changed

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.696
when I was a small boy in high school,

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.376
and there was this boy who struck,

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.800
injuring the wing and the leg
of a bird we called the augur buzzard.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.376
I was standing there,

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.336
just a mere 14-year-old,

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.896
and I imagined a human being
in a similar situation,

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.960
because this bird could not help itself.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.216
So even if I was hardly
any biologist by then,

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.136
I gathered with three of my friends
and we decided to house the bird

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.880
until it had regained strength
and then let it free.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.016
Interestingly, it accepted
to feed on beef from our school kitchen,

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.136
and we hunted termites around the compound
for its dinner every day.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.376
After a few days, it had regained strength

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.656
and we released it.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.216
We were so happy to see it flap its wings

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.136
and fly off gracefully.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.600
And that experience
changed the way we looked at birds.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.616
We went on to actually make a magazine,

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.856
and we called it the Hawk Magazine,

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.976
and this was in honor of this bird

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.936
that we had helped
within our own high school.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.240
Those experiences in high school
made me the conservationist I am today.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.776
And a passion for birds
should especially matter for Africa

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.256
and all Africans,

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.576
because among all other continents,

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.536
Africa hosts some
of the most amazing bird species

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.816
you can find anywhere in the world.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.656
Imagine having a name like "shoebill."

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.656
That's the name of that bird.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.256
And there are countries like DR Congo,

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.816
Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.376
who are leading the continent
in highest numbers of diversity

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.781
when it comes to the species.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.496
These birds continue
to provide the continent

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.976
with very crucial ecosystem
services that Africa needs.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.856
Moreover, there is huge potential

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.280
for Africa to lead the world
in avian tourism.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.176
The economy will definitely benefit.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.416
Imagine how many communities
will benefit from groups of tourists

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.616
visiting their villages
just to see the endemic birds

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.040
that can only be found in those villages.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.040
How can we help birds together?

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.936
There is now a chance for all of you

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.775
to turn your passion for birds

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:51.696
into contributing
to their continued survival,

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.559
and you can do that
by becoming a citizen scientist.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.216
Citizen science is a growing trend
around the world,

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.296
and we are having scenarios
where people are sharing information

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.296
with the rest of the community
about traffic updates,

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.576
security alerts and so on.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.376
That is exactly what
we realized as bird-watchers,

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.456
and we thought, because birds
are found everywhere,

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.656
if we've got all of you
and everyone else in Africa

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.056
to tell us the birds
they find where they live,

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.496
where they school,
or even where they work,

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.056
then we can be able to come up
with a map of every single species,

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.816
and from there scientists will be able

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.896
to actually prioritize
conservation efforts

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.376
to those habitats that matter the most.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.456
Take for example these two projects,

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.256
the Africa Raptor DataBank,

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.136
which is mapping all birds of prey
in the continent of Africa,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.456
and the Kenya Bird Map,

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.416
which is mapping about 1,100 species
that occur in my country, Kenya.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.416
These two projects
now have online databases

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.896
that are allowing people to submit data,

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.896
and this is converted
into very interactive websites

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.000
that the public can consume
and make decisions from.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.936
But when we started,
there was a big challenge.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.416
We received many complaints
from bird-watchers,

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.696
and they will say,

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.056
"I'm in a village,
and I cannot access a computer.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.696
How do I tell you
what birds live in my home,

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.096
or where I school, or where I work?"

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:21.816
So we were forced to renovate our strategy
and come up with a sustainable solution.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.136
It was easy:

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.376
we immediately realized that mobile phones

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.056
were becoming increasingly
common in Africa

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.760
and most of the regions
could get access to one.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.216
So we came up with
mobile phone applications

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.376
that you can use on your iPhone
and on your Android phone,

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.496
and we made them freely available

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.776
for every bird-watching
enthusiast out there.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.056
So we came up with BirdLasser,
which is used by the Kenya Bird Map,

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.776
and also we have
the African Raptor Observations,

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.856
which is now used
by the African Raptor DataBank.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.016
This was a huge breakthrough in our work

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.736
and it made us get
enormous amounts of data

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.560
from every birder
out there in the regions.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.776
With this, we realized
that citizen science

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.856
is indeed very powerful,

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.920
the reason being,
citizen science is adaptive.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.376
And we were able to actually
convert many bird-watchers

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.920
to start sharing new information with us.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.456
When we were starting,

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.056
we didn't know that birds
could be a huge gateway

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.880
to approaching conservation
of other forms of animals.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.856
Interestingly, now
in the Virtual Museum for Africa,

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.056
we have maps for dragonflies
and damselflies,

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.816
butterflies and moths,

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.976
reptiles, frogs, orchids, spiders,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.856
scorpions, and yes,
we are even mapping mushrooms.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.536
Who could have imagined mapping mushrooms?

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.136
So this showed us that indeed
we've created a community of people

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.520
who care about nature in Africa.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.936
I hereby call upon all of you

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.176
to join me in promoting the value of birds

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.976
within your communities.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.656
Please just tell your friends about birds,

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.960
for we are always inclined
to love and care for that which we know.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.976
Please spend a few minutes
in your free time

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.096
when you are at work,
at school, or maybe at home,

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.696
to at least look around you
and see which beautiful birds are there.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.816
Come join us in citizen science

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.816
and tell us the birds you're finding
in the places where you visit.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.136
Even simpler,

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.776
you could buy your child or your sibling

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.616
a pair of binoculars

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.976
or a bird book

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.496
and let them just appreciate
how beautiful these birds are.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.376
Because maybe one day
they will want to care

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.296
for that one which they know and love.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.096
The children indeed are our future.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.616
Let us please teach them
to love our feathermakers,

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.576
because the love of birds

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.936
can be a huge gateway
to appreciating all forms of nature.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.176
Thank you very much.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:02.456
(Applause)

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.920
Thank you.
