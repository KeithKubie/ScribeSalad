00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.589
I’m thinking about getting a new phone.

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.589
Should I get the one that’s dull and lifeless
or clean and shiny?

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.480
Oooh… shiny…

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.379
Hey there glossy gatherers, Jules here for
Dnews!

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.990
From a very early age, we as humans are intrinsically
attracted to shiny things.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.810
Lip gloss, mirror-finish car paints, diamonds,
even glossy paper!

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.530
That might seem obvious to say, the same behavior
doesn’t seem to be universal throughout

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.680
the animal kingdom.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.439
We used to think magpies were attracted to
shiny things, but a 2014 study disproved that

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.800
idea, and found that they were actually afraid
of them, as well as any new objects in general.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.280
In fact, our research had trouble finding
any other animals with a marked predisposition

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.050
to shiny objects in the same way humans seem
to be practically obsessed with them.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.690
Plenty of theories have been proposed.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.629
Some believe it’s just an aesthetic preference
that’s picked up as you age.

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.359
Your parents like shiny things, so you like
shiny things.

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:59.350
But a study in Ecological Psychology from
2010 observed infants and toddlers being drawn

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.370
to shiny mirrors, and even licking their surface
as if lapping at a pool of liquid, so the

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.460
attraction appears innate.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.100
In fact, this response in babies is telling.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.180
Could it be that shiny things just remind
us of water?

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.610
In 2014, researchers from Ghent University
and the University of Houston conducted six

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.300
different studies to try and narrow down humanity’s
attraction to shininess.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.840
The first two-part study asked children around
the age of five and full-grown adults to rank

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.740
glossy and non-glossy paper to their preference.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.220
This was in order to a) establish that adults
do like shiny things, and b) to establish

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.580
that children like them too, before being
socialized to the idea.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.980
The researchers hypothesized that we are drawn
to gloss because our brains associate it with

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.570
water, and to test that hypothesis, they gave
a new set of participants glossy and matte

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.560
pictures of both aquatic landscapes and deserts.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.240
They found that people did indeed believe
the aquatic images were glossier than the

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.130
desert images, despite the photo having the
same level of gloss or matte.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.600
And just in case, to rule out the hypothesis
that maybe we like glossy things simply because

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.250
they’re just visually appealing, like the
way symmetry is, the researchers conducted

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.250
another study.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.880
They blindfolded the participants and had
them touch rough matte and smooth glossy paper,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.319
and then had them rate quality and attractiveness
of the material.

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.230
The participants rated the glossy paper higher,
despite not even seeing it.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.220
The final experiment was examining if the
feeling of thirst, and craving water, could

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.620
also elicit a reaction to glossy materials.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.010
They fed participants salty crackers, and
had them evaluate their preference for either

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.770
matte or glossy pictures.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.720
Tellingly, the thirsty group was drawn more
to shininess, showing a potential correlation,

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.330
and thus a potential conclusion.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.630
So, do we like shiny things just because they
remind us of water?

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.770
Well, maybe.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.800
This is just six studies coming from the same
researchers, so it may be a lot more complicated

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.780
than just reminding us of water.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.810
We don’t know yet.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.819
More research is definitely needed.

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.420
We can’t do DNews episodes without support

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.180
Special thanks to Kay Jewelers for sponsoring

For 100 years, every kiss begins with Kay.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.150
If our attraction to shiny things is because
we associate it with water...what happens

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.860
to our body when we can’t find water?

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.100
Check out this video about dehydration, here.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.100
What about you?

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.230
What’s your favorite shiny thing?
