00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, there's a few answers you might have given to answer this question. Let's talk about them.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
First, you might have used this equation, this definition of acceleration,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to say okay well the ball changes its velocity by 20 meters per second by going from 0 to 20,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
which means Δv is equal to 20 m/sec and since it takes 2 seconds to drop

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Δt is equal to 2 seconds.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Well, this is just the equation for acceleration and so the answer is

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
20/2 or 10 m/sec square.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That's your first answer you may have given, maybe 10 m/sec squared.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
That's probably the most correct, but your second answer,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
which I would have been very impressed with as well is how did Galileo measure speed.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This was hundred of years ago. They had no good way of measuring speed.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And so the very question that I gave to you was pretty flawed in that sense.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The third answer you may have given is how did he measure time.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Galileo did not have any stop watches or fancy chronometers in his day.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Let's see what Professor Settle has to say.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:05.000
To realize good results from the inclined plane needed to be able to time precise interval

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
segments of motion down the inclined plane.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
He did not have chronometers--he used a pot of water with a hole in the bottom which he could

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
fill to a certain level and which he could allow water to flow through which he could

00:01:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
open and stop, collecting the water in a container, and then weighing the water.
