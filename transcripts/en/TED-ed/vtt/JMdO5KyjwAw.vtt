00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:09.724
Is teleportation possible?

00:00:09.724 --> 00:00:13.142
Could a baseball transform into
something like a radio wave,

00:00:13.142 --> 00:00:14.617
travel through buildings,

00:00:14.617 --> 00:00:16.104
bounce around corners,

00:00:16.104 --> 00:00:18.855
and change back into a baseball?

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:24.995
Oddly enough, thanks to quantum mechanics,
the answer might actually be yes.

00:00:24.995 --> 00:00:26.576
Sort of.

00:00:26.576 --> 00:00:27.605
Here's the trick.

00:00:27.605 --> 00:00:30.296
The baseball itself couldn't 
be sent by radio,

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:33.763
but all the information about it could.

00:00:33.763 --> 00:00:36.266
In quantum physics, atoms and electrons

00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:39.756
are interpreted as a collection
of distinct properties,

00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:41.067
for example, position,

00:00:41.067 --> 00:00:41.926
momentum,

00:00:41.926 --> 00:00:44.265
and intrinsic spin.

00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:47.097
The values of these properties 
configure the particle,

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:50.658
giving it a quantum state identity.

00:00:50.658 --> 00:00:52.996
If two electrons have 
the same quantum state,

00:00:52.996 --> 00:00:54.547
they're identical.

00:00:54.547 --> 00:00:59.136
In a literal sense, our baseball
is defined by a collective quantum state

00:00:59.136 --> 00:01:01.696
resulting from its many atoms.

00:01:01.696 --> 00:01:05.547
If this quantum state information
could be read in Boston

00:01:05.547 --> 00:01:07.048
and sent around the world,

00:01:07.048 --> 00:01:10.876
atoms for the same chemical elements
could have this information

00:01:10.876 --> 00:01:13.479
imprinted on them in Bangalore

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.039
and be carefully directed to assemble,

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:18.969
becoming the exact same baseball.

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:20.178
There's a wrinkle though.

00:01:20.178 --> 00:01:22.849
Quantum states aren't so easy to measure.

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:25.763
The uncertainty principle 
in quantum physics

00:01:25.763 --> 00:01:28.740
implies the position and momentum
of a particle

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.738
can't be measured at the same time.

00:01:31.738 --> 00:01:34.879
The simplest way to measure
the exact position of an electron

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:39.239
requires scattering a particle of light,
a photon, from it,

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:41.821
and collecting the light in a microscope.

00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:47.178
But that scattering changes the momentum
of the electron in an unpredictable way.

00:01:47.178 --> 00:01:50.220
We lose all previous information
about momentum.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.751
In a sense, 
quantum information is fragile.

00:01:53.751 --> 00:01:55.830
Measuring the information changes it.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.731
So how can we transmit something

00:01:57.731 --> 00:02:01.899
we're not permitted to fully read
without destroying it?

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.753
The answer can be found in the strange
phenomena of quantum entanglement.

00:02:06.753 --> 00:02:10.723
Entanglement is an old mystery
from the early days of quantum physics

00:02:10.723 --> 00:02:13.142
and it's still not entirely understood.

00:02:13.142 --> 00:02:17.162
Entangling the spin of two electrons
results in an influence

00:02:17.162 --> 00:02:19.603
that transcends distance.

00:02:19.603 --> 00:02:21.533
Measuring the spin of the first electron

00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:24.721
determines what spin will 
measure for the second,

00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:29.132
whether the two particles are a mile
or a light year apart.

00:02:29.132 --> 00:02:32.931
Somehow, information 
about the first electron's quantum state,

00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:34.901
called a qubit of data,

00:02:34.901 --> 00:02:40.883
influences its partner without 
transmission across the intervening space.

00:02:40.883 --> 00:02:43.875
Einstein and his colleagues called
this strange communcation

00:02:43.875 --> 00:02:46.832
spooky action at a distance.

00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:50.094
While it does seem that entanglement
between two particles

00:02:50.094 --> 00:02:54.725
helps transfer a qubit instantaneously
across the space between them,

00:02:54.725 --> 00:02:56.404
there's a catch.

00:02:56.404 --> 00:03:00.642
This interaction must begin locally.

00:03:00.642 --> 00:03:03.963
The two electrons must be entangled
in close proximity

00:03:03.963 --> 00:03:08.395
before one of them is transported
to a new site.

00:03:08.395 --> 00:03:11.945
By itself, quantum entanglement
isn't teleportation.

00:03:11.945 --> 00:03:13.333
To complete the teleport,

00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:18.695
we need a digital message to help
interpret the qubit at the receiving end.

00:03:18.695 --> 00:03:22.705
Two bits of data created by measuring
the first particle.

00:03:22.705 --> 00:03:26.455
These digital bits must be transmitted
by a classical channel

00:03:26.455 --> 00:03:32.296
that's limited by the speed of light,
radio, microwaves, or perhaps fiberoptics.

00:03:32.296 --> 00:03:34.865
When we measure a particle
for this digital message,

00:03:34.865 --> 00:03:37.265
we destroy its quantum information,

00:03:37.265 --> 00:03:40.138
which means the baseball must disappear
from Boston

00:03:40.138 --> 00:03:42.986
for it to teleport to Bangalore.

00:03:42.986 --> 00:03:44.859
Thanks to the uncertainty principle,

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.316
teleportation transfers the information
about the baseball

00:03:48.316 --> 00:03:52.316
between the two cities
and never duplicates it.

00:03:52.316 --> 00:03:56.457
So in principle, we could teleport 
objects, even people,

00:03:56.457 --> 00:04:00.446
but at present, it seems unlikely
we can measure the quantum states

00:04:00.446 --> 00:04:04.492
of the trillion trillion or more atoms
in large objects

00:04:04.492 --> 00:04:06.738
and then recreate them elsewhere.

00:04:06.738 --> 00:04:11.188
The complexity of this task
and the energy needed is astronomical.

00:04:11.188 --> 00:04:15.468
For now, we can reliably teleport
single electrons and atoms,

00:04:15.468 --> 00:04:17.919
which may lead to super-secured
data encryption

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.569
for future quantum computers.

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:25.529
The philosophical implications
of quantum teleportation are subtle.

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:29.969
A teleported object doesn't exactly
transport across space

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:31.440
like tangible matter,

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.358
nor does it exactly transmit across space,
like intangible information.

00:04:36.358 --> 00:04:38.544
It seems to do a little of both.

00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:41.049
Quantum physics gives us 
a strange new vision

00:04:41.049 --> 00:04:45.920
for all the matter in our universe
as collections of fragile information.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.780
And quantum teleportation reveals
new ways to influence this fragility.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.993
And remember, never say never.

00:04:53.993 --> 00:04:55.641
In a little over a century,

00:04:55.641 --> 00:04:59.131
mankind has advanced from an uncertain 
new understanding

00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:01.911
of the behavior of electrons
at the atomic scale

00:05:01.911 --> 00:05:06.278
to reliably teleporting them
across a room.

00:05:06.278 --> 00:05:09.051
What new technical mastery 
of such phenomena

00:05:09.051 --> 00:05:12.732
might we have in 1,000, 
or even 10,000 years?

00:05:12.732 --> 00:05:15.573
Only time and space will tell.
