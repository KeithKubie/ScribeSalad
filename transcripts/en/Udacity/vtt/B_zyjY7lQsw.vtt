00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.550
In this lesson, we will examine a fast
Fourier transform and apply it in order

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.364
to obtain an efficient algorithm for
convolving two sequences of numbers.

00:00:08.364 --> 00:00:12.670
If you have seen the Fourier transform
before in the context of mathematics,

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.310
physics or engineering,

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.770
this lesson may have a different
flavor from what you are used to.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.330
We won't be using it to solve
differential equations or

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.090
to characterize the behavior
of an electrical circuit.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.980
Instead, we'll be focused on
the much more mundane task

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.260
of multiplying polynomials and
doing it quickly.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.220
This algorithmic aspect
of the Fourier transform

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.830
is actually almost as old as
the Fourier transform itself,

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.560
appearing in an early 19th century
paper by Gauss on interpolation.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.930
The transform itself, by the way, gets
its paper from Jean Baptiste Fourier's

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.710
1807 paper on the propagation
of heat through solids.

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:52.270
Gauss' trick seems to have largely
been forgotten, until Cooley and

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.390
Tookey published a paper on
the fast Fourier transform in 1965.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.470
Tookey was apparently somewhat
reluctant to publish the paper,

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.910
because he thought it was a simple
observation and the how to questions of

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.430
algorithms were still considered
second class at the time.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.880
Well much has changed since then.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.010
Their paper's now one of the most
cited scientific literature and

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.240
the idea is considered one of
the most elegant in algorithm design.
