00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:09.450
(soft music)

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.450
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.943
Bipedal, naked, large brain.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.713
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.903
Aware that death is inevitable.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.853
Yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.683
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.223
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.303
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.750
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.693
of the past.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.180
Carta brings together experts from diverse

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.422
disciplines to exchange
insights on who we are

00:00:52.422 --> 00:00:54.703
and how we got here.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.080
An exploration made possible
by the generosity of

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.713
humans like you.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.033
(upbeat music)

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.930
- The thing about humans,
and if you haven't thought

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.978
about it, I'm sure you will,

00:01:46.978 --> 00:01:50.210
we can and do eat anything.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.380
So what we can do is eat directly.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.200
So we do, we could be
completely carnivorous,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.540
we could be almost completely herbivorous,

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.510
if we can't eat it, like
grass, we feed it to a cow

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.590
who can eat it, or we do
what pascal does which is

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.940
takes the yeast and makes bread out of it.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.880
And so we can also take
that cow and cook it

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.540
so we can actually get
something out of this.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.750
I just picked this slide at random,

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.720
this is not one that I think
depicts much of anything,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.370
but the only reason I'm
showing it is because I want

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.850
you to get a sort of idea
of the body size of what

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.610
we're gonna be talking about.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.110
None of these animals are small.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.430
Okay so what did they eat?

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.830
Well how do you know?

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.381
So one of the ways is to do
morphological comparisons.

00:02:38.381 --> 00:02:42.600
So what you have here is
the skull of a very robust

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.530
australopithecine on
your right and you've got

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.230
a very early archaic hominin on your left.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.090
As you can see that there's
a massive difference.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.740
This is a chewing muscle
that goes through here.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.970
It has a ridge on the top
of it's head where there's

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.760
musculature that goes all the way up,

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.100
it is a chewing machine.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.185
These are the teeth.

00:03:03.185 --> 00:03:05.060
So you see the size of
these teeth verses the size

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.290
of another fossil,
australopithecus afarensis,

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.280
compared to a modern human.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.090
So you can see the different
sizes in their teeth.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.500
There are people in this
room who do that, I don't,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.610
but I can do it in general.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.750
Okay what did they eat?

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.230
You can also look at force and strain,

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.967
you can use a model, so
what yovue got here is

00:03:24.967 --> 00:03:26.660
a macaque monkey.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.370
This is done on a macaque monkey skull,

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.034
this is not done on a live
macaque, I don't believe.

00:03:32.034 --> 00:03:35.760
Although those were implanted in macaques.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.650
And then this is a australopithosine,

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.490
or a cast thereof, shaped
exactly like you would

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.320
a live one if you could

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.440
and you can see where
the stress and the strain

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.990
is coming.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.830
So what you've got is a
lot of stress across here,

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.860
which is where the chewing
musculature is gonna go

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.940
back behind here.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.030
And so you can see that
the distribution of stress

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.938
in some places is the same,
in other places it's not

00:03:57.938 --> 00:04:02.300
because what we're looking
at is strain deformation

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.788
of the bone following stress.

00:04:04.788 --> 00:04:07.800
Another way of looking at it is microwear,

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.190
that's what these pictures are.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.190
This is work that was
done by Mark Teaford and

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.170
Peter Ungar and what they say
is gorilla fine wear striae

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.690
baboon-like pits, microflakes
and it shifts to hominid

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:21.990
puncture crushing.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.780
What that tells you a little
bit about what kinds of

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.210
textures these animals were eating,

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.720
but it doesn't tell you what they ate.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.690
Well I like to go to
general principles first.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.730
So although I'm not gonna give you models,

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.750
I'll give you some general principles.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.650
One of those is as body size increases,

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.080
metabolic rate decreases.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.480
Per kilo, that's not overall energetics.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.660
So for small animals they
have to eat small packages

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.970
of high quality food that
can be processed quickly.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.643
So you think of that galigo
monkey, galigo (mumbles).

00:04:54.643 --> 00:04:59.643
You look at a large animal,
lots of low quality food,

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.530
processed more slowly and they
tend to be more sedentary.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.670
And again it's not total
output of energy or total

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.883
input of energy, it is per kilo.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.330
Well, okay so from that let's
look at what primate foods

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.530
are all about.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.410
Primate foods break down into
sort of three categories;

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.300
insects, leaves, and fruit.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.090
So what you're looking at
is things that are insects,

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.666
they move around a lot but
they're high in protein,

00:05:27.666 --> 00:05:29.370
leaves are also high in
protein but very difficult

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.614
to digest, and they also
are seasonal so they will

00:05:33.614 --> 00:05:36.740
disappear and so they
actually move, but over time.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.080
Fruit is high in energy, I
almost showed you orangutan

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.540
fruits that do not look
like they're high in energy,

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.310
but most fruits are high
in energy and they're easy

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.290
to digest.

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.840
They are, however, like
leaves mobile in time,

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.120
they come seasonally.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.300
You look at the primates that feed here.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.420
You have small primates,
very small primates,

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.020
that can feed on insects.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.420
Again, requires small
packages of food but highly

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.170
easy to digest.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.444
You have large primates,
depicted by this gorilla,

00:06:07.444 --> 00:06:11.270
it's again high in protein
but very hard to digest.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.885
And gorillas done more
around as much as the

00:06:13.885 --> 00:06:15.810
(mumbles) does.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.170
I show you fruit, although
there's no animal that can

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.730
survive just on fruit because
you don't get the protein

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.610
content, but I show you some
monkeys that are gonna be

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.150
feeding on fruit.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.887
You look at what these
animals do do is you get

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:32.738
animals along the lines
of frugivore folivores

00:06:32.738 --> 00:06:35.220
so the large animals will
eat leaves and then they

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.640
combine that with fruit.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.190
Small animals will either
be totally insectivorous,

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.400
or they'll combine that with fruit.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.170
What you never have is
a primate that relies

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:46.860
on leaves and insects.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.504
And that's just because a
large animal cannot capture

00:06:49.504 --> 00:06:53.300
enough insects in order to
be able to survive itself.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.970
Or able to survive.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.000
So we look at this in our
body size we should've been

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.110
a frugivore folivore, right?

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.840
Okay well you know what
your diet is and I would

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.190
say that this has been
going on for a long time.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.140
We were not folivores.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.010
Not for a very long time.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:13.470
So what do we do now
about what did they eat?

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:16.340
Alright this is the part
that I will be presenting

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.830
today and the data that I will present.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.730
And these all have to
do with stable isotopes.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.530
Stable isotopes are different
forms of the exact same

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.760
element and the one I'm
gonna be talking about is

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.051
carbon because it's gonna
be in a mineral portion of

00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:35.097
enamel or in bone and you
don't get any kinds of

00:07:35.097 --> 00:07:37.010
organics in that.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.630
So what these elements, how
they differ are different

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.139
masses which means that they
react at different rates.

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:47.020
And that means that if you've
got something that reacts

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.760
at different rates, that
it can be distributed

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.030
differently as, say, certain
trophic levels across

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.110
different parts of the same trophic level.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.420
And that's what we're gonna be doing.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:01.835
We present that as C13, C12
those are the stable isotopes.

00:08:01.835 --> 00:08:04.697
You've probably heard of carbon
14 which is radio carbon,

00:08:04.697 --> 00:08:08.833
this is not a radioactive
element, isotope.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.578
Then you get them presented
as delta C12 and it's in

00:08:13.578 --> 00:08:15.680
per mil just to make it read--

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.470
You take a standard, you take your sample,

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.810
you compare them and the
differences, the delta.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:23.870
Okay how did this all get started?

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.761
Well we know that atmospheric
CO2 is taken up by plants

00:08:26.761 --> 00:08:30.020
by photosynthetic pathway.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:35.020
In 1948 we knew that there
were plants that actually

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.940
the way in which they took
up CO2, and I have to say

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.959
that there is a man, was
at UCSD when I got here

00:08:41.959 --> 00:08:45.370
who was one of the men
who discovered this.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.095
C4 plants, I'm not even
gonna talk about 'em because

00:08:48.095 --> 00:08:50.640
that wasn't done at UCSD.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.640
But they weren't even
identified until 1967 so we've

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:59.170
had almost 20 years where
people thought everything

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:00.285
was like this.

00:09:00.285 --> 00:09:04.697
Now what do we do now is
look at the geochemistry.

00:09:04.697 --> 00:09:09.697
Samuel Epstein, who was at
Cal Tech, in 1971 finally

00:09:12.272 --> 00:09:16.420
had his ah-ha moment when
he realized that all those

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.870
plants that he had been
collecting across country

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.730
and everywhere else and he
could make no sense of it

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.540
because they came out with
a bimodal distribution,

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.240
low and behold these were
two different photosynthetic

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.380
pathways.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.940
Those two photosynthetic
pathways are actually

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.650
different kinds of plants.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:35.890
So what you get here are
what we call C4 plants,

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:38.341
they're gonna be (mumbles)
and grasses, some sedges,

00:09:38.341 --> 00:09:41.670
not very many of them and
many of the succulents had

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.660
the same numbers, even
though they're not C4.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.844
They come out to be
about a minus 12 compared

00:09:48.844 --> 00:09:51.711
to atmospheric CO2 which is minus seven.

00:09:51.711 --> 00:09:55.080
And it's different than
it was in the past,

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.440
so we have to correct for that.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.990
C3 plants actually take up
their material differently,

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.100
they fix in a three carbon sugar at first.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.810
They come out to be minus 26,

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.420
there is no overlap between C3 and C4.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.030
These are primate foods.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:17.030
These are leaves, fruits,
seeds, herbaceous plants,

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.040
all those kinds of things,
those are primate foods.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.713
These are not primate foods.

00:10:22.671 --> 00:10:26.130
But we're not interested
in the plants, right?

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.340
We're interested in the
animals, we're gonna try to

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.050
figure out what the animals do.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:33.260
The first lab study was by one
of Sam Epstein's post docs,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.270
Michael DeNiro that was
actually my post doc advisor

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:40.040
and so at Cal Tech what they
did is they took grasses

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.420
and they took plants that
had a C3 pathway and they

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.500
fed it to lab rats.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.570
And what they discovered
what that these two actually

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:50.620
mimicked the plants that they ate.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.169
So they actually could see the difference.

00:10:53.169 --> 00:10:58.040
The one issue was, well
okay but we don't know what

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.480
the plants are when we're
looking at these things

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.022
from the Pliocene, the Miocene,
and even the Pleistocene.

00:11:03.022 --> 00:11:06.560
Well, okay you're gonna
get a number but what does

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.600
that tell you about what the plant is,

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.610
or what's going on?

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:12.209
At this end that's C4, you
know at this end it's C3,

00:11:12.209 --> 00:11:14.480
what do you know about this?

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.960
How is it offset from the diet?

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.000
And what we found in this
study is that the offset

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.660
is about 10 per mil.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.210
These are animals with simple guts,

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.450
just like you and I have.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.480
So there was another lab
study that was done on

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.030
yama, of all things and it was done,

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.660
I believe at the University of Utah.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.840
And what they did is
they looked at the offset

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.830
between these large
animals and their diets.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.410
And low and behold, they
are quite different from

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:44.290
one another.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.910
So that means if you're
gonna use what you thought

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.740
was the offset, which is
minus 10, you're gonna have

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.980
problems with an animal
like a yama, a big animal,

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.110
because it's not gonna
give you the same kind of

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:57.763
information about the diet.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.320
This is the reason why, this
is for one of the people

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.530
in the audience, what we
have are cows which are

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.410
ungulous and they also are ruminants.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:12.730
They have a very basic
stomach in the forefront

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.700
of the other parts of
their digestive system

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.180
and what they do is the
house huge vast quantities of

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.010
microorganisms and what they can do, then,

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:27.010
is they can actually ferment
indigestible material.

00:12:27.546 --> 00:12:31.080
They are, cows are non-selective feeders.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.320
If you look at the skull
of the cow it does not have

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.490
any top teeth.

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:37.560
All it's doing is ripping
anything up out of the ground

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.630
and taking it.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:42.194
And so all the bovids in
east Africa are this kind of

00:12:42.194 --> 00:12:43.780
animal.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:48.780
The ones we're gonna
compare to our hominids.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.830
Horses, on the other
hand, for those of you--

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:55.973
If you live here you know
exactly what a horse looks like.

00:12:55.973 --> 00:12:58.730
I didn't know that much
about horse digestive system

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:01.450
until I was looking at
this to teach my courses.

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.490
They also have a pretty
massive digestive system,

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:06.100
but it's all hind gut.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.660
It is not in the stomach,
it's in the hind gut.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:12.010
So they actually are far more
selective feeders because

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:15.623
any toxin that comes in,
which gets taken care of by

00:13:15.623 --> 00:13:20.623
the ruminants microorganisms,
cannot be handled by a horse.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:25.520
That's why horses have
such more sensitive diet

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.720
requirements.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.269
If you look at a horse skull
it has both upper teeth

00:13:30.269 --> 00:13:32.260
and lower teeth, that allows
it to pick out exactly

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.060
what it wants to eat.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.160
These are primates.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.700
Those don't look really anything
like either one of these.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:43.550
So why do we think that we
can compare our primates,

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:47.830
our hominids directly
to browsers and grazers?

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:51.293
Either zebra or to bovids in east Africa.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.730
If you look at all living
primates, we've got a prosimian

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:58.300
here, you've got monkeys,
you've got an ape,

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.863
they are all C3.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.450
If you look at old world
monkeys, whether you've got

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:08.330
a cercopithencine, a
colobine, what the baboons do,

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:13.060
what a douc langur does
in Asia, they are all C3.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.463
Does not matter whether they
have a large stomach or not.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.380
Baboons in very marginal ar--

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:26.000
I went through every study
that was done on living

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.120
primates and what you will
hear is that baboons can

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:29.953
eat grass.

00:14:29.953 --> 00:14:31.020
Yes, they can.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.472
And about five to 10% of their
diet can actually be grass

00:14:34.472 --> 00:14:39.120
and it's only done in one
marginal area out of five

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.300
in Africa.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.950
You also get some poop that
is C4, but when you look at

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.383
their hair or their teeth, they are C3.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.040
So now let's go to the fossil record.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.590
This is from (mumbles) Wood
and I really appreciate

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.878
him allowing me to show this.

00:14:57.878 --> 00:15:00.640
What you have here are
possible archaic hom--

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.410
Possible hominids, you've
got what would be called

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:08.090
archaic hominins and here
you have the megadont,

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.290
the ones that I showed you before.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:13.650
They you get pre-modern
homo and anatomically modern

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:16.280
human, I will not be going up into this.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.220
I wanted to and there just wasn't,

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.480
I didn't think there was
gonna be enough time to do it.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.690
So let's look a little bit
at the skeletons of some

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:26.523
of these.

00:15:26.523 --> 00:15:28.737
I just picked some at random.

00:15:28.737 --> 00:15:32.617
Julia Lee-Thorp in South Africa
can a (mumbles) doing this

00:15:32.617 --> 00:15:35.808
and has done a phenomenal
job of preparing how

00:15:35.808 --> 00:15:40.150
you do enamel to do
carbon isotope analysis.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:43.610
What I hope you see here
is that all of these have

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.000
flared rib cages.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.622
And Leslie Aiello once
said, "Lucy had no waist."

00:15:49.622 --> 00:15:54.009
If you think about it,
even men have waists.

00:15:54.009 --> 00:15:56.750
Because we have a small digestive system,

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:59.210
when we stand up we have
a small digestive system.

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:01.140
These others did not.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.960
But they're all (mumbles)
fermentors because that's

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.097
what all of us are and our relatives are.

00:16:07.097 --> 00:16:11.420
This is homo ergaster, a
very early homo erectus

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.130
and what I think you'll see
is that it does not look

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:17.550
exactly like us, he probably had a waist.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:21.200
So what we're looking at is
a different size digestive

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.033
system.

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:27.900
So in 1999, Matt Sponheimer
and Julia Lee-Thorp published

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:31.450
what I believe is probably
the first paper looking

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:35.582
at carbon isotopes in early
hominids to figure to diet.

00:16:35.582 --> 00:16:39.880
They came up with an average
of minus 8.3 per mil.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:44.115
And quote, "This early
hominid ate large quantities

00:16:44.115 --> 00:16:45.470
"of carbon 13 enriched foods."

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:48.840
And from their perspective,
the thing that made them

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:52.747
on the human lineage is that
we were eating C4 foods.

00:16:52.747 --> 00:16:57.747
Alright what they did, and
I hope you can see this

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:02.810
in this slide, is that they
took the endpoint of C4 foods

00:17:03.074 --> 00:17:05.100
and they took the end point of
C3 food and I'll remind you,

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.349
this is a foregut fermentor,
this is a hind gut fermentor,

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:11.422
it is not a simple gut.

00:17:11.422 --> 00:17:13.750
Either any of them.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:18.690
So what we have here is a
zebra and we have a gerenuk.

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:21.190
But I could've picked
a bunch of other ones.

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:24.020
I don't think you can
compare a primate to that,

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.230
but that's what they did.

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:27.513
And then you take homo--

00:17:27.513 --> 00:17:30.810
This was australopithecus
afarensis I believe at eight

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:33.397
and then they said, "Okay
it's about halfway along

00:17:33.397 --> 00:17:36.617
"the line, massive
quantities of C4 foods."

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.370
There is another way of
doing this and this is what

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:44.770
I started looking at.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:47.480
And that is what if you
think about an offset of

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:52.350
10 per mil, which is what
simple gutted animals have now,

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:55.640
we do roughly, or 14 per mil.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.560
What would be the difference in the diet?

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.020
And what you have are the
blues one are the difference

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.797
if you look at 10 per mil
and the green ones are

00:18:04.797 --> 00:18:06.900
the ones if you look at 14 per mil.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.110
And I'm not saying that either
one of these is correct,

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:12.030
it's somewhere probably in
between and probably varies

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.300
across these different species.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.924
What I think you'll notice is
that virtually all of these

00:18:17.924 --> 00:18:22.924
have low quantities of C4
foods if you buy my argument.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:27.067
Or they are actually C3
feeders like any normal primate

00:18:27.067 --> 00:18:31.537
would be with one exception,
and that is the very robust

00:18:31.537 --> 00:18:35.136
ones in east Africa with
the huge massive chewing

00:18:35.136 --> 00:18:36.370
muscles.

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:41.370
So now, this cannot be
sited, but Fred Grind gave me

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:45.800
permission to point out that
there is a new paranthropus

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.951
at 3.5 million, which would
put it way down in here,

00:18:48.951 --> 00:18:51.930
and it is a C3 feeder.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:56.022
If you look at it, it's either
a mix with very little C4

00:18:56.022 --> 00:18:58.020
or it is C3.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:03.020
So sometime in around one
million to 1.8 million

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.330
we ended up with a major
shift that those animals

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:07.610
became C4.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:09.463
It was not true before that.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.650
So I finished up right
now with when we get to

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:17.470
homo gaster or homo erectus,
the same exact number as

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:21.500
you saw in the australopithecine,
but here I do not think

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:25.560
we're looking at mostly green plants.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.060
I think here we're looking
at meat and we're pretty sure

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.540
and I think we're gonna
have some speakers after me

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.880
that are gonna point out how
far back this probably went.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.930
This is one of Leslie
Aiello's, again, human-like

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:42.549
body shape, probably the
simple gut the way we do.

00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:46.240
I would say that probably
what we're looking at when

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:50.411
we have mixed C3 and C4 is
probably a mix of hunting

00:19:50.411 --> 00:19:55.411
zebra and hunting C3
feeding browsing animals.

00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:01.890
So my conclusions, if we
can consider variation in

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:05.119
diet to appetite, which most people don't,

00:20:05.119 --> 00:20:09.620
in modern fauna, the diets
in early hominins appear

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:13.550
far more varied than
originally appreciated.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:16.980
If we consider metabolic
differences between animals

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:20.723
with simple GI tracts, which
most all primates have,

00:20:20.723 --> 00:20:24.983
and those relying on
extensive fermentation,

00:20:24.983 --> 00:20:28.750
alternative diets become
distinct possibilities.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:29.603
Now thank you.

00:20:30.626 --> 00:20:32.733
(applause)

00:20:32.733 --> 00:20:33.747
Oh wait.

00:20:33.747 --> 00:20:35.452
One last one.

00:20:35.452 --> 00:20:38.090
I just want to say I have
to thank my students,

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:40.410
because if it weren't for my
present and former students

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:42.950
you would not have heard this talk today.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:44.982
(applause)

00:20:44.982 --> 00:20:47.649
(upbeat music)
