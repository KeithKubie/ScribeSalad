00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.880
Honeypots is another component of
the intrusion detection technologies.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.320
Honeypots are decoy systems

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.120
to attract the attackers away
from the critical systems.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.390
By diverting attackers from valuable
systems to honeypots, we can observe

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.060
what the attackers are trying to
do to our systems and networks.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.800
And based on that information,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.750
we can develop strategies
to respond to the attacks.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.720
Typically a honeypot system is
filled with fabricated information

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.790
to make it appear to be
a valuable system on the network.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.570
A honeypot system is instrumented
with monitors and event loggers so

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.750
that any access, or any activity
on the honeypot system is logged.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.730
In order to attract attackers to
a honeypot and keep them there, so

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.810
that we can gather more
information about attacks.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.030
Any attack against a honeypot
is made to seem successful.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.760
Most importantly, a honeypot is not
a real system used by any real user.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.950
Therefore any access to
honeypot is not legitimate.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.080
Most likely, any inbound connection
to honeypot is a network scan or

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.700
direct attack.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.400
In addition,
any outbound traffic from the honey pot

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.170
means that they system is
most likely compromised.
