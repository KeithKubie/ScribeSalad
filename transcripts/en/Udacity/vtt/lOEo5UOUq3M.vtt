00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.080
Today we'll talk about learning by recording cases.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.372
This is our first topic of learning, one of the fundamental elements of

00:00:07.372 --> 00:00:12.730
knowledge-based AI. It is also a first topic in analogical reasoning,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.460
often considered to be a core process of cognition. We'll start talking about

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.760
recording cases in a general sense. Then we'll discuss a specific method for

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.210
recording cases called the nearest neighbor method.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.550
We'll generalize this method into the k-nearest neighbor method and

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.820
end by talking about complex cases in the real world.
