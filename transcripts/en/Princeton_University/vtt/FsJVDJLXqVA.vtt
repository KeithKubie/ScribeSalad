Charlie Metzger '12:
I had the incredible opportunity to take a freshman seminar with Professor Cornel West,

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:16.959 position:98%
Charlie Metzger '12:
so for three hours a week 15 other freshmen and I spent time with probably the most influential

00:00:16.959 --> 00:00:20.339 position:98%
Charlie Metzger '12:
African-American public intellectual in the world. It was just a mind-blowing educational

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:27.339 position:97%
Charlie Metzger '12:
experience. I think the most uniquely Princeton experience I've had so far didn't actually

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.380 position:97%
Charlie Metzger '12:
happen here. It happened on the other side of the world in Vietnam. I had the chance

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.500 position:98%
Charlie Metzger '12:
to study in Hanoi last summer for seven weeks on a program run by the Princeton Institute

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.360 position:97%
Charlie Metzger '12:
for International and Regional Studies with 14 other Princetonians. We went with

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.190 position:97%
Charlie Metzger '12:
three professors -- one of which is a huge superstar in the East Asian Studies Department, and

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.970 position:97%
Charlie Metzger '12:
the other of which is a Princeton alum who single-handedly reopened the embassy in 1995.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.650 position:98%
Charlie Metzger '12:
It really made me realize how incredibly lucky I am to go to a school like this where opportunities

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.000
Charlie Metzger '12:
like that can happen.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.340 position:98%
Paavana Kumar '10:
One of the reasons I came to Princeton was to be able to concentrate on music more, and

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.840 position:98%
Paavana Kumar '10:
to be able to hone my skills as a singer and a pianist. Things I've really enjoyed have

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.300 position:98%
Paavana Kumar '10:
been to sing with the Glee Club and the Chamber Choir. They've had really great performance

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.190 position:98%
Paavana Kumar '10:
opportunities. I've been able to sing in Richardson Auditorium here and to tour other

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.750 position:97%
Paavana Kumar '10:
places like Buenos Aires. I've also toured to Ireland and Los Angeles with my a cappella

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.340 position:97%
Paavana Kumar '10:
group, which was a really great experience. The most exciting experience I've had really

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.100 position:97%
Paavana Kumar '10:
has been to do with the independent work I've been able to do, which I know is something

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.950 position:98%
Paavana Kumar '10:
that sets Princeton apart from other colleges. So for me I came to Princeton because I wanted

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.830 position:98%
Paavana Kumar '10:
to study more in the fields of literature, in the fields of language. I'm also really

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.400 position:97%
Paavana Kumar '10:
interested in music, so I'm writing a senior thesis that has to do with the kind of intersection

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.470 position:98%
Paavana Kumar '10:
between music and literature, and music as narrative strategy, which is really kind of my dream thesis.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.270 position:97%
Eric Plummer '10:
The J.P. and the thesis -- those two projects are where you figure out what you're passionate about.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.920 position:97%
Eric Plummer '10:
Because you can't write a hundred pages or 30 pages for your J.P. on something

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.439 position:98%
Eric Plummer '10:
that you don't care about. That's when you learn the most about yourself, when you're

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.520 position:98%
Eric Plummer '10:
writing your J.P. and your thesis. The happiest surprise was just that the people are who

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.810 position:98%
Eric Plummer '10:
they are, I guess, that I wasn't coming into an environment where I was the only person

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.920 position:97%
Eric Plummer '10:
like me. It's a school for all of us. Because you can get the books and the education at

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.500 position:98%
Eric Plummer '10:
almost any institution in the country, but at the end of the day, the people that Princeton

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.300 position:98%
Eric Plummer '10:
picks to be here are some of the brightest, most talented, people who help you become a better you.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.640 position:98%
Ana Gonzalez '11:
Participating in a civic action service trip run through the Pace Center. I applied and

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.700 position:97%
Ana Gonzalez '11:
was accepted to participate in a trip to the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.310 position:97%
Ana Gonzalez '11:
It honestly was one of the most amazing experiences in my life. There was no other place I would

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.200 position:98%
Ana Gonzalez '11:
have rather been over fall break. It was beautiful to be able to apply so much of what we learned

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.130 position:98%
Ana Gonzalez '11:
in our classrooms here at Princeton. We're learning about theories, and we're reading

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.340 position:98%
Ana Gonzalez '11:
about people, reading about cultures, and to be able to engage a culture and a people

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.069 position:98%
Ana Gonzalez '11:
and offer them some help. We did a lot of grantwriting proposals. It was a glimpse of

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.860 position:98%
Ana Gonzalez '11:
what Princeton hopes to prepare us for. I want to be more involved with the Pace Center

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.000
Ana Gonzalez '11:
now because of my trip.

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:15.569 position:98%
Mike Yaroshefsky '12:
Running for student body president. It was a pretty remarkable experience, especially

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.520 position:97%
Mike Yaroshefsky '12:
the door-to-door campaigning. Being able to go and see 70 percent of campus is something

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.739 position:97%
Mike Yaroshefsky '12:
that I otherwise would not have been able to do. One of the great things is that I had

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.520 position:97%
Mike Yaroshefsky '12:
a great group of friends who were able to support me through the entire campaign -- just

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.540 position:97%
Mike Yaroshefsky '12:
tons of great people helping me out along the way, and that's why I was able to do

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.330 position:97%
Mike Yaroshefsky '12:
it, because I had the help and I had people behind me saying, "Just go for it, Yaro,

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.599 position:98%
Mike Yaroshefsky '12:
you've got this, just do it!" Now that I've taken office, I feel a tremendous amount of

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.720 position:98%
Mike Yaroshefsky '12:
responsibility. I'm an engineer at heart, so a great perk of the job is that I get to

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.150 position:97%
Mike Yaroshefsky '12:
see the inner workings of the student government and the University, and then I get to try

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.379
Mike Yaroshefsky '12:
to make things run more smoothly.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.650 position:97%
Melinda Baldwin GS:
I think what a lot of people don't realize about graduate school is that it is a full-time

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.200 position:97%
Melinda Baldwin GS:
job, and if you don't treat it that way, it's going to be really hard to finish your Ph.D.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.750 position:97%
Melinda Baldwin GS:
Being a graduate student is really nothing like being an undergraduate. It's much more

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.110 position:97%
Melinda Baldwin GS:
like being an apprentice professor. One of the reasons I was really drawn to Princeton

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.730 position:97%
Melinda Baldwin GS:
history is because of the very generous funding package that they're able to put together.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.949 position:98%
Melinda Baldwin GS:
I liked that Princeton didn't think of us as cheap labor. I like that Princeton thought

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:25.139 position:97%
Melinda Baldwin GS:
of us as people who were going to go on to careers beyond graduate school and realized

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.010 position:98%
Melinda Baldwin GS:
that the goal was to turn out people who would go on to successful future academic careers.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.410 position:98%
Melinda Baldwin GS:
And I thought that Princeton history did a really good job of recognizing why we were

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.539 position:97%
Melinda Baldwin GS:
there, what we wanted out of it, and how they could help us get there.
