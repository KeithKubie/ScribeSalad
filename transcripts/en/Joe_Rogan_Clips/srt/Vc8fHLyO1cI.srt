1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,470
The Joe Rogan experience.
Yeah. I don't know, man.

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:08,760
You guys weren't so far ahead of the curve
though. You know, I mean you, you were,

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,660
you had weeds, songs like when,
like what year that was, uh, the,

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,340
the first album was in [inaudible] 91.
Yeah.

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,470
And we started riding for that
album probably a four years prior.

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:27,720
Wow. And uh, you know, the
weed songs, those came about
because we were, we'd heads,

7
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:30,800
you know, we just fuck, fuck
it, let's be ourselves. Right.

8
00:00:30,801 --> 00:00:34,990
A different thing now for people
that were, were fans because uh, I,

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,990
when I was listening to you,

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,020
I was just getting ready to move from
Boston to New York and back then you would

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,600
hear about new hip hop bands
from like friends. Yeah. Like,

12
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,050
like it was all word of
mouth. Yeah. Man, for sure.

13
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:56,100
I would hear about it like somebody that
I think somebody I worked out with had

14
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:59,550
it and I was like, what the fuck is
this? And then like, that's Cypress Hill.

15
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:02,310
I was like, Damn. And we were
trying to be different, you know,

16
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:05,610
I'm not sound like a typical
west coast, you know, group,

17
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,450
because a lot of a lot of west coast
groups at that point, you know,

18
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,040
what the labels were looking for were
Nwa, you know, types and you know,

19
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,570
things like that. Like either,
you know, gangster, west coast,

20
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:19,351
gangster rap,

21
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:23,610
they were looking for that or
either the kid frost Chicano type.

22
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,420
And we didn't want to do that. We don't
want to a foot hold ourselves like that,

23
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,550
you know,
mugs being from New York,

24
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:34,140
he wanted to sort of blend both
worlds, right. So, you know,

25
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:39,000
we went with,
with the east coast type sound with La,

26
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,950
you know, type of slang mixed with,
with east coast slang. And so people,

27
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:46,050
you know, they were like, where
the fuck are these guys from?

28
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,880
And people thought we
were from Cypress Hill,

29
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:51,240
New York because there's a Cypress
hill down there. And, uh, you know,

30
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:54,510
people just didn't really know at first
because we were one of the first groups

31
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:58,890
that didn't put our images on
any of our first, um, you know,

32
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,330
any of our singles or, or our art covers.
We never did like the, the shots, like,

33
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,570
you know,
that,

34
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:08,460
that were existing at that time where
it's a clean shot of the group or the

35
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,250
artist or whatever. We were
always on some, you know,

36
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:14,040
cause we were metal heads too,
you know, before the hip hop.

37
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,970
We liked the obscure metal albums.
So we didn't, we were like,

38
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,590
we're not going to put
ourselves on the covers.

39
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:22,980
We're just going to do these crazy
obscure covers and make people, you know,

40
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,870
try to guess who we are. Be Mysterious,
Dan. We talk about longevity. I mean,

41
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:28,704
you guys,

42
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,240
you guys have been around a long fucking
time and Craig is dropped off at all.

43
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,660
It's crazy. You know. Um,
we, we didn't expect it.

44
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,870
We didn't know how long I run would
be. We just kept working. You know,

45
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,580
we always had a strong work ethic. We
were never the types just to sit around.

46
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,080
We're always doing something, you know,
mugs is always making beats. Um, you know,

47
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,880
I'm always writing to something,
I'm always into one project or another.

48
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:58,020
So it was always just about keeping
busy and, and that, that, uh,

49
00:02:58,021 --> 00:03:02,660
suited as well. It's crazy. 28
years later still banging it.

50
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:07,630
It's crazy. When you say 28 years,
28 years later from your first album,

51
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:11,800
man, again, you guys never dropped
off for a second. Not once.

52
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,670
You were always there. You have to
be consistent in hip hop, you know,

53
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,040
in music in general,
especially like if,

54
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,880
if there's a time where radio stops
playing your music or you know,

55
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:26,850
as MTV stopped playing music videos
in and they went for more, um,

56
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,360
reality show type programming, you
got to, you got to stick out there.

57
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,060
So for us it was, you know,
constantly doing shows.

58
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,620
We didn't put out as many albums as we
could of, but we thought less was more,

59
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,730
you know, instead of like drive
in the music into your heart,

60
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:46,050
like a steak or something like
that. We would just, you know,

61
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,900
let everything breathe for a while.
And there was, there was a time where,

62
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:52,720
you know,
we sort of let go of doing everything.

63
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,040
It was like a six year period where
we just kinda took off. We, we didn't,

64
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,960
we weren't away completely.

65
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:03,400
We're still doing like sporadic shows
here and there to keep up the profile,

66
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:04,900
but we weren't like touring.
Yeah.

67
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:05,520
Okay.
