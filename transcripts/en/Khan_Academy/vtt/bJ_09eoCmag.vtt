00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.830
In the last video, we started
to talk about how to

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.840
parameterize a torus,
or a doughnut shape.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.670
And the two parameters we were
using, and I spent a lot of

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.750
time trying to visualize
it, because this is all

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:12.660
about visualization.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.950
I think this is really the
hard thing to do here.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.490
But the way we can parameterize
a torus, which is the surface

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.860
of this doughnut, is to say say
hey, let's take a point let's

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.790
rotate it around a circle.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:26.580
It could be any circle.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.000
I picked a circle
in the z-y plane.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.670
And how far it's gone around
that circle, we'll parameterize

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.320
that by s, and s can go between
0 all the way to 2 pi, and then

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.990
we're going to rotate this
circle around itself.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.480
Or I guess a better way to say
it, we're going to rotate the

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.860
circle around the z-axis, and
it's all at the center of the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.290
circle, so we're always going
to keep a distance b away.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.800
And so these were top
views right there.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.590
And then we defined our second
parameter t, which tells us how

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.180
far the entire circle has
rotated around the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.920
z-axis access.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.150
And those were our two
parameter definitions.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.780
And then here we tried to
visualize what happens.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.350
This is kind of the domain
that our parameterization

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.820
is going to be defined on.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.140
s goes between 0 and 2 pi,
so when t is 0, we haven't

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.870
rotated out of the z-y plane.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.910
s is at 0, goes all the
way to 2 pi over there.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.510
Then when t goes to 2 pi, we've
kind of moved our circle.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.460
We've moved it along,
we've rotated around

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.970
the z-axis a bit.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.950
And then this line in our s-t
domain corresponds to that

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.490
circle in 3 dimensions,
or in our x-y-z space.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.650
Now given that, hopefully we
visualize it pretty well.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.540
Let's think about actually how
to define a position

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.520
vector-valued function that is
essentially this

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.140
parameterization.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.360
So let's first to do
the z, because that's

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.660
pretty straightforward.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.860
So let's look at this
view right here.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.580
What's our z going to
be as a function?

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.240
So our x's, our y's, and
our z's should all be

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.690
a function of s and t.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.780
That's what it's all about.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.340
Any position in space should
be a function of picking a

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.300
particular t and
a particular s.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.800
And we saw that over here.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.380
This point right here, let
me actually do that with

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.820
a couple of points.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.690
This point right there,
that corresponds to that

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.790
point, right there.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:26.970
Then we pick another one.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.660
This point right here,
corresponds to this

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.100
point, right over there.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.770
I can do a few more.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.180
Let me pick.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.490
This point right here,
so s is still 0.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.580
That's going to be this outer
edge, way out over there.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.770
I'll pick one more, just
to define this square.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.350
This point right over here,
where we haven't rotated t at

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.800
all, but we've gone a quarter
way around the circle, is

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.920
that point right there.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.400
So for any s and t we're
mapping it to a point

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.530
in x-y-z space.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.950
So our z's, our x's, and
our y's should all be

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.910
a function of s and t.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.690
So the first one to think
about is just the z.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.020
I think this will be
pretty straightforward.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:19.940
So z as a function of s and
t is going to equal what?

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.080
Well, if you take any circle,
remember s is how the angle

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.250
between our radius
and the x-y plane.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.795
So I can even draw
it over here.

00:03:29.795 --> 00:03:33.350
Let me do it in another color.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.910
I'm running out of colors.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.550
So let's say that this is
a radius, right there.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.750
That angle, we said, that is s.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.110
So if I were to draw that
circle out, just like

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.990
that, we can do a little
bit of trigonometry.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.970
The angle is s.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.950
We know the radius is
a, the radius of our

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.890
circle, we defined that.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.760
So z is just going to be the
distance above the x-y plane.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.640
It's going to be this
distance, right there.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.900
And that's straightforward
trigonometry.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.275
That's going to be a, I mean,
we can do SOCATOA and all

00:04:12.275 --> 00:04:14.620
of that, you might want
to review the videos.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.320
But the sine, you can
view it this way.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.210
So if this is z right there,
you could say that the sine of

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.190
s, SOCATOA is the opposite
over the hypotenuse, is

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.750
equal to a z over a.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:37.020
Multiply both sides by a, you
have a sine s is equal to z.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.790
That tells us how much above
the x-y plane we are.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.180
Just some simple trigonometry.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.970
So z of s and t, it's only
going to be a function of s.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.740
It's going to be a
times the sine of s.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.110
Not too bad.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.420
Now see if we can figure out
what x and y are going to be.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.500
Remember, z doesn't matter.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.250
Doesn't matter how much we've
rotated around the z-axis.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.980
What matters is, how much we've
rotated around the circle.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.820
If s is 0, we're just going
to be in the x-y plane,

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.310
z is going to be zero.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.140
If s is pi over 2, up here,
then we're going to be

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.190
traveling around the
top of the doughnut.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.805
And we're going to be exactly
a above the x-y plane, or z

00:05:19.805 --> 00:05:20.700
is going to be equal to a.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.000
Hopefully that makes
reasonable sense to you.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.020
Now let's think about what
happens as we rotate around.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.830
Remember, these two
are top views.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.210
We are looking down
on this doughnut.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.090
So the center of each of these
circles is b away from the

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.410
origin, or from the z-axis,
what we're rotating around.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.220
It's always b away.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.660
So our x-coordinate, or our x-
and y-coordinate, so if we go

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.240
to the center of the circle
here, we're going to be b away,

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.050
and this is going to be b
away, right over there.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.000
So let's think about where we
are in the x-y plane, or how

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.850
far the part of our, what
we're, I guess you could

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:08.280
imagine, if you were to project
our point into the x-y

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.150
plane, how far is that going
to be from our origin?

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.030
Well, it's always going to
be, remember, let's go

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.050
back to this drawing here.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.720
This might be the
most instructive.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.440
This is just one particular
circle on the z-y plane, but

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.910
it could be any of them.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:30.390
If this is the z-axis, over
here, this distance right here

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.230
is always going to be b.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.780
We know that for sure.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.295
And so what is this
distance going to be?

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.110
We're at b to the center, and
then we're going to have some

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.900
angle s, and so depending on
that angle s, this distance

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.650
onto, I guess, the x-y plane,
you know, if we're sitting on

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.310
the x-y plane, how far are
we from the z-axis, or the

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.870
projection onto the x-y plane.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:02.300
Or you can, you know, the
x or the y position.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.850
I'm saying it as many
ways as possible.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.490
I think you're visualizing it.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.260
If z is a sine of theta, this
distance right here, this

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.770
little shorter distance right
here, that's going to

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.300
be a cosine if s.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.640
s is that angle right there.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.000
This distance right here is
going to be a cosine of s.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.670
So if we talk about just
straight distance from the

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.910
origin, along the x-y plane,
our distance is always going

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:41.660
to be b plus a cosine of s.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.860
When s is out here, then it's
actually going to become a

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.910
negative number, and that makes
sense, because our distance

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:47.020
is going to be less than b.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.730
We're going to be at
that point right there.

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:55.180
So if you look at this top
views over here, no matter

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.510
where we are, that is b.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.420
And let's say we've
rotated a little bit.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:03.090
That distance right here, if
you're looking along the x-y

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:10.570
plane, that is always going
to be b plus a cosine of s.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:14.370
That's what that distance
is to any given point.

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:16.760
We're depending on
our s's and t's.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:21.910
Now, as we rotate around, if
we're at a point here, let's

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.980
say we're at a point there, and
that point, we already said, is

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:32.890
b plus a cosine of s, away from
the origin, on the xy plane.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.670
What are the x and y
coordinates of that?

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:36.240
Well, remember.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.430
This is a top-down.

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.115
We're sitting on the z-axis
looking straight down

00:08:40.115 --> 00:08:41.470
the x-y plane right now.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.460
We're looking down
on the doughnut.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.330
So what are our x's
and y's going to be?

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.690
Well, you draw another
right triangle right here.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:49.880
You have another
right triangle.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.400
This angle right here is t.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.520
This distance right here
is going to be this times

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.180
the sine of our angle.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:03.000
So this right here, which is
essentially our x, this is

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:11.410
going to be our x-coordinate, x
as a function of s and t, os

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:18.480
going to be equal to the sine
of t, t is our angle right

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.850
there, times this radius.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.550
Times, we could write
it either way, times

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:28.195
b plus a cosine of s.

00:09:28.195 --> 00:09:30.910
Because remember, how far we
are depends on how much around

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:31.900
the circle we are, right?

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.340
When we're over here,
we're much further away.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.980
Here we're exactly b away,
if you're looking only

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.580
on the x-y plane.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.670
And then over here, we're
b minus a away, if

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.900
we're on the x-y plane.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:48.790
So that's x as a
function of s and t.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:54.790
And actually, the way I defined
it right here, our positive

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:57.750
x-axis would actually
go in this direction.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:02.570
So this is x positive, this is
x in the negative direction.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.710
I could've flipped the signs,
but hopefully, you know, this

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.350
actually make sense that that
would be the positive x,

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:08.370
this is the negative x.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.530
Depends on whether using a
right-handed or left-handed

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.740
coordinate system, but
hopefully that makes sense.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.770
We're just saying, OK, what is
this distance right here that

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.930
is b plus a cosine of s?

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:23.080
We got that from this right
here, when we're taking a view,

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.130
just a cut of the torus.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:30.420
That's how far we are, in kind
of the x-y direction at any

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.330
point, or kind of radially
out, without thinking

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:34.420
about the height.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.920
And then if you want the
x-coordinate, you multiply it

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:43.170
times the sine of t, the way
I've had it up here, and the

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:47.140
y-coordinate is going to be
this, right here, the way

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.500
we've set up this triangle.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.780
So y as a function of s and t
is going to be equal to the

00:10:53.780 --> 00:11:01.260
cosine of t times this radius.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:06.270
b plus a cosine of s.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.030
And so our parameterization,
and you know, just play with

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.170
this triangle, and hopefully
it'll make sense.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:14.500
I mean, if you say that this is
our y-coordinate right here,

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:20.530
you just do SOCATOA, cosine of
t, CA is equal to adjacent,

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.560
which is y, right, this is
the angle right here,

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.000
over the hypotenuse.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.850
Over b plus a cosine of s.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:31.770
Multiply both sides of the
equation times this, and you

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:36.680
get y of s of t is equal to
cosine of t times this

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.790
thing, right there.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.010
Let me copy and paste
all of our takeaways.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.165
And we're done with
our parameterization.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:56.040
We could leave it just like
this, but if we want to

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.550
represent it as a position
vector-valued function, we

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.590
can define it like this.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.950
Find a nice color, maybe pink.

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:10.010
So let's say our position
vector-valued function is r.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:15.580
It's going to be a function of
two parameters, s and t, and

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.530
it's going to be equal
to its x-value.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.010
Let me do that in
the same color.

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.070
So it's going to be, I'll
do this part first.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:31.970
b plus a cosine of s times sine
of t, and that's going to go in

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.510
the x-direction, so we'll
say that's times i.

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:38.390
And this case, remember,
the way I defined it,

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.450
the positive x-direction
is going to be here.

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:43.420
So the i-unit vector
will look like that.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:47.780
i will go in that direction,
the way I've defined things.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:56.710
And then plus our y-value is
going to be b plus a cosine of

00:12:56.710 --> 00:13:04.590
s times cosine of t in the
y-unit vector direction.

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:08.520
Remember, the j-unit vector
will just go just like that.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.460
That's our j-unit vector.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.670
And then, finally, we'll throw
in the z, which was actually

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.330
the most straightforward.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:22.800
plus a sine of s times the
k-unit vector, which is the

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.330
unit vector in the z-direction.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.950
So times the k-unit vector.

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:34.000
And so you give me, now, any s
and t within this domain right

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.530
here, and you put it into this
position vector-valued

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.240
function, it'll give you the
exact position vector that

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.260
specifies the appropriate
point on the torus.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.520
So if you pick, let's just
make sure we understand

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.620
what we're doing.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.860
If you pick that point right
there, where s and t are both

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.430
equal to pi over 2, and you
might even want to go

00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:59.730
through the exercise.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.870
Take pi over 2 in all of these.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.860
Actually, let's do it.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:10.820
So in that case, so when r of
pi over 2, what do we get?

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:15.730
It's going to be b plus a
times cosine of pi over 2.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.060
Cosine of pi over
2 is 0, right?

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.900
Cosine of 90 degrees.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.940
So it's going to be b, right,
this whole thing is going to be

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.920
0, times sine of pi over 2.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.030
Sine of pi over 2 is just 1.

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:34.650
So it's going to be b times i
plus, once again, cosine of pi

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:40.730
over 2 is 0, so this term right
here is going to be b, and then

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:46.650
cosine of pi over 2 is 0,
so it's going to be 0 j.

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:51.110
So it's going to be plus 0 j.

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:54.970
And then finally, pi over 2,
well, there's no t here,

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:56.520
sine of pi over 2 is 1.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.120
So plus a times k.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.230
So there's actually
no j-direction.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:10.950
So this is going to be equal
to b times i plus a times k.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:13.550
So the point that it specifies,
according to this

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.010
parameterization, or the vector
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], is b times

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:17.920
i plus a times k.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:24.840
So b times i will get us right
out there, and then a times k

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.530
ill get us right over there.

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:29.080
So the position of the
vector being specified

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.470
is right over there.

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:33.170
Just as we predicted.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:36.110
That dot, that point right
there, corresponds to that

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:37.570
point, just like that.

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:40.080
Of course, I picked points it
was easy to calculate, but this

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:44.260
whole, when you take every s
and t in this domain right

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:48.180
here, you're going to
transform it to this surface.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.930
And this is the
transformation, right here.

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:56.090
And of course, we have to
specify that s is between, we

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:58.210
could write it multiple ways.

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:04.290
s is between 2 pi and 0,
and we could also say t

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.760
is between 2 pi and 0.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.480
And you could, you know, we're
kind of overlapping one extra

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.860
time at 2 pi, so maybe we can
get rid of one of these equal

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.380
signs if you like, although
that won't necessarily change

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.710
the area any, if you're
taking the surface area.

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:19.370
But hopefully this gives you at
least a gut sense, or more than

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.770
a gut sense, of how to
parameterize these things, and

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:23.850
what we're even doing, because
it's going to be really

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:27.690
important when we start talking
about surface integrals.

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:29.740
And the hardest thing about
doing all of this is

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:30.520
just the visualization.
