00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.760
So we just got some feedback
from Jeremy about our app.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.630
One of the things I wanted you to note
about this is that he didn't have

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.848
trouble with some of the things that we
had trouble with in the first iteration

00:00:08.848 --> 00:00:09.662
of user feedback.

00:00:09.662 --> 00:00:11.474
He had no trouble
finding the check boxes.

00:00:11.474 --> 00:00:14.900
There wasn't any confusion
around task versus event.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.390
And he seemed able to navigate
around the app pretty well.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.800
However, there were a couple of things
that we noticed were a little bit wrong

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.860
with the app still.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.990
Jeremy wanted to actually
input his data into the app.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.110
And Jeremy noticed there were
a lot of extra things in the app,

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.060
that maybe weren't tied to the core
aspects that I was asking him about.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.350
These are things that we'll
look into in the future and

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.670
as we continue to iterate
are things that you would solve.
