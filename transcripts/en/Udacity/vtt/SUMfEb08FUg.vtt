00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.792
m 1 is just equal to negative m 2. These slopes are the same magnitude, but

00:00:03.792 --> 00:00:07.719
opposite signs. This makes sense, intuitively, in terms of how our graph is

00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:11.850
shaped. The slope right here, is as steep as the slope right here, just pointing

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.546
the other direction. This is going to be true of any two points, that are

00:00:15.546 --> 00:00:19.988
directly opposite one another, across that line of symmetry we drew before. This

00:00:19.988 --> 00:00:24.045
is a way then of quantifying that symmetry of the graph. You can imagine also

00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:28.141
that if we flipped one side of the graph over that line of symmetry to the other

00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:30.050
side it would map directly onto it.
