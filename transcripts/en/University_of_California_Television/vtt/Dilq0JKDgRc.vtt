- [Announcer] This program
is a presentation of UCTV

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.193
for educational and
noncommercial use only.

00:00:11.138 --> 00:00:13.721
(gentle music)

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.160
- Good afternoon, my name is Ellen Gobler.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.420
I manage the Graduate Council Lectures,

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.470
and we're pleased to have
all of you here today.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.760
Thank you so much for joining us.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.403
It's my pleasure to
introduce Andrew Szeri.

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:03.986
(audience applauding)

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.180
- Good afternoon.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.020
My name is Andrew Szeri, I'm
Dean of the Graduate Division,

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.580
and we're pleased along with
Graduate Council to welcome you

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.720
to the Charles &amp; Martha
Hitchcock lecture series.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.210
Our speaker today is Neil Shubin.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.870
The story of how the
endowment came to Berkeley

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.040
is a nice example of the
ways in which this campus

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.720
is linked to the history of
California and of the Bay Area.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.480
Dr. Charles Hitchcock was
a physician for the army

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.890
and came to San Francisco
during the gold rush,

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.470
where he opened a
thriving private practice.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.500
In 1885, Charles
established a professorship

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.360
here at Berkeley as an expression

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.240
of his long-held interest in education.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.710
His daughter, Lillie Hitchcock Coit,

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.140
still treasured in San Francisco

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.090
for her personality as
well as her generosity

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.790
with respect to Towers,

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.920
greatly expanded her
father's original gift

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.050
to establish a professorship at Berkeley,

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.270
making it possible for us to
present a series of lectures.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.610
The Hitchcock Fund has become

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.070
one of the most cherished endowments

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.890
of the University of California,

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.590
recognizing the highest distinction

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.953
of scholarly thought and achievement.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.270
Now I would like to invite William Lester,

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.020
Professor of Chemistry and Chair

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.920
of the Hitchcock Professorship Committee,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.690
to say a few words about our speaker,

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.983
Professor Neil Shubin, thank you.

00:02:27.983 --> 00:02:31.150
(audience applauding)

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.640
- Well thank you, Dean Szeri.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.470
Good afternoon.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.210
Although you've heard it
before, I'm William Lester,

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.230
Professor of Chemistry and Chair

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.750
of the Hitchcock Professorship Committee.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.180
On behalf of the Hitchcock Committee,

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.340
I'm pleased to welcome Neil Shubin

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.860
as this year's speaker and the Charles M.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.480
and Martha Hitchcock Lecture Series.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.590
Neil Shubin is a
distinguished paleontologist

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.820
whose research seeks to understand

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.560
the mechanics behind
the evolutionary origin

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.900
of anatomical features of animals.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.470
His work focuses mainly on the Devonian

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.380
and Triassic periods,

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.350
to understand the pivotal

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.740
ecological and evolutionary shifts

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.920
that occurred during that time.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.750
In 2004, after scouring the
Canadian Arctic for six years,

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.350
Shubin and his team unearthed
Tiktaalik roseae crae,

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.020
a fossil fishapod, which
despite its fishlike features,

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.930
had a neck, skull,
ribs, and parts of limbs

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.390
similar to land animals.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.870
This discovery represents the transition

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.290
between fish and four-legged mammals

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.330
that occurred over 350 million years ago.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.650
His announcement about the
discovery of this phenomenon

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.860
on April 6, 2006 in the journal Nature

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.640
made front page news in
newspapers worldwide.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.260
Finding the 375 million year old fossil

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.120
also spurred Shubin to
write the recent book,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.480
Your Inner Fish: A Journey Into

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.460
The 3.5-Billion-Year
History Of The Human Body,

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.990
arguing that fish provide an important

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.533
evolutionary step in human history.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.030
Shubin received his BA from
Columbia University in 1982,

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.050
he earned his PhD from Harvard University

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.830
in Organsimic and
Evolutionary Biology in 1987,

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.290
and in 1996 he was awarded an Honorary MA

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.440
from the University of Pennsylvania.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.280
He was a Miller postdoctoral
fellow at UC Berkeley

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.030
from 1987 to 1989 and held positions

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.980
as an assistant, associate,
and full professor of biology

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.400
at the University of Pennsylvania
before joining the faculty

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.290
at the University of Chicago in 2000.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.140
Shubin in currently the Robert R. Bensley

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.920
Professor of Organismal
Biology and Anatomy.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.550
He serves as the Associate Dean

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.100
of the Biological Sciences
division and as a member

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.083
of the committee on evolutionary biology.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.440
Shubin has been honored with
a Guggenheim Fellowship,

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.530
the Marcus Singer Award,

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.200
and was named Person of the Week

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.550
by ABC News

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.980
for the week of April 7th, 2006.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.980
In addition, he has appeared
on the Colbert Report

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.270
and Public Radio International.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.211
Please join me in welcoming
Professor Neil Shubin.

00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:40.378
(audience applauding)

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.730
- Thank you Dean Szeri, Professor Lester,

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.030
members of the Hitchcock
Committee, my hosts

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.400
in the Department Of Integrative
Biology here at Berkeley.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.060
Thank you for the honor of
being a Hitchcock Professor

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.950
and thanks also for
giving me the opportunity

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.290
to return to Berkeley,

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.660
which is the place of
my intellectual roots.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.463
Much of what I do is
really sort of flowed from

00:06:11.463 --> 00:06:14.290
the concepts, ideas, and approaches

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.650
that I learned during my
time here at Berkeley.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.100
So today we're gonna talk about
the great transformations.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.090
And if you take the four
and a half billion year

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.961
history of our planet,

00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:26.540
you can begin to visualize

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.440
in a number of different ways.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.410
And one of the most
common ways to visualize

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:31.730
the history of our planet,

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.050
is as some sort of
linear series of events.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.350
And so this is one taken from a textbook.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.391
It's from Press and Siever,

00:06:39.391 --> 00:06:42.190
a very prominent geology textbook.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.410
And what you see is this
linear series is depicted

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.880
as sort of a corkscrew so
they can fit it on the page.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.650
And you see the various
events and the trajectory

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.250
in the history of our planet,

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.390
and the history of life on our planet

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.773
from the presence of the first rocks,

00:06:58.773 --> 00:07:01.730
the earliest visible life
in the fossil record,

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.540
the origin of bodies
and plants and animals,

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.260
and then you see sort of the major events

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.500
in the history of vertebrate life,

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.230
creatures with bones,

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.650
the shift from water to land,

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.370
the shift to the origin
of dinosaurs and so forth.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.240
When you look at the world this way,

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.740
in this sort of linear way,

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.810
from beginning to present,

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.190
what you sort of see is there are times

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.960
that kind of look revolutionary

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.880
or the sort of revolution in the air

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.770
where there are big things happening.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.800
And those time periods have
always attracted my attention

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.170
for one reason or another.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.540
And that's why I've ended up focusing

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.870
on two time periods in
the history of life,

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.100
the Triassic and the Devonian,

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.940
time periods from 200 million years ago

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.130
and about 375 million years ago.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.790
But anyway, I'm gonna show you

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.240
how this kind of way of
depicting the history

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.150
and the sequence of events in our world,

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.410
actually it gets in the way

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.840
of really understanding and decomposing

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.790
some of the main events we see
in the history of our planet

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.580
and life on our planet.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.872
And what I'm gonna do is

00:08:02.872 --> 00:08:04.640
I'm gonna take one particular example,

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.400
one major transformation,

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.150
the shift from fish that lives in water

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.530
to limbed animals that live on land.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.950
I'm gonna take that shift and
really analyze it in detail

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.040
to show you how an integrative approach,

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.020
integrating fossils, and
studies with living organisms,

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.370
can tell us a lot about how
this transformation happened.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:24.930
And I'm gonna use that as a microcosm,

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.110
an example really of how we can approach

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:31.060
all the other transformations
that are out there.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.430
So let's start with the
transformation from water to land.

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:37.660
So here what we have the
transformation from water to land.

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.620
And you see here, I've shown a cartoon.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.080
This is a complete
caricature of the situation.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.790
And if you were to sort
of blue sky this thing,

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.430
on the back of an envelope,

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:47.610
and you know look at a fish,

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:51.310
and look at a land living
vertebrate animal with bones,

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.700
you can sort of say wow
geesh, life in water

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.800
is vastly different from life on land.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.710
Almost every single
system of these creatures

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:58.790
had to change.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.430
And I just showed you
several here, I mean,

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.510
respiration, feeding,
locomotion, and head mobility.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.230
And if you look at the end
states of this transition

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:09.180
it looks really large and
indeed almost impossible.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.250
Now just take a few of
them, take respiration,

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.430
and you have a shift from creatures

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:14.900
that are largely water breathing

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.490
to creatures that are air breathing.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.927
This involves whole sweeps
of changes to organs

00:09:18.927 --> 00:09:21.074
and the ways that organs develop,

00:09:21.074 --> 00:09:24.990
and circulatory systems,
and lungs and so forth.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.960
Feeding, feeding in water

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.680
is very different from feeding in land.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.270
You go from where you have water

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.410
where you can suck the food into the mouth

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:35.900
by changing the volume of the mouth cavity

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.360
to biting, where on land you can't suck in

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.700
unless you're a Hoover
Dustette or a vacuum cleaner.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.910
It's really more of a biting approach

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.610
to the capturing and chewing food.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.170
Locomotion is completely
different on land from water.

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:52.520
I mean, here you have water supported,

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.790
where you basically have to
support yourself in gravity,

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:55.900
it's not gravity supported,

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.830
but it's basically you're
dealing with gravity as a force.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.660
And the skeleton had to change

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.440
from a water supported to
actually dealing with gravity

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.633
as a force, on the
ground, on the substrate.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.250
And there's all kinds of other
changes associated with this.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.110
Head mobility, you know fish have heads

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.650
that are largely connected to the body

00:10:16.581 --> 00:10:18.610
by a series of bones so
when you move the head

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.470
you move the rest of the body.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:21.900
They don't have necks whereas

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:22.733
land living creatures have necks,

00:10:22.733 --> 00:10:24.950
their head can move
independently to the body.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:26.520
Now for this whole talk
I could have gone through

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.560
a whole long list of things

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.890
from excretion, reproduction,

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.530
and all kinds of different systems

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:31.800
that would have to change.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.020
And when you look at these
systems, you'd say golly gee,

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.560
I don't see how this
transformation could ever happen.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.850
So my sort of goal for the last 20 years

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.220
has really been to look at this in detail.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.510
To try to collect new fossils,

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.310
to try to collect understandings from

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:48.100
living recent creatures

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:52.120
that tell us a lot about how fish achieve

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.820
this important shift in evolution.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.930
This was sort of the
state of affairs in 1987.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:00.220
This is a textbook written
by one of my predecessors

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.600
at the University of
Chicago, Len Rodinsky.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.450
And I saw this in 1987
in a graduate seminar

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.100
and it really attracted my interest.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.980
'Cause what he showed is a
lobe-finned fish on the top.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.360
This is a creature from about,

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.220
the first ones of these appeared

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.120
about 380 million years ago.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.800
And on the bottom you see
an early limbed creature.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.450
This is a creature from Greenland,

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.850
at least that's what we thought
it looked like at the time,

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:26.140
from about 365-ish or
so million years ago.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.297
And I remember looking at this and saying,

00:11:27.297 --> 00:11:29.307
"Golly gee, this is a big transition.

00:11:29.307 --> 00:11:31.600
"There's a lot for features
that have to change."

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.500
And to approach this,
it became pretty clear

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.333
that if we wanted to address this,

00:11:35.333 --> 00:11:37.320
we had to find new fossils.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.150
In fact if we wanted to find new fossils

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.500
that bridge this gap,

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.460
we had to find whole new
places to look for fossils.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.040
So off we went to start looking for places

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.024
to find new fossils to tell us about

00:11:48.024 --> 00:11:50.063
this important anatomical shift.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.750
And so like paleontologists everywhere,

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.170
there are actually some simple rules to go

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:56.940
when you want to design a new expedition

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.490
to look for fossils.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.520
We look for places in the
world that have sort of a

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.550
convergence of three things.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.440
The first is you look
for places in the world

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.110
that have rocks of the right age

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.330
to answer the question
that you're interested in.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.501
I mean so I'm interested in
the shift from water to land

00:12:11.501 --> 00:12:15.290
and fish, so it's no mystery
that I'm interested in rocks

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:20.290
around 380 to 365 or so million years old.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.850
The next thing is you look
for rocks of the right type.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:26.680
Not every kind of rock preserves fossils.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.410
Sedimentary rocks preserve fossils

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.650
better volcanic or metamorphic ones.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.390
And indeed within the sedimentary rocks

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:35.100
there are certain
depositional environments,

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.130
environments where those rocks were formed

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:40.180
which are more likely
to preserve fossil bone

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.550
than others for a variety of reason.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:46.250
One because they might reflect
areas where creatures lived.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:48.470
The other is, because they were formed

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:52.930
in very gentle environments
with little erosion

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.300
so that whatever fossils were there

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.283
were preserved in some detail.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.664
The third variable is really important.

00:12:58.664 --> 00:12:59.850
Actually it's one of
the most important ones.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:01.954
It does me no good if my wonderful rocks

00:13:01.954 --> 00:13:04.420
of the right age and the right type

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.390
are buried five miles underground.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.850
I mean these rocks have to
be exposed to the surface.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.210
I mean what we do as paleontologists

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:12.393
is walk over rocks for long days,

00:13:13.331 --> 00:13:15.490
just to find bones weathering out.

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:17.550
So it's really exposures,
rocks of the right age,

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:18.950
and rocks of the right type.

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:21.540
There's a third variable when
I stated out on this quest.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.350
And that was lack of money.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:26.360
And so I started on my,
this is really true.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.780
I started my first academic job

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.880
after leaving Berkeley as a Miller Fellow,

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.589
I moved to Philadelphia as
a young assistant professor

00:13:34.589 --> 00:13:37.160
here in the southeastern
portion of the state.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.261
And what I wanted really
was a field program

00:13:40.261 --> 00:13:44.010
that I could do on the cheap,
or on weekends out of my car.

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:47.030
You know paying like
turnpike tolls and gas money.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.930
And the first thing I did was obviously

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:52.150
pulled out a geological map
of New York and Pennsylvania

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:53.610
and the first thing you
see when you pull out

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.020
a geological map of New
York and Pennsylvania

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.550
is you see that the place is just littered

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.470
with Devonian Age rocks.

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:02.015
So I basically stripped out everything

00:14:02.015 --> 00:14:04.860
unimportant out of the
state of Pennsylvania

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:08.240
and what's left here is
the Devonian. (laughs)

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.949
And you can see, I mean it's
loaded with Devonian Age rocks.

00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:14.920
And these span an age pretty
much in the late Devonian

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.540
is the ones I was interested in.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.440
And these are rocks about
365 million years old

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.730
from the Catskill
Formation and they extend

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.620
into New York and into the
Catskills, hence the name.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:25.660
So it's pretty clear,

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.470
from about a three hour
drive from Philadelphia,

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:33.376
you know I had access
to Devonian Age rocks.

00:14:33.376 --> 00:14:35.290
Got even better when we started to look

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:38.810
at the geology of these rocks
and what geologists knew.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:41.250
The Pennsylvania State Geological Survey

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.870
was mapping these rocks for years

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.950
and concocted a cartoon really version

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:48.380
of what Pennsylvania
was like at this time.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.760
If you wanna think what
Pennsylvania was like

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.290
in the Devonian, get
Pittsburgh, Harrisburg,

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:56.610
and Philadelphia out of your
brain and think Amazon Delta.

00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:59.870
This is really just a cartoon
of the reconstruction.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:01.880
Essentially a series of highlands

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.550
to the eastern part of
the state of Pennsylvania,

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:07.350
and an inland sea to the
west, called the Catskill Sea.

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:08.480
So if you look at the Devonian rocks

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.010
of Pittsburgh or Cleveland,

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:13.940
you'll find they're marine
rocks from this inland sea.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.873
And a series a rivers that
drain from east to west.

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.420
Now if you're a paleontologist

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.460
interested in the transition

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.670
from fish to limbed animal,

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.620
and you wanna find
fossils along those lines,

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:27.750
this is perfect.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:30.230
Because you can sample if you're lucky,

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:33.300
ancient seas, ancient estuaries,

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.460
all the way up the stream if you're lucky.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.530
I was also lucky in this regard

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:41.490
because a graduate student
started working with me.

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:42.323
This is Ted Daeschler here,

00:15:42.323 --> 00:15:43.410
this is a picture of us last year,

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:44.480
not when he was a graduate student.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.464
We were a lot younger when
this whole thing started.

00:15:46.464 --> 00:15:48.900
But Ted and I have been working ever since

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:52.430
and Ted really has been a
major, major, major part

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:55.890
of much of the work, fossil
work, you're gonna hear about.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:57.180
But Pennsylvania has a problem,

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.300
I mean it has two of these variables,

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.570
it has rocks the right age
and rocks of the right type,

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:03.180
but unfortunately it's not
renowned for its exposures.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:04.600
Pennsylvania's not a desert.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.330
And so it turns out the
best exposures for us

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:08.950
were areas where the Pennsylvania

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:12.710
Department Of Transportation
decided to put in new roads.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.860
What would happen, or
where there are streams,

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.200
but it's actually the road cuts that were

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.590
kind of a critical thing.

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:19.820
What happens is, you know
Penn DOT will come through

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.220
and you know when they want to put a road

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.000
or a bend in a road or widen a road,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.220
what would they do, they'd
blow it up, they blow up rock.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.100
When they blow up rock,
if we were really lucky,

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.950
they'd blow up rock in the Devonian.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:31.390
And if you're super really lucky,

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.590
they'd blow up rock in
you know the right part

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.810
of the delta system of the Devonian rocks.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:41.335
And to his was one area
which was widened in the 70s.

00:16:41.335 --> 00:16:43.210
It's a road about an hour north

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:45.060
of State College, Pennsylvania.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.670
It's a road cut called,
don't be surprised,

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.730
Red Hill, 'cause it's a red hill.

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:53.503
A large road cut and when
it was widened in the 70s,

00:16:53.503 --> 00:16:56.340
it exposed a series of
the strata, the beds here

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.250
which you can see going up.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.720
This is really a fluvial
river environment.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.690
And what you see as you walk through here

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:05.440
are cross-sections of ancient streams.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.850
Ancient streams, their
overbank or marginal deposits,

00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:10.560
sometimes you'll see point bars,

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.430
these streams look like they meander,

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:15.836
it has a very classic sort
of deltaic even part of,

00:17:15.836 --> 00:17:18.950
and some meandering
streams within this area.

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.740
So it's a really rich area.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.120
And you see the scale here.

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:23.890
There's a car and there's
a human being for scale.

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:25.400
What is actually our research program was,

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.480
was to climb up and down
the sides of these hills.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.880
It got a little tricky but pretty soon,

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:34.720
by about 1991 we started to
find all kinds of fossils.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.990
I mean the first things we started to see

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:37.870
were like teeth the
size of railroad spikes

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.750
coming out of the hills here.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:41.400
We started to find jaws
to these creatures.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.600
This is Ted holding one
of our first jaws we found

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.450
out of this thing.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:46.970
It was just the front end of the jaw.

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:49.004
These jaws are like long as your arm

00:17:49.004 --> 00:17:51.400
and you know with teeth
the size of your thumb.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.300
So these are really big monstrous fish

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.810
that are about 16 feet
long, up to 16 feet long.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:18:00.640
So large carnivorous fish
coming out of the rocks here.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.569
We have lots of other kinds
of fish, invertebrate animals.

00:18:03.569 --> 00:18:07.010
This is the sidewall of a fish,
you can see its body armor,

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:08.760
it's got a squashed head here.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.440
Tons of these kinds of things.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.760
And then by about 1993 we started to find

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.680
bits and pieces of early limbed animals.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.880
And this was one that was particularly

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.250
important at the time.

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.340
It's an upper arm bone, the humerus,

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.350
and we started to find a femur,

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:25.670
which is an upper leg bone.

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:27.840
We found other bones of
the skull and so forth.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.770
And this humerus is particularly important

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:34.380
because it was very similar
to a humerus known from

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.297
a Devonian limbed animal from Greenland.

00:18:37.297 --> 00:18:40.210
The one actually I showed
you in a cartoon earlier.

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:41.150
So it was pretty successful.

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.780
We started to find by the mid-90s,

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.010
a whole ecosystem really.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:46.710
And I'm not describing the plants.

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.290
Some of the earliest known forests,

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:52.080
with trees, we found their
leaves and trunks and so forth.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.820
Land was loaded with lots of life,

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.900
scorpion-like and spider-like creatures,

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.710
and many of those from these sites,

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:01.350
and then tons of fish from within here.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:03.130
And this is what this road cut,

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:05.090
Red Hill road cut in
Pennsylvania looked like

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:08.010
when we reconstructed it
with National Geographic.

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:09.330
You know you got that large fish,

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.400
you know with the teeth the
size of railroad spikes.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.220
You have lots of little
armored fish around here,

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.320
and then you had these limbed animals

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.900
with the tetrapods, literally
four legged creatures

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.990
of which there are about
three or four types

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.823
coming out of here.

00:19:21.823 --> 00:19:23.063
It's really remarkable.

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:25.870
But it became really clear

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.180
that to get to the problem

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.500
that I was interested in,

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.800
this transition, we weren't
making a ton of headway.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.460
We were finding tons of fossils,

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:37.240
but these rocks are about
365 million years old.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.800
And what we were picking up at this point

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:42.060
were mostly really well formed tetrapods.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.090
We were picking up some of
these creatures as well.

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:46.850
But from our knowledge of the rocks

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:49.210
and faunas around the
world, it was pretty clear

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:51.230
we were probably in rocks too young.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:53.070
We would have to move back in time.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:54.350
Because to move back in time,

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:56.150
we begin to understand
some of the transition here

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.983
and I just want to run through

00:19:56.983 --> 00:19:58.960
some of the anatomy that's different.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.920
And here you see the
lobe-finned fish on top,

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.555
which we knew was closely
related to limbed animals.

00:20:03.555 --> 00:20:04.720
And just look at the head.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:08.030
You see basic differences in
the architecture of the head.

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:09.480
You know here at the top you see,

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.880
you know these creatures
have like a conical head

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.090
with eyes on either side.

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:15.397
The early limbed animals have got

00:20:15.397 --> 00:20:17.570
almost like a crocodilian kind of head.

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:20.280
It's a flat head with eyes on top.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.180
And the architecture of the bones in here

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.310
actually is somewhat different

00:20:25.496 --> 00:20:27.570
than the fish on top as well.

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.220
If you look at the neck,
fish don't have a neck.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.220
Again as I said before,

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.510
the head is actually
connected to the shoulder

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:34.773
via sort of linkages of bones

00:20:34.773 --> 00:20:37.340
and the head is not independent movable,

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.760
whereas in early limbed animals,

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:39.910
like all their descendants,

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.090
you and I,

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:42.530
have a neck with a head that's
separate from the shoulder

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:46.463
and there's a series of joints
at the base of the skull.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.624
And you know finally, and I
can make a long list here,

00:20:49.624 --> 00:20:51.860
the thing that was
really interesting to me

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.630
was to understand the
shift from fins to limbs.

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:56.570
Fish had fins with fin webbing,

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:57.640
you lose the fin webbing

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.350
when you get to these
early limbed animals,

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.870
and you gain fingers and toes
and wrists and ankles okay.

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:04.550
And we weren't making
a whole ton of headway

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:06.270
in understanding this transition.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:08.230
And it became very clear from what we knew

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.010
and this is what we were finding.

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:11.990
This is the family tree more or less.

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:13.820
Here's limbed animals up here.

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.270
These are the fish that are successfully

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:16.860
mostly related to them.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:17.980
If we wanted to make any headway,

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:19.400
we had to find creatures that were sort of

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.430
more on this branch,

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.790
which would really be able to very clearly

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:24.750
tell us the sequence of keys

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:27.160
or the origin of key features

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.800
that led to the origin of limbed animals.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.120
And to do that,

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.510
when we look at the age of these things,

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:35.300
these things, many of these first appear

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.820
back around 380, 390 million years ago.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:39.660
Some of them continue all the way up.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.960
The earliest limbed animals, tetrapods,

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:45.270
appeared around 363,
365 million years ago,

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:46.480
the good scalable material.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.420
At the time, that's what we knew.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:49.930
But there is a big gap in our knowledge.

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:53.070
We didn't have many faunas
or floras at this age

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.750
really here about 375 million years ago.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:57.913
So we had to move back in time.

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:00.710
And so we began our hunt again right.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:03.250
So you look, remember we\
look for rocks the right age,

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:05.210
rocks the right type and exposures.

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:07.010
And going through it,
it became pretty clear

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:09.790
we had to, we were thinking
about going to Brazil,

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:11.890
we were thinking about
working in Colorado.

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:14.760
Everything changed for us one
day in the winter of 1998,

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:17.240
in my office at the
University Of Pennsylvania.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.630
Ted and I were having an argument

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:20.750
and to settle the argument, I pulled out

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.844
a college undergraduate
geology textbook. (laughs)

00:22:23.844 --> 00:22:26.350
This is I think, the one that
I had was the second edition

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:27.930
of Dott and Batten,
Evolution Of The Earth.

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.440
I believed it was pre-plate
tectonic when it was written.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.160
This book is now I think
in the 11th edition

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.370
or something like that.

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:34.360
We settled the debate

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.988
and as I was thumbing through the book,

00:22:35.988 --> 00:22:40.100
after that little set to,

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:43.780
I came upon this figure in the
textbook in like chapter 14.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.680
And it stopped me in my tracks

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.610
and basically defined my research,

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:49.650
at least in the field
for the next six years.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:51.520
So I want to spend a
second on this diagram,

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.080
it's that important.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.330
It says, Upper Devonian
Sedimentary Facies.

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:57.162
Which means, you know rocks
more of less the right age

00:22:57.162 --> 00:22:58.700
and you know maybe
rocks of the right type.

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.380
And what you see here is
a map of North America,

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.090
here's the United States, here's Mexico,

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:06.340
here's Canada, Greenland, Canadian Arctic.

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:07.740
And superimposed on that,

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.680
is a map of the depositional environments,

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.150
or the environments of rock
formation in the Devonian.

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:15.890
And the western part of North America

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:17.563
was mapped as an ancient ocean.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.980
The rocks there were formed,
the Devonian at least,

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:22.570
were formed in the ancient ocean.

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:25.390
But these authors, Dott and Batten,

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:26.460
with their citations,

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.630
identified three areas around the world

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:30.820
that were formed in ancient Delta systems,

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.130
like the Amazon Delta today.

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:35.234
One of them, the first one
I showed and right here,

00:23:35.234 --> 00:23:36.500
we know about that one right,

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:37.840
that's the Catskill project.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.310
That's where Ted and
I were already working

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:40.383
and finding fossils.

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:44.710
The second one is up in Greenland,

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:45.900
this is East Greenland,

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.500
I already showed you a
limbed animal form there.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.680
This is well known.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.020
But there's a third area
that stopped me in my tracks,

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:54.690
and it's an area extending
about 1500 kilometers

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.620
east to west across the Canadian Arctic,

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:00.130
which was mapped by
these guys and said to be

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:02.480
Devonian Age rocks,
like Devonian Age rocks,

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.590
formed in ancient delta systems,

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.430
completely unexplored.

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:08.840
And that, you know, that
literally stopped us.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.150
So we ran to the library, and
this all happened one morning.

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:13.510
Ran to the library,

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:15.570
and there we started to uncover

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:16.750
a really wonderful story.

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:17.840
And just indulge me

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.990
as I spend a second or
two on this little story.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:25.500
The story begins in 1890s in Norway

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:29.810
where the Norwegians wanted
to run to the North Pole.

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:31.460
There's a race to get to the North Pole.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.250
And the Norwegians had
a really bright idea

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:35.950
to design a ship, a
really strong wooden boat,

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:40.050
and that this wooden boat
would be sitting in the Arctic

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:42.450
and get carried by currents
up to the North Pole.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:43.490
That was their idea.

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:44.720
And they had an explorer named Nansen

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.840
who was a remarkable
individual in many ways,

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.990
who helped design this boat.

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:50.140
And this boat's called the Fram,

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.190
which means forward in Norwegian,

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:54.040
and it's truly a remarkable ship.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.492
This is a boat that took
Nansen furthest North,

00:24:56.492 --> 00:24:57.325
it didn't get him to the North Pole

00:24:57.325 --> 00:25:00.050
but it got him close in the 1890s,

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:01.930
it was eventually to take Amundsen

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:04.510
to the South Pole around 1910,

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:06.600
so it went from north to south.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.090
In the interim, it went
to the Canadian Arctic

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:10.480
with this crew.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.700
And this is the crew led by Otto Sverdrup,

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.329
he doesn't look like
he's a very funny guy,

00:25:15.329 --> 00:25:17.080
but you know what they did

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.810
was for three or four years,

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:21.060
they went up to the Canadian Arctic

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.940
overwintered there on the ship,

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.180
the sole purpose being to understand

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:28.930
the flora, the fauna, and the
rocks of the Canadian Arctic.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:31.440
On the boat was this
gentleman here, Per Schei,

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.585
he's the hero of the story.

00:25:33.585 --> 00:25:34.460
So what they did was,

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.690
they went to Southern Ellesmere Island,

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:39.790
from 1898 to 1902.

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:42.650
And they went to these fjords
down here overwintering,

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:44.100
and it's a pretty harsh
place to overwinter,

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.100
I can tell you that much.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.590
And Schei would get off the boat

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:49.173
and start mapping the geology.

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:51.346
This is Per Schei.

00:25:51.346 --> 00:25:54.200
He started mapping the
geology and you can see,

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.650
here's a fjord he went
to called Goose Fjord,

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:57.850
and he started mapping it out

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:01.600
and he started to pull out bones of fish.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.760
And these were the species of fish,

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.270
the fauna list that he brought about.

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:08.280
Little pieces, rhino
flex and this and that.

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.790
This was actually to be lost.

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:11.070
No one really was to cite this.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:14.200
Per Schei passed away tragically

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.813
after the return of the Fram,

00:26:15.813 --> 00:26:17.915
he died at age 30.

00:26:17.915 --> 00:26:20.500
And this work was
subsequently just picked up

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.130
by a guy named Keran in 1915,

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:23.670
who described it and then this paper

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:24.770
sort of sat in the literature,

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:28.960
never really, never
really cited until 1974.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.270
This gentleman comes along, Ashton Embry,

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:34.730
who mapped, who was partly
responsible for running

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.210
a mapping project in the Canadian Arctic,

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:38.760
mapping the rocks of the Arctic

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.460
for a variety of economic reasons.

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:43.660
And what Ashton did,
is a map in the Arctic,

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:46.240
he really did a precise
map which basically told us

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.230
that we had to work there,

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:48.487
and where we had to work.

00:26:48.487 --> 00:26:51.050
And the paper that did it is this,

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:53.200
and it was published in 1976.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.090
And the reason why I'm
showing you this paper

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:57.530
is there's a single page in the paper

00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:59.320
that basically told us we had to go

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.140
immediately to the Canadian Arctic.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:02.800
And this is the page.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.800
It doesn't look like much,
a lot of words on the page,

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.330
but I'll blow up two areas for you.

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:09.830
Where he talks about
age, blow it up it says,

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:11.440
the available data indicate an age

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.150
of Early to Middle Frannian.

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:15.490
You remember the question
mark I showed you before,

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:17.520
that's the question mark.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.980
Then it really, where we lost it, (laughs)

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:22.850
was essentially when we saw

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:25.050
what he described as the Fram Formation.

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:26.250
The Fram Formation is similar

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:28.850
to the Catskill Formation of Pennsylvania.

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:31.510
So here we had rocks at the question mark

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:34.020
that were similar to the Catskill
Formation of Pennsylvania.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:36.100
This all happened in the morning in 1998,

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:39.557
in you know, in my office in a library

00:27:39.557 --> 00:27:41.090
at the University of Pennsylvania.

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:42.840
We were shaking, there was
nothing else we could do,

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.780
we went to get some Chinese food.

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:47.220
So um, we went for Chinese food,

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.730
I had my kung pao chicken,

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:49.860
and this really sealed the deal.

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.216
I opened my fortune cookie,

00:27:51.216 --> 00:27:52.870
and it said,

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:54.859
soon you will be at the top of the world.

00:27:54.859 --> 00:27:56.420
(laughing)

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:57.860
So I was like, okay we're out of here.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:00.810
Anyway so that got us there.

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:04.150
So um, so this is what,

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:05.118
so we're dealing with Nunavut territory,

00:28:05.118 --> 00:28:06.800
here's the North Pole,

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.820
we're 600 miles or 700
miles from the North Pole,

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:12.510
this is Ellesmere Island
right here, here's Ellesmere.

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:16.730
This is what Ashton maps
as the exposures of the,

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:18.590
of the Devonian the Canadian Arctic.

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:19.930
He named the key formation,

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:22.000
the one that's most like
the Catskill Formation,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.440
after that boat The Fram,

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.630
and it's called the Fram
Formation right here.

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:27.490
So it's actually right at that right edge,

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:28.323
the question mark.

00:28:28.323 --> 00:28:30.710
The earliest-known tetrapods,
limbed animals at the time,

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:31.660
were from up here,

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:34.290
so we're significantly earlier in time.

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:35.640
And again just to show you the cartoon,

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.370
he mapped it as a Delta system,

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:39.860
with a series of Highlands
to the east and north,

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:41.200
and Inland Sea to the west,

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.770
and the series of streams and rivers

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:43.810
draining from east to west,

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:44.643
so off we go.

00:28:44.643 --> 00:28:45.964
It was a little bit of challenge because

00:28:45.964 --> 00:28:47.870
the places up there right,

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:50.160
it's not here where I could
drive with my Subaru to,

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.170
you know Pennsylvania,

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:54.060
it's up here which creates problems,

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.628
I mean logistic problems.

00:28:56.628 --> 00:28:59.230
So the nearest town to us
where we ended up working,

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:00.750
is a couple hundred miles away,

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:02.440
and this is a picture of that town,

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:06.540
with a population of about
170 people in spring.

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.960
It's Grise Fjord, Grise Fjord, Nunavut.

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.850
It's not, you know, not
a hotbed of activity.

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:13.910
So it's quite remote you know,

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:17.210
so everything we bring is fairly precious,

00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:19.233
we bring a small crew as
I'll show you in a second,

00:29:19.233 --> 00:29:22.710
because we get around
through this ferry operation

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:24.920
of helicopters and planes since we're so,

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.440
we're farther than a tank of gas

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.970
could take us in a helicopter,

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:29.672
so fuel has to be ferried in to get us

00:29:29.672 --> 00:29:31.180
to where we want to go.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:33.070
So we take these planes
which land actually

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:34.320
on the rock and Tundra here,

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.133
it's pretty thrilling actually,

00:29:36.133 --> 00:29:38.710
and then, if you define that term loosely,

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:42.410
and then the helicopters
take us into our camps.

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:44.310
Because of that it really
affects the science we can do,

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:46.725
we can't bring big crews and importantly,

00:29:46.725 --> 00:29:48.840
when we find something,

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.910
and ie fossils, which are very heavy,

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:52.510
we can't bring a lot of them back.

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:54.700
And so we leave a lot of
what we find out there,

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.270
and we, you know it's a real decision.

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:57.740
We're out there for five or six weeks,

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.740
and we're making sort of,
hard choices about what stays

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:02.003
and what comes with us.

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:07.240
So we started in 1990, the
fortune cookie was in 1998,

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.040
it took us about a year to raise money,

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.403
and so we went to the western
part of the Arctic first,

00:30:11.403 --> 00:30:12.643
this is what camp looks like,

00:30:12.643 --> 00:30:14.660
it's the personal tents, main tent.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:16.840
What we do is basically,
these are the Devonian rocks,

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.210
and since you have this
freeze thaw in the Arctic,

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:22.730
the bones come weathering
out, quite nicely.

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:24.470
And you know we walk over the rocks,

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:25.480
and when you find bones,

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.790
you look for the layers
that they're coming from.

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:30.720
In 1999 we didn't find much,
we had terrible weather,

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.575
and it turns out we were
actually in much deeper

00:30:32.575 --> 00:30:35.890
ocean ancient deeper ocean,
than we wanted to be.

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:38.750
So following the Delta model,
we had to move upstream,

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:41.500
and what that meant
geologically, is moving east.

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:44.700
And when we moved east to
southern Ellesmere Island here,

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:48.790
that's when we started to
find lobe-finned in abundance,

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:50.080
bits and pieces of them at least,

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.470
along these sort of cliff things,

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:53.233
as we walk up and down the cliffs.

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.710
The big discovery was made by

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:00.160
a college undergraduate Jason Downes,

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.740
who joined us one year
to sort of apprentice.

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:05.804
This is the site Jason was to discover

00:31:05.804 --> 00:31:08.370
in the morning before he discovered it.

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:09.660
So about three hours later,

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:10.780
Ted took this picture.

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:13.220
About three hours later Jason was to walk

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:15.383
over this little patch here, I
don't know if you can see it,

00:31:15.383 --> 00:31:19.630
it's sort of a greenish gray patch.

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:21.150
We didn't know it at the time,

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:22.890
but Jason had discovered,

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:24.900
an enormous quantity of bone.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:27.310
He was late back to camp, it
was actually quite a worry,

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:30.520
but he returned to camp with
pile after pile of bone.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.700
So what we did that night was,

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.710
since it's daylight 24
hours a day in the Arctic,

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:35.370
this is us that night around midnight

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:36.610
or 1:00 in the morning,

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:38.863
actually crawling Jason's site,

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:43.330
to find the layer that Jason's
bones were coming from.

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:47.520
Now this grayish green
carpet here was formed,

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:48.730
I mean I should say a carpet,

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:51.190
of thousands and thousands
and thousands of fish bones

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:53.290
of which you're seeing
like lungfish tooth plates,

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:55.160
and things like that here.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.790
It took us about a year I
should say, I mean a whole year,

00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:00.150
to actually find that layer,
it was actually quite hard,

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:03.030
but when we found it, we
were able to isolate it,

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:04.530
this is Ted here and the crew,

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:11.370
the layer was exposed as
a series of fish skeletons

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:13.230
buried one on top of the other.

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:15.520
So Jason's little carpet of fish fragments

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:16.840
was formed by skeletons,

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.360
mostly you know half skeletons,

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.930
occasionally a full skeleton,

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:23.440
but it was really articulated
material that was coming out.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.120
So we opened up the hole fairly large,

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.126
and this is what it looked like

00:32:27.126 --> 00:32:29.422
in 2006 actually after a while,

00:32:29.422 --> 00:32:30.930
and the big discovery happened here,

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:32.940
with the my colleague Steve Gatesy

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:35.000
who was cracking rock and discovered this,

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.280
I don't know if you're going to see it

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.560
but you the Devonian rock here,

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.470
see this little V and
there's a little slash there.

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:43.090
This little V, he said,
"Hey guys what's this?"

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:46.360
We looked at it, turns out
it's the snout of a fish,

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:49.090
and not just any fish, a flat-headed fish.

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:50.180
You could tell it was flat-headed snout.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:51.420
So remember I showed you before,

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:52.600
conical head, flat head?

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.880
Here I had a flat head
sticking out of the cliff,

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.360
looking me in the eye right.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.660
So I kind of knew we'd found
what we were looking for.

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.090
And so what it became then,

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:02.380
was to remove these things very carefully.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.350
As we remove this one,
we found about four more

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:07.380
of these flat headed fish,
we now have about 20 of them,

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.880
in various states,

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.760
from individual bones to whole skeletons,

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.560
to the skeletons we have about five.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.050
So come home on the bottom
of the helicopter anyway.

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:18.507
So when these came back,
it was in the fall of 2005,

00:33:18.507 --> 00:33:20.450
the preparators take
over and these are people

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:22.120
who work with a needle and pin,

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:25.200
and these things come
back encased in plaster.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.580
And this is Steve's specimen,

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:27.750
they sit for months of the time,

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:29.130
this took several months,

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:30.870
Fred Mollison in Philadelphia did this,

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:32.410
removing the rock grain by grain.

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:36.400
And here you can see after
about six or seven weeks,

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.240
a top of a head was revealed.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.920
This is one orbit where an eye would be,

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.630
this is another orbit
where an eye would be,

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:44.120
looks like you're dealing
with the top of a flat head.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.010
A few more months go by,

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:46.410
and this was starting to be exposed,

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:47.940
here's the head showing itself,

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:49.383
here's one orbit, here's the other,

00:33:49.383 --> 00:33:51.948
this is a shoulder,
and this is a shoulder,

00:33:51.948 --> 00:33:53.290
it looks like we have a neck

00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:55.660
with no connection of
bone to the shoulder,

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:57.170
this thing got really interesting.

00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:58.400
As this was happening,

00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.910
a trial was going on in Pennsylvania,

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:03.453
the Dover trial, Kitzmiller
case where intelligent design.

00:34:05.757 --> 00:34:07.538
And some people were
saying during that trial,

00:34:07.538 --> 00:34:10.760
that whether that there
are no transitional

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.320
fossils with transitional
features in the fossil record,

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.820
and here sitting on our desks,

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.520
both in Chicago and Philadelphia,

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.560
were these things exposing themselves.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:19.690
So as we began to prepare it,

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:21.880
you know here's a fish from
about 380 million years ago,

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.500
here's a early limbed animal,

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.370
from about 365 million years ago,

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:26.340
here's the new fish,

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:28.477
I use that term for lack of a better word.

00:34:28.477 --> 00:34:31.810
What it is, we have the extended size from

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:34.660
about a foot and a half
long to nine feet long.

00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:36.280
The creature here is 4 feet long,

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.920
and only I'm showing you the front half.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.560
You can see it had scales on it's back,

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.660
these have been squashed in,

00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:43.020
scales on it's back and a fin,

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.283
fins with fin wedding,

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:47.890
yet it has a flattish
head with eyes on top.

00:34:47.890 --> 00:34:50.750
It has a real neck so
it's lacking an operculum,

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:53.400
which most fish have.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.494
So it has a mosaic of
features of both fish

00:34:55.494 --> 00:34:57.023
and land living creatures.

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:00.770
So you see as a mosaic
like a lobe-finned fish,

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:03.140
it has fins and scales and primitive jaws.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.320
Like a land-living animal,
it has a neck, wrists,

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.530
flat head and expanded ribs.

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:08.750
So here we have a wonderful fossil

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:10.510
with transitional features,

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:13.100
limbs, heads and so forth.

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.010
So being the discoverers of this creature,

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:16.320
we got to name it,

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:20.290
and so we wanted the name to
reflect its Inuit heritage.

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:21.730
We worked there with the permission

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:22.930
of the Inuit government,

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:25.360
and the Inuit elders,

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.490
they were very helpful to us,

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:29.410
and we wanted the name to
reflect it's provenance.

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:31.770
And so we had a naming
project where we engaged

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:34.510
the Nunavut elders, these
are the Nunavut elders here,

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:36.950
to come up with a name
to meet two criteria.

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:38.120
Criterion number one,

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.450
was a name that was
meaningful to them and to us.

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:43.550
And number two, was a name
that we could pronounce.

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:44.740
And this is the name of the committee,

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:48.142
so that secondary, didn't
lend for a lot of confidence

00:35:48.142 --> 00:35:49.377
that we have a name it yeah.

00:35:49.377 --> 00:35:51.290
Anyway so um, talked
to one of these people,

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:53.900
I believe it's this guy
here, I'm not totally sure.

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.310
But we were talking on the
phone over about a month,

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:57.800
trying to describe what it was,

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.140
and you know I'd said, well
you know we have a fish,

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:02.580
and it comes in rock you know, long pause,

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:03.473
well no, hunters don't find fish in rocks,

00:36:03.473 --> 00:36:05.710
they're in the streams or ocean.

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:07.170
Like no no no, it's a fossil,

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:09.660
and there were so many gaps in
the way to communicate here,

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.830
they had no concept for
fossil and so forth.

00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:14.197
So eventually one conversation
I'll never forget he said,

00:36:14.197 --> 00:36:15.377
"You know, just what is it,

00:36:15.377 --> 00:36:17.200
"tell me what it is and where it lived."

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.862
I said, "Oh it's a it's
a large freshwater fish."

00:36:19.862 --> 00:36:20.695
He says, "Why didn't you just say so,

00:36:20.695 --> 00:36:22.120
"you have yourself a Tiktaalik."

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:23.910
I said, "A Tiktaalik, what's that?"

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:26.510
He said, "It's a large
freshwater fish in our language,"

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:29.320
So that was the, um, how the name stuck.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.270
But anyway back to the biology here.

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:33.497
The um, so we had several of these things,

00:36:33.497 --> 00:36:35.397
and we were very fortunate
to have several specimens,

00:36:35.397 --> 00:36:38.110
because that means we
can now take them apart,

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:40.130
to begin to understand,
how did the bones work,

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:42.340
how did the joints work,
how does, and then,

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:44.870
put the animal together
again to figure out,

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:48.160
how it compares to creatures
along the evolutionary tree.

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.280
And how does it tell us

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.941
about how this great
transformation happened.

00:36:51.941 --> 00:36:53.520
And this is what this is all about.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.850
And so here you're looking at
one of our large specimens,

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:57.080
about nine feet long,

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.260
and you see here's a lower jaw,

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:00.250
here's another lower jaw

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:03.690
so you're looking at it like
this, two jaws like yay.

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:05.360
And it was one specimens like these,

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.040
that we started take limb bones apart.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.830
So we found here's an
upper arm bone, a humerus,

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:10.830
and here's a shoulder.

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:12.271
And so we took all these things out

00:37:12.271 --> 00:37:14.510
and we were really fortunate in that

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:17.480
not only did we have many of
the bones of the of the fin,

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.060
so you take off the fin webbing,

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:20.370
this thing had fin webbing,

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:22.480
and then you see, just like our arm,

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.950
if you were look at your
own arm in the skeleton,

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:25.570
you have one bone, upper arm bone,

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:27.350
two bones in the forearm,

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:30.340
a series of joints here,
that as they go distally,

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:31.527
they can flex and extend,

00:37:31.527 --> 00:37:34.150
and those joints go all the
way out to your fingers.

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:35.450
And that's essentially what you have here.

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:38.740
One bone, two bones, you
have a series of joints

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:39.657
that are capable of flexion,

00:37:39.657 --> 00:37:42.000
just like like your wrists and fingers.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.200
And indeed, we can compare these bones,

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.610
this bone here and this bone here,

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:48.120
to bones that are actually in amphibians,

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.120
creatures for lack of a better word.

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.630
And we can compare them up and down

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:54.060
the file in the evolutionary tree.

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:56.740
What got really interesting is
when we took the bones apart,

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.740
we were able to take each joint apart.

00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:01.190
So what we did was, we
took the shoulder apart.

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:02.600
And here's the shoulder of Tiktaalik.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.590
Here's the socket on the shoulder,

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:06.190
here's the ball on the humerus.

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:08.040
And we can see from the detailed shape,

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.450
what the likely and unlikely
patterns of kinematics,

00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:13.150
of motion of one bone on the
other would be at the shoulder.

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:15.420
Very unusual shoulder in
some ways, it has a ball,

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:17.230
but has a sort of cam-stop here,

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:19.980
which would prevent it from
this action of protraction.

00:38:22.448 --> 00:38:23.780
We could see the elbow of Tiktaalik.

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:26.550
Here's the radius and here's the ulna,

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:27.950
and you can see the sockets,

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:31.263
where they'd fit on the elbow
joint of the distal humerus.

00:38:31.263 --> 00:38:33.650
This is the arm bone and you
can see where they'd fit on,

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:35.480
and you can see how this one facet,

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:39.060
which sort of rotates
this down this side here.

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:41.060
That means this bone could rotate far down

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:43.203
into the plane of the
slide, that's important,

00:38:43.203 --> 00:38:44.650
I'll show you later.

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:46.690
And then we can do it for
every other joint in the thing.

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:48.440
It was really remarkable
to be able to do that,

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.090
and what we're doing now is
actually modeling it digitally,

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:53.600
to see how these bones
would move on one another.

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:54.620
But to give you a sense of all this,

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:55.500
let's just look at the shoulder.

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.339
And I have three creatures here.

00:38:57.339 --> 00:38:59.070
I have one, a lobe-finned fish,

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:00.940
this is a Eusthenopteron,

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.460
here's an early limbed
animal Acanthostega,

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:07.030
and you're seeing the shoulders
here from from the side.

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:08.700
Okay so you're like looking at the animal

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:10.320
from the side like this,

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.580
and here's Tiktaalik.

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:13.440
One of the things is, you
can see the shoulder socket,

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:16.740
here in Acanthostega and you
can't see it in Eusthenopteron.

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:17.770
Well if you pop on the humerus

00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:18.760
you can see the upper arm bone

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:19.610
you can see what that means.

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:23.040
In Acanthostega, this early limbed animal,

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.280
the humerus or upper arm
bone is coming out at you,

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.769
like this, like a crocodile,
so the limb is held

00:39:29.769 --> 00:39:31.890
to the side of the body.

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:33.943
Whereas in fish like Eusthenopteron,

00:39:35.219 --> 00:39:38.723
the humerus is facing backwards like this.

00:39:39.608 --> 00:39:41.740
In Tiktaalik it's different it's rotated,

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.110
that whole joint is rotated,

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:44.770
so it's sort of intermediate in position

00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:48.340
between the bone that faces
to the side in Acanthostega,

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:50.150
and backwards in Eusthenopteron.

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:51.860
And then you just add the other bones in.

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:55.910
If you add the forearm
bones, the radius and ulna,

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:58.260
turns out that the radius
and ulna in Tiktaalik,

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:02.440
just like Acanthostega, are
capable of flexion like yay.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.810
And indeed the radius can rotate inwards,

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:06.680
and work with a motion called pronation,

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:08.930
like moving your thumb inwards.

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:10.240
And when you add the other bones in,

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:12.820
we can begin to see what
Tiktaalik was able to do.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:15.370
Tiktaalik is specialized
into a form of a push-up,

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:18.960
with elbow bent and wrist extended,

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.760
with a small set of
palmish bones it could,

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.810
and remember the fin webbing
is sticking out here as well,

00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:26.930
you can support the body
in a form of a push-up

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:30.960
with a palm-equivalent
flush against the ground.

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.300
What was nice about these specimens too,

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:33.610
and it's something we
haven't really published it,

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:36.010
is the notion that we can begin to see

00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:39.370
how the fin webbing
changes during this change.

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:41.550
So you're looking at the type specimen,

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:43.870
one of the better specimens of Tiktaalik,

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:45.920
from the top, and here you see the fin

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.440
with its fin webbing.

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.100
We have several these
specimens that are intact,

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:51.830
which show the relationship

00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:54.010
between the limb bones I just showed you,

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:55.510
and the fin webbing.

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:56.970
And that's really important,

00:40:56.970 --> 00:41:00.500
because, if you look at a
fish like Eusthenopteron

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.180
and Acanthostega, you see the big shift

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:04.140
in the fin webbing, they lose it.

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:05.570
fish have fin webbing,

00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:07.140
limbed animals do not.

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:08.230
If you look at Tiktaalik,

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:10.120
it's reduced the fin webbing,

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.620
but it's done so in a very important way.

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:15.600
It's done so, not from the outside in,

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.440
but from the inside out.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.880
It's done it over the joints.

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:21.800
So where it's lost the fin
webbing and these big rods,

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:24.300
is over the elbow joint
and over the wrist joint.

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.410
Which totally makes sense,

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:28.923
those are the areas
where the fin would bend.

00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:33.790
So this is a sort of more
or less what we think

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:35.860
what the fin of Tiktaalik was able to do,

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:38.950
function like a paddle, or like a prop,

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:42.220
enabling the creature to do a push up.

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:45.580
This is the reconstruction of
Tiktaalik as it was in 2006,

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:48.280
as a flathead with eyes
on top, pair of nostrils,

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:51.210
has a neck where the head is
separate from the shoulder,

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:54.060
and key in this, is
the loss of many bones,

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.700
including the opercular bone which the,

00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:58.560
a whole series of opercular bones.

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.820
It has a fin webbing and
inside that fin webbing

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:04.370
is an upper arm bones,
forearm bones the equivalence,

00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:06.663
and both proximal carpal
and distal carpal bones

00:42:06.663 --> 00:42:10.110
that is the equivalence of
a wrist, big expanded ribs.

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:11.640
We now know a lot about the hind fin,

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:12.760
with the pelvis and so forth,

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.310
we're lacking the femur

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:16.480
so that's why I haven't drawn it in yet.

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:17.510
One of the key things here

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:19.141
is really understanding
Tiktaalik as a living animal,

00:42:19.141 --> 00:42:21.379
because then we can begin
to see this transformation,

00:42:21.379 --> 00:42:23.329
And that's what we are going to get to.

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:25.220
One of things about Tiktaalik,

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:28.100
is if it's supporting itself
as the appendanges suggest,

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:30.090
on the ground like in a push-up,

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:31.990
that's when the neck
becomes comes quite handy.

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:35.700
If you look at a fish, it has
a head fused to the shoulder,

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:37.220
and it does so by a series of bones

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:39.030
at the back of the skull,

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:42.210
and a series of opercular
bones, a whole opercular series

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:45.000
that connect the cheek to the shoulder.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.500
These bones, I should
say the opercular bones,

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:47.430
have several functions,

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:50.130
they actually connect
the head to the shoulder.

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:52.150
They function in
breathing in fish as well.

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:55.530
They're pumps that draw
water across the gills.

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:57.787
One of the big changes in
the transition to tetrapods,

00:42:57.787 --> 00:42:58.830
the limbed animals,

00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:00.400
is the loss of all these bones,

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.750
so not only do you have a neck,

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:03.930
but you've lost the operculum as well.

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:05.500
And it turns out Tiktaalik
is much the same.

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.700
It's evolved the ability to do push-ups,

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:08.590
and at the same time

00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:10.580
it's lost this whole series of bones here.

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:13.720
And what this shows is,
with this opercular series,

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.770
is how one change, loss of simple bones,

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:19.350
can affect several traits of the creature,

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:22.321
from head mobility, which
is important for locomotion

00:43:22.321 --> 00:43:24.350
and the variety of behaviors it has,

00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:25.530
to breathing as well.

00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:27.370
Because as you lose the operculum,

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:29.060
there are new ways that have to come about

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:30.823
to bring water through the mouth.

00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:35.300
So what's Tiktaalik specialized to do?

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:38.580
Here's the reconstruction
it's a benthic animal,

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:39.950
able to live on the water bottoms,

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:41.400
with a flat head with eyes on top,

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.290
looking at prey as they go by.

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:45.445
It's also an animal that's
able to live at the margin

00:43:45.445 --> 00:43:47.533
of water and land,

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.090
and to feed as a carnivore,

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:51.260
to feed either on fish

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:53.251
or on the large variety of invertebrates

00:43:53.251 --> 00:43:55.080
that are present on land,

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.173
and in the air at this time as well.

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:03.470
So if you look at the
family tree and you plot

00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:05.270
with all the various
characters that we can do,

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:07.310
Tiktaalik turns out to
be very closely related

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:08.297
to limbed animals.

00:44:08.297 --> 00:44:11.508
And so no surprise given all
the features that we found.

00:44:11.508 --> 00:44:13.266
Now to really make sense of this,

00:44:13.266 --> 00:44:14.860
and to get back to the
whole point of the talk,

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:17.230
which is really understanding
great transformations.

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:18.190
Remember I opened with up the fact

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:19.540
that this is an integrative discipline,

00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:20.970
this is something we have to pull in data

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:23.100
from many different lines of inquiry.

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:24.840
When it really comes down,
we have to think of ways

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:27.237
to integrate these studies of fossils.

00:44:27.237 --> 00:44:29.030
And I should say right off the bat,

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:32.550
that Tiktaalik only gains
meaning in relationship

00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:34.280
to the other fossils that
we have in this sequence

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:35.360
in this series here okay.

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:36.690
It alone doesn't tell us anything.

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:38.411
It's this whole batch
of things which tell us

00:44:38.411 --> 00:44:40.043
how this transition happened.

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:43.190
But we really have to begin to think about

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:44.500
what living fish can tell us,

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:47.610
and how they can, what lessons
can we learn from them about

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:51.943
how fish evolved to walk on
land and to live on land.

00:44:51.943 --> 00:44:52.776
And there's a couple things,

00:44:52.776 --> 00:44:54.330
I'm just gonna to isolate three.

00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:56.960
One is, we can study
their genes and genetics.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.720
That is, we can look at the genetic recipe

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.600
that builds the bodies of fish,

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.227
and builds the bodies
of land living animals

00:45:02.227 --> 00:45:04.620
and we can ask the question
what's different among them,

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:06.410
and we can do that at the level of organs,

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:08.000
we can do that the level of tissues,

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.710
we can do that at a variety
of different levels,

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:12.143
with increasing precision every year.

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:14.620
We can look at appendage support,

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:16.690
how do fish support themselves
with their appendage,

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:18.740
what are the models of living organisms

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:21.060
that do this kind of thing today,

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:22.270
and we can look at air breathing.

00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:23.900
How does air breathing happen in fish?

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:25.700
And you know we can do
with, this is arbitrary,

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:27.596
I could add in another four
or five things on here,

00:45:27.596 --> 00:45:29.810
but I wanted to give you
some take-home messages

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:32.360
about what we can learn from living fish.

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:33.740
Well if you look at it,

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:35.200
what I'm going to show you here is,

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.430
what you can see are limbs,

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:38.690
these are fins up here
and limbs down here.

00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:41.640
If you take living creatures
alone, with no fossils,

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.227
we have limbs with one bone, two bones,

00:45:43.227 --> 00:45:45.090
little bones and fingers,

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:46.830
and I'm showing you a chicken and a human,

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:48.070
and they have a one bone, two bone,

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:49.320
sort of finger arrangement as well,

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.800
despite the fact that it's in a fin,

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:53.900
and if you're compare to fish
fins that are alive today

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:56.020
they don't look a whole lot alike.

00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:57.300
Here's a lungfish here,

00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:01.180
a creature Neoceratodus from Australia,

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:03.610
and it has one bone okay down here,

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:04.700
but it doesn't have any other bones

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:05.930
that look very limb-like,

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:07.950
neither do any of these other fins here.

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:09.280
Where the comparison gains meaning

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:12.160
are when we add the fossils
to this evolutionary tree,

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:16.080
that we begin to see this one
bone two bone limb pattern

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:18.710
appearing and evolving in our own lineage.

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:20.490
So if you just take living creatures,

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:22.060
this transition from fin,

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:24.930
I'm sorry from fin to limb, looks vast.

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:27.010
But when we start to
add in the fossil taxa,

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:28.650
the fossil creatures and species,

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:31.220
you begin to see the links between them.

00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:32.560
but really where it's important

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:35.280
is we can study the genetics
and developmental biology

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.410
of living creatures,

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:37.641
in a way that we can't do

00:46:37.641 --> 00:46:41.550
with the ones that have been
dead for 375 million years.

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:43.750
And when we do that, what
we can begin to understand

00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:45.960
is the genetic toolkit and the recipe

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:48.750
that builds the skeleton of an appendage.

00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:50.040
We can begin to ask the question is,

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.648
what are the set of genetic interactions

00:46:51.648 --> 00:46:54.330
that build the pattern
of one bone two bones,

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:55.920
little bones, fingers?

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.549
We begin to ask the question,
what's the genetic recipe

00:46:58.549 --> 00:47:00.330
that controls the number of bones

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:01.560
in different parts of the body?

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.680
It's size and shape and so forth.

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:05.470
And if we do that we can begin to see,

00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:08.120
and by about the late 90s we began to see

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:10.320
that there's a very
characteristic set of patterns

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.490
of gene activity and gene function,

00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:14.000
genes called the Hox genes and others,

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.980
I'm not going to go through them all,

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:18.210
that characterized the
development of limbs.

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:19.600
It's a cascade of events,

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:21.840
of cellular events and genetic events,

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:23.370
that produced the pattern of limbs,

00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:25.910
I'm going to talk about
that more tomorrow.

00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:27.190
However what was really interesting

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:28.640
is we knew what this stuff was,

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:31.970
how it was happening in
chickens and mice and frogs.

00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:33.210
The real surprise came

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:35.740
when we started to look at
these genetic interactions

00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:37.980
and processes acting in fish fins,

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:39.490
and what was truly remarkable,

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:41.670
is that many of the genetic processes

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:44.470
that build the fins and the
skeleton of the fins of fish,

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:46.770
and indeed that pattern
them, are very similar

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:51.740
to those that pattern the
limbs of limbed animals.

00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:53.780
And in fact it's very clear that you know,

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:55.450
if you were to ask the question,

00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:56.840
are there any new genes

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:59.510
that are patterning the
limbs of limbed animals

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:01.110
that aren't in present in fins.

00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:02.770
The answer's likely no.

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:05.070
That is it's not like the
origin of limbs involved,

00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:07.860
necessarily involved the origin
of whole new sets of genes,

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:11.210
it involved whole new sets
of genetic interactions,

00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:13.370
and new ways of genes
being turned on and off

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:14.850
in new places and so forth.

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:17.030
so it's using existing genes in new ways,

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:18.180
and reconfiguring them.

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:22.150
So the genetic, if you want toolkit,

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:24.430
that's necessary to build appendages,

00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:25.370
was already present

00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:27.740
when a lot of these fossils hit the scene.

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:29.963
So the repertoire was already there.

00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:33.530
If we look at appendage
support in extant creatures,

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:35.090
what you'll find is a lot of fish

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:37.460
actually support themselves
with their appendages.

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:40.230
Most famous among this is the mudskipper.

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:42.610
Mudskippers can live on
land for a period of time,

00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:45.150
about 24 hours about the max in the mud,

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:47.993
and they have appendages but
the little type of elbow.

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:50.110
And if you look at frog fish,

00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:53.930
the frog fish is a creature
that can walk in the water,

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:55.940
this is actually an aquatic
creature they can walk around.

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:59.560
It even has a little sort of
elbow and a distal paddle.

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:01.180
What's remarkable about
all these creatures

00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:02.950
that have evolved to sort of walk

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:05.240
or support themselves
with their appendages,

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:08.360
is oftentimes they do it with
equivalent kinds of joints.

00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:11.270
shoulders and and paddles and so forth.

00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:12.780
But in each case that they do it,

00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:14.650
they do it with different bones.

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:16.960
So here is the frogfish fin,

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:19.320
and you remember we have this
one bone two bone little bone

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:21.320
ray pattern, this is nothing like that.

00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:24.340
This is three bones, a big
old plate, a big old rod,

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:27.310
a big old rod here and a
bunch of spikes coming off.

00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:29.770
That's very different
from the limb pattern

00:49:29.770 --> 00:49:31.700
in early, in limbed animals.

00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:33.500
So what you see is when fish,

00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:36.850
that are distantly related to
Tiktaalik and other creatures

00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:38.460
evolved appendage support,

00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:40.310
they evolved similar kinds of joints

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:42.610
but they do it with
different sets of bones.

00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:44.371
Only one lineage did it our way,

00:49:44.371 --> 00:49:48.330
and that's the Tiktaalik
lobe-finned fish of ourlineage.

00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:49.810
Finally you can ask the question you know,

00:49:49.810 --> 00:49:51.650
the creatures that are
doing appendage support

00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:54.230
and walking in mud and so
forth, how they breathe?

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:57.120
Well if you look at the
evolutionary tree of fish,

00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.570
and you ask the question,

00:49:58.570 --> 00:49:59.980
how many of these things
are air breathers?

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:02.350
There are about 30,000
different species of fish,

00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:04.610
say 29,000 of them or so.

00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:06.520
Of those that are looked at so far,

00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:08.442
in the last major monograph
somebody identified

00:50:08.442 --> 00:50:11.200
375 species of air breathing fish,

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.100
which is what's been looked at,

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:13.690
there are certainly a whole lot more,

00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:16.660
in 49 different families
and if you map it to a tree,

00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:18.500
it evolved at least 24 times.

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:21.030
That likely is about three times to love,

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:23.180
based on if you look at
the trees that mapped on.

00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:25.150
So air breathing in fish has evolved

00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:29.070
many times independently
in living extant fish.

00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:30.600
And how do they do it?

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:33.870
The most common way that fish breathe air,

00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:36.240
at least in the evolutionary tree,

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:37.540
is they use lungs.

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:38.900
In fact lungs are primitive,

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:41.150
lungs are primitive to this
thing here, a Polypterus,

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:42.180
to lung fish,

00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:43.400
indeed if you look at Tiktaalik

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:44.920
and where it fits on this tree,

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:46.780
Tiktaalik's right about here.

00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:49.890
So lungs hit the scene
well before Tiktaalik,

00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:51.850
and even its distant relatives

00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:54.230
were around in Devonian streams.

00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:56.979
They evolved in each case
like in the lung fish

00:50:56.979 --> 00:50:59.300
they evolved to allow creatures to breathe

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:01.630
when water gets anoxic and oxygen poor,

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:04.100
they go up and gulp air
in many different ways.

00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:05.580
And there other examples as well,

00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:07.520
there are diverse air breathing
organs in this group here

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:08.870
which is very specious.

00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:11.690
Some of these creatures
vascularize their swim bladders,

00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:13.320
they vascularize their mouths

00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:16.040
there are numerous strategies
for air breathing in fish,

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:18.480
but lungs are the ones
that are actually primitive

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:19.430
to our own lineage.

00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:23.133
So returning to the
initial sort of challenge.

00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:27.794
With air breathing evolving
multiple times independently

00:51:27.794 --> 00:51:31.330
in fish, with the genes
necessary to build limbs,

00:51:31.330 --> 00:51:33.190
already present in fish fins,

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:34.750
with appendage support appearing

00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:36.820
in numerous kinds of fish independently,

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:38.730
with intermediates in the fossil record

00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:40.625
at just the right time
in the fossil record,

00:51:40.625 --> 00:51:43.540
you, you know don't ask the question,

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:45.860
how could this transition
ever have happened.

00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:48.590
Ask the question, why
did it happen only once.

00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:51.128
It's so, this barrier
between water and land

00:51:51.128 --> 00:51:53.560
seems to be very porous,

00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.770
at least for creatures
that are specializing

00:51:55.770 --> 00:51:58.480
for the interface between water and land.

00:51:58.480 --> 00:51:59.740
And why did it evolve only once,

00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:00.700
I can only speculate.

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:02.700
In our lineage and only evolved once.

00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:04.890
Perhaps it's some sort of
ecological king of the hill

00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:07.600
situation where, you have an incumbent,

00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:10.890
and it sort of displaces
any other lineages

00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:12.230
that would evolve to walk on land,

00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:15.080
'cause there's already an
incumbent set of species there.

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:18.900
So all this is in terms
of its extrapolating

00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:20.470
to great transformations.

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:23.347
You know one way of thinking
about great transformations,

00:52:23.347 --> 00:52:25.890
is the popular one you
see day-to-day in cartoons

00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:27.650
and oftentimes in texts,

00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:30.090
which is as a ladder-like
notion of change that is,

00:52:30.090 --> 00:52:32.087
you know one species
leads to another species

00:52:32.087 --> 00:52:34.100
leads to another species.

00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:35.480
That's not how it works.

00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:37.800
that's not how the water
to land transition works,

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.960
that's not how any of the
other great transitions works.

00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:42.770
It's not like Tiktaalik and its kin

00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:43.990
were sitting around thinking,

00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:47.000
oh golly I wanna to evolve
lungs so I can walk on land,

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.170
I wanna evolve wrists to walk on land.

00:52:49.170 --> 00:52:51.240
It was adaptation to life in water,

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:53.460
it was diversification in life in water,

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:55.620
finding new strategies to
live on the water bottom

00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:56.453
in the shallows,

00:52:56.453 --> 00:52:58.330
in the interface between water and land,

00:52:58.330 --> 00:53:00.210
on the mud flats and so forth,

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:03.200
that led to the diverse
adaptations which became useful

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.630
when the need came to walk on land.

00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:08.180
And so what we think about is
evolution not as this ladder,

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:11.410
but as Darwin originally
proposed, as a tree.

00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:12.750
As a tree of evolution

00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:15.043
with a diverse set of strategies evolving.

00:53:16.350 --> 00:53:18.410
And I should say that
there is a unifying theme

00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:19.830
to many of the great transformations,

00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:21.930
I'm gonna just close
with a series of these.

00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:24.047
You can think of the
transformation from something like

00:53:24.047 --> 00:53:26.240
you know the common
ancestor of an acorn worm

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:28.250
and the earliest fish with a skull.

00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:29.470
If you look at this change,

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:31.630
if you look at creatures
both living and long dead,

00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:33.458
what you'd find is a wonderful series of

00:53:33.458 --> 00:53:36.480
creatures with transitional features

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:40.180
between acorn worm and
fish and I should say,

00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:43.590
some of the most important
species in this transformation

00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:46.800
have just been discovered
in the last 30 years.

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:47.640
You could say the same thing

00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:48.960
with any other great transformation.

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:53.360
Take whales and their derivation
from four-legged creatures

00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:54.950
about 50 million years ago,

00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:56.800
you could find fossils that have a series

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:59.667
of transitional features
leading to whales,

00:53:59.667 --> 00:54:02.780
devise a family tree well
supported by characteristics

00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:05.170
which show how this sequence
of changes happened.

00:54:05.170 --> 00:54:08.460
And again the major fossils
that support this transformation

00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:10.200
discovered in the last 20 years.

00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:11.840
And the same thing is true with the shift

00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:14.117
from reptiles to mammals,

00:54:14.117 --> 00:54:17.120
to the evolution of our
own species Homo Sapiens

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:18.610
from our primate relatives,

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:20.200
from birds to dinosaurs,

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:23.040
when underlying all these
transformations is this,

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:25.068
that some of the most important
fossils and understanding

00:54:25.068 --> 00:54:27.450
the great transitions
in the history of life,

00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:29.680
have been discovered in the last 30 years.

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:31.750
and when you think about this field,

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:32.840
these are the great times

00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:34.750
in understanding great transformations.

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:36.810
Nowhere has it become
easier to find fossils

00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:37.650
from around the world,

00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:39.780
to analyze them in new
ways with new imaging

00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:41.460
and new quantitative techniques,

00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:44.540
to study living creatures
with understanding their genes

00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:47.660
and genomes and sequencing
in an ever rapid clip,

00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:50.910
to understand the the
genes that build bodies,

00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:52.200
and control development,

00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:54.830
to understand the
biomechanics of the features

00:54:54.830 --> 00:54:57.690
that these creatures
use to walk and to live,

00:54:57.690 --> 00:54:58.927
to understand the ecosystems

00:54:58.927 --> 00:55:01.300
and the systems that
function as ecosystems

00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:02.350
and the food webs,

00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:05.110
the ways these creatures
would have interacted.

00:55:05.110 --> 00:55:08.300
Nowhere, at no other time in
the history of our science

00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:10.870
has it been a better time to
study the great transformations

00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:13.570
because this is now a
fundamentally integrative field,

00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:14.970
and an integrative biology.

00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:15.852
Thank you very much.

00:55:15.852 --> 00:55:19.019
(audience applauding)

00:55:21.358 --> 00:55:23.941
(gentle music)
