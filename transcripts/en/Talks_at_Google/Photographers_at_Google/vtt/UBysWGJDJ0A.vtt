00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:05.340
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: How many of you guys are
familiar with Rick's work?

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.340
Awesome.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.340
Awesome.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.590
Well, the thing about Rick is his
work is amazing, but he is the best teacher

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.139
and he makes
things so accessible.

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.330
He's such an inspiration and he's
such a giver, and the more you get to know

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.740
him, you
realize he's not -- he's one of those people

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.180
that
doesn't allow fears to hold him back, and

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.930
he's just
awesome person.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.340
And, and he makes beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful photos no matter what the conditions.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.699
So
without further ado.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:32.699
&gt;&gt;RICK: Okay.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.090
Thank you, world-famous Katherine Hall.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.820
[Clapping]
&gt;&gt;RICK: Thank you so much, Katherine, and

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.530
thank
you all for coming.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.340
This is the second time I've spoken
at Google.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.110
It is an honor, it's a pleasure to speak
here and it's very exciting.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.300
I know this is broadcast
all around the world and it's going to be

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.440
be archived so
it'll be on YouTube so this is really, really

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.440
exciting.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.229
And right after this, I'm getting my Google+
T-shirt.

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.330
I
couldn't get to the gift shop before, so right

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.230
after I'm
definitely getting my Google+ T-shirt.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.420
This talk is
going to be about travel photography.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.470
Now, I like to
make my talks interactive so please ask questions

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.470
during
the talk.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.130
If it requires a long answer, well, I'll
answer it afterward.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.380
If it's a short -- you know, like
we were talking about polarizing filters before.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.640
What
does a polarizing filter do?

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.500
I'll answer it during the
session.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.380
But please, you know, ask questions, make
it

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.380
interactive.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.960
It makes it more fun for me and makes it
more fun for you.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.200
And Cliff, do you want to say a few
words before we get going?

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.200
&gt;&gt;CLIFF: Oh, sure.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.200
&gt;&gt;RICK: Come on in.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.670
The world-famous Cliff,
who arranged this whole thing.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.830
&gt;&gt; CLIFF: All right.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.830
Okay.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.830
&gt;&gt;RICK: Oh.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.920
He's getting out his notes.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.720
Rick
Sammon is the Canon explorer of light.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.630
&gt;&gt;CLIFF: Yeah, I'm really mean now.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.630
&gt;&gt; RICK: Okay.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.630
Here we go.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.159
&gt;&gt; CLIFF: I'll have to speak in the mic.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.390
I
mean, we really -- Rick as you already started

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.780
talking
we just really want to welcome you back to

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.780
Google.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.440
It's
always great to have a return visit.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.659
And as you all
probably know Rick is very active on Google+,

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.659
too.

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.549
So
it's really becoming the nexus for photography

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.950
online
and we're really grateful for your -- for

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.630
your use of
the product, and for your sharing these great

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.630
images.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.780
And he is an explorer of light.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.050
And with that, go ahead
and continue.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.980
&gt;&gt; RICK: Okay.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.000
And actually one more person
wants to introduce me -- no.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.100
I'm only kidding.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.750
So this
presentation is about travel photography.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.520
I'm basically a travel
photographer.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.790
The difference between the travel
photographer and the photojournalist -- we

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.660
were talking
about photojournalism before -- a photojournalist

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.110
goes
out and usually shoots just what's there;

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.780
I spend a lot of
time making pictures.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.959
There's a big difference between
taking a picture and making the picture although

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.340
I do
have some photojournalistic-type pictures

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.340
in here.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.710
So
I'm going to start out -- everyone wants to

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.710
be a travel
photographer.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.900
Oh, man, I would love to travel the
world.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.470
I've been to more than a hundred countries.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.030
People say I would love to be a travel photographer.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.200
Well, I'm going to start out with a travel
story, and

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.130
you might want to reconsider how great it
is being a

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.130
travel photographer.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.240
[chuckles] This is one of my favorite
pictures from Antarctica.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.230
I've been to Antarctica
twice.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.671
This looks just like a polar bear.

00:03:01.671 --> 00:03:03.420
This is
amazing, right?

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.920
You can see the eyes, the ears, the
mouth, the paws, it's on its back with its

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.190
knee and its
foot up in the air.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.600
Well, this is my favorite picture.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.780
I took this picture on my first trip to Antarctica
about

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.730
four years ago.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.709
And the thing about my work is.

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.530
I lead
a lot of workshops around the world.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.520
I leave a lot
of -- lead a lot of travel photography workshops.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.640
So
the deal is, I get a free trip in exchange

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.430
for teaching
the people how to take pictures.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.050
It's kind of cool.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.319
But listen to this: There's no such thing
as a free

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.580
lunch because, [chuckling] you know, people
knock on your door at

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.190
9:00 o'clock oh, can you help me clean my
sensor?

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.030
I
can't find out what custom function 42 does,

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.000
and things
like that.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
So it is a lot of work.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.959
It's a lot of fun,
but it's a lot of work.

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.660
Also, it doesn't really matter
what type of camera you have.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.150
I shoot with digital SLR,
some people shoot with smartphone cameras

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.620
-- I think the
mic just went out -- but it doesn't really

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.300
matter for
this talk because the tips I give really apply

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.830
to all
different types of photography.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.700
So let me tell you
about my first trip to Antarctica.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.790
It was amazing.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.910
You
fly from New York to Buenos Aires, and then

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.760
down to
Ushuaia, which is the southernmost-most city

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.039
on the
planet.

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.669
From there, you go across the Drake's Passage.

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:21.669
Three days.

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:27.029
You're on the ship for three days over what
can be the roughest seas in the world.

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:31.010
They can have
60-foot seas here; this time we were lucky,

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.590
but you can
get seasick.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.499
They can give you a shot to put you out if
you want to be out for three days.

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:40.650
But are there any
people of a medical background here?

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.479
Because there are
two stages, clinical stages of being seasick.

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.469
The first
stage is you feel like you're going to die;

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:49.509
the second
stage is you wish you were dead.

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:51.729
[Laughing]
&gt;&gt; RICK: And this is true, because I have

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.849
been
seasick on some of these cruises.

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:56.860
But I went to
Antarctica to photograph -- to photograph

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.750
all the
beautiful animals, the penguins, you know,

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.771
the seals,
all this stuff, but I fell in love -- I fell

00:05:02.771 --> 00:05:04.699
in love
with the blue ice.

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:06.259
The blue ice down there is
incredible.

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:11.589
Here, I'm using a 15-millimeter fish eye
lens on my Canon 5D Mark II, which is a full

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:12.819
frame image
sensor camera.

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:16.610
And again, if you guys have any
questions about like where were we just standing,

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.880
I was
actually wearing my Wellington boots standing

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.880
in the
ice.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.880
I was moving around.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.889
If you have any questions
like that during the presentation, please

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:25.889
ask.

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.419
But you
know I was at the bottom of the world and

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.789
I thought
maybe a 15-millimeter full frame fish eye

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:33.490
lens would
help tell the story about being at the bottom

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.490
of the
world.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.550
I'm also going to throw in some technical
tips

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.550
here.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.259
You see that everything in this scene here
is in focus from the

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:42.460
ship in the back to the foreground here.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.650
To get
everything into scene and focus, what you

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.259
want to do is
use a wide angle lens, set a small aperture,

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:51.940
and focus
1/3 into the scene.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.059
Now that may sound backwards.

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:54.830
You
might think oh, that's so far away.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.360
I want to focus 2/3
into the scene.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.879
You focus 1/3 into the scene.

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:03.169
That'll
give you the -- a maximum amount of the scene

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:04.169
in focus.

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:06.509
You're really setting the lens up for what's
called the

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:07.509
hyperfocal point.

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:10.380
But I fell in love with this
beautiful blue ice.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.129
Just look at these formations.

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:15.710
Now, I'm riding around in a zodiac, which
is an

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:16.979
inflatable boat.

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:20.360
They don't let you get too close to
these because these things can flip over like

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.020
a moment's
notice.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.809
It's very exciting to be down there at the
bottom of the world.

00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:27.749
But look at this ice castle here.

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:29.680
This ice castle is amazing.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.770
So we spent a lot of time
riding around in these zodiacs.

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.330
Before we got going we
were talking about a polarizing filter.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:42.270
The only filter
that I use outside is a polarizing filter.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.559
Polarizing
filter reduces glare on water, glare on ice,

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:48.809
glare on
windows, glare on leaves, but it could also

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:51.759
make your
pictures look sharper because it cuts down

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:55.389
on the
reflections of the moisture in the atmospheric

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:56.389
haze.

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:58.469
It's the only filter I use outside.

00:06:58.469 --> 00:07:01.479
I used to use
gradual filters that are half dark on top

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:04.360
and gradually
go clear on the bottom unless you hold them

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.529
upside down [chuckles lightly]
and it's the opposite way, but that's the

00:07:07.529 --> 00:07:11.189
only filter I
use for my travel photography.

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:14.669
If I'm doing a
waterfall, I'll use a neutral density filter.

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:16.610
When
there's not a lot of color in the scene, like

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.300
you see
here, what I like to do is I like to make

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.289
my pictures a
black and white; I like to make a monochromatic

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:24.289
image.

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:26.800
Here's another example of this beautiful ice
formation.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.500
Now, you notice the pictures are a little
stretched here

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.500
on this monitor.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:36.539
If I go back quickly to the first
picture, you'll see that this is cropped actually

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:38.899
kind
of like the for -- come on in we have first

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:42.699
class seats
and business class seats right over here [chuckles]--

00:07:42.699 --> 00:07:46.689
cropped in
the HD format or the panorama format.

00:07:46.689 --> 00:07:49.740
The first
thing that I do -- I don't know about Katherine,

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.069
but the
first thing that I do is I crop my pictures.

00:07:53.069 --> 00:07:56.779
I try to
get the shot, you know, perfect in camera,

00:07:56.779 --> 00:07:58.099
but I lot of
times you can't.

00:07:58.099 --> 00:08:00.860
I like to crop out, like look at this
picture.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.330
I'm on my monitor here it's cropped -- if
I go

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.240
back -- on my monitor it's cropped square,
but it's

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.409
stretched here.

00:08:07.409 --> 00:08:09.639
But I like to crop out the dead space.

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:12.169
When I took this picture here, there's boring
sky on the

00:08:12.169 --> 00:08:13.800
top, boring stuff on the bottom.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.849
Why include that in
the scene?

00:08:15.849 --> 00:08:17.999
I'm very big on cropping.

00:08:17.999 --> 00:08:21.419
There are some
photographers who say forget it.

00:08:21.419 --> 00:08:23.589
You have to get it
right in camera.

00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:25.050
What I say -- you're shaking your
head.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:27.330
I say to my publishers -- although I'm not
doing

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:31.240
any more books anymore I'm only doing apps,
and E-books,

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.840
and PDFs and things like that -- I used to
tell my

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.170
publishers, in a nice way, I used to say crop
my

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:40.500
pictures and you're a dead man [chuckles]
because I don't want

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.350
people to crop -- you know, you spend so much
time.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:43.830
This is your art.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:48.120
Never underestimate the importance of
cropping out that stuff.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.080
So taking pictures in
Antarctica is not really that hard.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.180
You know, it's so
beautiful, you have so many different subjects,

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.580
it's
overcast a lot of the times so you don't have

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.340
that high
contrast to deal with.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:04.120
What's hard about shooting in
Antarctica is A, getting there, it takes two

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.600
days to get
there; and B, putting on the Wellington boots,

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.770
putting
on the long underwear, putting on the waterproof

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.800
pants,
putting on the waterproof jacket, putting

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:16.040
on the life
jacket, bringing gloves that let you operate

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.590
your
camera.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.470
This is the hard part of shooting in
Antarctica.

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:24.810
It's not really finding the subjects or
doing the -- manipulating the controls.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.190
What's really
interesting is what I was down in Antarctica,

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:32.320
there was
scientists from Wildlife Conservation International,

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.291
National Geographic, the Smithsonian, and
they're

00:09:35.291 --> 00:09:37.220
studying the ice.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.550
If you look at this ice formation
over there, they're trying to figure out why

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.170
the ice is
starting to look like penguins.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.800
They just can't figure
it out.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:50.820
So anyway, this is one of my favorite pictures
taken on the first trip.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.660
Here's the cropped version of
it.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.930
If you have a web site, I tell people -- oh,
this

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.250
is what I forgot to say.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.970
Susan knows this.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.610
If
someone's cell phone goes off during a presentation,

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:04.800
I
always make this -- you know what?

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.120
I have to put a
slide in.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:11.000
I always make them come up here and do the
twist for 60 seconds, but I forgot to say

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
it.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.780
[laughter] I forgot
to say it so it's okay.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.310
Anyway, look how nice this
picture looks dressed up with a little bit

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:20.710
of drop
shadow, with a frame around it.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.780
First impressions when
you do a web site are very, very important.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.710
Put your
best work out there, ask your friends, you

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:30.090
know, to help
you select your best picture, your best design,

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:31.370
stuff
like that.

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:36.110
Anyway, I did go to photograph the animals,
I love the blue ice, they have these beautiful

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.560
Gentoo
penguins down there.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.370
When I travel, I take basically
two lenses.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:45.930
I have a two bodies, a Canon 7D and a Canon
5D Mark II.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:51.940
On the 7D, which is a crop sensor image
camera, I have a telephoto zoom, either a

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.550
100 to
400-millimeter zoom or a 70 to 200, depending

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.700
upon how
far away the animals are.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.980
In Antarctica, the animals
aren't hunted to you can get as close as this,

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:02.980
or even
closer.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.910
You could touch them in Antarctica.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:08.410
So I have
the telephoto lens on the crop sensor camera

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:11.800
because
animals are far away that crop sensor doesn't

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.850
really
bring you closer, but it's like you're getting

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:14.850
closer.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.180
And on the full frame image sensor camera
what I have is

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:22.800
a wide angle zoom, usually a 17 to 40-millimeter
zoom,

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.000
maybe a 24 to 105-millimeter zoom, and I always
have a

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.990
fish eye with me, too.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:32.060
I don't carry a lot of lenses,
as Susan will tell you.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.021
I don't have a lot of lenses --
actually, I don't have a lot of lenses so

00:11:35.021 --> 00:11:36.310
I don't carry
a lot of lenses.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.340
You don't need, you know, a ton of
lenses.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.610
I lead workshops where people show up and
they

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.650
have those belts, you know, and they have
like eight

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.590
lenses here, they have their backpacks with
nine more

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:49.480
lenses here, and they miss all the shots.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.850
I like to
have my cameras handy over one shoulder, if

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.800
I have the
wide angle lens -- wide angle lens -- wide

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.540
angle zoom on
my camera body and on the other -- the telephoto.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:04.720
Anyway, this was taken with the 100 to 400-millimeter
zoom and the background was very distracting

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.700
so I'm
shooting at a wide aperture.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:11.220
I'm shooting at a wide
aperture to blur the background.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.400
In wildlife
photography and in people photography, I do

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.450
the same
thing when I find a subject.

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:20.010
I take what's called the
environmental shot -- these are nesting albatrosses

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.870
on
Diego Ramirez Island -- I like to take what's

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.380
called the
environmental shot.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:28.950
The subject in the environment, and
then I like to go in and take the closeup

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:30.800
so I'm telling
the story.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.440
I don't know what shot I'm going to like
best later, I don't know which one someone

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.570
may buy, but
if you do it both ways, again, and having

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:41.650
those two
cameras lets you shoot fast, you'll have what

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:45.000
you need.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.620
So when you shoot a subject with a lot of
white in it,

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:52.330
this is going to sound backwards, too.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:53.330
Yes.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.210
[Asking
question in the background]

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:59.620
&gt;&gt;RICK: Why did I chop the legs?

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.670
It looks like
I chopped the legs, but he's actually -- she

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.120
is actually
sitting on a nest.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.210
So these are nesting albatrosses.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:08.210
Okay?

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.530
So they have their nests in these little mud
--

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.760
mud piles here, so from back there it may
look like

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.400
that, but they're actually sitting on the
nest but you

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.400
have a good eye.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:23.090
So anyway, if there's a lot of white
in the picture, like here, you want to -- if

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:25.340
you're
shooting on automatic, you want to set your

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.730
camera on
plus one as a starting point.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:29.920
But, this may sound
backward.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.420
You know you know, hey, there's all this
light.

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:32.420
It's so bright.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.680
I want to set my camera on plus
one?

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.930
Well, you do.

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:40.550
Because all that light, all that
bright area, fools the camera's exposure meter

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:42.880
into
thinking the scene is brighter than it actually

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.860
is and
will underexpose your picture.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.840
I shoot all my pictures,
except my flash pictures -- as you'll see

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.880
in the studio
later when we move over there with Cliff -- I

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.370
shoot
either on the aperture priority mode or the

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.100
shutter
priority mode.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:01.090
A lot of my professional photographer
friends shoot on the aperture priority mode

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.040
or the
shutter priority mode.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.710
If you think about it, there's
only one right exposure; right?

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:09.630
And if you use manual
or aperture priority, or shutter priority,

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:10.740
it doesn't
matter.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:15.540
I found since I've been shooting a long time
that I can just use the exposure compensation

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:19.190
wheel on
my camera to dial in the right exposure very

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:20.190
quickly.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:22.350
And in a case like this, a case like this,
a case like

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:26.110
this, case like this, the depth of field is
the most

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:27.110
important thing.

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:30.400
So why not shoot on the aperture
priority mode?

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:35.810
Set your aperture and then as the light
level changes, the camera will automatically

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:38.520
pick the
correct shutter speed for the existing situation.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.520
Yes?

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.080
&gt;&gt; Male #1: What metering mode do you use?

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.510
&gt;&gt;RICK: What metering mode do I use?

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:48.960
I use the
evaluative metering mode and here's why because

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:53.230
I can
look at a scene like this and say okay, I'm

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:56.490
just going
to set this at evaluative metering.

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:59.700
If I just left it
on zero exposure compensation setting these

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.500
birds would
be a little washed out.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.550
They look a little washed out
here, they're fine on the screen here.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:05.550
Okay?

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:07.600
So
knowing that, that all this dark area would

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.370
fool the
camera's meter into thinking the scene has

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:14.560
all this dark
in it and no white, I have to underexpose

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:15.820
a little in
camera.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.950
So I'm setting my exposure compensation for
a

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:22.010
scene like this a little under, make a third
under.

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.710
The
key in all photography is learning how to

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:26.710
see the light.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.210
If you learn how to seen the light, then you
know how

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.270
you can make adjustments on your camera, knowing
again

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:36.570
that there's only white -- one right exposure
for you.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:39.510
So in seeing the light, it's all about this.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:42.070
It's first
seeing the contrast range in the scene.

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.610
There's not a
lot of contrast in the scene, so here we don't

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:48.610
have to
make that many adjustments exposure wise.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:49.610
Right?

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:51.740
So we
have to learn to see the contrast range in

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:55.400
the scene; we
have to learn to see the direction of light;

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.970
we have to
learn how to see the quality of light, hard

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.420
or soft,
it's soft; and then we have to learn -- what's

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.590
the other
thing about light?

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:04.060
Color.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:07.480
So we have to learn how to
see the contrast range in the scene, the quality

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.320
of
light, the direction of light, and the color

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.320
of light.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.770
Once we learn how to the light, then we can
make the

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:17.000
right adjustments with the -- inside our camera,
or add

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.570
a flash, use a reflector or diffuser, wait
for a

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:23.820
different time of day,, and then after we
do that on

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.550
site, then we can go into the digital darkroom
and work

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:27.850
and play with the light.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:31.320
If you think about it, every
picture I'm going to show you right here has

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.670
exactly the
same main element, and that's light.

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:39.630
So it's very, very
important to learn how to see the light, then

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:41.580
learn how
to control the light, and we'll be talking

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:45.840
about that
more a little in the presentation.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.240
One of my
photography tips -- one of my famous one-liners

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.110
is
"The name of the game is to fill the frame."

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:53.540
I like to
shoot tight.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:57.100
I like -- like here, I like to fill the
frame with the subject, yet there is something

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.589
to be
said for negative space, for dead space.

00:17:00.589 --> 00:17:04.770
So when I give
you these tips, try them and try actually

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:06.990
the total
opposite of them.

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:10.329
But most -- we were talking about
this before when we sat down.

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:14.189
When you're photographing
a person, when you think you're close, get

00:17:14.189 --> 00:17:16.669
closer; when
you're photographing an animal, a building,

00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:18.720
when you
think you're close, get closer.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:23.079
And cropping doesn't
bring you closer, but it emphasizes the subject

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:24.919
a lot --
a lot more.

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:29.029
This is a very basic tip, but I shoot
everything vertically, I shoot everything

00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:30.100
horizontally.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.559
Again,on what I'm going to like, I don't know
what

00:17:32.559 --> 00:17:34.870
someone else is going to like who might want
to buy the

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:35.980
picture.

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:40.409
If I'm going to offer the picture to a
magazine, I don't know whether they have space

00:17:40.409 --> 00:17:41.940
for a
horizontal or a vertical.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.799
Again, a very basic tip, but
I do that.

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:48.139
Again, here are some monochromatic images.

00:17:48.139 --> 00:17:51.440
If the pictures don't have a lot of color,
I'm going to

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.769
make them black and white.

00:17:53.769 --> 00:17:56.299
And when I go somewhere, I'm
trying to tell the story.

00:17:56.299 --> 00:18:00.269
I'm thinking as a magazine
photographer; I'm thinking if I'm putting

00:18:00.269 --> 00:18:02.340
a slide show
together.

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.649
So this would make a nice ending picture for
a slide show.

00:18:05.649 --> 00:18:09.499
Try to tell the story, just don't go to
Antarctica or wherever and say okay, I'm going

00:18:09.499 --> 00:18:12.240
to take a
lot of closeup pictures of this or that.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.580
Try to tell
the story of wherever you go.

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:17.950
So the first trip was
amazing.

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:20.580
I had an unbelievable time.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:24.000
The people liked
me teaching so they said hey, could you come

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000
back?

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.950
So
two years ago they asked me to come back.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:31.539
Now this --
this was a special trip to photograph the

00:18:31.539 --> 00:18:33.179
emperor
penguins.

00:18:33.179 --> 00:18:35.250
People save up their whole lives.

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.779
On their
life list they want to photograph the emperor

00:18:37.779 --> 00:18:38.779
penguins.

00:18:38.779 --> 00:18:41.059
The penguins are about this high, they're
in remote

00:18:41.059 --> 00:18:44.999
colonies, but they are magnificent, magnificent
animals

00:18:44.999 --> 00:18:47.789
so they needed a pro.

00:18:47.789 --> 00:18:49.049
So I said "Sure, I'll go."

00:18:49.049 --> 00:18:52.889
So the company hired me,
but this is a very short trip.

00:18:52.889 --> 00:18:57.299
It was a 12-day trip -- not
counting getting there, okay, which is like

00:18:57.299 --> 00:19:03.480
a day, and
coming It's three days going over the Drake's

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.640
Passage, which
can be the roughest seas in the world, right,

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.620
three days
returning, only six days of shooting.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:14.980
So this is a big
investment for just six days of shooting.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.769
Again, this
is a lifelong dream for people.

00:19:17.769 --> 00:19:21.780
So we leave Ushuaia,
the sky is great, it was sunny, people are

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.149
cheering,
we're having champagne on the bow of the boat,

00:19:24.149 --> 00:19:26.679
the
stern, all the way around the rail.

00:19:26.679 --> 00:19:28.530
It was amazing
going there.

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:32.720
So we're getting closer to Antarctica,
we're getting closer to this emperor penguin

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.890
colony.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:36.169
This is called pancake ice.

00:19:36.169 --> 00:19:37.169
We start seeing this.

00:19:37.169 --> 00:19:38.919
We
see our first tiny little penguin, you can

00:19:38.919 --> 00:19:40.049
see him up
here.

00:19:40.049 --> 00:19:41.619
People are cheering hey, we're getting closer
to

00:19:41.619 --> 00:19:42.720
the colony.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:46.760
Now, this was really like a National
Geographic expedition.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:50.440
We're in this Russian ice
breaker and it's going through the ice, the

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.860
ice is,
like, smashing off the bow at night when we

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:54.860
were
sleeping.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.649
It was so noisy that you really felt that
you

00:19:57.649 --> 00:19:59.830
were on an expedition.

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:02.710
One of my photography tips in
addition to the name of the game is to fill

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:05.559
the frame is
to always look back.

00:20:05.559 --> 00:20:09.320
Everyone's on the bow, here's the
bow crashing through the ice, but I like to

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.879
look back.

00:20:10.879 --> 00:20:14.520
Always look up, always look down, always look
back;

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.889
This'll open up a whole new world of photo
opportunities

00:20:16.889 --> 00:20:17.889
for you.

00:20:17.889 --> 00:20:22.750
So here I look back and I see the path that
this ice breaker is just breaking through

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:24.009
the ice.

00:20:24.009 --> 00:20:26.740
So
we get to Antarctica, the ice is so thick

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:31.659
now the boat
is moving really slow, again, the ice is crashing

00:20:31.659 --> 00:20:33.090
all
around.

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:38.009
The night before -- after three days of
traveling, all right, we get to Antarctica

00:20:38.009 --> 00:20:40.649
the night
before they bring out these two Russian-made

00:20:40.649 --> 00:20:41.649
helicopters.

00:20:41.649 --> 00:20:43.230
Russian ice breaker, Russian helicopters.

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:46.110
How cool is this if you want to talk about
being on an

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:47.200
expedition?

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.690
So they bring them out to test them --
they're bringing them out to test them because

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:53.299
we're
going to fly over to the emperor penguin colony

00:20:53.299 --> 00:20:56.100
because
the ship can't get close.

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:59.250
So they bring them out and it
starts to get overcast.

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:03.539
Now, although there is no such
thing as a bad day for pictures, everyone,

00:21:03.539 --> 00:21:06.639
you know,
they wanted that bright sunlight, they wanted

00:21:06.639 --> 00:21:10.049
the blue
sky, the penguins against the blue sky, and

00:21:10.049 --> 00:21:13.470
also it was
a lot warmer when the sun comes out.

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:16.419
So the captain
says -- he gets on the PA system and he says,

00:21:16.419 --> 00:21:18.249
I don't
know if we're going to be able to go tomorrow

00:21:18.249 --> 00:21:22.480
after
three days on the ship, after one day of trying

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.940
to get
there.

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:27.720
So we go in, have dinner, we come out after
dinner, and the sun comes out.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.341
So everyone's like
really happy and saying I can't believe it.

00:21:30.341 --> 00:21:31.460
This is
going to be great.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:35.700
We go back inside and I'm teaching
photography, I'm teaching Photoshop, light

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.230
room,
teaching all this stuff, getting everyone's

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:38.850
cameras set
up.

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:41.540
We wake up the next morning, and this is what
it

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:42.540
looked like.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.140
It was totally overcast.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.419
Captain gets on
the PA and says, sorry, we're not going anywhere.

00:21:47.419 --> 00:21:49.330
So
this is day one.

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:51.809
Well, on day two to four it snowed.

00:21:51.809 --> 00:21:53.389
[Laughing]
&gt;&gt;RICK: So we couldn't.

00:21:53.389 --> 00:21:57.539
So we're stuck on the
ship and this was, again, a lifelong dream

00:21:57.539 --> 00:21:58.600
for people.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.600
But it got worse.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:04.739
Half the ship, including me, got
what's called the Norwalk virus, and the Norwalk

00:22:04.739 --> 00:22:07.279
virus
is -- he's laughing so I guess you know what

00:22:07.279 --> 00:22:08.279
it is.

00:22:08.279 --> 00:22:10.259
It's the most -- it's like the worst virus
you

00:22:10.259 --> 00:22:11.259
could possibly get.

00:22:11.259 --> 00:22:12.289
You feel like you're going to die.

00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:14.770
I was calling Susan on the ship's phone, I
was telling

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:17.169
her where the will is and stuff like this
because I

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:18.590
really thought I was gonna die.

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:19.759
It's so bad.

00:22:19.759 --> 00:22:22.039
So
this is day two to four.

00:22:22.039 --> 00:22:25.119
So on day five I figured I
have to get off this ship.

00:22:25.119 --> 00:22:28.890
I just have to get off this
ship so I'm taking some snapshots just walking

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:29.970
around
the ship.

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:34.809
And by the way, as the pro, they don't give
you -- they don't give you the best cabin.

00:22:34.809 --> 00:22:37.549
My cabin was
way up on the top left there.

00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:41.139
They give the crew the
top cabins so when the boat swings like this,

00:22:41.139 --> 00:22:45.470
you know,
we get the severest cases of being seasick.

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:49.830
So anyway,
on day six, the last day, there was a mutiny.

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:53.440
The
guests -- we got together actually in a theater

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.830
like
this, and the guests said, we paid all this

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:56.830
money; we
want to go.

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:59.190
So the captain said okay, if you want to
go, we'll go.

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:03.409
So we get over -- we get in the
helicopters, he's flying us over, but here's

00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:04.799
the thing.

00:23:04.799 --> 00:23:08.799
We couldn't land closer than 2 miles -- 2
miles to the

00:23:08.799 --> 00:23:11.299
emperor penguin colony because they didn't
want to scare

00:23:11.299 --> 00:23:14.369
the penguins with the helicopters.

00:23:14.369 --> 00:23:17.129
So with all this
gear -- I have a 40-pound backpack -- Cliff,

00:23:17.129 --> 00:23:20.600
you'll see
most of the gear that I have this afternoon

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.650
--
forty-pound backpack, I've been sick, the

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:25.740
guests have
been sick for all these days, we walk over

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.139
the ice with
our life jackets because you're on ice so

00:23:28.139 --> 00:23:29.860
they set up
this camp there.

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:33.620
So we're getting closer to the emperor
penguin colony and it was really cool seeing

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.299
these
emperor penguins.

00:23:35.299 --> 00:23:36.789
This is how big they are.

00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:39.059
And the
thing is, they're not -- they're not hunted,

00:23:39.059 --> 00:23:41.369
so you can
get very close to these animals just like

00:23:41.369 --> 00:23:44.970
in Galapagos
you can get very close to the animals in Galapagos

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:47.720
because they're not hunted.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.070
So this is one shot that I
took, kind of like this.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:52.700
This is called "Babysitting",
right.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:58.419
It's the adult -- it's the mama emperor penguin
with the chicks, and this is the other.

00:23:58.419 --> 00:24:03.019
You've probably
seen pictures like this on National Geographic.

00:24:03.019 --> 00:24:06.700
Beautiful blue sky, the parents, the chick,
the

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.710
background's out of focus, nice framing.

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:13.230
Well, this
isn't the original shot; this is the original

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:14.230
shot.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:17.009
As
a travel photographer, if a photojournalist

00:24:17.009 --> 00:24:20.399
was there,
he or she would publish this type of picture,

00:24:20.399 --> 00:24:22.690
but
because I'm a travel photographer, I have

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:24.879
the license to
enhance my pictures.

00:24:24.879 --> 00:24:31.389
So what I did is I just added the
gradual filter and increased the contrast

00:24:31.389 --> 00:24:32.389
and
saturation.

00:24:32.389 --> 00:24:36.239
But if there's ever a magazine published
called National Adventure and they want an

00:24:36.239 --> 00:24:39.669
article
Rick's Trip from Hell believe me -- believe

00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:42.240
me, I am
ready to write this article.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:46.690
And the article would
actually be called this: "The Safety of Reminiscence."

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:50.320
Marco Polo had a wonderful saying and the
saying is "An

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.159
adventure is misery and discomfort... relived
in the

00:24:53.159 --> 00:24:54.789
safety of reminiscence."

00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:57.570
like here we're laughing about
this, I'm having a good time, I hope you're

00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:59.519
having a
good time, right?

00:24:59.519 --> 00:25:03.179
But again I felt like I was going to
die.

00:25:03.179 --> 00:25:06.639
On a more serious note, the most important
thing

00:25:06.639 --> 00:25:11.059
that we can do in our photography, I think,
is buy a

00:25:11.059 --> 00:25:12.059
camera -- no.

00:25:12.059 --> 00:25:14.289
[chuckles] The most important thing that we
can do I

00:25:14.289 --> 00:25:16.190
think is set a goal.

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:18.299
Setting goals is so important.

00:25:18.299 --> 00:25:19.960
I
used to tell my son -- Susan and I would tell

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.269
my son
this all the time.

00:25:22.269 --> 00:25:25.610
He set the goal to be the
valedictorian in high school; he achieved

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:26.610
that goal.

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:28.409
You guys are working at Google here.

00:25:28.409 --> 00:25:31.940
You set the goal
to get a job at Google; obviously it worked.

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:34.830
In
photography -- in life and in photography

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:37.070
we must set
goals.

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:42.269
I was teaching a workshop up in Alaska
photographing bald eagles and I was on the

00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:44.690
back of a
boat -- and actually it's a funny story.

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:48.200
I was in the
back of a boat hand-holding my Canon with

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:52.090
a 70 to 200
millimeter F4 lens, which is less expensive

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:55.239
than the 70
to 200 2A lens.

00:25:55.239 --> 00:26:01.279
I'm hand holding this and there's guys
on the back of the boat with $11,000 400-millimeter

00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:04.259
setups with the 400-millimeter 2A lens and
the super

00:26:04.259 --> 00:26:07.529
body and all this stuff, and I'm hand holding
shots.

00:26:07.529 --> 00:26:10.820
You don't need the world's best gear to get
pretty nice

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:11.820
shots.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:12.960
If the lights were a little darker, you'd
see

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.320
that this picture really pops.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.659
But anyway, we're on the
back of the boat and guys are shooting the

00:26:17.659 --> 00:26:19.919
eagles coming
down, shooting the eagles coming up, catching

00:26:19.919 --> 00:26:23.100
the fish,
and I have all these pictures here, but one

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:25.539
morning I
set the goal to get the shot.

00:26:25.539 --> 00:26:27.429
This is the one shot I
really wanted to get.

00:26:27.429 --> 00:26:32.159
I wanted to get a symmetrical
shot of the eagle coming in to catch a fish

00:26:32.159 --> 00:26:34.059
with the
perfect reflection here.

00:26:34.059 --> 00:26:35.299
So I set that goal.

00:26:35.299 --> 00:26:36.730
So what
did I have to do?

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:42.179
I knew I had to use a fast shutter
speed, I knew I had to set my exposure -- underexposure

00:26:42.179 --> 00:26:44.470
just -- underexposing just a little so the
white

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:47.239
feathers weren't all overexposed.

00:26:47.239 --> 00:26:49.889
This is actually the
hardest subject I've ever photographed because

00:26:49.889 --> 00:26:52.929
the
animal's moving fast and you have really dark

00:26:52.929 --> 00:26:56.259
feathers
and dark background against really bright

00:26:56.259 --> 00:26:57.259
feathers
here.

00:26:57.259 --> 00:27:00.639
So anyway, I had to use rapid frame advance;
set

00:27:00.639 --> 00:27:04.350
the exposure right; use AI servo focus, which
is like

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:07.399
focus tracking, it tracks the subject; and
I had to

00:27:07.399 --> 00:27:09.539
focus on a specific area.

00:27:09.539 --> 00:27:13.629
And we actually had the
captain move to boat to an area where we had

00:27:13.629 --> 00:27:15.409
beautiful
reflections.

00:27:15.409 --> 00:27:17.600
We set the goal, I got the shot.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.990
So in
your photography it's very, very important

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:22.419
to set a
specific goals.

00:27:22.419 --> 00:27:26.340
If you go up to Alaska on a trip, it's
not a goal I'm going to get great shots of

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:27.340
bald eagles.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.619
I'm going to get a shot of the eagle with
the talons

00:27:29.619 --> 00:27:30.619
coming out.

00:27:30.619 --> 00:27:34.919
I'm going to get the shot of an eagle, in
one second, of just catching the fish.

00:27:34.919 --> 00:27:37.809
I'm going to get
a shot of the eagle taking off after it just

00:27:37.809 --> 00:27:38.809
caught a
fish.

00:27:38.809 --> 00:27:41.289
I'm going to get a nice action shot like this.

00:27:41.289 --> 00:27:42.289
I'm going to shoot up.

00:27:42.289 --> 00:27:43.580
I'm going to shoot down.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.590
I'm
going to shoot all around.

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:48.820
If you make like a hit list,
again, set that goal.

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:50.450
You'll know where you're going.

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:51.450
Yes?

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:54.139
&gt;&gt; Female #2: So when you were photos of the
eagle, were you

00:27:54.139 --> 00:27:57.090
focusing on the white part on the eagle's
head or the

00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:59.539
darkest--
&gt;&gt;RICK: I was focusing on the body because

00:27:59.539 --> 00:28:01.049
it's
a very small point.

00:28:01.049 --> 00:28:05.860
So I'm actually using the center
focus point on my camera even though my camera

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:09.279
has 45
autofocus points -- you know, these cameras

00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:12.000
today have
all these different focus points -- I'm using

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.429
that AI
servo focus and I want to focus right -- like

00:28:15.429 --> 00:28:18.100
here, like
right on the animal's body.

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:21.350
But talking about animal --
these shots, if you look at all these shots

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:23.139
they have
something in common.

00:28:23.139 --> 00:28:29.309
When I'm photographing animals and
people in most cases if the eye is not in

00:28:29.309 --> 00:28:32.859
focus, if the
eye's not well lit, I feel I've missed the

00:28:32.859 --> 00:28:34.789
shot.

00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:36.019
That's
what I strive for.

00:28:36.019 --> 00:28:40.259
The reason I say most people
photography, if Marlon Brando was here and

00:28:40.259 --> 00:28:43.710
he said hey,
Marlon Brando -- it's really fun to be at

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:47.119
Google -- --
he'd say well, Rick, most of the times that's

00:28:47.119 --> 00:28:48.119
true.

00:28:48.119 --> 00:28:49.899
But
you might remember when I shot the Godfather

00:28:49.899 --> 00:28:51.529
I used top
lighting.

00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:53.570
I used top lighting so the people looking
at

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:56.419
the movie couldn't see into the subject's
eyes because I

00:28:56.419 --> 00:28:58.899
wanted to create a sense of mystery.

00:28:58.899 --> 00:29:01.440
I'm sure,
Katherine, you like the eyes most of the time.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.080
It's
very important in portraiture and wedding

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.679
photographer -- wedding photography to light
the eyes;

00:29:06.679 --> 00:29:07.679
right?

00:29:07.679 --> 00:29:08.679
Okay.

00:29:08.679 --> 00:29:11.639
So anyway, that's the thing in wildlife
photography.

00:29:11.639 --> 00:29:12.820
So what do we do?

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.970
We're actually
positioning the boat so we have good light

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:19.220
on the
animals' eyes.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:23.710
I was talking -- I was giving a talk
down at the California Photo Fest last week

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:26.460
and it was
on composition.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:31.970
How many people here have heard the
composition technique the Rule of Thirds?

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:32.970
Okay.

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:33.970
Just
about everybody.

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:37.840
How many people have heard the
composition technique Rule of Odds?

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.210
Nobody.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:42.039
The Rule
of Odds is actually a very good composition

00:29:42.039 --> 00:29:43.039
technique.

00:29:43.039 --> 00:29:45.580
You put odd things in a picture, they're going
to stand

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:46.730
out.

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:49.100
You put, you know, even things, they don't
stand

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.679
out as much for whatever reason.

00:29:50.679 --> 00:29:55.009
So this has three
dolphins in here -- actually whales before

00:29:55.009 --> 00:29:58.039
rather
than -- and then four.

00:29:58.039 --> 00:30:01.960
So I had a lot of pictures with
four in them, but I liked the shot with the

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:02.960
three.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.229
I
was thinking about that composition technique,

00:30:04.229 --> 00:30:05.989
the Rule
of Odds.

00:30:05.989 --> 00:30:10.609
Simplicity is really important, too so right
here we have just one animal.

00:30:10.609 --> 00:30:12.830
Now, I have these
beautiful patterns here.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:16.129
I'm using that polarizing
filter that we were talking about before to

00:30:16.129 --> 00:30:18.399
cut through
the glare on the water.

00:30:18.399 --> 00:30:22.909
If you're shooting in water,
around water, over water, next to water, you

00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:24.230
want to
bring a polarizing filter.

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:25.230
Yes?

00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:26.230
&gt;&gt; Female #3: Do you like a circular polarizer
or do you just

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:27.230
like the sheet for a polarizer?

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:32.399
&gt;&gt; RICK: Well, the circular -- we used to
have

00:30:32.399 --> 00:30:35.019
what's called the linear polarizing filter
before you

00:30:35.019 --> 00:30:36.889
probably got into photography.

00:30:36.889 --> 00:30:40.120
Now they had to develop
what's called circular polarizing filters

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.820
for the
autofocus cameras; the linear polarizing filters

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:43.880
didn't
work.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.870
But I -- that's what I use.

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:49.649
I like to use the
circular polarizing filters.

00:30:49.649 --> 00:30:51.510
And again telling the
story.

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:53.759
I'm trying to tell the whole story of the
whale

00:30:53.759 --> 00:30:55.899
so I'm doing the whale's tail.

00:30:55.899 --> 00:30:59.149
This picture might look
a little confusing, but what's going on here

00:30:59.149 --> 00:31:00.360
is I was
pretty lucky.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.580
These whales come up and they were eating
the krill.

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:07.169
The reason it looks kind of weird is because
the jaws come -- they distend and they like

00:31:07.169 --> 00:31:09.759
open like
this to the side so they can get the maximum

00:31:09.759 --> 00:31:11.320
amount of
krill.

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.629
It's pretty cool.

00:31:12.629 --> 00:31:15.669
Again, telling the story, watching the background.

00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:17.749
You know, if I took -- this picture could
have been

00:31:17.749 --> 00:31:21.059
taken off Long Island not too far from my
house.

00:31:21.059 --> 00:31:24.010
This
picture looks like it was taken in Alaska.

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:26.779
We want to
take pictures that have what's called a sense

00:31:26.779 --> 00:31:27.779
of place.

00:31:27.779 --> 00:31:30.690
This picture's nice, this picture's nice;
the closeups,

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:33.239
they're nice, but they could have been taken
anywhere.

00:31:33.239 --> 00:31:35.759
. So think about that when you're taking pictures.

00:31:35.759 --> 00:31:38.609
Think
about how can I take a picture that has a

00:31:38.609 --> 00:31:41.159
sense of
place?

00:31:41.159 --> 00:31:45.860
Another tip I want to share with you I learned
from my friend Dr. Dick Zakia, he where to

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:48.279
wonderful
book called "Perception and Imaging".

00:31:48.279 --> 00:31:52.049
"Perception and
Imaging", Dr. Dick Zakia.

00:31:52.049 --> 00:31:54.309
In that book he has nothing
about F-stops and shutter speeds.

00:31:54.309 --> 00:31:58.129
It's all about -- or
raw, or JPEGs, or image sensors, or anything

00:31:58.129 --> 00:31:59.129
like that.

00:31:59.129 --> 00:32:00.919
It's all about -- what he talks about -- what
he talks

00:32:00.919 --> 00:32:04.110
about is why we like pictures, the perception,
and how

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:05.510
it relates to imaging.

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:10.330
But one of his best tips is use
your camera like a spaceship.

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:11.759
I teach a lot of
workshops.

00:32:11.759 --> 00:32:16.570
We were doing a workshop last week down at
the pier, the pier in San Luis Obispo actually,

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:19.919
I
forget, in Cayucos, not too far from San Luis

00:32:19.919 --> 00:32:21.039
Obispo.

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:22.889
Everyone shows up with their tripods and their
cameras

00:32:22.889 --> 00:32:24.419
are like this at eye level.

00:32:24.419 --> 00:32:27.749
When you start using your
camera like a spaceship, you could come up

00:32:27.749 --> 00:32:30.539
with all new different
composition techniques.

00:32:30.539 --> 00:32:34.249
Here I'm on the back of the
boat, I'm holding my camera probably about

00:32:34.249 --> 00:32:37.460
6 inches
above the water with the [chuckles] strap

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.399
on to make sure I didn't
lose it.

00:32:39.399 --> 00:32:43.539
But I wanted to have this feeling of speed
that our boat is like cruising up through

00:32:43.539 --> 00:32:44.669
the water up
in Alaska.

00:32:44.669 --> 00:32:48.960
If I was up like this, it wouldn't have the
same effect.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:53.620
So use your camera like a spaceship; tilt
it up; tilt it down; tilt it to the left;

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:54.620
tilt it to the
right.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.919
If you think about that spaceship technique,
you'll see that you that you will come up

00:32:57.919 --> 00:32:59.739
with different
pictures.

00:32:59.739 --> 00:33:04.169
As far as the composition technique, another
one, leading lines.

00:33:04.169 --> 00:33:07.779
Here we have these leading lines or
leading shapes that are leading the viewer

00:33:07.779 --> 00:33:10.649
right up to
this mountain in the back.

00:33:10.649 --> 00:33:12.330
There are a million
different composition techniques.

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:16.200
I only have time
really to share a few with you with you, but

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.639
contours,
contours are another form of composition.

00:33:19.639 --> 00:33:21.200
This is just
a closeup of this.

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:26.940
Basically I'm doing the same thing I
did with the pictures of the nesting albatrosses

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:27.940
in
Antarctica.

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:31.470
I'm shooting wide and I'm shooting close,
and if I do this, I have enough pictures to

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:34.549
illustrate
all these different composition techniques.

00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:36.720
And here's
one more.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:40.940
I'm photographing this glacier, this
beautiful glacier up in Alaska.

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.629
Fish eye lens,
15-millimeter lens, one of the widest lens

00:33:43.629 --> 00:33:47.990
you could
buy, and then I'm using my 100 to 400 to capture

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:50.779
this,
to tell the -- to show the details.

00:33:50.779 --> 00:33:52.610
Details help to
tell the story.

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:54.149
We can tell the whole story -- not the
whole story.

00:33:54.149 --> 00:34:00.169
We could tell a broader story by using
this wide angle shot here and then a closer

00:34:00.169 --> 00:34:01.169
shot.

00:34:01.169 --> 00:34:02.890
And
speaking of details, here's a nice shot of

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:03.890
an iceberg.

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:06.249
Kind of boring, but look what happens when
we move in

00:34:06.249 --> 00:34:07.690
for a closeup.

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:10.179
This is taken with a 100 to
400-millimeter lens.

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:11.990
I'm looking for patterns.

00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:15.730
Patterns are yet another composition technique.

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:18.680
This is
an HDR shot.

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.280
You guys into HDR?

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.380
Anyone here into HDR?

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:24.380
Just one?

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.380
Two?

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:26.380
Three, four, five.

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:29.850
HDR is where it's
at, our eyes, speaking about -- yes, right?

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:35.100
[audience member replies] Our eyes
have a dynamic range of about 11 F-stops.

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:37.310
The best
digital camera on the planet has a dynamic

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:40.140
range that
can see five F-stops.

00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:45.990
So with HDR we can get back to
that 11 F-stop range and even go beyond it.

00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:49.230
So what's
going to happen is we can create images, you

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:51.610
know, so
this scene looks, you know, in our image like

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:52.800
it looks
to our eyes.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:58.340
Here we can see deep, deep into the
shadows here, yet the ice and the clouds outside

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:00.880
-- ice
and the clouds outside are not overexposed.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.440
I'm going
to jump out of this show for just one second.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.440
Yeah.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.690
&gt;&gt;
[Male asking question in the background]

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:10.340
&gt;&gt; RICK: Well, actually I have it here.

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:12.340
I don't
have to jump out.

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.730
How do I compare HDR to the zone
system?

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:18.960
Well, the zone system was developed by -- did
you ask -- was developed by Ansel Adams.

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.260
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Yeah, I know it.

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:21.260
&gt;&gt; RICK: Right.

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:25.110
And for those of you who
didn't -- don't know -- and what Ansel Adams

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:27.390
-- if you
want to have fun, do a Google search.

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:28.550
Right now you
could some have fun.

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:32.870
Tell me how many pages come up "I
hate HDR."

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:36.420
You're going to find 50,000 -- maybe not.

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:37.880
&gt;&gt; Male #3: 2.1 million.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:38.970
&gt;&gt; RICK: 2.1 million?

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.790
&gt;&gt; Male #3: Only
&gt;&gt; RICK: Only?

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:43.190
&gt;&gt; Male #3: In .30 seconds.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:45.690
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; RICK: Okay.

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:47.000
So that's how good Google is.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000
But anyway, I love HDR.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.590
Ansel Adams, he used the zone
system to find out what the different exposures

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:56.220
were in
these different zones from very dark to very

00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:01.860
light, and
he created HDR images using burning, and dodging,

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:05.990
different papers, different chemicals, different
exposure times, then he would dry his pictures

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:08.820
in the
microwave oven, as you may know.

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:12.490
But what HDR does is
it -- what these programs let us do today

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:16.570
is a matter of
minutes.

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:23.170
So here's a good example of HDR for you guys
who are not -- who are not into HDR.

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:24.330
Okay.

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:29.080
So this is
an HDR image, high, high dynamic range image.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.580
Here is the original
shot.

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:33.890
Here is the middle exposure for HDR in this
case

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:37.731
I had to take five exposures from the dark
-- that I

00:36:37.731 --> 00:36:40.890
captured from the darkest area to the brightest
area, I

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:44.850
had to take those five exposures and then
process them.

00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:49.810
Actually, here I used HDR Efex Pro, by
Nik Software.

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:50.810
You can do a search on this.

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:53.000
Actually,
if you go on my site, RickSammon.Info you

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.650
can get a
15 percent discount on it.

00:36:55.650 --> 00:37:00.020
But anyway, without HDR this
is what the scene would look like; it looks

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:01.020
terrible.

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:03.570
With HDR, this is what the scene looks like.

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:05.270
It's kind
of magical.

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:10.390
But the key is, the key is you have to
take -- you have to take enough exposures,

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:12.810
again, to
capture that dynamic range.

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:16.420
So anyway, on my site,
RickSammon.info if you go to save on creative

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.850
plugins,
you'll see a bunch of tutorials on this.

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:22.020
Let's see how
fast you can find this.

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:25.240
Go on RickSammon.info
&gt;&gt; Male #4: RickSammon.Info?

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.440
&gt;&gt;RICK: .info.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.240
&gt;&gt; Male #4: Oh.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:29.240
Okay.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:33.150
&gt;&gt;RICK: And then type in the search window
"HDR

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:34.710
must-know info".

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:36.560
So if you go in this -- Yeah.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.970
HDR
must-know info.

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:43.481
So if you want a nice little --
actually, it's a long tutorial on HDR, you'll

00:37:43.481 --> 00:37:44.481
find that.

00:37:44.481 --> 00:37:48.020
It's probably about a thousand words, about
eight or 12

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:55.210
different examples of HDR but HDR really is
amazing.

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:57.880
Yes?

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:09.070
&gt;&gt; [Male asking question in the background]
&gt;&gt;RICK: Okay.

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:10.450
This is a very good question.

00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:12.990
So he's saying I'm up here talking about like
I know

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:14.160
what I'm talking about; right?

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.720
[chuckles] But how about the person
who wants to learn about light?

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:18.720
Okay.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.740
Well, I don't
have a picture of a histogram up here now,

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:24.140
but does
anyone not know what a histogram is?

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:25.140
Okay.

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:27.350
So on the
back of your camera, you have a histogram.

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:30.550
What that
histogram is telling you, is it's telling

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:33.600
you about the
bright areas and the dark areas.

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.220
If you have a lot of
dark areas in your picture, you can look at

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.870
each -- like
you mentioned the zone system.

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:41.710
You can look at your
histogram like you have a pile of bricks over

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:44.970
here, and
if you have a picture like this with some

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:48.930
dark areas
going to have bricks piled up like this way

00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:52.280
on this side
of your histogram for the dark areas.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.810
For the
highlights over here, you're going to have

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:56.970
bricks piled
up like this.

00:38:56.970 --> 00:39:02.280
If you have a picture just taken on an
overcast day without a lot of highlights or

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.490
shadows,
you're just going to have what looks like

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:06.840
an even
mountain range, like this.

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:11.040
When I talk about light, I do talk
about what I said before, that we have to

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:14.820
learn how to
see the light, the contrast range in the scene,

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:16.610
the
direction of light, the color of light, the

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:19.900
quality of
light, but the histogram is your light meter,

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:22.560
so this is
actually a very, very important thing.

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.910
I don't use a
light meter.

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:28.270
A couple of my friends still use light
meters, but -- you don't use a light meter,

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:29.270
right?

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:30.270
You
use a histogram.

00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:31.270
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Or a spot meter.

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:32.270
&gt;&gt; RICK: Or a spot meter in your camera.

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:34.060
The
histogram what you want to do is when you're

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:38.540
shooting,
you want to move your histogram over to the

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:39.540
right.

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:40.950
If
you do a search on this, move the histogram

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:43.470
to the
right, let's see how many pages you get on

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:46.770
that, this is
the key because in your -- if this is your

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:50.170
histogram
here, most of the information -- more than

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:53.750
half of your
information is captured over here.

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:56.030
If you have a
histogram with nothing over here when you

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:58.810
try to pull
stuff out of the shadows over here, it's going

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:00.040
to be
very noisy.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:02.580
This is why the basic tip -- how many
pages?

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:03.790
&gt;&gt; Male: #6: 2.2 million.

00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:04.790
&gt;&gt; RICK: 2.2 million.

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:07.870
Pretty soon you're not
going to need speakers at Google anymore,

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:09.970
just do
searches move to histogram to the right.

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:12.760
So anyway, you
want to move the histogram to the right.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:13.850
You don't want
that spike.

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:18.210
If that spike is right to the edge here,
you're going to lose detail.

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:21.150
This is the most important
thing -- I think I have to stand over here

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:22.150
for the mic.

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:24.990
This is the most important thing I talk about
when

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:28.380
people ask me questions like when you talk
about light,

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.540
what's the most important thing?

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:31.980
Expose for the
highlights.

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:33.710
You want to expose for the highlights.

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:34.710
Look at this scene.

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:36.570
What's the brightest part of the
scene?

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:40.410
Might be the reflection on the water right
here.

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:42.260
Here we have detail here, it's a little washed
out

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:44.350
because the lights are on but that's okay
because we're

00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:45.790
all here to learn.

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:47.840
But I'm always exposing for the
highlights.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.240
Did you ever shoot slides?

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.360
&gt;&gt; Male #7: Oh, yeah.

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:54.190
&gt;&gt; RICK: Oh, yeah.
when you shot slides, Katherine?

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:55.280
She used to shoot
slides.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:00.100
Your exposure had to be right on, dead on,
because if they were over, they were gone.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:04.120
Now, with
digital, if your highlights are overexposed

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:08.310
by more than
a stop, you can get them back, I mean, under

00:41:08.310 --> 00:41:09.760
-- just
about a stop.

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.330
If they're over more than a stop, you're not
going

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:12.330
to get them back.

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:17.870
So it's very important to expose for
the highlights and move your histogram to

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:19.840
the right.

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:23.130
As
far as people photography goes, and travel

00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:26.020
photography,
I always like to put a person in the scene.

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:28.650
This
picture taken out in Laos early one morning,

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:32.200
I love the
clouds, I love the setting, but if we take

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.710
the person
out of the scene -- this is taken a few minutes

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:37.670
before -- it doesn't have, you know, the same
kind of

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:38.670
feeling.

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:42.680
Now, some people here -- Ansel Adams probably
would like the scene because he didn't include

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:45.481
people
in the scene, but I like to put people in

00:41:45.481 --> 00:41:46.481
the scene.

00:41:46.481 --> 00:41:47.700
Both are valid.

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:51.390
It's up to you and shoot it -- shoot it
both ways.

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:55.870
When we were talking before someone said
they wanted to do people photography.

00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:57.370
Who said -- right.

00:41:57.370 --> 00:41:58.730
So here's an example.

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:02.900
Let me see where this other shot
is here.

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.510
Might be -- yeah.

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:05.510
Okay.

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:09.300
When you're
photographing a person, my No. 1 thing is

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:11.650
this, to think
about this: The closer you are to the -- I

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:13.530
don't want
to get too far away from the podium -- The

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:17.330
closer you
are to the person, the more intimate the picture

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:18.330
becomes.

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:21.080
So when you think you're close, get closer.

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.650
This is over in Laos.

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:25.020
We were there last year.

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:27.400
Kind of
a boring shot, but it's kind of cool.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:30.420
The monks get out
early in the morning and they walk down the

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:32.960
road
barefoot, and they get the alms from these

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.900
people giving
them rice, and candy, and stuff like that.

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:37.250
But it looks
like a snapshot.

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:41.630
If you just get a little closer, you
feel more intimate; you feel like you're more

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:43.310
part of
the scene.

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:48.580
So again shooting close gives a picture a
greater sense of intimacy.

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:50.380
When you think you're close,
get closer.

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:52.120
But something else is going on there.

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:55.260
I
used a slow shutter speed to add a sense of

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:56.510
movement to
the picture.

00:42:56.510 --> 00:43:01.290
Here, these guys, the monks could have
been standing still.

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:04.410
And actually here they were kind
of standing still, but you want to add a sense

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:05.720
of motion
to your pictures.

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.480
This is one of the things we have to
do as photographers.

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:12.950
We're shooting stills -- we're
shooting stills, but we want to add a sense

00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:15.070
of motion to
our pictures.

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:19.780
So play around with shutter speeds, play
around with aperture.

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:23.540
So anyway, Laos is an incredible
place, northern Thailand is an incredible

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:24.540
place.

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:26.590
This
is one of the temples, an HDR shot.

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:29.800
Without HDR, you
wouldn't be able to see these beautiful paintings

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.850
on the
background.

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:34.170
And it's -- you know, traveling's such a
great education.

00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:36.200
You learn so much.

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.420
Here's the inside
of the temple.

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:40.580
You can see all these beautiful
paintings over here.

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:45.490
So some of the paintings depict a
scene like this, if you're good in life, the

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:47.330
afterlife
will be nice.

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:48.330
Okay.

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:51.720
Here's another scene, again, if
you're good in life, when you die everything

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:52.720
will be
nice.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.790
Well, if you're not good, they show this is
what

00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:55.790
happens.

00:43:55.790 --> 00:44:00.590
This is what happens if you drink too much,
okay, and then you die, this is what happens

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:01.590
to you.

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:03.510
All right, this is if you're a murderer what
happens to

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:04.510
you.

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:05.700
So again, traveling is a great education.

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.570
So they
bring the kids to this temple -- these temples

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:11.360
to show
them hey, this is what can happen.

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.190
But if you want a
great place to go, I've been a lot of places,

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:16.730
I've
said this before, more than a hundred countries,

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:20.960
Laos is
like Thailand was like 50 years ago.

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.400
It's still very
remote.

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.690
We went on this beautiful river ride here.

00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:26.721
This is a daylight fill-in flash picture here.

00:44:26.721 --> 00:44:30.880
I think
I told you the only time I use a flash in

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:34.630
the manual
exposure mode is if I'm taking a flash -- or

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:35.870
a flash
shot.

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:40.130
All my other pictures are on either aperture
priority or shutter priority.

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:44.340
But it's so remote there,
people are still fishing with nets.

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:46.660
I like this shot
because it's balanced.

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:49.910
When you're taking a picture,
another thing that you want to think about,

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:52.890
yet another
thing you want to think about is balance.

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:55.610
So the net
here falling on the water, and the fisherman,

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:58.770
it has
some action, but it's balanced.

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:01.590
Think about how you can
balance your pictures.

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:04.960
Now, these aren't the fish he
caught, but one of the things that's really

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:08.670
fun to do in
remote countries like Laos, Thailand, Cambodia,

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:11.560
some
places in Central America, is like to go to

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:12.560
the markets.

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:14.570
Here this man was preparing our lunch.

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:16.170
Katherine, is
this the kind of lunch we're going to have

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:20.089
tomorrow,
Katherine, before the photo?

00:45:20.089 --> 00:45:22.770
&gt;&gt; Katherine: I hope not.

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:24.060
&gt;&gt;RICK: You hope not?

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.810
Anyway, you see, you
learn what's going on in different cultures.

00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:30.260
You know,
we have so much here, we really do have so

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:34.090
much here and
what we have to do to survive is a lot different

00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:36.800
from
when a lot of other people around the country

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.370
-- around
the world have to survive.

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:42.330
And one more thing on
traveling is such a great education, this

00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:45.750
is just a
snapshot, but I took this shot and the next

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:50.300
few shots
because they're these unexploded fuel tanks

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:52.770
here as
decorations around the village.

00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:57.450
You see it here, you
see it here, and you see it in this shot.

00:45:57.450 --> 00:46:00.880
Again, these
are just snapshots, but again getting back

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:04.770
to this
education thing, during the Vietnam War when

00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:08.830
the pilots
would go up, you know, on their bombing raids

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:11.880
and they
couldn't land with full fuel tanks, right?

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:13.870
They had to
get rid of them otherwise their planes could

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:16.340
explode if
they didn't land correctly.

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:19.780
They just dropped these
tanks like over beautiful villages like you've

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:21.350
just seen
before.

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:22.470
So you learn this stuff.

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:26.140
This is part of being
a travel photographer.

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:28.500
Getting back to that shooting
horizontally and vertically.

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:30.280
This is Angkor Wat in
Cambodia.

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:34.830
Nice enough shot, right, shooting
horizontally, but here's a vertical shot,

00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:36.490
an HDR shot.

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:38.660
We can see the white clouds aren't overexposed
and

00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:41.580
washed out, yet we can see into the shadows.

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:47.870
Now, one
thing on HDR is this: We can open up all the

00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:48.980
shadows,
right?

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:52.930
But when we open up all the shadows our pictures
look flat.

00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:55.160
I want you to remember this when it comes
to

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:56.160
shadows.

00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:00.900
Shadows can be your friend; shadows add a
sense of depth and dimension to a picture;

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:04.260
and my friend
Frank Doorhof has this expression, "Shadows

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:06.040
are the soul
of the picture."

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:10.680
So, you know, just because we can open
up the shadows, it doesn't mean that we have

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:13.540
to open up
the shadows.

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:17.480
Another thing we have to do is add a sense
of depth and dimension to our pictures.

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:19.980
We see the
world in three dimensions: Height, width,

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:22.680
and depth;
our cameras only see two.

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:26.660
Here this is a side of one of
the temples in Angkor Wat Cambodia.

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:28.220
Here's another side
of one of the temples.

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:32.780
If you shoot at an angle, you
can shoot sense of depth.

00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:36.240
If I'm going to photograph
this room right now here at Google, it looks

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:39.360
very flat
shooting straight on like that; if I go over

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:43.090
here, it's
going to have a much greater sense of depth.

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:47.390
So try to
create a sense of depth and dimension in our

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:48.570
pictures.

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:51.170
So it's almost 4:00 o'clock and I think we're
going to

00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:54.070
start our studio session kind of soon after
that.

00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:56.480
Let me see if I have anything else I can show
you

00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:02.560
quickly here before we take any -- well, I'll
tell you

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:03.560
this.

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:05.980
How many people were at my presentation last
time?

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:06.980
Okay.

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:07.980
Two.

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:13.050
So I'm just going to end with this
quick little story.

00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:15.000
So I teach a lot of workshops
around the world.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.710
This is a workshop in Botswana, one
of my favorite shots.

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:22.520
This picture illustrates a lot of
points in photography.

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:27.290
One, the name of the game is to
fill the frame; Number 2, light the eyes;

00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:31.860
Number 3, have a
plain background; Number 4, use a wide aperture

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:34.960
to blur the
background if it's distracting; and getting

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:37.381
back to my
friend's -- my new friend in the front's comment

00:48:37.381 --> 00:48:41.090
about
light, I'm looking to expose for the highlights,

00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:43.380
the
brightest part of the scene first, which is

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:44.380
right here.

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:46.480
I don't want that overexposed and washed out.

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:48.510
So
this -- and you want a little bit of expression

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:50.710
on the
animal's eyes; he's looking for something.

00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:53.400
So this
picture illustrates a lot of different -- a

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:55.240
lot of
different techniques.

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:58.710
Here we see -- excuse me -- what
simple cropping can do.

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:02.260
I not only cropped this
picture; I increased the saturation.

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:04.910
How many people
sharpen their pictures here?

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:06.080
Okay.

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.690
The key to
sharpening the picture is using selective

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:10.690
sharpening.

00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:14.140
Rarely do you want to sharpen the entire picture.

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:16.450
You
want to sharpen just the most important part

00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:17.450
of the
picture.

00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:19.790
So here I'm sharpening the animal's face.

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:22.010
I'm
sharpening the body, but not as much as the

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:23.010
face.

00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:26.380
There'd be no reason to sharpen around this
animal

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:30.290
because I want the attention to go to the
animal, plus,

00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:32.660
if you sharpen the dark out-of-focus areas,
that

00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:34.660
increases the noise.

00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:37.610
Always sharpen selectively, unless
you're taking a picture of a rose, then you

00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:40.690
want the
whole thing very sharp.

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:43.870
But also I use a technique like
Ansel Adams used.

00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:45.240
Ansel Adams had a great expression.

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:47.630
He said, "A picture's not done until I darken
the

00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:48.630
edges."

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:52.320
Renaissance painters did the same thing, they
darkened the edges.

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:57.850
So I darken the edges to draw more
attention to the -- to the main subject.

00:49:57.850 --> 00:50:01.160
If you go on
safari, having a good guide is the key.

00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:04.810
We're driving
around in the jeep -- or the Land Rover, and

00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:06.700
the guide
says, "Man, look at that lion.

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:09.600
I can't believe that,"
and he's pointing to the lion.

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:10.810
Well, we can't see it.

00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:15.970
This is why you want to go on safari because
if you look closely, you'll see that -- with

00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:18.690
a good
guide, you'll see that there's a lion hiding

00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:21.120
in the
shadows right there.

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:26.300
One thing, by the way, if you're
into photographing birds around here, or owls,

00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:29.380
or any
kind of wildlife around here, if you want

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:32.690
a better
chance of finding the animals rather than

00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:37.430
looking left
to right, like most of us read, search the

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:38.860
scene from
right to left.

00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:42.240
It slows you down and it's really a much
better way to find the animals.

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:45.200
You'll see if you're
outside searching for a subject if you move

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:47.340
like this,
you're going to go faster than going like

00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:50.240
that because
you're used to going like this when you are

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:51.790
-- when you
are reading.

00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:52.790
Okay.

00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:55.490
So I'm just going to end with these
couple of pictures.

00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:59.730
On safari with this guy, we're in
this little plane, a light plane, we're landing

00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:02.760
on this
runway, the guides on the bottom on the runway

00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:04.660
are
shooing the animals off the runway, the elephants

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:06.730
off
the runway.

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:11.260
So we come down on the runway and the guide
whips open the door and says "Quick, quick.

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:12.510
These lions
are mating.

00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:13.510
You have to come.

00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:14.510
You have to see this."

00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:17.660
So because I'm ready, like I told you I was,
with my wide

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:20.870
angle lens on one shoulder, my telephoto lens
--

00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:23.560
telephoto zoom on the other, I'm in the jeep
in one

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:26.110
second, the land rover in one second.

00:51:26.110 --> 00:51:28.270
This guy's
fumbling around getting his stuff out of the

00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:29.270
bag.

00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:30.680
I
said, I can't believe we're might miss this

00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:31.680
thing.

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:32.680
The guide's saying, "Hurry up!

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:33.680
This doesn't happen too
often.

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.180
Lot a lot of people get to see this."

00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:36.360
So here's
the male lion.

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:38.270
He really wanted to mate.

00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:40.370
Here's the
female -- this goes on for three days -- she

00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:43.050
didn't want
to mate any longer, okay?

00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:44.740
But I really wanted to get a
shot.

00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:46.560
I wanted to get this shot.

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:48.240
I call this the Love
Bite.

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:51.630
Here's the female biting the lion trying to
keep

00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:52.630
him away.

00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:58.240
Here I used a 500th of a second shutter speed
to freeze the action, but here's the story.

00:51:58.240 --> 00:51:59.590
You see
these twigs here?

00:51:59.590 --> 00:52:03.560
Well, there were some twigs right in
front of this scene right here.

00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:06.980
Well, before we got in
the vehicle the guide says to me, he says,

00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:09.730
"Whatever you
do, don't stand up.

00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:10.850
Don't move in the vehicle."

00:52:10.850 --> 00:52:13.370
Again,
this is been going on for three days; the

00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:15.930
animals
haven't eaten; who knows.

00:52:15.930 --> 00:52:17.870
You don't want to distract
the animals.

00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:22.050
Well, I forgot what he said and I was so
interested in getting this shot I stood up.

00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:25.640
As I stood
up, the lions stopped what they were doing

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:27.870
and they
started coming toward the vehicle.

00:52:27.870 --> 00:52:31.750
So you've seen this
on National Geographic where the lion's crouched

00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:33.910
down
like this, and they're going through the grass

00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:37.140
and
they're coming closer and closer and closer.

00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:40.300
And as the
guy's -- the guy's saying to me as they get

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:43.480
closer,
first he said, "Don't move," then he said,

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:46.250
"Don't move,"
then he said, "Don't move," then he's just

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:48.910
going, "Don't
move," like this, because they're coming closer,

00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:50.630
and
closer, and closer, and closer.

00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:54.890
Anyway, they come right
up like as close as you two guys are right

00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:55.890
here.

00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:57.930
They
look up, and this is what happens.

00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:00.870
Though they didn't
jump up and kill me, they were so hot and

00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:04.010
tired they
were just looking for some shade.

00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:06.550
They lied down in the
shade of the vehicle.

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:08.060
[Laughing]
&gt;&gt;RICK: So listen, I want to thank you all

00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:09.880
very
much for joining me here at Google.

00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:13.060
I hope you learned
a lot; I hope you had a lot of fun.

00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:17.260
Everyone who comes
to my seminars or workshops is a student for

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:21.230
life so if
you want to send me questions, it's just Rick

00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:23.310
-- well,
actually, my Google address is

00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:24.640
RickGodfatherSammon@google.

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:31.410
Trey Ratcliff, who actually
introduced me to Cliff and my friends here

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:35.600
at Google
gave me that title Godfather because when

00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:36.600
I met him he
says, "Man, Rick, you're one of the oldest

00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:38.980
guys I know
that's still into photography."

00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:41.490
[Laughing]
&gt;&gt; RICK: So anyway, and you can contact me

00:53:41.490 --> 00:53:44.829
through my site RickSammon.info . So thank
-- yes?

00:53:44.829 --> 00:53:48.750
&gt;&gt; Male #8: Do they allow that name on Google+?

00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:49.750
&gt;&gt; RICK: Pardon?

00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:50.750
Do they allow that name
Godfather?

00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:51.750
Oh, I guess so.

00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:52.750
I've had it for a few
months.

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:53.750
So thank you very much.

00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:58.430
I hope you had a good
time and learned a lot.

00:53:58.430 --> 00:53:59.050
