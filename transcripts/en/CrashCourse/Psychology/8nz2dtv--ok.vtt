00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.120
Even though you can't see me, you know that
I am here talking to you. And I can probably

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.499
persuade you that this container of water
and this container of water have the same

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:10.370
amount of water, which they do, even though
they don't look like they do.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.980
And you'll see I left my anglerfish behind
me. If someone were to move it without my

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.770
knowing, you'd rightly expect me to look for
it first where I originally left it.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.720
...Nnnugh!!

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.440
You can figure out all these things because
you are far down the path of cognitive development.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.500
Your parents will be proud. But there was
a time in your life, in all our lives, when

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.760
simple concepts like these were totally baffling.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.680
Of course, lots of things influence how your
mind and its relationship with the world grows

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.750
over time.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.540
Both our genetics and our environment begin
to affect our development long before we're

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.250
even born, and they continue to influence
our learning until the day we die.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.600
And even though we're born with nearly the
same number of brain cells we'll ever have,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.579
our complete set of brain hardware takes years
to solidify as our neural networks grow more

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:53.000
complex.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.220
The study of our physical changes, cognitive,
social and emotional changes throughout our

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.790
whole lives - from prenatal to preteen to
post-retirement - is called developmental

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.850
psychology. It's how we grow into who we are.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.859
And it begins with the growth of knowledge
itself: the process by which you mature into

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:15.859
the anglerfish-tracking water-beaker-estimating
peekaboo-master that you are today.

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.829
[Intro]

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:27.929
As we age, we tend to follow a sequence of
changes in behavior and appearance called

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:32.060
maturation. Everyone is affected differently
by their personal experience, of course, but

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.909
we all share inherent genetic growth tendencies.

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.850
We roll over before we sit, we sit before
stand, and we stand before we walk, and we

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.599
walk before we break dance. The same thing
applies to our cognitive development - how

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:47.599
we learn to think, know, remember and communicate.
And if you're gonna talk about cognitive development,

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:52.270
you gotta start with Jean Piaget, developmental
psychologist extraordinaire.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.929
Piaget was from Switzerland where he was kind
of a wunderkind and got his PhD in zoology

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:02.149
in 1918, began dabbling in Freud psychoanalysis.
After graduation, he headed to France to work

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.880
on a method for testing children's aptitudes
and abilities. While administering these tests,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.610
Piaget began to notice how younger kids kept
giving wrong answers to certain questions.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.890
He became fascinated by the fact that children
of a certain age consistently made particular

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.060
mistakes that older kids and adults didn't.
Like the younger kids would have a really

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.340
hard time understanding the idea I just showed
you, that this container has the same amount

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.180
of water in it as in this container. Or that
this row of coins has the same number as this

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.720
row.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.620
While others might have dismissed these as
childish mistakes, Piaget theorized that it

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.379
was because humans go through specific stages
of cognitive development and intellectual

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.700
progression. His main game was asking 'How
does knowledge grow?'

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.920
He proposed that as we grow and struggle to
make sense of our experiences, we create schemas,

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.900
or mental frameworks that help interpret information.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.250
Schemas are like concepts, ranging from physical
things like birds and hats and eye patches

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.829
to abstract ideas like friendship and betrayal.

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:58.709
And we're constantly striving for cognitive
equilibrium, or harmony, between our thought

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.629
processes and our environments, which are
always giving us new things to think about

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:03.469
and adjust to.

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:07.730
Piaget proposed that we adapt to new experiences
through two processes that are closely related

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.870
- assimilation and accommodation.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.230
When we assimilate new experiences, we interpret
them in terms of our existing schemas. So

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.680
if a toddler has never seen a deer but has
a schema for a horse, she may call the first

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.519
deer she sees a horsey. She wants to fit it
within her understanding.

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.549
But with more interactions in the world, our
minds expand to accommodate, or adjust to

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.359
new experiences. So soon enough, that kid
realizes that deer aren't just horses, and

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:35.280
she adjusts her schema. From there, she'll
be able to tell the difference between Bambi

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.999
and Black Beauty in no time.

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:40.609
But our knowledge base grows in ways that
are much more complex than just those two

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:45.999
steps, and Piaget knew that. He went on to
devise a four-stage theory of cognitive development

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:49.290
that described how we learn in different phases
of our lives.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.739
He called stage one the sensorimotor stage,
which begins at birth and continues on to

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.969
about age two. This is the time when babies
experience the world through their senses

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:02.219
and actions. Touching and grabbing and looking
and hearing. And putting things in their mouth.

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:05.930
From what I can tell, mostly just putting
things in their mouth.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.730
Younger babies may get scared around strangers,
seem to live only in the present, and have

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.670
to see something to know it exists. This makes
them very easy to trick, if you're into that

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.760
- I mean if you have any experience with babies,
just think about this: toss a blanket over

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.640
a six-month-old's pacifier and they think
it vanished.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.310
They lack object permanence, the awareness
that things still exist when they're out of

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.440
sight. And yet, we develop so quickly that
just a month or two later that baby already

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.050
understands better that objects and people
don't disappear just because they're hidden.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.460
Object permanence, in Piaget's view, was one
of the major achievements of the sensorimotor

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.680
stage.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.170
The second of Piaget's phases of development
is the 'preoperational stage' and he believed

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.110
it began around age two, and carried on through
age six or seven. The thing about kids of

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.140
this age is that it's all about them. The
preoperational stage is characterized by 'egocentrism'

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.160
which drives most of what a child thinks and
says.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.880
Kids have a hard time imagining another person's
point of view, so much so that when I was

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.330
a kid, if you asked me if I had a brother,
I'd say, 'sure, John', but if you asked me

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.710
if John had a brother I'd say, 'Nah, I don't
think so.'

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.530
Egocentrism of course never fully disappears,
even in adults who understand how the whole

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.830
sibling thing works.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.540
The preoperational stage is also marked by
a child's ability to mentally represent objects

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.620
and events with words and images and pretend
plays in their imagination. They're big into

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.630
animism now, and believe their favorite bunny,
batman or stuffed anglerfish has feelings

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.740
and opinions and possibly the intent to kiss
or kill you when you're asleep - depending

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.020
on how they're feeling.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.460
Still plenty of kinks to work out.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.470
Piaget suggests that early in this stage,
kids don't yet understand the concept of conservation

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.940
- like how 500 milliliters is the same as
500 milliliters, no matter what container

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:39.330
it's in.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.490
They can also struggle with the notion of
reversibility. It's hard for them to mentally

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.400
reverse the process by which a ball of clay
smashed flat can be rolled back into a ball.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.080
It's a concept that takes some time to understand.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.180
And these challenges both have to do with
'Centration' - a child's tendency to fixate

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.940
on just one aspect of a problem or object
- like the shape of the container or the clay.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.810
But during the second half of stage two, things
begin to blossom. Kids start forming their

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.270
theory of mind or ability to understand other
people's feelings, thoughts and perceptions-

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.410
as well as their own- and also how to predict
behavior... like remember when my anglerfish

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.460
got moved when I wasn't looking? A child at
this stage will begin to realize that while

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.660
she knows that the fish is in a new place,
I don't know it was moved, so when I start

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.330
to look for it, she'll expect me to look where
it originally was and not where it was moved

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.960
to.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.270
These new people skills have all kinds of
awesome applications from trying to convince

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.560
your parents to "PLEASE GIVE ME THAT EXTRA
COOKIE I SO DESPERATELY NEED!" to showing

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.220
empathy, which is better - and offering comfort
to others when they seem sad.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.990
Piaget called the third stage of development
- beginning around age six or seven and lasting

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:49.190
until eleven or twelve - the 'Concrete Operational
Stage'. Kids are starting to think logically

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.710
about concrete events that they've actually
experienced. And unlike children in the earlier

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.780
phase, getting hung up on issues of centration,
kids in this stage experience 'decentration',

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.580
and become able to see beyond just one aspect
of an object or problem.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.650
So now, problems with reversibility and conservation
just cease to be problems. And the last of

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.800
Piaget's four stages is the 'Formal Operational
Stage' which starts at about twelve and carries

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.460
us through the rest of our lives. By now,
our reasoning is expanding to include more

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.600
abstract thinking, problem solving and hypothetical
questions.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.930
Now Piaget's four-stage model has been criticized
for over-simplifying things and for being

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.120
too rigid in how it classifies certain abilities
by age. Today, for example, researchers have

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.580
detected these phases at earlier ages than
Piaget ever did - sometimes way earlier - like

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.160
some types of object permanence have been
observed in three-month-olds.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.800
Psychologists also see development as more
of a continuous process rather than a series

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.780
of stepping stones. But even Piaget understood
that his stages weren't as fixed as he made

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:44.940
them sound.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:49.810
And he wasn't the only guy on the block talking
about development. For instance, his contemporary,

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.830
Belarussian psychologist Lev Vygotsky, had
some ideas of his own. While Piaget focused

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:58.190
on how a kid's mind grows by interacting with
his physical environment, Vygotsky emphasized

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:02.650
how early development occurs through parental
instruction and interaction with social environments.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:07.550
He believed less in set stages and more in
the idea that care-giver adults provide a

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:12.490
sort of scaffolding, that helps children climb
to higher levels of thinking and learning.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:16.860
Vgotsky put a lot of emphasis on language
as a way of assigning meaning to things, and

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:21.270
he also suggested that the ways kids develop
might actually vary across cultures.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:25.970
In the end, there's room for lots of different
theories here, but perhaps Piaget's greatest

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:30.860
achievement was developing theoretical depth
in the concept that kids actually think very

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.260
differently than adults.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.550
This fact has helped a lot of parents and
teachers, and his work spurred a new era of

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:41.330
research in the field. While Piaget wasn't
the only developmentalist, or even the first,

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:45.180
he's definitely one of the most influential,
and remains relevant to this day.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:50.390
As the brain and mind develop in children,
so too do their social, emotional, and moral

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:55.180
behavior. How a child is raised and cared
for can have a profound impact on their personality

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.340
later in life, which is something we'll look
at next week.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.890
This week, though, you learned how we use
schemas, assimilation, and accommodation to

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:07.050
make sense of the world around us, and about
Piaget's four-stage theory of cognitive development,

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:12.400
including sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete
operational, and formal operational periods,

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.460
and about Vgotsky's theory of scaffolding.
