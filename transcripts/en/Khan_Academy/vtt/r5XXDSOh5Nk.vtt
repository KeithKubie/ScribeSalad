00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.767
- [Tutor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.767 --> 00:00:03.321
is give ourselves some practice

00:00:03.321 --> 00:00:05.410
in the first step of u substitution,

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.196
which is often the most difficult

00:00:07.196 --> 00:00:09.134
for those who are first learning it

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:12.240
and that's recognizing when
u substitution is appropriate

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.696
and then defining an appropriate u.

00:00:14.696 --> 00:00:17.150
So let's just start with an example here,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.101
so let's say we wanna take
the indefinite integral

00:00:21.101 --> 00:00:23.268
of two x plus one times

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.323
the square root of x squared plus x, dx,

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.074
does u substitution apply
here and if it does,

00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:34.532
how would you define the u?

00:00:34.532 --> 00:00:37.341
Pause the video and try
to think about that.

00:00:37.341 --> 00:00:39.139
Well, we just have to remind ourselves,

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:43.551
that u substitution is really
trying to undo the chain rule,

00:00:43.551 --> 00:00:46.688
if we remind ourselves what
the chain rule tells us,

00:00:46.688 --> 00:00:48.754
it says look, if we have
a composite function,

00:00:48.754 --> 00:00:50.587
let's say f of g of x,

00:00:52.845 --> 00:00:55.531
f of g of x and we take
the derivative of that

00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:57.517
with respect to x,

00:00:57.517 --> 00:00:58.683
that that is going to be equal

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:01.162
to the derivative of the outside function

00:01:01.162 --> 00:01:03.059
with respect to the inside function,

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:03.892
so f prime

00:01:05.557 --> 00:01:07.000
of g of x

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.093
times the derivative
of the inside function,

00:01:09.093 --> 00:01:12.490
times the derivative
of the inside function

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.024
and so u substitution is all about

00:01:14.024 --> 00:01:17.249
well, do we see a pattern
like that inside the integral?

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:21.387
Do we see a potential
inside function, a g of x,

00:01:21.387 --> 00:01:24.493
where I see its derivative
being multiplied?

00:01:24.493 --> 00:01:27.139
Well, we see that over here,

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:30.370
if I look at x squared plus x,

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.212
if I make that the u, what's
the derivative of that?

00:01:33.212 --> 00:01:37.208
Well, the derivative of x
squared plus x is two x plus one,

00:01:37.208 --> 00:01:39.652
so we should make that substitution,

00:01:39.652 --> 00:01:43.319
if we say u is equal to x squared plus x,

00:01:44.162 --> 00:01:46.162
then we could say du dx,

00:01:47.325 --> 00:01:49.748
the derivative of u with respect to x

00:01:49.748 --> 00:01:52.695
is equal to two x plus one,

00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:55.279
if we treat our differentials
like variables or numbers,

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:57.296
we can multiply both sides by dx,

00:01:57.296 --> 00:01:59.225
which is a little bit of
hand wavy mathematics,

00:01:59.225 --> 00:02:00.687
but it's appropriate here,

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:04.187
so we could say two x plus one times dx

00:02:05.945 --> 00:02:07.736
and now what's really interesting here

00:02:07.736 --> 00:02:09.798
is we have our u right over there

00:02:09.798 --> 00:02:13.965
and notice we have our
two x plus one times dx,

00:02:14.862 --> 00:02:17.218
in fact it's not conventional
to see an integral

00:02:17.218 --> 00:02:19.319
rewritten the way I'm about
to write it, but I will,

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.201
I could rewrite this integral,
you should really view

00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:24.427
this is the product of three things,

00:02:24.427 --> 00:02:26.105
oftentimes people will just view the dx

00:02:26.105 --> 00:02:29.132
as somehow part of the integral operator,

00:02:29.132 --> 00:02:30.699
but you could rearrange it,

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:32.573
this would actually be legitimate,

00:02:32.573 --> 00:02:36.323
you could say the integral
of the square root

00:02:37.338 --> 00:02:41.505
of x squared plus x
times two x plus one dx

00:02:43.307 --> 00:02:45.024
and if you wanted to be really clear,

00:02:45.024 --> 00:02:47.012
you could even put all of those things

00:02:47.012 --> 00:02:49.523
in parentheses or something like that

00:02:49.523 --> 00:02:51.038
and so here,

00:02:51.038 --> 00:02:52.121
this is our u

00:02:53.528 --> 00:02:56.361
and this right over here is our du

00:02:58.355 --> 00:03:00.630
and so we could rewrite this as being

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.380
equal to the integral

00:03:03.688 --> 00:03:05.688
of the square root of u,

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:09.050
'cause x squared plus x is u,

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.633
times du, which is much
easier to evaluate.

00:03:13.742 --> 00:03:14.898
If you are still confused there,

00:03:14.898 --> 00:03:17.285
you might recognize it if I rewrite this

00:03:17.285 --> 00:03:19.044
as u to the one half power,

00:03:19.044 --> 00:03:21.870
because now we could just
use the reverse power rule

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:22.803
to evaluate this

00:03:22.803 --> 00:03:25.252
and then we would have
to undo the substitution,

00:03:25.252 --> 00:03:27.892
once we figure out what
this anti derivative is,

00:03:27.892 --> 00:03:30.535
we then would then reverse substitute

00:03:30.535 --> 00:03:33.702
the x expression back in for the u.
