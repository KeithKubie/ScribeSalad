00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.588
So my gut says I should group by, by date

00:00:03.588 --> 00:00:07.790
first? Because I'm, when I think about this, it's thinking like

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.480
how many tickets were sold this month and then within

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.050
that month, how would those tickets distribute? How many were each?

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.020
&gt;&gt; And you're right. You should be grouping

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.092
by date first because that's the overarching categorization.

00:00:20.092 --> 00:00:20.604
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:20.604 --> 00:00:25.580
&gt;&gt; So. Grab the purchase date field and then drag it above.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.820
&gt;&gt; Above.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:26.160
&gt;&gt; Ticket type.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.860
&gt;&gt; Oh, cool.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but, the thing right now with purchase date is it's everyday.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:32.549
&gt;&gt; Everyday.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:33.510
&gt;&gt; And we don't want that.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.680
&gt;&gt; We want to do it by month.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.530
&gt;&gt; Right. So, if we, click that little arrow,

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.100
and then Group by Dates, or Group Dates By.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.820
&gt;&gt; Yes, that's awesome.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.320
&gt;&gt; Calendar month.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.430
&gt;&gt; Alright, so October had 20. One which is VIP, that's awesome. Okay.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.000
&gt;&gt; So again this is just a preview. So don't

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.985
freak out if it doesn't show all of the records.

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:53.040
because I know sometimes people do.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.160
&gt;&gt; Okay, should I hit Save and then?

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah click Save always.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.550
&gt;&gt; As.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.370
&gt;&gt; Save As, yeah. That was close.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.490
&gt;&gt; Okay,

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.420
&gt;&gt; Total revenue over time.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll say by monthly.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.050
&gt;&gt; Oh, by month. Yup.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.990
&gt;&gt; Save and Run?

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.254
&gt;&gt; Save and Run.

00:01:08.254 --> 00:01:11.650
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's so cool. So we've got May 2013,

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.970
we had 14 VIP tickets and 17 General Admission. June,

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.590
a lot of people bought tickets. All right, this is very cool. So

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.780
now I, I mean I want to make a chart. I'm going to fool around.
