00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.770
&gt;&gt;Presenter: It's my pleasure to welcome,
it's our pleasure I guess, at Google, to welcome

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.630
the co creators of "Husbands", Brad Bell and
Jane Espenson who are going to talk about

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.790
"Inventing Television: How Husbands Fully
Realizes the Promise."

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.040
Please join me in welcoming Brad and Jane.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.040
[Applause]

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.320
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: I guess we should say a little
bit who we are and then we can talk about

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.320
why we're inventing television.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.320
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Oh, okay.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.350
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: I'm Jane Espenson, I'm one
of the creators of "Husbands" which is, we're

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.920
gonna show you a couple episodes of it and
talk about it and how it is inventing television.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.239
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Truly.

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:39.239
Oh, you wait.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.930
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: I have, I come at this from
the TV side.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.219
I have a 20 year TV career, I've written for
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Battle Star

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.820
Galactica" and "Game of Thrones" and "Once
Upon a Time" which check it out, ABC, Sunday

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.820
night.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.360
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: If you've watched TV you've seen
something by her.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.399
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: If you've watched, particularly
if you've watched geeky, sci-fi TV you've

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.210
definitely seen something I've written.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.960
And coming from the other side, from the younger,
hipper more internetty side is Brad Bell who

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.199
really created the show.

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.090
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Who uses the internet.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.490
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: So, that's what I do.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.680
Yeah, I had an idea for a web series and thought,
there's something to that internet thing,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.180
and when YouTube was first around in 2004,
2005 I think is when I became conscious of

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.090
it I was like, okay, wait, there's something
there.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.840
There's a platform where there's no middle
man, this is brilliant.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.820
I don't know what I'm gonna do with this but
I'm gonna do something.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.480
And four or five years later we ended up making
"Husbands."

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.850
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Yeah cause I'd seen the videos
that he'd made and put up on YouTube and they

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.110
were, the first one I saw was about marriage
equality and it was brilliant and funny and

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.770
I was like, I like the way this guy writes,
he tells jokes the way I tell jokes, we should

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.770
become friends.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.610
And we did with no, I wasn't seeking someone
to do an online show with, it never occurred

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.930
to me to do an online show.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.490
When you look at it from the TV side you sort
of feel like, well, I've got the biggest cameras

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.030
in the world and, like, what feels like the
biggest platform, why would I wanna do that?

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.930
Until someone points out to you that you're
not on the biggest platform.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.560
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: It's, yeah, I mean, there's this
perception that it's a smaller pond.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.190
Like, oh your little small pond on the internet
and you can make the jump to the big boys

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.579
in TV but, I mean, really?

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.150
How many more millions of people can you reach
on the internet?

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.580
It's not a small pond it's an ocean.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.580
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Absolutely.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.760
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: It's the Indian Ocean and the
Arctic Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean and the

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.760
Pacific Ocean.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.500
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: It's the Seven Seas.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.709
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: It's the Seven Seas.

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:42.709
[Laughter]

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.930
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Yeah, so, it started occurring
to us, it didn't occur to us till we actually

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.010
had "Husbands" out there, actually, that that
we were in, we were in the big ocean.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.670
That we could reach people internationally,
instantly, that there was sort of no ceiling

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.340
on the number of people we could reach.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.410
We had perfect control over everything we
were doing for once which is also awesome.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.980
But there was this sense that people kept
comparing it to broadcast.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.790
If you look at the word broad in broadcast
it's just, oh it's so wide, worldwide web

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.060
has wide in it to.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.400
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Like it's just it's a big

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.400
world.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.450
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: I think wide is probably broader
than broad.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.450
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: I think.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.450
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: I mean I don't know for sure.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.450
I just made it up.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.450
[Laughter]

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.450
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: We'd have to get out a tape
measure.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.450
[Laughter]

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.330
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: But you were talking about
the history, you looked up the history of

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.450
the word television, the original promise
of TV.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.130
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: It was because, you know when
somebody loves you or something you do but

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.580
they sort of insult you without realizing
it?

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.020
People would say things like, "Your show is
so good.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.430
I wish it was a real show."

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.450
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Or, "I don't get it its so funny,

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:55.210
why isn't it on TV?" and that didn't make
sense to me because it is on TV, I make television.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.280
Like I don't know what a web series is, I
make television.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:07.930
"Oh no, no, I mean like on that box in my
living room on Fox or AMC" and I didn't understand

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.980
what the distinction there was like what exactly
is it that defines television that I'm not

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.500
making television.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:23.550
So, as it turns out, television is a hybrid
word, Greek and Latin, tele meaning far and

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.580
then vision meaning well, obviously, vision.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.830
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Vision.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.140
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: You know?

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.910
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: So, far vision, so when you think

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.449
of NBC the far vision is LA to New York.

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.190
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Honolulu.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.080
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Okay, Honolulu, too.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.080
And maybe Guam.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.080
[Laughter]

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.240
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: but anyways, it's not as
far as the worldwide web.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.000
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Tokyo basically.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.540
Yeah, on the other hand you plug something
into YouTube and within minutes, I mean, Tokyo

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.210
and all the other places that aren't in America.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.680
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Right.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.070
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: So the word television sounds

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.949
like it was meant to apply to the worldwide
web and when you actually go back and look

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:11.479
at how people talked about television when
it was a baby, that sounds like it's talking

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:12.479
about the worldwide web.

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:18.720
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: And not just the original vision
of, oh vision of telev- I didn't even do that

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.720
on purpose.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.169
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: But the actual definition to

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:26.170
this day is telecommunication medium.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.940
As anyone who's ever been in a relationship
knows, communication is a two way street.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.050
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: So a broadcast box where, you

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.560
know, they're, they're telling you what the
message is or telling you what the story is,

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.610
that's one sided and the internet is communication.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.490
So, really, the internet is more television
than television.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.710
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: It's the original promise
of television.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.020
We put the name on the wrong box.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.180
You're looking in the wrong box.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.540
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: For like 80 years.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.540
[Laughter]

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.540
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Yeah.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.180
So television, we, we, television is being
invented now.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.500
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Exactly cause it's just recently
been realized as such.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.940
I mean, I think that technically speaking
it happened at the birth of the internet but

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.900
now it's almost an evolution in our own consciousness
of, oh wait, this is television.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.160
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: We worked very hard to try
to make it match the quality of broadcast

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:25.130
television in terms of production quality
and, sort of, the process that went in to

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.289
the jokes and the performances and everything.

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:33.710
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Yes we want to match the production
quality and surpass the creative content and

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.449
quality of storytelling.

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:42.300
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Yeah and we started, you
might ask why doesn't network TV make content

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.630
that addresses issues like this or has, or
if you enjoyed it why doesn't network TV make

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.150
it?

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.430
It's so easy to say, "Oh it's cause they're
homophobic jerks" and it's like no they're

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.030
not, they're reasonable people who've been
taught a certain way of doing business and

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:02.500
they only have a certain amount of information
at their disposal to make decisions.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.660
They end up with a couple assumptions.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:11.840
I think that they assume that they can predict
how a show's gonna do via testing.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.930
I once asked some executives, though, in a
meeting, I said, "Have you ever tested the

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:17.930
testing?

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.600
Have you ever gone back to see which shows
are successful and see if they actually were

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.350
the ones that were predicted to be successful?"

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.750
And they said yes they had done that, they
had crunched the numbers and there was a slight

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.620
negative correlation.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:33.610
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: And yet testing is still

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.770
used so they're clearly not getting the information
that they need to know about what to predict

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.630
what shows have an audience.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:46.510
They also make this big assumption that the
cast of a show is gonna look like the audience

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.139
of that show.

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:51.849
So if they see a show with gay actors they're
gonna assume that they're only gonna get a

00:07:51.849 --> 00:07:52.849
gay audience.

00:07:52.849 --> 00:08:00.629
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Which is, sort of, I think been
brought about even more in the era of niche

00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:04.940
and niche programming and everyone has their
own little channel that appeals to them-

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.790
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Yeah, it's propagated this
assumption.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:12.590
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Right because, you know, 30 years
ago there weren't those tiny little markets

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:17.960
so you could take a show that was specific
like the "Golden Girls" which is four women

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.440
in their 60's, like, yeah that sounds like
that has mass appeal, right?

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.700
Four single women in their 60's.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:24.700
[Laughter]

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.819
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: We'll get the single women
in their 60's; they're not changing their

00:08:27.819 --> 00:08:29.120
brands and stuff so?

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:35.220
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Yeah but I, just for fun, the
other day did a Twitter search on the "Golden

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:39.370
Girls" and I mean 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15
minutes, 20 minutes, 25 minutes,

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:40.969
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: People making comments.

00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:45.390
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: No exaggeration, not one person
under, not one person over the age of 30,

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:48.790
they were all under 30 and loved the Golden
Girls, "Oh my gosh this is my favorite episode.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.270
I always watch this before I leave the house."

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.610
I mean, 30 years later this show is still-

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.040
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Drawing young people.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:01.610
And if you, when I look back and think about
my viewing slate as a kid growing up in Central

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:07.810
Iowa in a very, sort of, homogenous part of
the country, my viewing slate was "What's

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:13.140
Happening" and "Sanford and Sons" and " The
Jeffersons" and I watched all of these shows

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.210
with a black cast and it never even occurred
to me that they weren't for me.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.070
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Well, and those were massive
hits.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.690
Today if you pitched a show with an all black
cast-

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.680
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: The assumption is that you'll
get a black audience.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.680
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: BET.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.589
Go to BET that's a great place for your all
black show.

00:09:27.589 --> 00:09:33.000
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Yeah, so I think networks
are now sometimes saying, "We can't afford

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.779
to be niche anymore because we'll only get
this one audience" when it's not the case.

00:09:38.779 --> 00:09:43.930
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Well exactly and so what they
end up doing is making generic content as

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:49.380
opposed to universal content when, when you
really look at the history of what works most

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:54.330
effectively, you have very specific characters,
you have, you have a world that you can't

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:58.060
relate to and that's why you're interested
in watching it because you wanna learn something

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.530
from it and see what that's all about.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:06.940
And by the end of that journey you realize
how much you do have in common, how much you

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.089
can relate and empathize.

00:10:08.089 --> 00:10:11.089
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: And, of course, this has
become self fulfilling.

00:10:11.089 --> 00:10:15.570
People know, oh I'm only supposed to watch
the content with the people look like me because

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.720
that's how it's being marketed to me and I
don't even see the ads for the things where

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.350
the characters all look like me.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.410
And you end up with the situation that we
have now, where when I was a kid, black and

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.310
white audiences watched the same shows.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:29.820
Now, other than Monday night football, I think
there is no overlap between the shows African

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:34.100
American audience members watch and white
audiences, it's like we have managed to split

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.670
it up but that doesn't have to be the case.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:39.620
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Well I think that there was a
natural fragmentation with the internet and

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:47.019
with, you know, different choices of things
to watch but I think that it's being fed by

00:10:47.019 --> 00:10:51.149
the other side as well because people are
going, "Oh, we want niche, okay let's make

00:10:51.149 --> 00:10:53.130
it just for this audience."

00:10:53.130 --> 00:11:00.751
And, you know, it's snowballing and both parties
I think are responsible, both the audience

00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:01.751
and the creators.

00:11:01.751 --> 00:11:05.519
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: And third, in case you forgot
we were counting on a list, the third and

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:10.730
final reason I think that network TV doesn't
make content like this is because the main

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:15.170
metric they have for measuring how well a
show is doing is pure ratings, just numbers,

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:19.720
households, not how engaged the people are
but just how many there are.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.019
And this would be like we had someone make
an analogy to us once about, like, "Imagine

00:11:24.019 --> 00:11:28.040
you're like a pork chop company and you've
got a Twitter site and you've got a million

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.089
followers but they're all vegetarians.

00:11:29.089 --> 00:11:31.179
You're not selling your pork chops."

00:11:31.179 --> 00:11:34.620
Like it doesn't matter what the numbers are
it matters whether you're reaching the right

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.940
people and it matters if they are engaged
in your product.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:41.300
So, TV doesn't measure it that way.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:42.820
So they're gonna look at a show like this-

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:43.820
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Absolutely.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:48.450
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: and just see how many people
they can get not are those people who are,

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:52.310
as we discovered when we put this up on Kickstarter,
yeah, only a thousand donors.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.889
A thousand donors who each pulled $60 out
of their wallet.

00:11:55.889 --> 00:12:01.029
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Yeah and I mean we had someone
approach us recently and ask, "Well how many

00:12:01.029 --> 00:12:02.029
views do you have?"

00:12:02.029 --> 00:12:04.389
And I'm like, Are you living three years ago?

00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:08.670
Like, how many views do we have, really?

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:14.730
600,000 the first season which is not an incredible
number.

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:16.910
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Yeah if you were a TV show-

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.310
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: It's pretty good for 22 minutes
but it's not an incredible number.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:27.100
So they we're like, oh you know, da, da, da
and I said, "But we raised $30,000 in 12 hours

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.260
if that makes a difference."

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:35.230
Yeah, if you've got a thousand people that
aren't buying your product and 100 people

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:39.890
that are buying three units of your product,
like, which do you want?

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:45.930
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Yeah, so that's why TV doesn't
make content like this, is that they're not,

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:49.740
they're making these assumptions like, "Oh
it'll get a small number of people and it'll

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:55.820
only appeal to a niche and testing tells us
things that we know are wrong but we believe

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:56.820
anyway."

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:57.820
So there's all sorts of reasons why.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.360
So, what's gonna happen to replace it?

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:05.149
The internet which is fantastic unless internet
ends up making the same mistakes TV did.

00:13:05.149 --> 00:13:09.240
There's this temptation to go, "Oh, how did
TV get to be what it is?

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:13.860
Let's do that same thing" and you end up just
copying all the bugs from the old software

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:14.860
into the new software.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:21.079
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Or on the other end of the spectrum,
trying to completely reinvent the wheel and,

00:13:21.079 --> 00:13:27.250
oh this new machine with this interface and
it's all about how we, you know, put the content

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:31.870
in front of the viewer and how we tag it and
how we get them to click on the next thing

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:36.019
and no, it's not really, it's just about making
great content.

00:13:36.019 --> 00:13:40.110
I mean, our engagement is 100 percent.

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:41.810
People sit and watch our content.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:49.920
Like when I hear other, other content creators
saying, you know, "This ADD thing, people

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.089
are just clicking off and they don't wanna
watch and we really just don't know how to

00:13:53.089 --> 00:13:56.870
wrangle it, you know, cause people are just
ADD now and that's all there is to it."

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:00.940
Making all these excuses and I don't know
how many of you have been in sales or seen

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.570
Glenngary Glenn Ross
[Laughter]

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:07.310
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: But it's not the leads, you know
what I mean?

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:09.690
Sell it, like don't blame the leads.

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:11.149
You either sell something or you don't.

00:14:11.149 --> 00:14:14.060
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Well kids are sitting there
playing video games till they fall over.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.459
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: They die.

00:14:15.459 --> 00:14:16.529
That's, I mean-

00:14:16.529 --> 00:14:17.959
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: That's an engaged audience.

00:14:17.959 --> 00:14:18.959
[Laughter]

00:14:18.959 --> 00:14:20.060
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: That's an engaged audience.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.060
[Laughter]

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.740
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: We should be, how can we
achieve?

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.950
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: How can we kill our audience?

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:28.111
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: But I think that the argument

00:14:28.111 --> 00:14:33.209
to that is that it's active and, you know,
viewing is passive but I disagree.

00:14:33.209 --> 00:14:38.860
When you are integrated with an audience that
is passionate about a show, look at "Mad Men"

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:39.860
parties.

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:44.550
People gathering at their houses, dressing
in period costumes, making drinks and watching

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.310
"Mad Men," it's social.

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:52.769
Like, you don't need a technical interface
to be social, TV has always been social.

00:14:52.769 --> 00:14:57.780
You know, the birth of Little Ricky, seventy
percent of Americans with a television were

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.270
watching the birth of Little Ricky all at
the same time.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:06.370
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: And TV has, because TV is,
network TV, traditional TV has gotten so chopped

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:11.110
up it isn't really about building community
and that 70 percent of the way people are

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.450
watching anymore, the internet is about building
community.

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:17.440
So if you take that building communities thing
that the internet does really well and you

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.190
take the emotional engagement that scripted
entertainment-

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:21.190
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Exactly.

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:25.081
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: does better than any other
form of entertainment where people are, they

00:15:25.081 --> 00:15:29.570
are hanging on the birth of Little Ricky because
it is novelistic, the script, you're waiting

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:31.860
to see what the writers have come up with.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:36.161
That same passion that people have for "Husbands"
of waiting, it kills them that they wait two

00:15:36.161 --> 00:15:38.980
weeks between the episodes cause they can't
wait to see what's gonna happen.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:39.980
They are pulled in.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:45.769
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Yeah, exactly and I think that
that is, the crucial element is the emotional

00:15:45.769 --> 00:15:51.649
attachment which, incidentally, I mean if
you wanna talk revenue, is also the first

00:15:51.649 --> 00:15:58.520
step toward making your audience more receptive
to being sold because they're already emotionally

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:03.269
invested in what they're watching and you
buy things emotionally.

00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:08.440
So if you're emotionally giving yourself already
when you're being advertised, too, then there's

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:14.060
already an emotional bond there that it makes
you a little more inclined to trust the people

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.500
putting that product in front of you.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:19.300
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Usually it's cause an initial
like this, the things that you see Cheeks

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:26.810
and Brady using design a lifestyle, a place,
a hip place, hip people and sort of an aspirational

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:27.810
lifestyle.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:33.829
So we had a fan in season one who tracked
down the hotel robe that Cheeks was wearing

00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:34.829
in a scene.

00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:36.650
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: This hotel was not publicly named.

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:38.440
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Right she had to figure it
out.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:44.220
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: She had to figure out what this
hotel was, contact them, purchase this, and

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.509
she lives in New Zealand
[Laughter]

00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:51.820
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: purchase this robe for over $100
and this is like a 19 year old university

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:52.820
student.

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:58.980
We're not talking like some, some eccentric,
wealthy person who has the means and the time,

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.949
without advertising it at all.

00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:05.790
In fact, there's a green necklace that I wear
in the scene where I'm talking to Haley in

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:11.089
the kitchen, Tweeted a picture of it, just
tweeted a picture and said "Day 2 on the set."

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:15.220
And immediately the response was "Where can
I get that necklace?

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.800
Oh my God, I want that necklace."

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.000
And that is because of an emotional attachment
to the character.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:29.890
It's the Rachel haircut, the Rachel haircut
from "Friends" was iconic and getting that

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:32.730
haircut meant that you were a fun single girl
[Laughter]

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:38.890
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: And everyone loved you and you
lit up the room, that is the connection that

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:40.710
people want to their programming.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:44.390
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: A lot of people are gonna
be getting the Brady.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:45.400
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Yeah, I think so.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.600
The Brady buzz cut.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.970
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: That is what we strive for.

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:55.240
We strive to entertain people in that way
and give people that connection because there

00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:01.020
is an audience out there that has been largely
abandoned by networks and cable that used

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.020
to love TV.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:10.840
I mean, cord cutter is a term now because
the internet has better things to offer and

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:17.669
TV doesn't and there are a lot of people that
are hungry and wandering around saying, "Where

00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:18.669
is it?

00:18:18.669 --> 00:18:19.760
Where's the good stuff?

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.030
What happened to must see TV?"

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.580
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Right.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:27.929
This is reinventing television or inventing
television, inventing must see TV all over

00:18:27.929 --> 00:18:28.929
again.

00:18:28.929 --> 00:18:32.240
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Yeah, so that sense of community
that you get when you watch television on

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:38.549
the internet combined with the fantastic programming
that television, in its heyday, offered.

00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:41.570
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: So that's our vision of the
future.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:46.600
That's how we think "Husbands" is inventing
television and I don't know, are you ready

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:47.600
for Q&amp;A?

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.600
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Yeah.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.600
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: You wanna hear what the people
have to say.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.690
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: I would love to know, yeah exactly,
what the feedback is from-

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.799
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Either the thoughts or the
show or really anything.

00:18:56.799 --> 00:19:01.940
We're happy to answer any questions.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:02.940
[Pause]

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.660
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Particularly because you're professionals
in this arena.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:11.350
&gt;&gt;female #1: I only watched the show for the
first time like a few days ago when I heard

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:14.200
that the talk was gonna be here and, because
I love "Firefly" and things like that I have

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.200
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Oh, thank you.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.030
&gt;&gt;female #1: I had to come to the talk.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.660
So I watched the show and I sat down there
and I thought, "Okay, I'll watch an episode"

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.390
but I didn't realize it was only like two
or three minutes an episode.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:23.390
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Oh, season one?

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:26.789
&gt;&gt;female #1: Yeah, season one, so I started
watching it and I was like, "Oh, okay, I can

00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:31.440
watch the whole season in the time it takes
me to normally watch an episode" which is

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:36.100
cool I could catch up on season one quickly
but I'm wondering about the format.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:41.500
I mean, I, it's so good but I can't sit there
and just like get into it.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.260
I can't, you know, I can't do a marathon of
"Husbands"

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.020
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: That's how things changed
between season one and season two.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.870
These, you saw, were much longer, these were
ten minute episodes.

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:53.260
&gt;&gt;female #1: Yeah actually I hadn't realized
how much time they were taking but they felt

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.260
like they went deeper.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.260
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Yeah.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.960
&gt;&gt;female #1: So is this just because you're
trying it out?

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.410
Is this what you think episodes should be
like?

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:01.410
Can you talk more about the format?

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:02.950
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Yeah, we think people are
feeling what you're feeling.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:07.570
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Well, yeah, there are a few reasons,
I mean, I think a year ago short form worked

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:12.300
better but I think that's how quickly the
internet evolves.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:21.710
People are watching content longer and we
are making television and television has traditionally

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:28.210
been a structured format of a half hour or
an hour and, you know, if we had the budget

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:33.309
we would certainly release 24-30 minute episodes
at a time.

00:20:33.309 --> 00:20:37.800
Since that's not really what we're doing right
now we thought that the best way to split

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:42.140
it up would be in three acts because, you
know, a sitcom has three acts and, yeah, it

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:47.830
does, it allows you to spend more time with
the characters and really get into the world.

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:57.280
Yeah, and, we have more hits on our 10 minute
episode than we had on our, at this point,

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.520
than we had at this point on our first 2 minute
episode.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.330
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Which is amazing for people
to sit for 10 minutes, like, it really has

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:05.330
changed.

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.570
People are starting to feel that what you're
feeling like, I wanna settle in like it's

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:08.570
a TV show.

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:09.570
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: It is a TV show.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:10.679
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: It's a TV show.

00:21:10.679 --> 00:21:14.920
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: So they're wondering where the
rest is and they're still complaining it's

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.700
too short at 10 minutes.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.330
"I want more, it's too short!"

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:23.601
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Yeah, people have that 22-24
minute programmed into our DNA from all the

00:21:23.601 --> 00:21:27.400
years of watching TV and ideally we would
hope to be able to make enough "Husbands"

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:33.190
that we could make a whole series of full
length 24 minute episodes.

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:39.080
Right now we can make one chunk of content
like that and we wanna, you know, you work

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.690
for many, many months to premier it all and
have it all blown out in a day would be a

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:44.690
shame.

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:48.809
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Right, well, interestingly enough,
you know, we talk in these terms of, "Well

00:21:48.809 --> 00:21:52.290
if we had the budget" that doesn't even mean
a network budget.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:22:01.730
I mean, we make an episode, a half hour episode
of "Husbands" for half of what one "Modern

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:03.309
Family" cast member gets paid.

00:22:03.309 --> 00:22:05.720
To put it into perspective.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.490
That would be our version of a big budget.

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:12.789
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: The third executive producer
on the show is Jeff Greenstein who directed

00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:17.100
the episodes and he's fantastic and he always
says, he writes for "Desperate Housewives"

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:20.549
and he always says that we make this show
for the bottled water budget on "Desperate

00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:21.549
Housewives."

00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:22.549
[Laughter]

00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:25.890
&gt;&gt;female #1: Have you thought about trying
to get a way for those 600,000 viewers or

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:27.250
whatever you had to contribute?

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.960
I mean, I also didn't know about your Kickstarter
thing.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.890
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Yeah, that's exactly how we made
season 2.

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:35.950
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Yeah we raised, we asked
for $50,000 they gave us $60,000.

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:43.210
So that, yeah, that paid for season 2 with
a little help but, yeah, I mean that if we

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:46.630
wanna make more that is one of the options
to stick up, to go back and say, keep taking

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:50.809
a look, you got more, you got anything else
in there?

00:22:50.809 --> 00:22:51.809
[Laughter]

00:22:51.809 --> 00:22:54.960
&gt;&gt;female #1: I mean, if all those "Firefly"
fans could have paid to have you write more

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.230
episodes I'm sure they would have, right?

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:57.630
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: I'm sure that's right.

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:03.600
I think, my first instinct with the Kickstarter
was to feel a little ooky about, like, gee

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.559
I'm asking people, I don't know what their
means are and I'm asking them for money to

00:23:07.559 --> 00:23:09.610
make a thing.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:13.690
And I sort of realized they, they're, it's
not a donation, it's a purchase.

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.960
They are buying this content because they
really, really want it.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.070
&gt;&gt;female #1: Yeah, Starbucks doesn't have
any problem asking for the money for the lattes,

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.070
right?

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:22.070
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Exactly.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:24.590
It's like buying a ticket to a movie, you
know, or yeah, renting it.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:26.460
I mean, you're supporting it.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:30.830
The more people that buy the ticket to the
first one there might be a sequel and maybe

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:31.830
it'll be good.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:35.820
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Yeah it's when we, like the
$50 incentive for the Kick starter was the

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:40.850
DVD and you start going, "We're charging $50
for a DVD, oh my God!"

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:42.980
Then you go, no we're not.

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.659
We're allowing them to buy more product and
here's the DVD we think you might like.

00:23:46.659 --> 00:23:52.690
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Well, and we were also simultaneously
able to offer them more content without expanding

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:56.289
the budget because we had behind the scenes
crew.

00:23:56.289 --> 00:24:03.929
So we have a documentary that's four, yeah
four installments at ten minutes apiece and,

00:24:03.929 --> 00:24:07.070
I mean, it's edited like a show.

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:13.450
It's entertaining and shows the highlights
and the relationships and what went on backstage

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:14.450
and the whole process.

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:17.570
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: So between every week, every
Wednesday they'll be a new episode or a new

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:20.440
behind the scenes which shows you the making
of the previous episode.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.059
So you can become a scholar of "Husband."

00:24:22.059 --> 00:24:23.059
[Laughter]

00:24:23.059 --> 00:24:25.559
&gt;&gt;female #1: I like the cameos, too.

00:24:25.559 --> 00:24:26.559
That's great.

00:24:26.559 --> 00:24:27.690
Nathan Fillion in the second season.

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:31.850
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Nathan Fillion in season
1 and season 2, yeah, I don't know if you

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:37.140
all recognize Josh Whedon and Mekhi Phifer
and Clare Grant were all in this, and John

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.740
Hodgman and Jon Cryer.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:43.799
Yeah, Jon Cryer, oh my God, a star of that
caliber, that was amazing.

00:24:43.799 --> 00:24:48.640
&gt;&gt;male #1: You have a lot to say about how
networks screen and choose their programming.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:53.550
Do you see a future where instead of improving
that, networks just pick up shows that have

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:57.950
started and proven that they have an audience
through, you know, internet mediums such as

00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:58.950
yours?

00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:59.990
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: There's been some of that,
yeah.

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:01.159
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: They've done that.

00:25:01.159 --> 00:25:04.520
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Web therapy, Children's Hospital,
there's been a couple shows like that.

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:05.520
Yeah.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.500
But then you start just thinking of yourself
as being in the developmental ball park of

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:12.730
the baseball system and it's, it's, it gets
in that same mindset of like well you're the

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.000
little pond.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.410
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Exactly.

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:23.679
Exactly, it doesn't, it's fishing something
out of the ocean and putting it in a barrel.

00:25:23.679 --> 00:25:30.200
And the perception right now is "Oh, you made
the jump to TV" like TV is the king.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:35.360
Well that broadcast thing is not actually
TV.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.210
The web is TV as we've established.

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:43.419
&gt;&gt;male #1: I guess I'll take your answers
that you think content creators in your position

00:25:43.419 --> 00:25:45.300
shouldn't shoot for the networks as a sign
of success.

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.300
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Exactly.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:51.169
&gt;&gt;male #1: Although I still have the question,
do you think that networks will continue to

00:25:51.169 --> 00:25:54.559
reach down and pull in, pull in content-

00:25:54.559 --> 00:25:56.809
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Throughout the net and pull up
all the-

00:25:56.809 --> 00:25:58.419
&gt;&gt;male #1: Yeah, rather than develop their
own shows.

00:25:58.419 --> 00:26:02.620
I'm thinking if I'm a network executive why
should I risk, you know, I don't know how

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:06.770
many 10's of millions of dollars to watch
a show, instead I could buy something, buy

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:09.480
the rights to something that's proven to have
a content and, you know?

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.220
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Yeah I think they will.

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:14.870
I think it's a little tricky because they
look at viewing numbers, like we're saying,

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:19.890
instead of engagement so it's not really of
the metrics to know what to pull out.

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:23.850
But I love this analogy, it's like they're
lying to lobsters, we've been lying to lobsters

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:24.910
for years.

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:28.559
You've graduated from the ocean to this swanky
tank in this fancy restaurant.

00:26:28.559 --> 00:26:29.559
[Laughter]

00:26:29.559 --> 00:26:33.659
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: That's exactly; oh my God I wanna
see a cartoon.

00:26:33.659 --> 00:26:34.760
[Laughter]

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:42.660
&gt;&gt;male #2: If I may, I don't wanna be picky
but it's, I mean, when I hear the word content

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:47.029
and I think of some product sold in a box
or something in a jar.

00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:51.940
I mean, I think it kind of disparages your
work, I mean, why not call it a great show

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:52.940
or something like that.

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:56.049
I just heard so many times, content, every
time I felt, eeh?

00:26:56.049 --> 00:26:57.549
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Well no, you're right.

00:26:57.549 --> 00:26:59.370
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: What word would you rather us
use?

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:02.409
&gt;&gt;male #2: I don’t know, I mean it's a show,
it's a nice show, it's a great story.

00:27:02.409 --> 00:27:08.900
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Isn't it amazing, though, that
it can be a commercial product and a great

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:12.070
show with an artistic message with real emotion
and characters?

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:17.370
&gt;&gt;male #2: Even mention it's an awesome commercial
product but I mean, content, it's just so

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:18.370
low, I think.

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:22.970
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: I know what you mean because
it equates the same, it's, "Oh, 10 minutes

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:29.080
of programming" as if you're squeezing toothpaste
out of a tube and that's, it's the content

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.200
of, I get what he's saying.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:34.520
And the metaphor suggests that it's not the,
it's not the quality of the toothpaste it's

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.679
the amount.

00:27:35.679 --> 00:27:37.380
But we don't have a better word right now.

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:40.010
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Yeah, well, okay.

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:44.809
I don't think content is a bad word I think
that content gets a bad rap because there's

00:27:44.809 --> 00:27:46.149
not a lot of good content.

00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:48.520
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: But, I mean, yes, this is show

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:56.620
business not show art and we are interested
in both the creative and the social statement

00:27:56.620 --> 00:28:01.909
and doing something good and being entertaining
and all of that comes first but we certainly

00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:06.690
never forget that it has to be a commercial
product and that it has to be content offered

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:08.380
in a way that earns revenue.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.490
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: I hear you.

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:15.230
Actually the social good is a thing that we
wanted to mention that we forgot to mention

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:19.000
which is like one of the things we love about
the show is that it isn't just good and entertaining,

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.440
we actually think it does, it does good for
the world which is another way that it feels

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:29.040
like it is a right to associate it with the
internet where people have that kind of global

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.080
reach and influence.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.370
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Yeah.

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:38.890
&gt;&gt;male #3: This is a question about the writing
that you went through for this.

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:44.990
You clearly, you talked about how you feel
like the 22, 24 minutes kind of engrained

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:49.059
into people, and you clearly, you couldn't,
you didn't do that, you only had like the

00:28:49.059 --> 00:28:53.570
10 minute episodes but you were telling that
kind of 24 minuteish story.

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:57.460
How did you approach that in the attempt to
not recreate the wheel but still take the

00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.880
good things from the way TV does it?

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:02.110
Like, was that different from other shows
you've written?

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:06.299
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Actually, half hour shows
usually are written in three acts about 8

00:29:06.299 --> 00:29:07.330
minutes each.

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:10.360
So we were doing exactly what TV does.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.679
&gt;&gt;male #3: You didn't make any changes for
the fact that you knew that there'd be a large

00:29:13.679 --> 00:29:15.899
chunk of time between each of the acts.

00:29:15.899 --> 00:29:18.559
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: No we didn't particularly
bother to reset it or anything.

00:29:18.559 --> 00:29:21.670
We knew people would be able to go back and
watch their way into it.

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:25.299
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Yeah because, exactly, on the
screen the other videos, the other episode

00:29:25.299 --> 00:29:26.880
is right there if you've missed anything or-

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:31.860
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: We want it to feel as much
like traditional, what people are used to,

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:35.110
as possible and time tested formula.

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:38.309
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: But, yeah, it is television so
we made television.

00:29:38.309 --> 00:29:39.309
It's annoying.

00:29:39.309 --> 00:29:44.130
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: But you know what we could
do, we could swear.

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:45.130
[Laughter]

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:46.130
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: That's true.

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:49.450
Well and that's the really cool thing is that
it is television without boundary.

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:50.450
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Right.

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:51.450
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: At all.

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:55.240
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: We could have that bedroom
scene which was not particularly anything

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:59.580
beyond what you could see on any sort of sex
scene in a-

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.120
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Oh easily, soap opera.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.480
One o'clock in the afternoon, children could
be watching.

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.480
[Laughter]

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:08.700
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: But we did feel this great
freedom to show something that other places

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.690
might have blanched at, blanched and fallen
out of their chairs.

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:13.980
&gt;&gt;male #4: I love the writing sprints.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.120
I think that's very cool.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.440
A lot of Google code has been written during
writing sprints.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.440
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Really?

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.440
&gt;&gt;male #4: Yeah.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.440
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Oh my God.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.440
&gt;&gt;male #4: For real.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:26.430
And I just wanted to ask you to talk a little
bit about how because the internet is a much

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:32.100
more bidirectional medium and there's, like,
a channel coming back from the fans, like,

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:36.070
what made you decide to, like, invite people,
like, "No, you be creative, too."

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:37.070
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Right.

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:38.929
It was totally, I totally backed into it.

00:30:38.929 --> 00:30:43.470
I was like, "Geeze I need to write and I'm
sitting here on Twitter and I'm just getting

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:44.470
pulled into it.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:47.130
I’m having too much fun and I'm not gonna
write unless I just promise myself I'm gonna

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:48.130
write.

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:50.690
Oh hey, I can promise Twitter I'm gonna write."

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:56.280
So it was just I'm gonna write in 20 minutes,
and then almost as an afterthought I put in

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.340
like, "Why don't you do it too?"

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:03.060
And people loved, everybody would come back
at the end of the hour and say, "I finished

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:04.690
my dissertation, I'm gonna write a novel."

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:05.690
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: "I started that screen play

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:09.680
I haven't dusted off in 10 years" like suddenly
people were getting all this stuff done and

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:13.440
I realized, okay, this isn't just good for
me but it's helping people get stuff done,

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.730
it's that community building and now they're
sort of like a regular group of people when

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:18.130
I announce a writing sprint.

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:22.740
I don't know what they're doing that they're
able to drop everything but there's just this

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:26.630
whole flock of them that every time I announce
it it's like, "I'm in!" and they write or

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:34.650
clean their kitchen or code or edit or something
for that hour and it's wonderful and it's,

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:37.490
and so many people come up to me and thank
me for them and it's really made me realize

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:40.460
the power I didn't know that was out there.

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:44.990
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Yeah, that's the thing about
getting people to go out there and galvanize

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:47.290
and really do something in real life.

00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:50.720
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: And I love your shirt, you're
wearing your marriage equality, gay rights

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.240
Google shirt.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.500
Woo!

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.760
Nice.

00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:00.510
Yeah, we've actually been gifted with those
shirts already, we love them very much.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:04.510
&gt;&gt;male #5: We have a question from the VC
from another office.

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:07.169
This is a question from Rob Borner.

00:32:07.169 --> 00:32:11.799
He says, "I was intrigued by the comment Cheeks
makes in the Return of the Zebra that he has

00:32:11.799 --> 00:32:16.440
an exotic femininity in a society that views
that as weakness.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:20.899
Could you expand on that and say if one of
the goals of the show is to combat that social

00:32:20.899 --> 00:32:22.169
stigma?"

00:32:22.169 --> 00:32:27.799
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Combat is not a word I would
use.

00:32:27.799 --> 00:32:31.370
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Appropriate is not the word.

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:35.850
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: But yes, comment on it, certainly

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:39.659
I think that yes.

00:32:39.659 --> 00:32:45.830
Masculine means you are strong and you are
a provider and you can kill, roar.

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:53.269
Feminine means, oh you're helpless and oh
goodness and I think particularly ditzy and

00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:58.880
aloof and you can't be all that serious and
you can't be all that intelligent.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:05.470
So yes, part of the character of Cheeks and
part of the message, "message" I don't like

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:13.140
that word, of the show is that femininity
is strength and there is power there and there

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:14.860
is intelligence there and-

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:15.860
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: It's not a bad word.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:20.260
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: It's not a bad word, yeah, and
people say, yeah cause I get that like, "You're

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:24.970
a little more, no, you tend to be a little
more feminine."

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:26.390
What?

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:28.380
Like that was gonna offend me?

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:29.380
Like, I know.

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.390
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: I like that.

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:35.350
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: You know, and the whole notion

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:39.420
of like, well why doesn't he just dress like
a woman or why doesn't he just be a girl if

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:40.420
he wants to be a girl?

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:41.420
I don't.

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:42.420
I like being a guy.

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.160
I like all the things about being a guy.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.970
I love peeing standing up.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:46.970
[Laughter]

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:47.970
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: So jealous.

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:53.559
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: I mean, being a dude is so much
easier than being a chick.

00:33:53.559 --> 00:33:55.830
You could not pay me.

00:33:55.830 --> 00:34:03.240
But I love femininity and I, you know, I don't,
it's just not, why look down on it?

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:07.930
I don't understand why our society does that,
this hyper masculinization thing.

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:12.810
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: And you're saying something
in episode we just watched about owning your

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:16.130
stereotype, owning a stereotype, not being
afraid of it.

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:17.360
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: If it's authentic to you.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.360
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Right.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:23.050
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Like there's a difference between
adopting an identity that you feel is built

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:29.580
on a legacy of, yeah, stereotypes that have
come before you that you need to have to belong

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:30.580
to a community.

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:31.940
That's totally different.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:33.220
What I'm saying is I love Madonna.

00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:36.050
I have always loved Madonna.

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:39.129
I mean, not so much lately she's getting kind
of out of control.

00:34:39.129 --> 00:34:41.389
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: But I mean, yeah, I was six years

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:43.859
old and I was like voguing my face off.

00:34:43.859 --> 00:34:47.460
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: I just, like, what am I supposed

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:50.829
to butch it up so that people take me more
seriously?

00:34:50.829 --> 00:34:57.050
Or because I represent every gay man in the
world, it doesn't make sense.

00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:58.050
You know, so.

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:01.720
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: What I love is that by using
the word femininity, you aren't just defending

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:05.570
men you're defending all of womanhood, too.

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:14.240
You're pointing out the history of femininity,
femaleness and saying this has gotten a bad

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.240
rap the whole time.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.240
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Right.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:19.820
Well, I think that every human being has masculine
and feminine qualities.

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:25.730
Last night I drilled screws into the tile
so that I could hang a clock.

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:26.730
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Awesome.

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:27.730
[Laughter]

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:32.530
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: And my friend said, "You're so
butch sometimes."

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:35.680
And, you know, then I opened a jar of pickles
for her.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.580
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: But we all have masculine and

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:42.570
feminine traits so I don't see any reason
to be afraid of them or ashamed of them or

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:49.599
to play them down or to deny that they're
there because we're afraid of how it, how

00:35:49.599 --> 00:35:50.940
it might reflect on us.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:55.450
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: But then as soon as you tap
into one of the very few negative comments

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:59.400
that we ever get on the show which is like,
"Oh a stereotype" and it's like, if people

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.440
watch the show carefully they'll see that
that, we're saying something about stereotype.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:06.250
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Well, yeah, exactly and you have
to start someplace in order to have an arc

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:11.290
and I did see an interesting comment about
this most recent episode that said, "You know,

00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:17.690
if a girl were doing this like Lucy or Dharma,
it would be endearing but on a guy it's just

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:18.690
annoying."

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:23.550
And I thought, "Well there's a whole new conversation."

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:29.320
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Why is Lucy endearing but a man

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:33.980
is anno- a man is bratty, a man isn't thinking
about other people when he does it, like,

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:34.980
what's with that double standard?

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:35.980
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Yeah.

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.970
I saw a comment that called Cheeks an airhead,
the character Cheeks and it's like if you

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:42.020
watch more than a minute of our show you'll
see that he's the smart one.

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:45.740
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: And to me that's the person that's
listening to the tone of voice who's seeing

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:51.660
the mannerisms, like, I could be saying some
really intelligent thesis but, like, if I'm

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:53.010
saying it like this
[Laughter]

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:56.270
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: You're just looking at this;
you're listening to the words I'm saying.

00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:59.082
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: And that's kind of my point.

00:36:59.082 --> 00:37:05.600
&gt;&gt;male #6: If I may ask a second question
actually trying to build on that, still I

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:10.550
think there's still society has kind of a
problem when straight men have a feminine

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:11.550
side.

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:15.710
I think, it's still not acceptable, I mean,
I personally have that problem a lot and it

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:18.890
seems like people look at you in a weird way.

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:24.980
So, I mean, I don't think it's just a problem
that gay men have, it's just-

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:25.980
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: I completely agree.

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:33.990
I think that men need a revolution which sounds
ridiculous because men run the world.

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:36.560
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: And make more money than women,

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.750
I mean, it's true.

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:39.690
So like why do men need a revolution?

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:45.060
Well, because there are, there are so many
different interpretations of what a woman

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:46.060
can be.

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:49.960
You can be a ballerina or you can be a truck
driver, you know, girl power, girls can do

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.580
anything.

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.120
That's a message that's promoted a lot.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:38:01.340
Now it's not always executed very well but
there is that idea in society and a man has

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:08.790
to be one very specific model of what a heterosexual
man acts like and if he doesn't act that way

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:14.760
somethings, he's gay or, you know, there's
something going on there.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:24.280
So, yes, I absolutely think men need a revolution
to say, like, and I think it's probably men's

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.230
fault, too, I think men probably play into
it.

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:32.170
They don't want to go outside the box, they're
afraid of being judged like every human being

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:40.480
and they don't want to seem yeah, like any
way they might come across, any possible perception

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:43.230
that might exist if they step a toe over that
line.

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:48.070
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: So much of this is so engrained,
of all the different things we're talking

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:49.070
about.

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:53.140
I was just thinking about you've got fine
china but you wanna imply this isn't, this

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:56.809
isn't fine china this is almost like a parody,
this is low quality fine china, this is the

00:38:56.809 --> 00:38:58.450
paper plate version of fine china, chinette.

00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:03.940
We'll put the feminine ending on it so to
me [cannot understand] and it's like stuff

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:08.941
gets engrained that tight in our language
so it's, it's gonna take, it's gonna take

00:39:08.941 --> 00:39:12.290
a show like "Husbands" to fix it.

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:13.290
[Laughter]

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:15.540
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Well, I mean, yeah.

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:23.450
I think that, I have this story that I like,
it's sort of a parable about starfish and

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:27.339
there's two guys walking on the beach and
there's one of them throwing starfish back

00:39:27.339 --> 00:39:28.339
into the ocean-

00:39:28.339 --> 00:39:29.339
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Cause they're all washed
up and drowning.

00:39:29.339 --> 00:39:31.119
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Yeah there's like, you know-

00:39:31.119 --> 00:39:32.119
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Suffering.

00:39:32.119 --> 00:39:37.830
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: If you've ever seen starfish
beached and then they die, so he's throwing,

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:41.620
one by one, these starfish back into the ocean
and the other guy says, "Why are you doing

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:42.620
that?

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:43.730
You can't save all of them.

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:47.810
Like, what does it matter?" and the other
guys says, "Well, it matters to that one.

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:50.740
It matters to that one."

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:51.740
[Laughter]

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:52.740
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: "And it matters to that one."

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:57.900
So, yes, that is what we're trying to do with
"Husbands" and just because, you know, everyone

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:05.530
in the world doesn't know what "Husbands"
is, is no reason not to try and go with that

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:06.530
change.

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:07.530
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Reprogram.

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:08.530
Reach every starfish with a computer.

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:09.530
[Laughter]

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:10.530
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Yeah.

00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:11.530
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: That's our goal.

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:12.530
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Exactly.

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:13.530
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Wow, that went fast.

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:16.849
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: I mean, if there's anyone else
we're happy.

00:40:16.849 --> 00:40:20.300
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Oh yeah we're.

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:26.150
[Pause]
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Yeah you can get poster advertising

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:28.520
the talk signed by both of us.

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:30.609
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: I didn't know we had posters.

00:40:30.609 --> 00:40:31.730
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: We have posters.

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:32.730
Dude, we're big time.

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:33.730
[Laughter]

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:35.954
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Well I have 8x10's of me and
Brady in our underwear if you want those.

00:40:35.954 --> 00:40:37.730
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: No I really do if you want them,

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:38.730
they're pretty.

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:40.980
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Yeah we have season 2 promo
pictures.

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:46.819
So, I think that concludes our official talk
now it's just all underpants pictures for

00:40:46.819 --> 00:40:47.990
the rest of the time.

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:50.430
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: So come on up and say hi.

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:51.430
[Applause]

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:52.430
&gt;&gt;Brad Bell: Thank you.

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:53.070
&gt;&gt;Jane Espenson: Thank you.
