00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:10.977
<i> Sherpa does not mean
 to carry something.</i>

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.579
<i> It's an ethnic group,
 it's not a job.</i>

00:00:14.313 --> 00:00:15.915
<i> I wanted to know
 about the Sherpa.</i>

00:00:15.948 --> 00:00:20.419
<i>And reveal a part of their soul
and their life and their vision</i>

00:00:20.452 --> 00:00:21.453
<i> that we don't normally see</i>

00:00:21.487 --> 00:00:23.489
<i> in those adventure magazines.</i>

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:27.827
( applause )

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.962
Um...

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:31.998
<i> I gotta comment on
 this one really quick.</i>

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:33.466
<i> This is Danuru Sherpa.</i>

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:34.701
<i> He became a really close
 friend of mine</i>

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:36.435
<i> and was my guide
 in the mountains.</i>

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.973
<i> And he is checking
 Facebook on his iPhone.</i>

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:42.341
<i> I'm not kidding, it's not
 like my opening joke</i>

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:43.543
<i>It's what he is actually doing.</i>

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:47.013 line:0%
You can get really, really
good full-bar service

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:50.617 line:0%
at Camp One on Ama Dablam
at 21,000 feet, so...

00:00:53.252 --> 00:00:55.654
I'm the lucky guy that got
to photograph this story.

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:58.557
I actually didn't really care
about all this Everest drama

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:01.927
and all these big adventure
stories that overtake every...

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:03.930
adventure magazine
every single May.

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:05.698
<i> I wanted to know
 about the Sherpa.</i>

00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:08.000
<i> And I hope I'm going
 to be able to show you</i>

00:01:08.034 --> 00:01:09.669
<i> some images tonight that'll</i>

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:13.372
<i>reveal a part of their soul and
 their life and their vision</i>

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:16.142
<i> that we don't normally see in
 those adventure magazines.</i>

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:18.010
<i> You know, it all
 started simply enough.</i>

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:19.779
<i> This is the trek to
 Everest base camp.</i>

00:01:19.812 --> 00:01:21.681
<i> But I knew eventually
 that I would end up</i>

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:23.583
<i> getting into this.</i>

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:25.785
<i> And I knew eventually we'd
 get into this. Right?</i>

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:28.054
<i> And this is really
 not my territory.</i>

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:30.423
<i> This was my warm-up hike.</i>

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:33.559
<i> This is at around 20,000 feet.</i>

00:01:33.592 --> 00:01:36.762
It's really important to
reinforce this fact...

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:39.465
Sherpa does not mean
to carry something.

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:42.268
You know, we got all kinds of
packs, stuff called the Sherpa.

00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:44.270
Baby carriers called
the Sherpa...

00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:47.072
It's an ethnic group,
it's not a job.

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:48.775
<i> These guys are not Sherpas.</i>

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:51.110
<i> They're porters and they are
 of a different ethnic group.</i>

00:01:51.143 --> 00:01:53.913
<i> They are the Rai ethnic
 group, from lower in Nepal.</i>

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:56.582
<i> The Sherpa's work begins here,
 begins at base camp.</i>

00:01:56.616 --> 00:02:00.286
<i> You can see porters unloading
 these massive packs</i>

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.221
<i> down here in the
 bottom of the frame.</i>

00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:05.792
<i> And it's from this point on
 that the Sherpa's job begins.</i>

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:08.828
<i>They carry the loads up through
 the really difficult terrain.</i>

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:11.563
<i> The terrain that requires the
 crampons and the ice-axe</i>

00:02:11.597 --> 00:02:13.465
<i> as they go through
 the Khumbu Ice Fall</i>

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.835
<i>twenty-thirty times in a season.</i>

00:02:15.868 --> 00:02:18.604
<i> A lot of these loads are
 upwards of 150-pounds.</i>

00:02:18.637 --> 00:02:21.774
<i>If you shove that whole backpack
 full of oxygen canisters</i>

00:02:21.807 --> 00:02:23.642
<i> it's incredible
 weights, more than...</i>

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:25.677
<i> more than the body
 weight quite often.</i>

00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:29.748
<i> The work the Sherpa are famous
for is this high altitude work.</i>

00:02:29.882 --> 00:02:31.984
<i> This is Ama Dablam Camp Two.</i>

00:02:32.017 --> 00:02:34.920
<i> This is one of the most
 dramatic camps in the world,</i>

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:37.323
<i> That you can only fit
 five or six tents.</i>

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:38.857
<i> They're all at a
 little bit of an angle.</i>

00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:40.660
<i> It's the last place
 you can sleep</i>

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:42.061
<i> before you get
 into the slopes</i>

00:02:42.094 --> 00:02:44.731
<i> that can really avalanche
 off on that mountain.</i>

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:46.132
<i> And I want to
 put in one like</i>

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:47.600
<i> personal point of
 view photograph</i>

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:49.469
<i> to show you what I see.</i>

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:51.804
<i> What I have to do to
 make these photographs.</i>

00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:54.107
<i> I'm not a mountaineer,
 so these were...</i>

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.741
this was a new
environment for me.

00:02:55.774 --> 00:02:59.078
This is the, this is one of
those tents right there.

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:02.148
I'm kinda walking past one
that's right below them...

00:03:03.582 --> 00:03:05.451
to cross this little
bridge there.

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:09.255
Back at base camp
the Sherpas gather

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:11.691
<i> with their expedition
 team, to discuss</i>

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:13.059
<i> their roles on
 the mountains.</i>

00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:14.426
<i> Who's gonna set
 up Camp One,</i>

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.895
<i> who's gonna take
 down Camp Two...</i>

00:03:15.928 --> 00:03:17.497
<i> who's gonna carry
 the kitchen gear</i>

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.098
<i> who's gonna carry all the
 Western climber's stuff.</i>

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.768
<i> And in the case
 of this meeting</i>

00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:24.303
they're actually discussing
who is going to take down

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:26.205
the dead body of
a Bangladeshi climber

00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:27.607
that was left on the summit.

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:30.276
The family had
paid this company

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:32.144
to try to go back
and retrieve it.

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:35.548
<i>One of their main jobs, besides
 carrying these heavy loads</i>

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:37.783
<i> above base camp is
 also essentially</i>

00:03:37.816 --> 00:03:40.019
<i> the herding of the
 human cattle.</i>

00:03:40.052 --> 00:03:41.554
<i> You know, we've got these
 big lines of people</i>

00:03:41.587 --> 00:03:43.189
<i> going up these ropes and</i>

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.057
<i> on a lot of these
 Himalayan peaks they go</i>

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.393
<i> almost all the way from the
 base to the summit</i>

00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:49.561
<i>on many of the Himalayan climbs.</i>

00:03:49.595 --> 00:03:51.830
And these are rope systems that

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:54.967
a client can clip into
with an ascender and

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.303
just keep putting one
foot after another

00:03:57.336 --> 00:03:59.471
all the way to the
top of the mountain.

00:03:59.805 --> 00:04:02.107
<i> And quite often
 people will go up</i>

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:04.276
<i> incredibly difficult
 looking faces</i>

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:07.113
<i> and dangerous faces with
 the help of the Sherpas just</i>

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:09.047
<i> because of these ropes.</i>

00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:11.451
<i> You can see in this
 image, a Western climber</i>

00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:14.287
<i>I think this guy's... this looks
 like a French-German group.</i>

00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:16.522
<i> He didn't know how
 to use his ascender</i>

00:04:16.556 --> 00:04:20.393
<i> and he's being taught
 100-meters below the summit.</i>

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:23.862
His Sherpa helper actually had
to take away the ascender

00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:26.266
and show how to unclip
it and reclip it on.

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:28.500
And then actually made
a couple of pulls for him

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:30.603
so he could get up a
couple of feet and then

00:04:30.703 --> 00:04:32.871
you know, if this on Everest you
start having that bottleneck

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:34.507
and hundreds of people pile up.

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:37.343
<i> You know, climbers like
 that will often choose</i>

00:04:37.376 --> 00:04:40.279
<i> this particular mountain
 as their first peak.</i>

00:04:40.746 --> 00:04:43.850
<i>And will actually have to climb
 below that hanging glacier</i>

00:04:43.883 --> 00:04:45.184
<i> over there to the right.</i>

00:04:45.384 --> 00:04:48.855
<i>Once the camps get established,
 at these higher altitudes</i>

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:50.689
<i> the guides, these
 amazing athletes</i>

00:04:50.723 --> 00:04:52.658
<i> they kinda snap
 into a new role.</i>

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:55.228
<i> It's really like
 kitchen helpers.</i>

00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:57.363
<i> They're boiling
 water and cooking</i>

00:04:57.396 --> 00:04:59.265
<i> food and taking
 care of everybody.</i>

00:04:59.298 --> 00:05:04.003
<i> And it was amazing for me
 to watch these athletes</i>

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:06.838
<i> doing this kind of work,
 was like watching</i>

00:05:06.872 --> 00:05:08.808
<i> the NBA All-Star team like,</i>

00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:12.078
<i> waiting hand and foot on
 wealthy clients.</i>

00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:15.515
It's like having
Michael Jordan or LeBron James

00:05:15.548 --> 00:05:18.184
like, serving you,
like, cereal in bed

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:19.985
while you're still in
your sleeping bag.

00:05:20.118 --> 00:05:21.020
( audience laughter )

00:05:21.053 --> 00:05:22.321
'Cause these guys
they really are some

00:05:22.354 --> 00:05:23.589
of the best athletes
in the world.

00:05:23.622 --> 00:05:26.158
And they are spooning
this dude's sugar.

00:05:26.425 --> 00:05:27.893
( audience laughter )

00:05:27.927 --> 00:05:30.329
And then asking whether he
wants butter on his toast.

00:05:31.196 --> 00:05:34.300
And this happens because
they pay the money for that.

00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:39.372
On Everest we're talking
40 to 120 thousand dollars.

00:05:40.405 --> 00:05:44.010
<i> For me, this story
 was about this guy.</i>

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.712
<i> It was not about
 the famous Sherpa,</i>

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:49.448
<i> it's not about the guy that
 has all the big sponsors,</i>

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:51.617
<i> it's not about the
 world record holder,</i>

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.119
<i> it's about, kind of</i>

00:05:53.152 --> 00:05:55.053
<i> the blue-collar worker
 of the Sherpa world.</i>

00:05:55.087 --> 00:05:59.025
<i> The guy that just does the
 work to pay for his family.</i>

00:05:59.058 --> 00:06:00.526
This guy has maybe
climbed Everest

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:02.595
two, three, four times.

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:05.530
He wants to pay to get
his kids through school.

00:06:05.564 --> 00:06:07.666
And he is gonna go risk
his life to do that.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.802
Death rates for
Sherpas working in

00:06:09.835 --> 00:06:12.037
the mountains on
these expeditions

00:06:12.071 --> 00:06:15.508
statistically is higher
than the death rates

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:18.477
of US soldiers
in the Iraq War.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.746
So, pretty dangerous job.

00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:24.817
<i> But at the end of the day
 this is just about the money.</i>

00:06:25.417 --> 00:06:27.452
<i> A lot of these guys really
 don't want to do this job.</i>

00:06:27.486 --> 00:06:29.054
<i> They do it because there is</i>

00:06:29.088 --> 00:06:31.957
<i> a river of money running
 by their villages</i>

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.425
<i> and the only way to get it</i>

00:06:33.458 --> 00:06:36.629
<i> is to jump in and follow it
 all the way to Everest.</i>

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:39.365
<i> This was a surprising scene
 I also saw on pay day.</i>

00:06:39.398 --> 00:06:41.133
<i> It was a little
 gambling and what</i>

00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:42.534
<i> was surprising
 was that they were</i>

00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:45.704
<i> some of these guys were
 playing with $100 bills</i>

00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:49.175
<i> which would be like playing
 with $2000 bills here.</i>

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:51.677
It was a lot of money to
be messing around with.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:52.945
But I guess they
were celebrating

00:06:52.978 --> 00:06:54.346
the fact that they
had survived.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.882
<i> At the end of the
 Everest season, though</i>

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:58.818
<i> I followed down my Sherpa
 guides and friends</i>

00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:01.086
<i> because I wanted to go
 into the villages to see</i>

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:03.856
<i> what their daily life and
 culture looked like.</i>

00:07:04.323 --> 00:07:06.859
<i> This is Namche Bazaar.</i>

00:07:06.892 --> 00:07:08.593
<i> It's really the
 hub and the heart.</i>

00:07:08.627 --> 00:07:10.596
<i> It's where everybody
 kind of comes in.</i>

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.064
It's the center of
trading, it's the

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:14.533
last place to buy
all of your gear.

00:07:14.733 --> 00:07:17.302
Some people might even
helicopter into this place.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.040
<i> It's a tourist town full
 of hotels, restaurants.</i>

00:07:21.073 --> 00:07:24.243
<i> It's probably tripled in size
 over the last ten years.</i>

00:07:24.276 --> 00:07:25.978
<i> Twenty years ago there were
 none of these tin roofs.</i>

00:07:26.011 --> 00:07:29.849
<i> It's really big money is
 running through this village</i>

00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:31.583
<i> because so many
 people are on this</i>

00:07:31.616 --> 00:07:33.686
<i> trail and coming
 into the mountains.</i>

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:36.555
<i> But I also got off the
 beaten track a little bit.</i>

00:07:36.588 --> 00:07:40.492
<i>This is the village of Phortse.
It's not on the main, main path.</i>

00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:42.962
<i>And this town stands out because</i>

00:07:42.995 --> 00:07:45.831
<i> it has the record for the
 most Everest summiters.</i>

00:07:45.864 --> 00:07:49.001
Not the most summits, I
believe that's Thame but

00:07:49.034 --> 00:07:52.438
Phortse has 60 people that
have summited Everest.

00:07:53.905 --> 00:07:55.474
And that's nearly every home...

00:07:55.508 --> 00:07:57.076
in this village has somebody who

00:07:57.109 --> 00:08:01.547
either actively works right now
or has worked on the mountain.

00:08:02.214 --> 00:08:04.283
<i> You know, these are
 really quiet villages.</i>

00:08:04.316 --> 00:08:05.751
<i> This is the village
 of Thame</i>

00:08:05.785 --> 00:08:08.421
<i> where people grow
 potatoes, herd yaks.</i>

00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:10.122
<i> There aren't a lot
 of other options</i>

00:08:10.155 --> 00:08:12.358
<i> for making an income
 besides the mountain.</i>

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:14.226
Running a tea-house,
running a lodge

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.594
those are kind of the dreams.

00:08:15.627 --> 00:08:18.397
A lot of people save up their
money to start up a tea-house

00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:20.499
so they won't have to keep
working in the mountains.

00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:24.303
<i> Life is really quiet and
 slow in these places.</i>

00:08:24.336 --> 00:08:27.940
<i> With the exception of the
 heated volleyball matches</i>

00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:30.742
<i> that happen almost every day.</i>

00:08:30.775 --> 00:08:32.244
<i> They were awesome to watch</i>

00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:35.580
<i> they were super serious
 about volleyball.</i>

00:08:35.614 --> 00:08:37.750
<i>This is Sherpas versus porters.</i>

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:39.285
( audience laughter )

00:08:39.718 --> 00:08:43.221
I saw several of these matches
that were Sherpa on Sherpa

00:08:43.255 --> 00:08:46.258
where every single member of
both sides had summited Everest.

00:08:46.291 --> 00:08:47.659
Those were cool to see.

00:08:47.993 --> 00:08:49.962
You know, whole games
of Everest summiters

00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:51.163
from the age of 16

00:08:51.196 --> 00:08:53.832
to some of the guys
in their 50s still doing it.

00:08:53.865 --> 00:08:57.836
<i> This is like the new face
 of Everest climbing.</i>

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.305
<i>That guy on the left I think was</i>

00:08:59.338 --> 00:09:01.206
<i> the youngest guide in the
 last handful of years.</i>

00:09:01.239 --> 00:09:03.276
<i> He had just turned 16.</i>

00:09:04.443 --> 00:09:06.878
<i> This is, now we're going
 three generations back.</i>

00:09:06.912 --> 00:09:09.214
<i> This guy climbed,
 this is Karma Tenzing.</i>

00:09:09.247 --> 00:09:11.283
<i> He's 77-78-years old.</i>

00:09:11.283 --> 00:09:13.285
<i> He worked with
 Sir Edmund Hillary</i>

00:09:13.318 --> 00:09:15.087
<i> on expeditions in the 50s.</i>

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.389
<i> And then in the 60s and 70s
 he helped Hillary</i>

00:09:17.423 --> 00:09:20.425
<i> put together roads,
 bridges, schools,</i>

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:23.262
<i> a lot of the work projects
 that he did when he returned.</i>

00:09:23.696 --> 00:09:26.198
<i> And Hillary, who you can
 see in this picture here,</i>

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:29.835
<i> he was really a model for the
 Western-Sherpa interaction</i>

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:31.737
<i> for a kind of ideal
 form of that.</i>

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.406
<i> He returned and gave
 back to the community</i>

00:09:34.439 --> 00:09:36.942
<i> and he is still honored for
 his charitable contributions.</i>

00:09:36.975 --> 00:09:40.545
<i> This is at the anniversary of
the school he started in Thame.</i>

00:09:41.146 --> 00:09:43.315
After the climbing
season, I wanted to

00:09:43.348 --> 00:09:45.985
return with some of the climbers
I had met to their homes.

00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:49.455
<i> I followed Kalden Fura Sherpa
 back to his home</i>

00:09:49.488 --> 00:09:51.056
<i> the day he came
 back from Everest</i>

00:09:51.089 --> 00:09:53.259
<i> to see him reunite
 with his children</i>

00:09:53.292 --> 00:09:55.394
<i> at the tea-house he
 runs with his wife.</i>

00:09:55.427 --> 00:09:58.264
<i> You know this is a time
 for young fathers to</i>

00:09:58.297 --> 00:10:01.199
<i>reunite with their children that
 they've left for three months.</i>

00:10:01.833 --> 00:10:04.203
<i> But there are always
 the cases where</i>

00:10:04.236 --> 00:10:07.172
<i> the father, the husband, the
 brother does not come back.</i>

00:10:07.205 --> 00:10:10.308
<i> And that's a really hard
 part of the story to cover.</i>

00:10:10.342 --> 00:10:13.345
<i> This is Nima Doma Sherpa.
 She lost her husband Da Rita.</i>

00:10:13.378 --> 00:10:18.184
<i>He died of heart failure on, at
 Camp Three on Everest in 2012.</i>

00:10:18.217 --> 00:10:21.520
<i>And he leaves behind at the time
a two-year old a three-year old</i>

00:10:21.553 --> 00:10:23.522
<i> and considerable debt.</i>

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.591
<i> And this is a bunch of
 self-portraits from</i>

00:10:26.625 --> 00:10:28.460
<i> last year's
 Khumbu Climbing School</i>

00:10:28.493 --> 00:10:31.897
<i> at the Khumbu Climbing Center
that Conrad and his wife set up.</i>

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:33.466
<i> I really wanted
 people to be able</i>

00:10:33.499 --> 00:10:35.634
<i> to take pictures
 of themselves</i>

00:10:35.667 --> 00:10:37.068
<i> instead of always
 having it be me</i>

00:10:37.102 --> 00:10:39.472
<i> and my idea of what
 they looked like.</i>

00:10:39.705 --> 00:10:42.108
One of the great
benefits of all

00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:44.643
of this Western
influence and help

00:10:44.676 --> 00:10:46.945
is in new education
programs like this,

00:10:46.978 --> 00:10:48.513
like the
Khumbu Climbing School.

00:10:48.747 --> 00:10:51.349
<i>They teach basic safety skills.
 A lot of these young guys</i>

00:10:51.383 --> 00:10:54.019
<i>I'm talking about 16-year olds,
 17-year olds, 18-year olds</i>

00:10:54.052 --> 00:10:55.053
<i> going up to Everest.</i>

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.623
<i>They're jumping in the river of
 money and a lot of these guys</i>

00:10:57.656 --> 00:10:59.692
<i> they might be able
 to keep up and</i>

00:10:59.725 --> 00:11:00.925
<i> they might have
 the lung capacity</i>

00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:01.960
<i> and they might
 be strong</i>

00:11:02.227 --> 00:11:04.563
<i>but some of these guys actually
 don't know how to tie knots.</i>

00:11:04.596 --> 00:11:06.632
<i> And they don't know
 how to set up anchors.</i>

00:11:06.665 --> 00:11:09.334
<i> So people leave the school
 really competent and safe.</i>

00:11:09.367 --> 00:11:12.304
<i> They practice rescues and
 wilderness first-aid.</i>

00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:16.141
<i> All of this ultimately saves
 lives on the mountain.</i>

00:11:16.708 --> 00:11:18.843
<i> A lot of the children
 from these climbers,</i>

00:11:18.877 --> 00:11:19.979
<i> a lot of these
 families, they don't want</i>

00:11:19.979 --> 00:11:21.413
<i> their kids working
 on the mountain.</i>

00:11:21.713 --> 00:11:24.616
<i>And they end up saving all their
money to send them to Kathmandu</i>

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.119
<i> and they're gonna
 attend boarding schools.</i>

00:11:27.152 --> 00:11:29.855
<i> Like this one, Mount Kailash
 boarding school in Kathmandu</i>

00:11:29.888 --> 00:11:32.357
<i> where almost every
 student here is</i>

00:11:32.391 --> 00:11:34.226
<i> part of a Sherpa
 climbing family.</i>

00:11:34.259 --> 00:11:35.594
<i> And they live a lot of
 times away from</i>

00:11:35.628 --> 00:11:37.762
<i> family or with
 relatives in the city</i>

00:11:37.796 --> 00:11:39.164
<i> in hopes that
 education will bring</i>

00:11:39.197 --> 00:11:41.066
<i> them a different
 job than climbing.</i>

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.835
<i> This is Tashi Jangbu,
 he is 16-years old.</i>

00:11:43.869 --> 00:11:45.571
<i> He lives away from his family.</i>

00:11:45.838 --> 00:11:48.406
<i> His father has
 summited Everest 13 times,</i>

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.076
<i> and is saving money so that
 his kid can go to school.</i>

00:11:51.109 --> 00:11:54.279
And so that the family can
build a lodge or a tea-house

00:11:54.312 --> 00:11:56.982
and kind of move away from
this mountaineering industry.

00:11:57.016 --> 00:11:58.384
<i> While I was in
 Kathmandu I got to see</i>

00:11:58.417 --> 00:12:00.986
<i> a really different side
 of the Sherpa world.</i>

00:12:01.319 --> 00:12:02.488
<i> I got to go to
 some dance parties</i>

00:12:02.521 --> 00:12:03.989
<i> with some of my
 new friends.</i>

00:12:04.022 --> 00:12:06.057
<i> You know, their lives are
 really different than this</i>

00:12:06.091 --> 00:12:07.493
<i> kind of romantic village life.</i>

00:12:07.526 --> 00:12:09.161
<i> These guys are living
 just like my friends.</i>

00:12:09.194 --> 00:12:12.998
They live a big urban life,
they go out, they...

00:12:13.031 --> 00:12:15.033
some of these guys
really love climbing.

00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:17.503
They travel all over the world.
They're professionals.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.306
They're part of European
mountain guiding associations.

00:12:20.339 --> 00:12:21.840
So, you do have
both sides there.

00:12:22.674 --> 00:12:23.709
<i> One of the things
 I really wanted</i>

00:12:23.742 --> 00:12:26.011
<i> to do was to
 find a way to</i>

00:12:26.045 --> 00:12:29.048
<i> bring back how the
 Sherpas see themselves.</i>

00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:31.149
<i> This is Danuru and
 his mother Daki.</i>

00:12:31.182 --> 00:12:33.685
<i> Daki had eight sons, that all
 worked in the mountains.</i>

00:12:33.718 --> 00:12:35.353
<i> Five are still alive.</i>

00:12:35.387 --> 00:12:36.988
<i> Danuru is the youngest
 and lives with her</i>

00:12:37.022 --> 00:12:38.290
<i> and helps take care of her.</i>

00:12:38.323 --> 00:12:41.493
<i> You see this photo wall
 behind them, behind Danuru</i>

00:12:41.526 --> 00:12:43.428
<i> with his summit picture
 and his family.</i>

00:12:43.762 --> 00:12:46.065
<i> I found a way through
 these picture-walls</i>

00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:49.768
<i> I think to share how
 they see themselves.</i>

00:12:49.802 --> 00:12:52.404
<i> How they see their own
 families that they provide for</i>

00:12:52.437 --> 00:12:55.740
<i>with this work that they do. Why
 do they do this risky work?</i>

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.676
<i> To pay for this.
 To pay for their...</i>

00:12:58.009 --> 00:12:59.411
<i> family, for their future.</i>

00:12:59.444 --> 00:13:02.514
<i> And I wanted to also
 show, what do they do</i>

00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:03.949
<i> when the world isn't watching.</i>

00:13:03.982 --> 00:13:06.818
<i> When our photographers aren't
 hovering over their shoulders</i>

00:13:06.852 --> 00:13:09.154
<i> trying to get</i>
National Geographic<i> pictures.</i>

00:13:09.287 --> 00:13:12.291
<i> You know when they go climbing
 alone with their wife, right?</i>

00:13:12.324 --> 00:13:13.625
<i> These are photos I
 could never get.</i>

00:13:13.659 --> 00:13:15.794
<i> I love these...
 I love these found photos</i>

00:13:15.828 --> 00:13:17.028
<i> from their own collections.</i>

00:13:17.095 --> 00:13:20.098
<i> What photos they carry to the
 top of the mountain with them.</i>

00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:21.967
<i> What do they carry up there?</i>

00:13:22.568 --> 00:13:25.003
<i> And what photos do they
 return home with, right?</i>

00:13:25.037 --> 00:13:26.304
<i> To hang on their own walls.</i>

00:13:26.337 --> 00:13:28.707
<i> I love this one.</i>
( audience laughter )

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.210
<i> He brought his kid's
 stuffed gorilla up there.</i>

00:13:31.677 --> 00:13:33.611
<i> You know, so I collected
 these summit photos.</i>

00:13:33.645 --> 00:13:35.113
<i> I collected hundreds of these.</i>

00:13:35.414 --> 00:13:36.882
<i> These are the images
 of the Sherpa,</i>

00:13:36.915 --> 00:13:38.216
<i> like we're not used
 to seeing them.</i>

00:13:38.249 --> 00:13:41.252
<i> It's usually the Westerner
 we see in the victory pose</i>

00:13:41.453 --> 00:13:42.854
<i> and I think there's
 a lot to learn</i>

00:13:42.887 --> 00:13:44.389
<i> from how the Sherpas
 see themselves.</i>

00:13:44.422 --> 00:13:45.857
<i> And to me it's a reminder,</i>

00:13:45.891 --> 00:13:47.259
<i> you know, in this
 world full of stories</i>

00:13:47.292 --> 00:13:48.627
<i> about Western
 climbers and</i>

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:51.597
<i> victories and
 dramas, you know...</i>

00:13:51.697 --> 00:13:55.167
<i> that it's not all about us.</i>

00:13:55.234 --> 00:13:58.904
( applause )
