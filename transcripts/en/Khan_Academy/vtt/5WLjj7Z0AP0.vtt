00:00:00.384 --> 00:00:01.684
- [Voiceover] So I have
an expression here.

00:00:01.684 --> 00:00:05.251
Three times the entire
expression 5x plus six,

00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:08.784
and then plus the expression 7x plus two

00:00:08.784 --> 00:00:10.752
and all of that times four.

00:00:10.752 --> 00:00:12.317
And what I encourage you
to do is pause this video

00:00:12.317 --> 00:00:14.852
and see if you can
simplify this expression.

00:00:14.852 --> 00:00:15.584
And I'll give you a hint.

00:00:15.584 --> 00:00:17.518
You're gonna have to do some distribution

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:20.484
and then some combining of like terms.

00:00:20.484 --> 00:00:22.250
All right, now I'm assuming
you've had a go at it.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.951
Now let's work through this together.

00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:26.684
So as I mentioned, when
I see this three times

00:00:26.684 --> 00:00:28.517
the entire expression 5x plus six,

00:00:28.517 --> 00:00:30.517
I want to distribute that three.

00:00:30.517 --> 00:00:32.618
So I want to multiply that three times 5x

00:00:32.618 --> 00:00:35.018
and that three times the six.

00:00:35.018 --> 00:00:37.317
So three times 5x, well if I have five Xs

00:00:37.317 --> 00:00:40.067
and I have three times
that, I'm gonna have 15 Xs.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.101
And then three times six is 18.

00:00:45.218 --> 00:00:49.018
So this part of the expression
we have now simplified

00:00:49.018 --> 00:00:51.619
to 15x plus 18.

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:53.318
Now let's do the next part.

00:00:53.318 --> 00:00:56.985
So here I have this larger
expression written before

00:00:56.985 --> 00:00:59.085
this four but I wanna do the same thing.

00:00:59.085 --> 00:01:00.552
I just wanna distribute the four.

00:01:00.552 --> 00:01:02.618
It doesn't matter whether I'm multiplying,

00:01:02.618 --> 00:01:04.518
if I have the three or if I
have the number on the left side

00:01:04.518 --> 00:01:07.252
or the right side, so
let's distribute this four.

00:01:07.252 --> 00:01:11.594
I wanna do four times 7x and
I wanna do four times two.

00:01:11.594 --> 00:01:15.820
Four times 7x, well
that's going to be 28x,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.000
28x.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.651
And then four times two
is going to be eight.

00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:22.150
So we're almost there.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.150
This part of our expression has
simplified to 28x plus eight

00:01:27.151 --> 00:01:32.051
and now we can combine similar terms.

00:01:32.051 --> 00:01:35.351
So we have 15 Xs,

00:01:35.351 --> 00:01:37.770
and then we can add that to 28 Xs.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.484
Let me do this in a different color.

00:01:40.484 --> 00:01:44.350
If I have 15 of something
and I add 28 of something

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.184
of that same something to it,

00:01:46.184 --> 00:01:49.451
well then I'm gonna have what, 43 Xs.

00:01:49.451 --> 00:01:51.152
So 43 Xs.

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:54.618
15x plus 28 Xs, I added
the coefficients there,

00:01:54.618 --> 00:01:57.285
that's gonna be 43 Xs.

00:01:57.285 --> 00:01:59.668
And then 18 plus eight.

00:02:00.651 --> 00:02:02.585
Hey, let me do this in a new color.

00:02:02.585 --> 00:02:06.267
So 18 plus eight is going to be 26.

00:02:07.184 --> 00:02:07.785
And we're done.

00:02:07.785 --> 00:02:09.851
We've simplified this longer expression.

00:02:09.851 --> 00:02:12.186
We did some distribution then we combined

00:02:12.186 --> 00:02:16.401
some terms to get 43x plus 26.
