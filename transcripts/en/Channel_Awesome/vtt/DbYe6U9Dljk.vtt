[Channel Awesome Intro]

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.900
[Intro]

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.100
[Texting sound and Emojis] Fuck. This. Shit.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.100
The Emoji Movie is one of the most famously despised films in recent years.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.100
With a premise that's beyond desperate and gimmicky,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.100
a trailer with FAR MORE dislikes than likes,

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.600
and a Rotten Tomatoes score of EIGHT FRIGGIN PERCENT,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.000
This movie's hate levels have reached legendary status!

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.480
Now usually, I like whatever I review to have some sort of nostalgic tie-in

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.220
But with all the requests I've been getting to review this

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.260
I can't see the film not becoming a nostalgic landmark of heinousness

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.540
There's a lot to get to so let's get right to it

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.789
Insert your emoji icon brutally stabbing the emoji movie here does that emoji not exist yet?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.910
It will let's take a look at currently one of the most hated films ever the emoji movie

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.059
It starts off with the Columbia logo having its picture taken and given an emoji. I immediately hate all life

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.399
We're told how everybody is always on their phones, but seeing how this is a Sony movie with Sony products

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.291
They don't portray this as a bad thing. "That's our user, Alex." You can call him Riley

00:01:47.291 --> 00:01:49.380
It's not his name, but it's who he is

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.890
"Attention spans get shorter and shorter,"

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.640
"And you're probably not even listening to me right now who has the time to type out actual words"

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.959
I mean the writers clearly didn't type out actual words. I just assumed the entire script was this

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.279
You see the emojis are alive and live in a place called Textopolis

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.310
It's just a hint of how hard they're trying in this movie where we see our main character is named meh voiced by TJ Miller

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.990
Meh it turns out is super happy

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.040
But his job/personality assignment for life requires him to be unimpressed by anything

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.040
"We have business to attend to. What kind of business?"

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.760
"Monkey business"

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.709
I'll admit I got chuckle out of the emoticons being old and elderly, but don't worry

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.540
There's a whole bad movie of jokes to make up for it.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.640
"Is that the time? Hey my eyes are up here pal"

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.980
I'm sorry. I was looking at your boobs

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.300
Clock I don't even follow that

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.180
So he goes to talk to his father played by dammit Steven Wright why haven't you fired your agent yet?

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.060
No really that's how he's billed now

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.509
"I'm not letting you go to work today. What? You're just not ready son"

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.789
His dad said Meh isn't ready to go on the phone and be a meh face and in keeping with the film's theme

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:01.760
The moment is immediately followed by crap

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.760
"Should we wash our hands?"

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.120
[Laughter]  "We're number 2! We're number 2!"

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.840
That's Patrick Stewart playing Shit and his character's name is Poop

00:03:09.847 --> 00:03:10.949
"Just doing my duty"

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.719
Sweet Jesus Matt insists he's ready though and he visits the original emoji smiler played by dammit Maya Rudolph

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.389
Why haven't you also fired your agent? By the way if you're wondering?

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.869
No, that's not how she feels herself now, but it is a picture of this character hanging herself

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.369
She says you just wait for the user to pick you and then you get scanned into his

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.479
Conversation and that skin will get sent right up to Alex's tax buck. Yes naughty scammy twice last night

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.269
it was wonderful I

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.340
Kind of replied to Eddie's text

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.359
Right nothing nothing words aren't cool

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.009
That's like a film mocking a generations idiocy while also adding to that generations idiocy

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.519
Matt gets chosen though and panics giving a different face

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.209
What is that emoji just look around you it's called the audience's got to him reaction

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.929
Seeing how apparently this has never happened in history

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.910
I guess everything goes wrong and the scanner is destroyed in fact for a system and a

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.630
Civilization that doesn't need to exist they really should have more safety precautions

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.039
Effective phones have souls living in them does that mean that the machines

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.839
They use also have souls living in them do the gears inside that toaster also have little

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.189
Toasters inside the town called toe stop Alice is anyone who made this realizing

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.839
How stupid this all was yet, so they think mez a malfunction, which yeah?

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.350
Honestly sounds right as he talks to his friend poop, and we discover a whole new emotional realm that really evolves his character

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.409
Yeah, just getting to make sure jokes we all have accidents. You're so soft poop not too soft

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.640
I hope I did this role for my grandkids. Who are not getting Christmas presents this year

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.979
Smiler says the only thing to do is to delete them forcing antivirus BOTS to wipe them out

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.980
I

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.279
Know a lot of people compare this to inside out

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.150
But it doesn't help that smiler is

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:06.929
Literally joy except with different hair and complete lack of joy to quote John Lovitz from rat race. You should sue somebody

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:14.249
Man escapes though and comes across another unpopular emoji called high-five play by James Corden who thinks he's being hunted, too

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:20.579
He'll never find us down here welcome to the loser lounge where the emojis you never get used

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.729
Hangouts I guess that can be funny

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:30.539
But you're missing the really unpopular ones like pregnant wife drinking emoji Ghostbuster reboot emoji and breadstick emojis

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.079
dick sauce needs bread stick emojis

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.150
Just find the hacker and get reprogrammed

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.549
High-five tells them to find a hacker in the piracy app to get reprogrammed so that everything will go back to normal

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:47.400
But all I need is the hacker today's your lucky day. Let's roll the high-five also realizes

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.769
He can do that to become popular again kind of weird

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.479
He didn't originally think of that for himself

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.109
But they had to write this fast to start another Sony Cinematic Universe give him some credit

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.110
There was little toilet paper to write this on

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.479
They walk outside a text appleÃ­s and enter the wallpaper in the phone again could be a clever idea

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:09.389
But it just feels like more commercials for products and apps on Sony phones. We chats candy

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.150
It's especially tragic because that's a real good commentary on social media in this conversation

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.720
How does he know so many people none of these people know him?

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.350
But they like him yet, rather just have a real friend a real friend

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.999
How's that gonna get you anywhere what you need are fans, but again?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.989
It's kind of lost when you're in the film called the emoji movie

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.340
It's like slipping in fascism is bad and triumph of the will something's gonna get lost

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:43.348
They make it to the piracy app which is disguised as a dictionary app using a different skin

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.559
What could a teenage boy possibly want to hide from his parents?

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.370
What's this film rated again

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.460
It could have been worse job

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:08.250
Roaming through the drunken VeggieTales they come across a hacker named jailbreak played by dama Anna Faris why haven't you?

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.709
Oh god damn forget it and yes that is how she's built

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:18.150
Fanta favorite spots come in though and jailbreak agrees to help Matt after she sees he can make many different emoji faces they land in

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:25.560
Candy crush because shit. We're not enough like other Disney animated films. Are we the game obviously thinks you're candy. What do we do?

00:07:26.289 --> 00:07:31.559
Very still it's more likely the users mom downloaded it. So it probably won't be played for a while

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:37.859
After a mere 20-minute absence. We finally see not Riley again as he tries to hit on the girl

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:42.090
He likes but candy crunch keeps making sounds so he calls customer service to get the phone fixed

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:46.139
I'd like to make an appointment this phone is playing games with me, and yeah

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:52.049
That's all the insight we need on him for a while. It's amazing how much I know about this kid compared to inside out like

00:07:53.169 --> 00:07:54.729
the boy

00:07:54.729 --> 00:08:00.209
They finally get him out of candy crush, and they realize they have to get to the cloud to reprogram him after this

00:08:01.389 --> 00:08:07.499
Strong feminist statement, you know women are always coming up with stuff that men are taking credit for you know what?

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.590
Disgust

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:16.530
And as parents go looking for him while also being followed by the bots so they distract them in the YouTube app

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:24.299
What do you do No yeah be an average hour okay? These jokes are over five years old place your bets cat video or

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.420
Why even make another guess you know that's it?

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.580
Hey, what's this YouTube kids video with Elsa the Joker and spider-man oh?

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.900
That's gonna change the film's rating

00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:03.189
The bot spot our heroes trying to get to the cloud through Dropbox by going through the Just Dance app not entirely sure how that

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:06.400
path works on my phone either as it looks like they have to dance or

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:15.219
Death what does she mean by out digital death Just Dance got a lot darker in recent years, but jailbreak can't dance

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.220
So Matt shows her how oh?

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.820
He knows how to dance clearly this is a relationship material

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:35.740
Why does a hand have a butt why is that my biggest question, but more importantly why does a hand have a butt?

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:45.339
I do never call this Q&amp;A portion of the game the emoji

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.989
I'd rather do the Macarena with the Mario than the emoji pop

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.500
Well on fire

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:03.299
But jailbreak reveals. She's really a princess emoji the one said to have gotten off the phone although

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.480
She clearly didn't you're the princess emoji you

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:12.480
Never got off the phone now. We don't know that maybe she's just one of the minions playing dress-up everything else from this

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.870
Movie is stolen

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:19.530
Well, it's been about 12 minutes. Yes, we can check in on that Reilly again God. He plays such a big part

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:28.739
He deletes the dance app because it's making noise resulting in hi-5 getting trashed Mae wants to go save him leading to yeah

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:34.710
Good line. I'm just gonna leave him to get deleted. You gotta look out for number one well

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.379
What good is it to be number one? If there are any other numbers?

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:41.640
Don't try to be an actual movie now that boat sailed with a monkey business joke

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:48.299
So they go through Spotify where they sail along the sound waves and jailbreak discusses why she wants to get to the cloud

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:53.879
Did you realize it on the first emoji said a woman can either be a princess or a bride?

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:58.440
That's why I need to get to the cloud where you can be whoever you want to be

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:00.420
Okay, first

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:05.249
It looks like there's a lot of female emojis there so clearly has changed second didn't they say that

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:11.280
Smiler was the original emoji does she not count in those two choices third princess is really not a personality

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:17.100
This is very different from this, but whatever maybe she just doesn't like the idea of emojis

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:22.559
Whatever the reason is she wants to go to the cloud so they go into the trash to save high-five leaving all the other trash

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.029
Characters to die a slow and horrible death normally I'd be upset that with a movie, but honestly

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:29.339
I'm more frustrated with how many characters don't die

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.680
in a particularly odd scene

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:37.859
and that's saying a lot for this film mess parents look through not Riley's pictures with his folks and they have I guess a

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:44.130
Tender moment I say I guess because I honestly have no idea. This is supposed to be heartwarming or funny right now

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:48.299
I'm so overwhelmed with passionate feelings for you

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:59.069
Burns with the intensity of a red-hot flame we'll always have Paris marrying

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:05.909
So they make it to the drop box and ride their way to the fire wall they try different

00:12:06.129 --> 00:12:09.479
Passwords they think not Riley would have using meds different expressions

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:14.429
But they all fail we've tried all the important things in Alex's life his favorite pet

00:12:14.829 --> 00:12:20.998
Sport is a favorite grandma. If only this movie gave him a personality like finding out that he has a favorite grandma

00:12:20.999 --> 00:12:22.740
That's the most I know about him

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:28.139
But high five so an email in the trash to a girl he liked but never talks to and I guess it turns out

00:12:28.139 --> 00:12:30.009
That's the password I

00:12:30.009 --> 00:12:34.199
Guess that's romantic you having the password be a person you never talk to

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.179
If you're a stalker

00:12:37.179 --> 00:12:39.209
Hey, it's a creepy ass clock already

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:45.179
they make it to the cloud though and men miss he wants to stay with jailbreak she turns him down though because

00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:53.039
Movies, I like you just the way you are, but I had a plan. I'm not just some princess gene

00:12:53.559 --> 00:12:55.559
waiting for my prince

00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:01.349
Doll that old excuse if I have a plan and we suck at writing emotional conflict timeless tale

00:13:01.959 --> 00:13:08.159
Now leaves but gets captured by one of the bots and jailbreak decides to go back and save him. Let's go get him

00:13:08.199 --> 00:13:10.919
I suddenly want to write in all caps and hate everything

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:18.779
Mess brought back to be deleted, but his parents come in to speak up for him. I am the same malfunction gene does

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:26.580
And it doesn't affect my voice because you know I got a schtick

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.430
jailbreaking high-five crashing

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:33.780
But it looks like it's too late as the users deleting the phone to fix it however the girl

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.780
He likes is there, and it looks like

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:42.779
How do I even explain this they can always send an emoji to her and since mez the only one that can do a bunch?

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:43.630
of different emojis

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:51.059
It's decided he should go because you know sometimes a Sony phone and an emoji can get you the love of your life

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:58.500
Yep, that's what we're doing. That's that's what a super cool. Emoji a lot of feelings in one I got it I

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:05.999
Like that you're one of those guys who can actually express his feelings you know through the most unemotional laziest way possible

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:08.970
He pushed a button

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:10.600
Do that

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.689
he stops the phone from being deleted because

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:22.229
She found love and all of techstop, Alyssa's putback high-five is so emotional. He does even match his voice to his lip movements

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:31.770
So there was really a jackass who said we should ADR him more dialogue

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:38.459
They have a big dance party because I think it's law now every animated film should end with one and the emojis are used once

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:43.049
Again to replace all human emotion a fair analysis for this goddamn. Movie as a whole

00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:54.198
And that is one of the most hated films to come out of recent years and believe it or not I might have an unpopular

00:14:54.329 --> 00:14:56.329
opinion

00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:59.479
Oh I still hated it, but I think it's just run-of-the-mill bad

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.469
I've seen much much much much

00:15:03.779 --> 00:15:05.779
Much worse in all my years

00:15:05.819 --> 00:15:12.919
Reviewing this film does have a touch of creativity at least two inventive lines and enough of a visual eye to be colorful and somewhat

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:15.559
Imaginative, I've seen films that have none of those qualities

00:15:15.899 --> 00:15:21.529
But I'd be lying if I said I didn't understand why it has pissed people off so much the corporate

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.660
Advertising is not at all hidden

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:29.750
Which wouldn't be too bad if they could utilize it in a clever way like the lego movie did work it into the?

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:33.199
Storytelling like why couldn't we find out more about the kid through the phone?

00:15:33.199 --> 00:15:36.079
Maybe looking through his history of pictures and text

00:15:36.079 --> 00:15:41.809
we could see his flaws and maybe the flaw is time - the problems the emojis are going through but if we did that we

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.459
Wouldn't have our bullshit resolution

00:15:43.459 --> 00:15:48.709
We're a Sony product saves the day it is bad, and it's important to remember why it's bad

00:15:48.709 --> 00:15:53.509
So other films trying to do commercial tie-ins because let's be honest there's gonna be plenty of those in the future

00:15:53.639 --> 00:15:59.389
Can at least work it into their story better, so yeah? I can't even say it's one of the worst films

00:15:59.389 --> 00:16:03.829
I've ever seen take that for what it's worth. I guess as an advertising tie-in

00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:05.339
It is uniquely bad

00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:11.388
But as a bad movie among a sea of bad movies all I can give it is an honest and simple meh

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:17.690
I'm the nostalgia critic, and I deserve to be challenged by a more creatively bad movie

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.399
scooby-dooby-doo

00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:22.399
There's a third one?

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.949
Words are cool

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:14.020
Hey Doug Walker here doing the charity shout out in this week we are doing children incorporated

00:17:14.809 --> 00:17:16.809

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:22.959

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:36.099
education so that they may be healthy and have the opportunity to become contributing members of their communities
