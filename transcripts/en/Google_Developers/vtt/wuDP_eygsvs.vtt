JAMES GIANGOLA: Hi,
I'm James Giangola

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.330
from Google's
Conversation Design Team,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.690
and I'm here to show
you how to apply

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.450
the built-in hacks of
everyday conversation

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.690
to create cutting edge,
effortless, frictionless,

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.690
voice user interface
designs, or VUIs.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.180
Now, a hack is a good
thing, in the sense

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.527
of a creative, quick thinking,
agile, clever shortcut.

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:28.610
But I looked in the
dictionary, and the dictionary

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.430
says that hacks are
inelegant solutions.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.010
So just so you know,
because this is how I roll.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.630
I'm going to be
offering you a feast

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.020
of hack-like but
elegant solutions,

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.300
all courtesy of mother nature.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.359
That said, the title of
this talk could have been,

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:46.025
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:47.470
- Are you sitting down?

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.054
[END PLAYBACK]

00:00:48.054 --> 00:00:48.970
JAMES GIANGOLA: Great.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.960
You're all sitting down,
but think about it.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.290
In a conversation,
are you sitting down

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.070
is a mental hack, isn't it?

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.400
It's a shortcut.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.700
If you're on the phone and your
friend or whoever asks you,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.970
are you sitting
down, there not just

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.660
asking you how your body is
physically positioned in space.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.550
They're actually
telling you something.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.030
They're telling you, brace
yourself for some heavy news.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.310
You see, we have
this amazing ability,

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.740
and we take it for
granted all the time.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.240
We have this amazing
ability to look

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.030
beyond superficial
meanings and instead, we

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.130
seek out deeper,
hidden ones based

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.620
on the expectations of
how the world and how

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.240
our culture works.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.980
This ability is a
reflex of what's

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.230
called the
cooperative principle.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.060
So I'm going to talk
about our instinct

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.610
to behave cooperatively
in a conversation,

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.310
not just to behave
cooperatively ourselves,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.060
but also to expect the same
from others, including software,

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.080
including virtual assistants,
which is why you're here today.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.500
First, we'll explore the
co-operative principle

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.730
human to human.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.220
Then we'll turn to different
areas of conversation design,

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.860
where there are opportunities
to apply the principle in order

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.445
to create a superior
user experience.

00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:02.570
I'm going to show you how
to make your actions more

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.920
intuitive, more comfortable,
more relevant, and more

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.990
likeable for your users.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.540
And I'll show you how
mastery of this principle

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.430
will save you and
your designs from some

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.170
of the amateur
pitfalls that make

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.080
VUIs so frustrating to use.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.950
I'm going to show you a lot
of before and after examples,

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.040
redesigns, so that you
get the hang of it.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.560
So let's begin.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.930
What do you guys think of
the following exchanges,

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.810
and what do you infer about
the personality of the speakers

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.090
Leslie and Max, in particular.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.740
How likeable are these people?

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.686
Let's listen.

00:02:37.686 --> 00:02:38.475

00:02:38.475 --> 00:02:40.631
- Do you know who's
coming to the party?

00:02:40.631 --> 00:02:41.130
- Yes.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.010
Can you play a song for me?

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.106
- No.

00:02:51.106 --> 00:02:51.910
[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.520
JAMES GIANGOLA: So, what's
strange about these exchanges?

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.670
Grammatically, these
are yes/no questions.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.422
They're looking
for yes/no answers,

00:02:59.422 --> 00:03:00.880
but there's something
uncomfortable

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.000
about the literal yes/no
responses themselves.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.950
What is it?

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.870
Max and Leslie don't
sound cooperative.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.420
Why doesn't Max just go
ahead and tell Leslie who

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.160
all was attending the party?

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.330
What is the reason--

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.530
I want to know the reason--

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.310
why Leslie can't
indulge max with a tune?

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.080
Based on these brief
exchanges, would you

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.170
want these people to
represent your brand?

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.080
Would you endorse them
at all for employment?

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.840
Probably not.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.940
These examples show
that conversation

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.280
is more than just the literal
exchange of information.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.140
According to the
cooperative principle,

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.360
we humans naturally
assume and expect

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.430
there to be an
undercurrent of cooperation

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.770
between participants
or interlocutors

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.620
of a conversation.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.000
This applies to
the truth of what

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.030
we say, the amount of
information that we provide,

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.770
the relevance of
what we contribute,

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.450
and the way, in
good faith, we try

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.970
to communicate clearly, without
obscurity, without ambiguity.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.390
In the 1970s, the conversation
theorist Paul Grice,

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.760
stated each one of these
in the form of a rule,

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.680
known as Grice's Maxims.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.630
But for the sake of
simplicity, let's just

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.150
call it the
cooperative principle.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.800
It's a nice umbrella
term for our purposes.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.310
So today, I'd like to focus
on the Maxims of Quantity

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.209
and Manner.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.709
These are the two
that will give you

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.220
the biggest bang for the buck
in the limited time we've got.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.670
The Maxim of Quantity gives
us a principled understanding

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.460
of why Max and Leslie's
yes and no responses were

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.110
uncooperative.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.660
You see, according to
this rule of conversation,

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.060
a speaker provides
as much information

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.370
as is necessary to
advance the perceived

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.630
purpose of the conversation,
but not too much.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.910
And I'm going to show you lots
of examples of that as well.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.890
Since Max and Leslie's
answers didn't

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.890
provide enough information
to fulfill a purpose

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.290
or to meaningfully
move the topic forward,

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.360
they violated the
Maxim of Quantity.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.760
And that's what's wrong
with those conversations,

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.580
despite good grammar.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.080
You can find the
Maxim of Quantity

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.440
in the supermarket in
the condiment section.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.920
Doesn't the word tomato seem
uninformative or redundant

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.720
on the label tomato ketchup.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.170
After all, isn't all
ketchup made from tomatoes?

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.030
In fact, the phrase
tomato ketchup

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.680
was once very informative.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.620
Since the tomato was an
innovative substitution

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.630
for mollusks, in other
words oysters, mussels, etc.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.710
likewise, when people say
lady doctor or male nurse

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.080
or white trash,
they're informatively

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.410
revealing their prejudice
that doctors are--

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.720
irony quotes--
supposed to be male.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.700
Nurses are supposed
to be female,

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.400
and trash is not supposed
to be white, an insidious

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.630
racial slur.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:45.410
Not funny.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.530
This is an insidious racial
slur that most people don't even

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:49.460
realize.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.480
So what's going on here?

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.950
People obey the
Maxim of Quantity,

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.700
and they tell you what
they think you need

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.940
to know for better or worse.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.960
And so often, this happens
automatically, unconsciously.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.610
This next example's really key.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.690
Pay attention.

- Have you been to the Eagle?

[END PLAYBACK]

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.060
The answer is a
question, but Alex

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.980
must be cooperating with Sammy.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.100
This can't be a
non sequitur right?

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.670
Assuming the
co-operative principle,

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.850
we can actually
make five inferences

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.160
from the answer,
which is a question,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.710
have you been to the Eagle?

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.180
One, the Eagle serves drinks.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.730
Two, the drinks are
probably alcoholic.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.070
Let's hope so.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.000
Three, the Eagle's
open for business.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.260
It's operational.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.760
Four, the Eagle is nearby.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.930
It's in driving distance.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.310
It's not in Fresno
or Nova Scotia.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:49.720
And the Eagle is a place that
Sammy would probably like.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.060
Think of how important the
cooperative principle must've

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.036
been in terms of the evolution
of the human species.

00:06:55.036 --> 00:06:56.410
We wouldn't get
much accomplished

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.760
if we had to spell
everything out,

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.730
unpacking each
and every thought,

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.410
as if we had to
explain how things

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:07.990
work to aliens unfamiliar
with our terrestrial ways.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.180
What Alex just did there
on that last slide,

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.050
is an example of
conversational implicature.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.820
That is, the speaker
has just said

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.670
something that leads the
listener to make an inference.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.830
In this case, five of them.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.740
Speakers make implicatures,
and listeners make inferences

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.950
all the time.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.650
And these shortcuts
are the fallout

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.600
of the cooperative
principle acting

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.810
on a library of shared
world knowledge, knowledge

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:33.710
that we share with
our interlocutor.

00:07:36.855 --> 00:07:39.480
In the next example, we can make
an inference that you probably

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.010
take for granted.

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:45.750
So the sentence is, last night,
I saw Chris at a restaurant

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.250
with a woman.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.310
Obviously, the woman was
not her friend Chris's wife,

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.010
even though biologically,
his wife is a woman.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:54.690
How do we know
it's not his wife?

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.210
Well, if she were
his or her wife,

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.790
the speaker would have said so
in the interest of providing

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.560
a satisfactory
amount of information

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.265
to move the conversation
forward, the Maxim of Quantity.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.278
JAMES GIANGOLA: Notice how
the superficial invitation

00:08:13.278 --> 00:08:16.590
to go make a sandwich actually
indicates an amount of time

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.750
that the listener is
probably not happy with.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:22.740
What if the listener has
said, I'm putting my shoes on?

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:27.600
Right, the listener would
have been a lot happier.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.100
The next example's
already familiar,

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.230
but let's add some more context.

[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:35.400
- Hey, what did that

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.203

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.656
JAMES GIANGOLA: And
here's a speaker who

00:08:39.656 --> 00:08:42.459
appears to be uncooperative, but
she's actually being very nice.

00:08:43.246 --> 00:08:45.120

from Dunder Mifflin?

00:08:48.165 --> 00:08:52.626
- Well, he was on time, and he
was wearing a beautiful tie.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.680
JAMES GIANGOLA: We could be
confident that the speaker

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.660
cannot recommend this
candidate for employment.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.580
The primary piece of
shared world knowledge

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.470
that makes this
implicature possible

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.224
is our familiarity
with the saying,

00:09:03.224 --> 00:09:04.890
if you haven't got
something nice to say

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.730
about someone, right?

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.130
Let's compare two answers
to the same question.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.090

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.730
JAMES GIANGOLA: I'm
glad you laughed.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.340
Why is one OK and not the other?

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.440
Neither one answered
the question.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.720
Why is one good
and the other bad?

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.300
It's because the first one
has a basis in shared world

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.000
knowledge, which is, it's
not cool to ask people

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.310
how much their stuff costs.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:47.110
The implicature here
is I won't tell you

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:48.700
how much my stuff
costs, but here's

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:52.630
where you can go and
find out yourself.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:55.600
Now, let's see how we can
apply the cooperative principle

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.620
and conversation
implicature to VUI design.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.810
Here's an example of a
conversation implicature

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.320
from the Google Home
Timer Application.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.260
A timer is going off, and
the user says thank you.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.480
What should happen next?

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.390
The system should infer that
this an expression of gratitude

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.190
is only superficial.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.620
Drawing on her store of
shared world knowledge,

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.620
the assistant should
understand the hack-like nature

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.510
of thank you in this context.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:25.790
By implicature, the user
is really saying, OK,

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:26.830
you can turn it off.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:30.160
That will be all.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.240
Besides drawing inferences,
a good assistant

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.420
should also observe
the Maxim of Quantity.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:35.680
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.100
- Show me pictures of the
state flower of California.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.830
- The state flower of
California, here you go.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.086
By the way, it's called
the California Poppy.

00:10:44.086 --> 00:10:44.760
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.176
JAMES GIANGOLA:
Here the assistant

00:10:46.176 --> 00:10:49.420
infers that the user does not
know the name of the flower,

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.820
otherwise, they
would have used it.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.490
So she provides that
extra info, the quantity,

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:58.990
to fill in the likely gap
in the user's knowledge.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.600
In this next example,
the user needs a ride,

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.990
so they ask their assistant
to speak to Droover.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.620
Droover answers, and
here's what happens next.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.460

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:09.960

JAMES GIANGOLA: And the
interaction just comes

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:24.120
to a halt. Cooperative?

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.810
Is that cooperative?

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.510
Here's one possible redesign
of that application that

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.150
would advance the user's
intent cooperatively and

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.870
informatively.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:34.691

The nearest car is
20 minutes away.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.480
Does that work for you?

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.610
- No.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.770
- I can check again in
two or three minutes.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.590
Are you still interested?

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:46.386
- All right.

more cooperative,

00:11:48.905 --> 00:11:50.310
more likable doesn't it?

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.710
I think so.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.880
Now, this next example is a
VUI adaption of a real GUI.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.200
The interaction isn't
conversational either.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.210
Again, it just dead ends, comes
to an abrupt halt at the end.

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:06.900
The context here is a power
user knows that the delivery

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.014

- For this hour,
the delivery charge

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:19.290
has temporarily changed to
$7.99 due to the high volume

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.450
of orders received at
Tasty Noodle House.

We can improve on this.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.550
How can we make this app's
persona more appealing,

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.250
more socially intelligent?

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.718

- Just so you know, between
8:00 and 9:00 tonight,

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.440
the delivery charge for this
particular restaurant is $7.99.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.990
Do you want to go ahead
and place your order?

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:52.337
- No.

00:12:52.337 --> 00:12:54.170
- In that case, there
are some other options

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:55.910
in that area that
are pretty similar.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:57.121
Are you interested?

00:12:57.121 --> 00:12:57.620
- Sure.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.070
Why not.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.280
JAMES GIANGOLA: So
we've seen examples

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.560
of informative assistance.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.950
Now, let's turn to our users
who can't resist the instinct

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:19.610
to cooperate, to meaningfully
advance the conversation as

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:23.135
if they were interacting
with another human.

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:24.440
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.570
- And how many people are going?

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:27.877
- It's my wife and myself.

00:13:27.877 --> 00:13:28.460
[END PLAYBACK]

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.710
JAMES GIANGOLA: Unfortunately,
cooperative informative

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:33.440
contributions like my wife
and myself will likely

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.840
be rejected by the
recognizer, which is often

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.960
built to expect superficial,
literal responses

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.760
like the number two.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.980
So that so-called error
that you just heard

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:47.360
is actually an example
of verbal cooperation.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.420
If the recognition grammar can't
handle cooperative responses,

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.840
then use the rapid re-prompt
strategy in the first level,

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.190
no match prompt.

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:57.660
For instance, sorry,
how many was that?

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.990
Compare a nice conversational
prompt like sorry,

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:05.040
how many was that?

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.430
With typical VUI speak, which
should be something like, I'm

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.440
sorry, I didn't catch that.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.020
Please speak to the number
of people in your party.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.270
You can say, for example, two.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.150
Everyone seems to prefer the
conversational version, which

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.580
happens to debunk the
myth that conversational

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.330
means long winded and verbose.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.760
In this next example, the
VUI offers the possibility

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.640
of paying right now with
either Visa or MasterCard,

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.280
but notice the way the
user's prompted to respond.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.130
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:33.630
- Great.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.930
You can make a payment right
now with Visa or MasterCard.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.840
So would you like to pay now?

[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.750
JAMES GIANGOLA: The VUI seems
to be offering an either

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:46.300
or choice, but then serves
the user a yes/no question.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:50.340
So the persona's
intent feels ambiguous.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.260
The recognition
grammar was designed

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.030
to accept only yes,
no, and synonyms.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:58.230
So cooperative users who
said things like, yes, visa

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.970
were served an error prompt.

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.340
You see, if you know about
the cooperative principle,

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:05.430
you don't need to find out
about the stuff after the fact.

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:08.970
You can spare yourselves time
consuming and expensive user

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.790
research or the damage
control of having

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:14.610
to make major tuning changes
to your recognition grammar

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:16.890

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:18.930
On the next slide,
we have no input

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:34.240
said anything at all.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.300
So put on the defensive,
a cooperative user

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.497
would be justified
in explaining,

00:15:38.497 --> 00:15:40.830
you didn't hear anything,
because I didn't say anything.

00:15:43.446 --> 00:15:45.570
It's likely that a user
hasn't spoken, because they

00:15:47.186 --> 00:15:48.310
Maybe they were distracted.

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.250
They weren't paying attention.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.730
Here are a couple of
more socially appropriate

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:53.867

Just paraphrase it and ask as
if they never heard the question

you could do it.

JAMES GIANGOLA: In VUI design,
this re-prompting strategy

00:16:12.334 --> 00:16:15.900
is called escalating detail,
but the more general design term

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.120
in other areas of
design outside of VUI

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.150
is progressive disclosure.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:21.960
Think about it.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.429
If I ask you a question,
and you don't answer.

00:16:25.429 --> 00:16:26.970
And then I come back
with you and say

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:31.470
I didn't hear anything,
that is so freaking rude.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.170
That's bad parenting.

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:33.920
You can't do that.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:34.419
Stop it.

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:42.000
But we've been doing that
for 20 years or more.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.040
Yes, we have to stop.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.150
Dis-confirmations are
when a user answers

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.310
no to a confirmation prompt.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.830
Dis-confirmations are a
particularly gnarly problem

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:53.290
in VUI design, and we can
understand the challenge

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:56.020
in terms of the cooperative
principle in particular,

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.830
the Maxim of Quantity.

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.919
So here's an example of
a confirmation prompt.

00:16:59.919 --> 00:17:00.460
Let's listen.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:11.680
JAMES GIANGOLA: Now, when
the information is correct,

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.060
users say yes or some synonym.

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:14.829
Everybody's happy.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:21.450
But when it's wrong, that's
the dis-confirmation.

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:23.270
Users elaborate.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:26.630
And those cooperative details
generally elude the recognizer

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:27.869
as we can see on the right.

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.560
Obviously, it's not practical to
put each and every one of these

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.890
in your recognition grammar.

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:38.420
You're going to dilute
the recognition accuracy.

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.300
As Tolstoy said in his
novel Anna Karenina,

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.580
happy families are all alike.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:48.880
Every unhappy family is unhappy,
each in its own way, right?

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.000
That's what's going on here.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.160

possible re-prompts.

JAMES GIANGOLA:
Usability studies

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:01.250
have shown, time and time
again, that people just

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:04.970
need a brief second chance to
recover from a misrecognition

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:06.710
error.

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:09.260
This conversation approach
stands in sharp contrast

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.090
to industry cliches
like this one.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:16.910
JAMES GIANGOLA: When
I hear this prompt,

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:18.770
I don't imagine a friendly face.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:20.600
I see a flowchart.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:25.310
I see arrows springing from
boxes, going from box to box.

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:28.300
This style is inconsistent
with the assistant metaphor,

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.960
and so it undermines
the integrity

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:37.010
of the design of the
assistant user experience.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:40.430
Unfortunately, VUI users have
had so many bad experiences

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:42.230
with speech
recognition technology

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.450
and with amateur VUI
designs, that they've

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:47.720
been trained over the years
to say as little as possible.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.090
They'll also take prompts
at their literal superficial

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:53.210
reading, and they will not
provide additional information

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:56.570
that would be considered
naturally cooperative.

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.490
They're wary that this might
trigger a misrecognition error,

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:00.650
and that's understandable.

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.050
Our design should
accommodate for these cases

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:07.810
as well, for these
users as well.

- Great.

JAMES GIANGOLA:
Notice I didn't serve

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.420
an error prompt at that point.

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.220
I could've, but I didn't.

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.370
Like when a little kid
falls in summer camp, right?

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:33.810
You just pick the kid up, brush
him off, say shiny over there,

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:34.310

Don't make a big deal out of it.

Just move along smartly.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.990
So here, user A is more
cautious with speech technology

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.000
or simply prefers a
step by step approach

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.370
as a matter of preference.

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:47.510
Maybe it's something to
do with their personality.

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:50.385
Then there's user B, who
moves the conversation forward

00:19:50.385 --> 00:19:52.760
with the address right away,
as you can see on the right.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.640
They just give the address.

JAMES GIANGOLA: There's too
much going on in one step

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:22.920
for everyday users.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.110
There's too much going on.

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:28.130
Presumably, this design is to
satisfy the programming metrics

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:29.840
of economy and efficiency.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.910
The design is neat.

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.280
It's just a single
dialogue state,

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.130
a single turn with a
single piece of information

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:39.800
to collect.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.440
But what if I don't
have the address?

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:47.450
I have to wait through a
timeout to hear the next prompt.

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:52.916
First, we can't possibly know
what a user's timing out means.

00:20:52.916 --> 00:20:55.040
They could be timing out
for any number of reasons.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:59.870
We can't ascribe an [? NLP ?]
interpretation to a time out.

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:01.130
We don't know what it means.

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:03.710
Also, make making
people wait in silence

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:05.630
is disrespectful of their time.

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:06.710
It's abusive.

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:10.400
That's why I hate using
VUIs for customer service,

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.410
because I don't like
to time out, like wait

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:13.790
through these timeouts.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:15.740
My time is really valuable.

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.640
So this is a design strategy of
having people time out in order

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.890
to signal some
meaningful response is

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:24.230
antithetical to
what conversation

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.030
and cooperation are all about.

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:28.100
The bottom line is that
this type of design

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:32.000
is alien to the true and natural
way to manage information flow

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.910
and turn taking.

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:34.910
And this is the product
of hundreds of thousands

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:36.350
of years of evolution.

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:38.180
This design just doesn't cut it.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:42.050
If you thinking that this
slide is a cheap trick,

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:44.420
a straw man, think again.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.520
Design solutions
paralleling this one,

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.550
frequently arise when economical
and efficient appearing

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:51.290
flowcharts are
developed and deployed

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:55.640
as VUIs with little regard to
conversational expectations.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.430
So start designing
your conversational app

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:03.910
with best pass sample dialogues
and then flowchart that.

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.410
The goal is to create a
superior conversational user

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:09.830
experience, not a flowchart
that's meant to impress.

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:12.650
Users don't care what
your flowchart looks like.

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:14.780
Give people their turn.

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:18.130
That's conversational.

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:19.930
So making users wait
through a timeout

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.930
is one of my pet peeves
as a VUI designer.

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:26.020
The next few slides feature
yet another annoying feature

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:29.750

peeve, another bete noire,

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.270
another bugaboo.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:34.540
I'm talking about applications
that teach users what to say,

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.930
as if the VUI were a
touch tone application,

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:39.500

[END PLAYBACK]

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.895
JAMES GIANGOLA: I think it's
safe to assume we all prefer

00:23:58.895 --> 00:24:01.980
VUI number two, right? : The
implicature in VUI number one

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:06.930
is that I don't know how to
use English to get to the next

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:09.840
message or to get
someone to repeat.

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.110
Why do I say that?

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:15.270
The persona wouldn't be giving
me the instructions otherwise.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:17.520
It's like, last night I
saw Chris at a restaurant

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.490
with a woman or tomato ketchup.

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:21.240
The person's telling
me that, because they

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.250
think it's informative to me.

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:28.980
So assuming cooperation,
to repeat the message,

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.290
say repeat, is supposed
to be informative.

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:33.600
The subtext is
proceed with caution.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.790
This interface is not intuitive.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:38.460
Your existing mental
model of how English works

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.350
will get you into trouble here.

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:44.160
Follow my instructions, or else.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.250
Basically, the user experience
is a linguistic straitjacket.

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:52.800
So avoid teaching
commands in a VUI.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.680
If you have to explain a
command, something's wrong.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.300
Go back to the drawing board.

00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.850
This ain't touch tone.

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:02.340
The whole point of
offering the public a VUI

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:04.560
is that speech is intuitive.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.450
Speech doesn't need to be
taught, a la press three

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:10.830
to do that, or press
the star key to do that.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:13.530
This is cognitive load
that's inherent to touch tone

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:17.610
applications, because no
one was born knowing what

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:19.380
pressing one or two would do.

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.570
But in the VUI
universe, that inherit

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:23.250
burden is now superfluous.

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:26.340
It's unjustified.

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.070
Changing gears a bit.

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:30.450
We've seen in the previous
examples that saying too much

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:33.960
is a violation of the
Maxim of Quantity.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.240
Too much information
implies irrelevance.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.610
And VUIs are despised
around the world,

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:40.920
because their designers
seem to have forgotten

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.200
that VUI users are not reading.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.120
They're listening,
and there's no way

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.424
to fast forward in a VUI.

00:25:47.424 --> 00:25:49.590
Think about your own
experiences in customer service

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:53.550
applications-- calling
the bank, the airline,

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:55.980
your cell phone provider.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:57.720
There's no way to
fast forward in a VUI.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.930
There's no way to skip ahead of
irrelevant messages, irrelevant

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:04.170
options, irrelevant
menus, intrusive up-sells,

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:05.940
legal disclaimers.

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:09.410
We VUI users are at the
mercy of the auditory signal.

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:13.110
We're held captive to the
linearity of the speech signal.

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:14.940
So many VUI designers
have forgotten

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:18.525
that VUI use is inextricably
linked to the passage of time.

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:24.490
But irrelevance,
which is practically

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:27.010
a defining characteristic
of VUI use,

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:30.140
is not inherent
to the technology.

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:31.135
It's just bad design.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.620
Now, we're at the forefront
of an exciting new wave

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:37.680
of VUI design--

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.700
smart phones, personal
assistants, talking robots.

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.010
And we use these
devices voluntarily.

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:44.810
We pay lots of money for them.

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.090
Now, compare this with the
first wave of VUI design,

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:49.070
which was all about
customer service.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:50.960
Customer service
isn't voluntary,

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.510
so we consumers have been a
captive audience, so to speak.

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:55.910
We've been at their mercy.

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:59.300
So I want to now look back
into the history of VUI design,

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.630
and I want to look at what's
been so frustrating about VUI

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:06.544
use, particularly with
[INAUDIBLE] relevance.

00:27:06.544 --> 00:27:08.960
I want to look at what's been
so frustrating about VUI use

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.080
historically, and let's try
to analyze our frustration

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.110
in terms of the
cooperative principle.

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:16.460
And hopefully, we won't
repeat those mistakes,

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:19.220
because nowadays,
we cannot afford to.

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.460
The audience is no longer
captive in the new wave

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.740
of VUI design.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.320
From a technical
perspective, what exactly

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:31.970
is uncooperative about, please
listen carefully, as our menu

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:33.820
options have recently changed?

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:38.420
It's a message you hear all
the time in customer service.

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:41.794
It's irrelevant to pretty much
everyone who listens to it.

00:27:41.794 --> 00:27:43.460
And of course, it
would be absurd to try

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:45.560
to fix it with the truth.

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.690
The message would read
something like this.

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:50.690
Please listen carefully one,
if you've called before,

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:53.330
two, if the menu options
have changed since then,

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:55.190
and three, if you
happen to remember

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:57.167
what those options were.

00:27:57.167 --> 00:27:59.000
The translation is,
please listen carefully,

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.870
because this interface
is not at all intuitive.

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:05.420
Am I wrong?

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:08.630
By the way, it's not
conversational to introduce

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:10.940
a reason with the
conjunction as.

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:12.590
That's for literature.

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:15.690
This feels like a letter
written by a bureaucrat.

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:19.580
This is not a likeable person.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.670
In contrast, a good
conversational participant

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:25.010
keeps track of the conversation.

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:26.450
I'm going to repeat that.

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:27.890
A good conversational
participant

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:29.780
keeps track of the conversation.

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:33.080
They have an operational memory
of previous contributions,

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.030
and therefore, a
contextual awareness

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:36.440
of their interlocutor.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.750
And this is what's wrong
with, please listen carefully

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:41.060
as our menu options
have recently changed.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:45.530

unaware of your context.

never bodes well

JAMES GIANGOLA: The
verbosity of this prompt

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.690
is presumably to help users
from getting into trouble

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.270
with the recognizer, but
none of this preoccupation

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:41.010
is necessary, at least not yet.

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:44.500
And it sounds like we're
in for a rough ride.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:45.940

here for users

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.410
Well, pretty much everything.

- Hello.

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:55.180
This is Sundance County's
automated service

for recording power outages.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:01.692

calling about gas or electric?

00:32:03.457 --> 00:32:05.790
JAMES GIANGOLA: I used to
hear this voicemail recording,

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:08.640
pretty much every day, at a
company I used to work for.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.940
The message was, the
following three new messages

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:14.220
have not been heard.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.190
I used to choke on that
have not been heard part.

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:18.840
If a message is
new, doesn't that

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.940
mean that I haven't
heard it yet.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:26.040
It's a little bit like hearing
this zebra has stripes.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:27.330
Don't all zebras have stripes?

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:31.830
For me, a new message,
by definition,

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:33.840
is a message I haven't
heard in the same way

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.640
that zebras have stripes.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.110
But in this system,
a new message

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:39.480
is one, a message that
has not been heard yet,

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:43.050
or two, a message that has been
heard but not to completion,

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:45.100
or three, it has been
heard to completion,

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.100
but you haven't archived it yet.

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.710
Seems like a bit much for
everyday people to grok.

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:51.720
I bet they have other
things on their minds.

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:58.560
My colleague Margaret Urban
coined the term tech-splaining.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.810
It means giving overly
technical information

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:03.270
that's lost on
everyday users like,

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:06.990
the following three messages
have not been heard.

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:08.730
So here's a message
from a pretty popular

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:11.130
voice-only assistant.

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:12.870
She says, I'm sorry.

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:15.650
I didn't understand
the question I heard.

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:17.550
For an every day user,
it would be enough

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:20.040
for her to simply say that
she didn't understand.

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:22.927
She could even say she didn't
understand the question.

00:33:22.927 --> 00:33:25.260
Why does she say that she
didn't understand the question

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.490
she heard.

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:27.430
She can't read.

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:29.390
It's only voice.

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:34.140
Well, the message
can be paraphrased,

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.550
you asked a question.

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:38.160
I might have misrecognized
what you asked.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:41.490
Be that as it may, I tried to
make sense out of what I heard,

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:44.490
which might not have been
what you actually said.

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:50.250
But I couldn't figure out what
that meant either, so sorry.

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:55.730
For everyday users, this
technical nuance thinking,

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:58.470
the distinction between
automatic speech recognition

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:01.200
and natural language processing.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.217
This nuance thinking that
underlines the message is lost.

00:34:04.217 --> 00:34:06.300
And the persona just ends
up sounding a little bit

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.860
weird and otherworldly.

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:12.010
So in these last
few examples, we've

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:14.110
seen how an excess
of quantities can

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:16.900
lead to some obscure
expressions, which brings us

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:20.980
to Grice's Maxim of Manner,
which is in a conversation,

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:23.110
speakers avoid
obscurity of expression,

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:25.900
and they avoid ambiguity.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.420
So speaking of
obscuring ambiguity,

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:31.780
I want to look at two UIs
whose technical use of language

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:33.760
doesn't seem
linguistically cooperative.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.949
I'm talking about how
technologists understand

00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:38.210
the prepositions near and in.

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:42.969
On TripAdvisor, we see that
near is used as a synonym of in.

00:34:42.969 --> 00:34:44.320
But I'm a conference goer.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.719
I'm looking for hotels
in Washington D.C.,

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:49.989
not near Washington D.C. I don't
want to stay near Washington.

00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:51.790
I want to stay in Washington.

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:55.120
For everyday folks, these
words are not interchangeable,

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.940
but this novel use of near seems
to reflect the technologist's

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:01.550
concern for a geographical
radius, a range of distance.

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:03.790
This unfamiliar,
unclear use of language

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:05.410
causes cognitive friction.

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:07.390
Now, hold that thought.

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:09.020
If I'm in Mountain
View, California,

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.930
and I ask the Google
Assistant for movies nearby,

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:15.180
she tells me, here's some
movies near Mountain View.

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:16.870
Well, near me and
near Mountain View

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:20.105
are two different things,
because I'm in Mountain View.

00:35:20.105 --> 00:35:22.480
So she tells me, here are some
movies near Mountain View,

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:25.510
but the movies she shows
me are in Mountain View.

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:28.300
So there's a couple of
levels of mismatch here.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:30.370
This might make
sense to an engineer,

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:33.890
but to an everyday user,
it feels like a bug.

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:35.770
So this is something
I'd like to see changed.

00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:39.640
And the solution is to just
change near to around--

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:41.729
movies around Mountain View.

00:35:41.729 --> 00:35:43.270
Around Mountain View
is pretty loose.

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:44.920
We understand it
means in the vicinity

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:48.100
of in rough, informal
conversational terms.

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:50.500
So instead of redefining
words for users,

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.930
what about leveraging
conversational language?

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:55.480
Conversational language
is itself a metaphor.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.824
And what is a metaphor?

00:35:56.824 --> 00:35:58.240
It's something
familiar that helps

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.060
us understand the unfamiliar.

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:05.130
Familiar language is itself
a gesture of cooperation.

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:06.880
I'm going to give you
some quick examples,

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:07.720
and then I'm going to wrap up.

JAMES GIANGOLA: So to sum
up, the cooperative principle

00:37:02.761 --> 00:37:04.160
is at the gut of conversation.

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:07.630
It perverts-- perverts--
sorry about that.

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:09.070
Easy for me to say.

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:10.689
It pervades every
turn-- and I did

00:37:10.689 --> 00:37:11.980
that every time I rehearsed it.

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:13.570
I made that same mistake.

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:15.580
It pervades every
turn in a dialog.

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:17.120
It's not an optional feature.

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:18.820
There's no override.

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:20.890
So imagine two types
of talking primate.

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:23.140
One group communicates with
the cooperative principle,

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:24.310
and the other one doesn't.

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:27.160
Which group do you think has
the evolutionary advantage?

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:30.460
Also, ask yourselves
why is legal language so

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:33.430
hard to understand, so
dense and so frustrating?

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:36.229
Because the language of the law
leaves nothing to inference.

00:37:36.229 --> 00:37:38.020
The language of the
law assumes that you're

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:39.394
going to act out
of self-interest

00:37:39.394 --> 00:37:42.010
and take advantage of
any potential loopholes.

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:44.860
So it's a [? spans ?] assumption
of the cooperative principle.

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.500
The difficulties that you and
I have with legal language

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.450
are evidence of the
practical necessity

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:51.580
for the evolution of the
cooperative principle

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:52.696
in human cognition.

00:37:52.696 --> 00:37:54.070
And this, in my
opinion, has been

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:56.710
critical to the development
of human civilization.

00:38:00.847 --> 00:38:02.680
So the main takeaways
from this presentation

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.810
is that people are
naturally cooperative.

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:07.120
We expect cooperation
too, and this principle

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.040
prevails over literal
interpretations

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:10.884
and the rules of logic.

00:38:10.884 --> 00:38:12.550
I've shown you the
perils of irrelevance

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:13.720
in conversation design.

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.410
It disrespects user's time.

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:18.190
It challenges their patience,
and it reinforces frustrations

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:19.720
with VUIs in general.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.570
But good VUI design optimizes
for immediate relevance.

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:24.970
So sharpen the user's focus
and direct their attention

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:27.370
by reducing auditory clutter.

00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:31.520
Respect the limits
of short term memory.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.180
The advantage of offering a
VUI is that everyone already

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:37.510
knows how to speak, so leverage
the inherent intuitiveness

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:38.230
of VUI.

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:42.060
You don't need to teach
touch-tone style commands.

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:43.510
Three, recognition
grammar should

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:45.250
be constructed, as
much as possible,

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:47.650
to anticipate
verbal cooperation.

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:50.230
And let's please be more humble
about what the industry calls

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:52.000
recognition errors.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.819
This adjustment in
attitude is sure to have

00:38:53.819 --> 00:38:55.360
an effect on the
tone of the messages

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:58.930
we write in response
to so-called misrecs.

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:04.360
Four, personalization means more
than saying welcome back, Pat.

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.190
Truly satisfying
personalization should

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:08.350
begin with at least being
informative and relevant

00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:11.120
from the user's point of view.

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:15.019
So we haven't had much time
today for a topic this big.

00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:16.810
Once we start delving
into the complexities

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:19.750
of conversational design, you'll
see how vast this field really

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:20.417
is.

00:39:20.417 --> 00:39:22.000
But if you found
this talk worthwhile,

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.800
we've got some great
white papers online

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:28.450
at g.co/dev/ActionsDesign,
written by myself and other

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:30.639
people on our design team.

00:39:30.639 --> 00:39:31.930
There's quick reference guides.

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:32.721
There's checklists.

00:39:32.721 --> 00:39:34.360
There's videos for
however much time

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.130
you have-- one minute,
three minutes, an hour.

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:40.060
A lot of great resources
there on that site.

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:44.940
I believe we are out of time.

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:48.170
Getting the signal from Monica,
saying yes, we're out of time.

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:49.900
Thank you, Monica.

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:52.360
I'll be in the sandbox outside
if you guys want to talk.

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:52.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:56.060
Thank you.

00:39:56.060 --> 00:40:00.110
