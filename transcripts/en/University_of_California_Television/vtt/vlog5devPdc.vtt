(uptempo techno music)

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.510
- Welcome to a Conversation With History.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.648
I'm Harry Kreisler of

00:00:30.648 --> 00:00:32.694
the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:32.694 --> 00:00:35.020
Our guest today is John Yoo,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.820
who is Professor of Law

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.280
at the University of California Berkeley,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.900
Boalt School of Law.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.263
He's the author of The
Powers of War and Peace,

00:00:44.263 --> 00:00:48.233
and War By Other Means:
An Insider's Account

00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:50.647
of the War on Terror.

00:00:50.647 --> 00:00:53.170
John, welcome to the program.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.210
- Thanks for having me.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.875
- Where were you born and raised?

00:00:55.875 --> 00:00:58.329
- I was born in Seoul, South Korea,

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.810
and was raised in the Philadelphia area.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.580
So, I came over here
from the United States,

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.448
to the United States when
I was three months old.

00:01:07.448 --> 00:01:10.069
Initially grew up in southern New Jersey

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:13.754
then grew up ultimately in
the Philadelphia suburbs.

00:01:13.754 --> 00:01:16.685
- And looking back, how
do you think your parents

00:01:16.685 --> 00:01:19.520
shaped your thinking about the world?

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.223
- Well, there's a lot of different ways.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.111
One, they were immigrants
from another country.

00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:30.448
I think that was very important to me,

00:01:30.448 --> 00:01:34.480
the idea that you would leave the country

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.040
you grew up in and went to school in,

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.077
and go to an entirely different country,

00:01:38.077 --> 00:01:41.707
something I think is very hard
for Americans to understand,

00:01:41.707 --> 00:01:43.350
there's not a lot of immigration

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.290
from America to other countries,

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.838
so I think that's one
thing is that how strong

00:01:48.838 --> 00:01:52.080
the pull of the United States is

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.636
on people in other countries.

00:01:53.636 --> 00:01:55.820
Second thing is, you know,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.950
I think they fled military
dictatorship, at the time.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.780
South Korea in the 1960s and in the 1970s

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.274
was a military dictatorship.

00:02:04.274 --> 00:02:07.140
And so, there's a big contrast I think,

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.223
between there and the kind of

00:02:09.223 --> 00:02:12.837
political, and economic, and
social freedoms one has here.

00:02:12.837 --> 00:02:15.430
And the third one, obviously, Korea is

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.266
a divided country to this day,

00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:21.137
and there's this famous shot from space

00:02:21.137 --> 00:02:23.433
of the Korea peninsula at night.

00:02:23.433 --> 00:02:26.970
And you can see the northern
half is completely black.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.040
And the southern half is full of light,

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.000
as is the Western world.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.240
And so, one of the last
thing I got from my parents,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.837
I think, was their deep
suspicion of communism,

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.703
and the Soviet Union,

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:46.160
And because of that, more
sympathy, and you know,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.690
when I got older in the
American political system,

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.141
of people who did not
think that the communists

00:02:51.141 --> 00:02:54.460
were gonna win or were a
legitimate political system.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.580
And that fighting expansion
of the Soviet Union

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.267
was a good thing.
- Mm-hmm.

00:02:59.267 --> 00:03:02.160
Was there a discussion
of politics, the law,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.215
around the dinner table?

00:03:04.215 --> 00:03:06.013
- No, I'm sorry, I don't have

00:03:06.013 --> 00:03:08.461
one of those great
stories growing up where

00:03:08.461 --> 00:03:12.279
my parents are cross-examining the kids

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:14.510
about politics and who to vote for.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.740
In fact, both, all I know about
my parents' political views

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.900
is that one of them is a Republican

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.700
and one of them is a Democrat

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.340
but I'm not sure which one is which,

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.190
and they've never told me, so

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.910
we didn't talk a lot about,

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.850
partisan or party politics
at the table at all.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.252
You know, so I can't,

00:03:34.252 --> 00:03:37.470
I can't say that my views were shaped

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.190
at the dinner table, or
my skills as a lawyer

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.352
was shaped from arguing
with my parents and sibling

00:03:42.352 --> 00:03:44.770
about politics and law.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.590
- Where did you do your undergraduate work

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.810
and then your law degree?

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.610
- I went to Harvard College
and I majored in history,

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.033
American diplomatic history in particular.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.050
I wrote my undergraduate thesis

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.740
about efforts to cooperate in
the sharing of nuclear weapons

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.030
between the United States and
Western Europe in the 1960s.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.321
And I did my Law Degree at Yale

00:04:06.321 --> 00:04:09.140
where, we don't have majors in law school

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.970
but I worked primarily in
the fields I still do now,

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.700
constitutional law and
international affairs.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.620
- And when where you
bitten by bug to look at

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.700
foreign policy, international law,

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.310
the power of the president,

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.410
those set of things that
run throughout your work?

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.810
- Actually it comes all
the way from middle school.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.190
Well part of it is just,

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.500
having come from Korea,
being an immigrant,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.139
and coming from a place where
the United States fought,

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.320
and drew in one of its Cold War battles.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.168
So that story of course, would make me

00:04:41.168 --> 00:04:43.244
sort of interested in the beginning.

00:04:43.244 --> 00:04:46.983
The second thing is I went to a school,

00:04:46.983 --> 00:04:48.640
in middle school and high school

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.100
that heavily emphasized
Western civilization

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.505
and the study of the classics.

00:04:53.505 --> 00:04:58.505
So I read a lot about Greek and
Roman sources and histories,

00:04:58.718 --> 00:05:02.000
which are, a lot of it is about

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.713
what we would think of today
as foreign affairs, politics,

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.740
military and so on.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.390
And so I was interested even
before I got to college,

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.034
and then when I got to
college I got to study

00:05:15.034 --> 00:05:18.819
a lot different aspects
of international relations

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:23.819
as it interacted with the
American domestic system.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.425
And then, law school, certainly

00:05:26.425 --> 00:05:28.720
more finely narrowed that down

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.033
to really the legal aspects of that.

00:05:32.033 --> 00:05:34.620
- And did you have any professors either

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.270
as an undergraduate or at law school

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.360
who heavily influenced you?

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.516
- Yes, in college I was

00:05:42.516 --> 00:05:46.510
heavily influenced by two professors who,

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.910
and it's probably the
normal course at Harvard,

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.673
neither of them are there anymore and,

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.421
one was Thomas Schwartz,
who's a professor of history,

00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:59.700
at Vanderbilt who was a real student

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.677
of the German reconstruction
period after World War II

00:06:02.677 --> 00:06:04.370
and is just last, I think two years ago

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.835
came out with this book about
Lyndon Johnson in Europe.

00:06:06.835 --> 00:06:09.470
The other professor I was
close to was Brian Ballou

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.500
who's a professor of history at Virginia

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.121
and he was a student of the
American administrative state.

00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:17.330
So actually if you think
about those two interests

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.723
that actually combined
from those two areas.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.070
And law school, I was or
the people I was closest to,

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.560
Peter Schuck, who's been
many times to UC Berkeley,

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.000
probably be back again,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.450
student of administrative law,

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.060
Harrold Kohs, say foreign
affairs and Akila Marr

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.113
who really studied constitution from

00:06:36.113 --> 00:06:38.635
an originalist perspective and so again,

00:06:38.635 --> 00:06:40.803
all three of those are,

00:06:41.653 --> 00:06:44.140
continue to be influences
on my work today.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.030
- How were you affected
by the Reagan revolution,

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.921
or were you?

00:06:47.921 --> 00:06:52.921
- You know, given the kind of
millue I think I came out of

00:06:53.876 --> 00:06:58.650
I was very supportive of
President Reagan's policies,

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.390
particularly in foreign affairs.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.280
The idea that the Soviet
Union was an evil empire,

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.380
it was an evil system
and the United States

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.470
was appropriately trying to defeat it,

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.160
not just reach some state
of coexistence with it,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.050
but to actually win in the Cold
War is very attractive to me

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.590
and he, Carter was really the president

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.939
I was really conscious of.

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:24.320
There's a sharp difference between the two

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.320
and I really though Reagan had
foreign policy about right.

00:07:29.718 --> 00:07:32.195
Domestic policy, I sort of like the idea

00:07:32.195 --> 00:07:33.747
of lower tax cuts.

00:07:33.747 --> 00:07:36.150
I mean more tax cuts, lower government

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.047
intervention in society.

00:07:38.047 --> 00:07:42.440
More space for private activity.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.710
People sometimes find it odd that I'm a

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.285
libertarian when it comes
to domestic social issues

00:07:47.285 --> 00:07:49.813
as opposed to foreign affairs.

00:07:51.275 --> 00:07:54.210
However, Reagan did not cut spending,

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.960
which he should have done.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.710
But other than that, the
other aspects of his policy

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:03.290
I thought were, I very much agreed with.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.380
- In one of the books or
one of the articles I read,

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.190
it mentioned that you,
the federalist society,

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:12.850
that you joined that when
there were only eight members

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:16.220
and it was made up of
conservatives and libertarians,

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.240
I think it said.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.625
So there is this dycotomy
in the conservative,

00:08:21.625 --> 00:08:24.560
in what we came to think of
as the conservative movement

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.960
and also in your own thinking.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.910
- Oh yeah, there is, I
mean people maybe generally

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.170
don't realize it but
within what's thought of

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:34.060
as the conservative legal movement,

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.625
there's a deep division
between libertarians

00:08:36.625 --> 00:08:40.020
who are just relatively suspicious

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.420
of government power on any form.

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.206
No matter what level of government it is.

00:08:44.206 --> 00:08:48.296
And I would think of as
more social conservatives

00:08:48.296 --> 00:08:51.749
or big government
conservatives, which also

00:08:51.749 --> 00:08:55.297
runs through the Republican Party too.

00:08:55.297 --> 00:08:57.090
And there's no resolution of it.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.801
And one thing the federal
society is good about

00:08:59.801 --> 00:09:03.380
is that it provides a forum to those two

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.771
groups to debate things.

00:09:04.771 --> 00:09:07.010
One great issue that they debate about

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.870
and disagree about is
wire tapping, for example.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:13.252
The war on terrorism,
so there's not unified

00:09:13.252 --> 00:09:16.025
view amongst legal conservatives.

00:09:16.025 --> 00:09:18.870
- During this formative
experience there was

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.418
a lot of energy in the
conservative movement.

00:09:21.418 --> 00:09:24.907
It was an exciting time
to become a conservative.

00:09:24.907 --> 00:09:26.811
That's fair, isn't it?

00:09:26.811 --> 00:09:29.740
- Yeah, I mean I think, it's interesting.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:33.260
The dominant sort of,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.180
the dominant way of thought at that time

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.100
was still, I think fairly
liberal and so if you

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.440
were a conservative,
particularly the place

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.263
like Harvard or Yale
or any major university

00:09:42.263 --> 00:09:45.320
at that time, conservatives
were sort of more

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.560
the radicals, I guess they were.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.635
They were trying to overturn the way

00:09:49.635 --> 00:09:51.741
things had been going for some time.

00:09:51.741 --> 00:09:53.936
So yeah it was more exciting.

00:09:53.936 --> 00:09:55.819
The people involved were maybe younger.

00:09:55.819 --> 00:09:58.470
They had the fresher and newer ideas.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:00.230
They were more fun to debate about them,

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:04.590
whereas what I think of
as a liberal orthodox

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:08.260
either had really been a
product of the new deal.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.868
And then Roosevelt and Johnson and Carter

00:10:10.868 --> 00:10:13.250
seemed tired and defensive.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.265
- Mh-mmm.

00:10:14.265 --> 00:10:16.970
You've been fortunate to have a number

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:21.970
of legal mentors, Judge Silverman first.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:24.770
Then Justice Thomas.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:27.040
And then you also worked for Orin Hetch.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.660
Talk a little about each of them briefly

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.090
and how they influenced
you because they really

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.593
gave you a view of
national security issues,

00:10:34.593 --> 00:10:37.470
conservative legal scholarship,

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:42.228
and then finally the
view from the congress.

00:10:42.228 --> 00:10:45.572
- I learned a great deal
from all three of them.

00:10:45.572 --> 00:10:50.572
They've all been very
influential mentors of mine.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:55.270
Judge Silverman is the first
person I had a real job under.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.290
You serve as a law
clerk which means you're

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.219
their assistant, you help
the judge research cases.

00:11:00.219 --> 00:11:03.280
If they want you to find what the laws

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.890
of some subject you go find it.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:07.190
You help them prepare for oral arguments.

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:08.437
You basically,

00:11:08.437 --> 00:11:11.670
research assistant, basically.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:13.980
In a way, professors have them.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.186
And he was a really good for me because he

00:11:17.186 --> 00:11:19.990
was someone who combined those
things I was interested in.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:22.074
He had been an ambassador.

00:11:22.074 --> 00:11:24.201
He was ambassador to Ugoslavia.

00:11:24.201 --> 00:11:28.870
And he's continued to be a
figure in foreign affairs

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.852
and national security even
though he's a judge and a lawyer.

00:11:30.852 --> 00:11:35.219
He's not a pure policy person.

00:11:35.219 --> 00:11:37.700
But someone who trained in law.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.187
So even just a few years
ago he was the joint

00:11:40.187 --> 00:11:43.050
chairman on the president's commission

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.237
on the WMD in Iraq study.

00:11:46.237 --> 00:11:47.900
So he continues to play a role.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.090
So that was very,

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:51.940
that was very important to me to see that

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.340
the things I was interested
in could lead to a career.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.530
And to see how he thought things through.

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.472
He was the first real lawyer I worked for.

00:11:58.472 --> 00:12:03.472
Justice Thomas is also very

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.781
influential person in the way I thought,

00:12:05.781 --> 00:12:07.730
or the way I think.

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.160
He taught me a number of things.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.490
One thing he taught me was not to really

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:15.109
worry so much about criticism.

00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:19.810
He really thinks the key thing in any

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:22.840
of these things we do is
to reach what you think

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.150
is the right answer.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.400
And if you think it's the right answer,

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.497
then defend it.

00:12:26.497 --> 00:12:30.600
And not to be so swayed by criticism.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.250
Not that you don't pay attention to what

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:33.710
other people's arguments and views are,

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:36.110
but you consider them
all and then you make

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.810
your decision and then you live with it.

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.000
You don't sway back and
forth based on criticism.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.510
And so he's been criticized a lot.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.763
He's one of the most
criticized public figures.

00:12:45.763 --> 00:12:49.144
And I think what I saw
was a person who continued

00:12:49.144 --> 00:12:51.550
to do his job and continued to stand up

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:52.712
for what he believed in.

00:12:52.712 --> 00:12:57.250
Senator Hatch, again I
was very lucky, again

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.723
to work for a wonderful guy

00:12:58.723 --> 00:13:02.160
and someone who taught me
about how politics works.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.660
So what I've always often
said to students is that

00:13:06.091 --> 00:13:07.870
we can prepare you in law school how

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.118
to be a judicial clerk.

00:13:09.118 --> 00:13:11.110
I think you can be prepared in law school

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:13.251
or graduate school how to
work in the executive branch.

00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:17.400
And I don't think in, no
offense to political scientistt

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.130
or to lawyers, I don't
think we have a clue

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:21.076
how to teach people how
to work in congress.

00:13:21.076 --> 00:13:24.553
You can't have a class on congress 101

00:13:24.553 --> 00:13:26.690
that really tells you what a lobbyist does

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:27.800
and how you would do it.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.840
How you would be a staffer.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.570
How you work things through the political

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:32.257
process in congress.

00:13:32.257 --> 00:13:34.163
What are hearings really like?

00:13:34.163 --> 00:13:35.547
How do you run?

00:13:35.547 --> 00:13:38.090
So of all the jobs I've actually had

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:40.400
I think I learned the
most from Senator Hatch

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.660
in that one year I worked for him

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.080
because there's no way right now we can

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.083
effectively teach that
experience in the classroom.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.657
- Which leads me to my next question.

00:13:49.657 --> 00:13:54.151
What do you think it takes
to do the kind of law

00:13:54.151 --> 00:13:56.840
that you do, it's not tort law.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.120
It's not contracts.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:03.120
It's really sort of the
constitution international

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.000
relations, it's a very

00:14:08.429 --> 00:14:12.280
hard thing to get your hands on, my view.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.470
- In the law school what they would say,

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.773
it's a hard thing to bill hours for.

00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:18.374
In the sense that
- You don't work

00:14:18.374 --> 00:14:20.370
for government.
- You obviously make money.

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:22.320
There's no law firms that have a practice

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.658
in foreign affairs law.

00:14:23.658 --> 00:14:24.980
- That's it.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.013
So what does it take to do that?

00:14:27.013 --> 00:14:28.960
Idealism, I guess?

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.250
- Well first of all, I think you're not

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:32.640
gonna make a lot of money if you go

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.420
into that kind of work
and most of the work

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.543
is in the government.

00:14:38.423 --> 00:14:40.880
You get into corporate,
to extent, companies

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:41.840
might get involved in it.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.970
It's really to extent their
multinational companies

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:46.341
and they run across issues,
but really the things

00:14:46.341 --> 00:14:49.285
I'm concerned about war powers,
treaty powers and so on,

00:14:49.285 --> 00:14:52.658
don't really rise that
much in private practice.

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:55.390
So the only real way
to get experience in it

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:58.186
and to learn about it is by doing it.

00:14:58.186 --> 00:15:00.871
So I've had the opportunity to work

00:15:00.871 --> 00:15:02.913
in all three branches of the government

00:15:02.913 --> 00:15:04.480
and to see these kinds of issues

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.580
from each of those different perspectives.

00:15:07.616 --> 00:15:09.750
And there's a lot of jobs, not a lot,

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.440
but there are good number
of jobs in the government,

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.650
in the federal government that involve

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:15.430
these kinds of issues, but outside of that

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:17.421
there really isn't much.

00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:20.170
So it's hard for me to tell students

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.371
to go into this as a line of work.

00:15:22.371 --> 00:15:25.070
I mean we can teach them
the issues in the class,

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:27.588
but it's gonna be very
hard to get actual jobs

00:15:27.588 --> 00:15:30.493
where you work on this everyday.

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:35.024
- Let's talk now to
where you found yourself

00:15:35.024 --> 00:15:39.770
at the time of 9/11
because as I was preparing

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.470
for this interview, it struck
me that you were present

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.720
at the Creation in a way.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.780
And you were in the Bush administration.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.008
You had a position at Berkeley
and you were on leave.

00:15:50.008 --> 00:15:54.030
So in the summer of 2001,
what was the position

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:56.613
you took up and what
does that position do?

00:15:56.613 --> 00:15:59.740
- So I was in the office of legal counsel.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.011
I was a deputy in the
office of legal counsel.

00:16:02.011 --> 00:16:06.321
That office functions
to provide legal advice,

00:16:06.321 --> 00:16:08.807
constitutional issues mostly,

00:16:08.807 --> 00:16:11.633
but also statuatory issues
to the executive branch

00:16:11.633 --> 00:16:16.633
because many people in the public world

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:19.870
don't really realize it, but the courts

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:22.120
only end up interpreting a fairly small

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.778
proportion of the law.

00:16:23.778 --> 00:16:25.140
The executive branch
has to enforce the law

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:26.810
and when it does that it has to figure out

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:28.347
what the law means in the first place.

00:16:28.347 --> 00:16:31.514
So the office of legal
counsel functions as sort of

00:16:31.514 --> 00:16:33.925
the office within the entire government

00:16:33.925 --> 00:16:36.709
that is a court of final appeal

00:16:36.709 --> 00:16:41.146
to those kinds of questions
within the presidency

00:16:41.146 --> 00:16:43.080
and the agencies.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.747
And also serves to serve
a advisor on the law

00:16:45.747 --> 00:16:48.763
to the president and the white house.

00:16:50.537 --> 00:16:53.571
I was hired to be in charge
of the foreign affairs

00:16:53.571 --> 00:16:55.781
docket within that office.

00:16:55.781 --> 00:16:57.660
It's a very small office, only has about

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.817
20 to 30 people in it.

00:16:59.817 --> 00:17:02.934
If you go back to that
world, the pre 9/11 world,

00:17:02.934 --> 00:17:05.700
this was not and
administration that was gonna

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:10.290
place a lot of importance or
emphasis on foreign affairs.

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:14.757
It was emphasizing tax cuts
and faith based initiatives

00:17:14.757 --> 00:17:17.950
and so on, so it wasn't
thought that this was

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:21.547
going to a particularly
important or heavy job.

00:17:21.547 --> 00:17:24.700
There weren't I think a
great number of national

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.100
security specialists in the administration

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.856
or in the justice department.

00:17:28.856 --> 00:17:30.998
So at 9/11 I was on my desk.

00:17:30.998 --> 00:17:34.670
I think was working on fairly
mundane routine things.

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:38.209
So I was at my desk and I saw the second,

00:17:38.209 --> 00:17:40.643
on television I saw the second plane

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:43.385
hit the world trade center towers.

00:17:43.385 --> 00:17:45.158
And I stayed there.

00:17:45.158 --> 00:17:46.873
I remember Washington was evacuated

00:17:46.873 --> 00:17:49.243
which was an incredible sight.

00:17:49.243 --> 00:17:52.256
Since I worked on these
issues I had to stay

00:17:52.256 --> 00:17:56.130
and I stayed there probably until

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:57.586
two or three in the morning.

00:17:57.586 --> 00:17:59.660
But it was very strange experience.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.999
To go out and get
something to eat for lunch,

00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:04.850
I couldn't find anything.

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:06.070
Washington was a ghost town.

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:07.100
It was completely empty.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.698
All the stores were shut.

00:18:08.698 --> 00:18:12.091
And driving home that night
was an incredible sight

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:15.650
because, I never thought I
would see in our lifetime,

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:18.200
I drove over the 14th street bridge,

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.764
which is the main bridge leading out of

00:18:19.764 --> 00:18:22.123
Washington to Virginia, where I lived.

00:18:22.123 --> 00:18:25.215
And it goes right by the
Pentagon and you drove by

00:18:25.215 --> 00:18:28.788
and the night sky is
lit up by the huge fire

00:18:28.788 --> 00:18:30.250
at the Pentagon.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:33.563
I never thought I'd live to see the day

00:18:33.563 --> 00:18:37.370
where part of our capital is on fire.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:39.672
- Did you realize right away how important

00:18:39.672 --> 00:18:43.930
the research that you had been doing was?

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:46.360
Because I believe, and let
me show this first book

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.760
of yours, which I guess
actually is the second

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.490
book to come out, I'm not sure.

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:52.027
- [John] First one.

00:18:52.027 --> 00:18:53.230
- The first, The Powers of War.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:55.860
You were working on this
book before you went

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.010
to Washington, right.

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:59.110
So you were, and in
this book you're really

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:02.263
grappling with a new interpretation

00:19:02.263 --> 00:19:05.610
of what are the powers of the president.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:10.610
- Yeah, during the '90s, my primary

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.264
scholarly activity was
this war powers question.

00:19:13.264 --> 00:19:17.270
One would have been
debating since well before

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.560
the Vietnam war, but
Vietnam War was really

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.120
when it became most prominent was the

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.070
does the president have
the authority to use

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.863
force abroad without
congress' authorization,

00:19:27.863 --> 00:19:29.340
without declaration of war

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.458
or any other kind of authorization.

00:19:31.458 --> 00:19:34.600
And you're right, I
think what I had to argue

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.797
was new in the sense
that most legal scholars,

00:19:38.797 --> 00:19:41.270
and the prominent ones at this time,

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:42.670
and probably continue
to today still think--

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:44.161
- And Harold Koh is one of them.

00:19:44.161 --> 00:19:45.593
One of your teachers.

00:19:45.593 --> 00:19:48.176
- Was probably one of the
leading people in this,

00:19:48.176 --> 00:19:49.600
takes this position.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:54.107
Or the view that president
acts on constitutionally

00:19:54.107 --> 00:19:57.930
unless he or she gets the
permission of congress

00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.960
through declaration of war or a statute

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.803
to wage a war abroad.

00:20:03.636 --> 00:20:06.187
I started working on that in 1993,

00:20:06.187 --> 00:20:07.400
was when I first started doing it.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.480
And you know, the '90s
were a period when no

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.180
one though there would be any wars anymore

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.493
and this would be kind of a back water

00:20:13.493 --> 00:20:16.340
of constitutional work.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.246
The other thing I just point out is

00:20:18.246 --> 00:20:21.143
this is an area where
the practice is very much

00:20:21.143 --> 00:20:23.994
at odds with the academic consencus.

00:20:23.994 --> 00:20:27.696
You look at certainly since
World War two, if not before

00:20:27.696 --> 00:20:31.030
in several wars, some
very significant ones

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:34.250
like Korea itself, which didn't have

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:35.971
any kind of congressional authorization.

00:20:35.971 --> 00:20:39.610
So yeah, this is something I
was working on before 9/11.

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:43.300
I believed I had signed
the contract to publish

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.140
this book before I went
off into government.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.078
I had not planned to go
into government in 2001.

00:20:48.078 --> 00:20:50.510
So I had planned, this
book would have probably

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:52.953
come out in 2002.

00:20:54.193 --> 00:20:56.830
- And in doing your
theory you're essentially

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.830
in the book, let's talk
briefly about that.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.609
You're looking at the record of practice,

00:21:00.609 --> 00:21:03.024
the imperatives of a dangerous world,

00:21:03.024 --> 00:21:06.670
and the structural advantages
of the executive branch.

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:08.301
Those are the three things
that you're identifying

00:21:08.301 --> 00:21:10.950
as truly important.

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:14.240
And when you did that when
you brought what I guess,

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.320
one would call a conservative perspective

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.729
or a new way of thinking, which
is or is not conservative,

00:21:19.729 --> 00:21:24.729
you essentially came up with an argument

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:27.364
about the president's
power and the congress.

00:21:27.364 --> 00:21:29.290
What is that argument?

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:30.720
- Well first let me say
this isn't a really,

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.597
in my view, a conservative
versus liberal view

00:21:32.597 --> 00:21:34.173
in the sense that

00:21:34.173 --> 00:21:37.421
President Franklin
Roosevelt certainly I think

00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:40.920
would have agreed with me
and republicans at that time

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.365
were quite critical of Roosevelt or Truman

00:21:43.365 --> 00:21:45.560
and a republican congress or Johnson.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.560
So I don't really think it follows

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.150
a conservative level thing.

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:50.887
Historically, although
it certainly does now.

00:21:50.887 --> 00:21:54.063
So the basic view is this, I don't think

00:21:54.063 --> 00:21:56.742
the constitution and
the area of war powers

00:21:56.742 --> 00:22:00.570
is so straight jacketed that it requires

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.267
a step by step process.

00:22:02.267 --> 00:22:06.080
Like a dual key launch
system on a submarine,

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.050
where the president can't turn his key

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:10.622
until congress has turned his key

00:22:10.622 --> 00:22:12.805
and that this is all set
out in the constitution.

00:22:12.805 --> 00:22:16.384
Rather I think the constitution
has a flexible process,

00:22:16.384 --> 00:22:20.680
either branch can act on its own.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.700
Take the initiative.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.423
Also means either branch can try to stop

00:22:23.423 --> 00:22:25.640
the other branch using its own powers.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.820
And there's nothing wrong with that.

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:31.300
That the constitutional
system actually anticipates,

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.284
if not intends there to be some conflict

00:22:33.284 --> 00:22:36.050
between the executive
and legislative branches,

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:37.450
between the president and congress

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:39.510
over something like war.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.260
But what I didn't think
it was was this kind of

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.902
legalistic process like passing a law.

00:22:43.902 --> 00:22:46.340
And I think that makes sense because

00:22:47.221 --> 00:22:49.560
that would make the most sense if you had

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.300
the other elements that you mentioned.

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.400
That you had a world that was dangerous,

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.920
you would want the
government to be able to act

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.931
flexibly and quickly if you needed to.

00:22:56.931 --> 00:23:00.561
If future challenges
were gonna be uncertain,

00:23:00.561 --> 00:23:03.580
you would wanna have,
again, an executive can

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:06.570
take the initiative
and congress can choose

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:08.320
to support and congress can also block him

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.153
if it wants to.

00:23:09.153 --> 00:23:12.425
But what is so, I emphasize
constitutional flexibility,

00:23:12.425 --> 00:23:14.840
the interesting thing
about this is the critics

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:18.430
of practice had always
based their arguments

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.260
in the original understanding
of the constitution

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.671
which is not a familiar home
to these kinds of scholars

00:23:22.671 --> 00:23:24.585
in almost any other issue.

00:23:24.585 --> 00:23:27.327
So I think what my contribution was to say

00:23:27.327 --> 00:23:30.520
the practice that has been
going on in this country

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.820
for many, many decades is not actually

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.210
inconsistent with the original view

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:35.150
of the constitution.

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:36.360
The constitution was
originally was written

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.200
to be flexible so you
can harmonize the two.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.919
Otherwise the view has to be that there

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:43.950
have been many, many
presidents over many decades

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:45.530
including most of our great presidents

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:47.460
who have been acting unconstitutionally

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.940
in all of these areas.

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.760
- When you look at the specifics

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.644
and I think this is
important in a way that

00:23:52.644 --> 00:23:56.611
you're very clearly saying,
look if the congress

00:23:56.611 --> 00:24:01.611
wants to stop a war, they can
cut off the funding basically.

00:24:02.271 --> 00:24:06.536
And then on the other
hand, really the president

00:24:06.536 --> 00:24:09.008
can just take an action and he really

00:24:09.008 --> 00:24:11.783
doesn't need a declaration of war.

00:24:11.783 --> 00:24:15.160
In the case of fighting Al-queida

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:18.010
and the case of the Iraq war,
Bush went to the congress,

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:19.470
but he really didn't have to do that.

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:20.430
- That's right.

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:22.770
I would say the Korean War

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:25.281
or any number of things.

00:24:25.281 --> 00:24:27.902
Lincoln's response to
Civil War or as you said,

00:24:27.902 --> 00:24:31.710
the Iraq War or war in Afghanistan.

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:34.110
I don't think the
president constitutionally

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:36.149
needed to get, or the Cosovo War,

00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:37.710
president didn't need
to constitutionally need

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:39.240
to get the permission of congress.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.640
On the other hand, only
congress could provide

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.794
the funds for any of those wars to go on.

00:24:43.794 --> 00:24:48.280
And that in my view remains
congress' ultimate check.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:52.420
So if congress really wants
to end the war in Iraq,

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:53.253
they can do it.

00:24:53.253 --> 00:24:55.330
In fact, it's very easy to do it.

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:56.661
Don't even have to pass a law.

00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:58.347
All they have to do is not pass anything

00:24:58.347 --> 00:25:01.153
because military appropriations come up,

00:25:01.153 --> 00:25:03.430
with this war, every, not just every year,

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:05.160
sometimes several times a year.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.450
If congress just stopped and said,

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:07.570
we're not gonna vote you anything.

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:12.101
We're gonna sit passively
on our heels and just watch,

00:25:12.101 --> 00:25:14.000
then the war would have to end.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.450
- And this raises an interesting question

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:19.507
that really recurs throughout your work,

00:25:19.507 --> 00:25:22.077
and that is the legal dimension

00:25:22.077 --> 00:25:24.166
and the political dimension.

00:25:24.166 --> 00:25:27.970
And so the political
realities are that congress

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:30.073
isn't gonna use that power.

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:34.473
Even probably if you had
a majority of democrats

00:25:34.473 --> 00:25:37.540
in both the house and the senate.

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:41.550
So I guess the, I'm
curious about your sense

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:45.065
of your role because as
in the administration

00:25:45.065 --> 00:25:49.280
being aware of the theories that

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:53.093
you had developed there really,

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.220
what is the play here between,

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.570
because you in your job you said about

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:03.528
writing a number of memos
based on these principles.

00:26:03.528 --> 00:26:08.528
And I guess the important question

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:13.132
is how does our system

00:26:13.132 --> 00:26:17.339
respond negatively to
actions of the president

00:26:17.339 --> 00:26:21.960
if congress and the courts power

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.117
is so circumscribed?

00:26:24.117 --> 00:26:26.280
- Well you know again,
I don't think the power

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.880
is circumscribed, and
so is a formal matter.

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:30.713
- [Harry] But it's a matter of politics.

00:26:30.713 --> 00:26:31.768
- I would agree with you,
it's a matter of politics,

00:26:31.768 --> 00:26:33.530
they choose not to use it.

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:35.474
And one point I really
try to make in the book

00:26:35.474 --> 00:26:40.380
is that because groups
or people or institutions

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.301
don't use the powers at their hand,

00:26:43.301 --> 00:26:46.051
doesn't mean we have to
reinterpret the constitution

00:26:46.051 --> 00:26:48.460
itself to force them to do it.

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.610
If they don't want, the congress or court

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:52.440
doesn't want to try to
check the executive,

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.580
then that's their decision.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.887
But that doesn't mean the
constitution's broken.

00:26:55.887 --> 00:26:58.640
So just one point, so the second thing is

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.890
in terms of the being an
academic in government

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:03.440
I think is really our question,

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.660
well at the one hand I might say

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:09.280
and I think this has
been the consistent view

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.810
of the justice department
across many presidents

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:13.950
that I might think that the president

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:17.298
has the authority to respond to Al Qaeda

00:27:17.298 --> 00:27:20.060
without any congressional permission.

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:22.260
On the other hand on the policy matter,

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.930
I was one of the small team that worked

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:26.690
with congress to get them to pass

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:29.170
such an authorization both with regard

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:30.633
to Afghanistan and Iraq.

00:27:30.633 --> 00:27:35.360
So you're right, my
constitutional view is one thing,

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.080
but it may be politically better for the

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.070
Bush Administration to get permission

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:43.334
from congress or authorization
from congress anyway,

00:27:43.334 --> 00:27:45.773
and that's what I did.

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:49.790
- There was an interview
you did with Front Line

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:52.480
and I was really struck by this quote

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.640
and I think it relates to what we're

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.770
talking about right now.

00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:00.380
And this was something you said at the end

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.213
of the interview.

00:28:01.213 --> 00:28:03.190
I think one of the things I did notice

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:05.569
in a lot of these debates
is that a lot of people

00:28:05.569 --> 00:28:08.195
thought or wanted the law to have

00:28:08.195 --> 00:28:11.160
already made the choice for them.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.530
That's the thing that was
very interesting to me.

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:15.880
I think people in the
public and some members

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.980
of the military, the agencies, they think

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.440
that all this should
be decided by the law.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.520
That the law really tells you exactly

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.490
how to treat enemy prisoners.

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:26.854
And it does when you're
fighting another nation state.

00:28:26.854 --> 00:28:30.100
What I think made them more uncomfortable

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.820
was the newness of the concept,

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:35.850
the sort of radicalism of
this unprecedented enemy.

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:38.122
So in a way, you're sort
of admitting that you're

00:28:38.122 --> 00:28:40.160
sort of sheepishly I think here,

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.570
that you were in a way surprised

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:47.280
by the impact of the
memos you were writing.

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.388
Or were you, is that a fair reach?

00:28:49.388 --> 00:28:52.370
- I think what I was trying to say there

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:54.073
and what I think still is that,

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:59.591
what struck me is that,
with the war on terrorism,

00:28:59.591 --> 00:29:01.654
not so much the war in Iraq which is a

00:29:01.654 --> 00:29:04.558
sort of standard nation
state, nation state war.

00:29:04.558 --> 00:29:08.158
But in the war on terrorism,
you had a situation where

00:29:08.158 --> 00:29:10.480
this was a new kind of enemy.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.380
And the conflict is different.

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:15.889
And people within the executive branch

00:29:15.889 --> 00:29:19.528
were very relunctant to ask,

00:29:19.528 --> 00:29:22.095
well really do the rules
that we have developed

00:29:22.095 --> 00:29:24.950
for the kinds of wars we know,

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:27.360
wars between nation states covered by

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:32.100
the Geneva Conventions, do
they really apply here or not.

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:35.196
And people did not want to
think about that question.

00:29:35.196 --> 00:29:39.920
Even though I think it
seemed to clear to me

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.270
and I think clear to a lot of other people

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:43.563
that legally the Genevan
Conventions don't apply.

00:29:43.563 --> 00:29:45.010
That doesn't tell you,

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:46.750
if they don't apply, that doesn't tell you

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:47.583
one way or the other whether you should

00:29:47.583 --> 00:29:50.328
apply the rules of the Geneva Conventions

00:29:50.328 --> 00:29:52.540
as a matter of policy.

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.710
And there are people who
thought well, since it must,

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:56.420
we wanna follow policy therefore I have

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:59.040
to go back and read the law in some way

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.422
to find it to apply to
conflict with Al Qaeda.

00:30:02.422 --> 00:30:06.900
So I think the law there is used as a way

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.129
not to make decisions.

00:30:08.129 --> 00:30:12.290
To say oh the law has already
made this choice for us,

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:15.030
when I don't think it really has.

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:16.410
And that makes it harder.

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:19.030
If the law hasn't really
already made the decision

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:20.043
for you then it's harder to figure out

00:30:20.043 --> 00:30:23.218
because you have to reach the
policy decision of your own

00:30:23.218 --> 00:30:25.325
and take responsibility for it.

00:30:25.325 --> 00:30:29.671
- Now in a democracy
what we believe is that

00:30:29.671 --> 00:30:33.115
in an open debate and
because so many of these

00:30:33.115 --> 00:30:38.115
memos, some of which you
authored were really secret

00:30:39.327 --> 00:30:43.700
for quite a while, it prevented a kind of

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:47.671
vigorous debate so that the politics

00:30:47.671 --> 00:30:50.847
didn't happen in the short term.

00:30:50.847 --> 00:30:53.609
So it's an interesting conundrum here.

00:30:53.609 --> 00:30:58.609
You get legal decisions
by you with a particular

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:03.380
perspective but nobody
knows about them, basically.

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:06.940
And because the political
debate didn't occur,

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:10.538
so there could be policy
made on the basis of well,

00:31:10.538 --> 00:31:13.453
this is what the law says, but.

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:17.942
- I think that's a fair point
and a difficult problem.

00:31:17.942 --> 00:31:22.060
And again, example,
this is always a problem

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.340
in war it seems to me,
but it's an even greater

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:26.160
problem in this war then in previous wars.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:30.670
Which is when you vote
a war you have to take

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:31.660
measures in secret.

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:34.130
You have to swiftly and
secretly and decisively

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:35.834
in the word of the federalist papers.

00:31:35.834 --> 00:31:39.170
That can be at odds with
the idea that you have

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:42.794
full robust debate over policy options.

00:31:42.794 --> 00:31:45.941
Just take a standard
answer, was there a full

00:31:45.941 --> 00:31:49.112
robust public debate in the United States

00:31:49.112 --> 00:31:51.884
in 1941 and '42 about whether to emphasize

00:31:51.884 --> 00:31:55.994
Europe over the Pacific as
the major field of battle

00:31:55.994 --> 00:31:57.500
against the Axis Powers.

00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.024
I don't think there ever really was.

00:31:59.024 --> 00:32:01.650
You certainly didn't, until much later,

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:03.470
have public all the kinds of plans

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:05.644
and strategic thinking of
the Roosevelt Administration,

00:32:05.644 --> 00:32:10.644
because there's obvious
harm that premature

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:12.330
disclosure of the information can have

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:14.250
in helping the enemy in a way it doesn't

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:16.635
when you're talking about tax
cuts or domestic spending.

00:32:16.635 --> 00:32:21.101
And so that's basically a
problem, I think in all wars.

00:32:21.101 --> 00:32:24.714
It's especially a problem
in this kind of conflict

00:32:24.714 --> 00:32:28.850
because enemy's almost
acting entirely covertly.

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:33.144
So the kind of information
that we're dealing with

00:32:33.144 --> 00:32:35.230
is primarily intelligence.

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:38.490
It's not reconicance.

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:40.790
It's not the kind of
methods you usually use

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:43.100
to gain information on the enemy

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.969
if the enemy was say Germany or Russia.

00:32:44.969 --> 00:32:49.500
And because of that the
kinds of discussions

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:52.160
could have negative consequences in terms

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:56.558
of our ability to succeed
in fighting a covert enemy.

00:32:56.558 --> 00:33:01.558
To give you one example
about wire tapping.

00:33:01.723 --> 00:33:04.850
If you were to say, we
need to have a discussion

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:07.090
about wire tapping because we wanna tap

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:09.710
this kind of communication, then Al Qaeda

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:11.900
will respond quite quickly and stop

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.868
using that form of communication.

00:33:13.868 --> 00:33:16.587
And this is not idol hypothesis.

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:21.396
In the '90s, I talk about in another book.

00:33:21.396 --> 00:33:26.090
In the '90s, the
government got the ability

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:28.330
to actually intercept Osama Bin Laden's

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:30.695
personal cell phone calls
which I think is extraordinary.

00:33:30.695 --> 00:33:35.658
And in the course of
a trial from the first

00:33:35.658 --> 00:33:37.809
world trade center bombing by Al Qaeda,

00:33:37.809 --> 00:33:40.728
I believe the government
leaked that it had

00:33:40.728 --> 00:33:43.372
this ability, I think
probably to show eventually

00:33:43.372 --> 00:33:46.510
that it knew it could trace back

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:49.173
that Osama Bin Laden had
actually ordered the bombing.

00:33:49.173 --> 00:33:52.750
But within 24 hours,
Osama Bin Laden stopped

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:54.940
using that cell phone which was the only

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:57.000
obvious and rational thing for him to do,

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.815
and never used one again.

00:33:58.815 --> 00:34:01.970
So they monitor our discussion,

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:03.180
which is easy to do through the internet

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.580
and they react fairly quickly.

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:10.580
- When one looks at these memos,

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:14.900
it's very clear that you were really

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:17.510
present at the creation
and that you had to

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:19.642
define a new set of terms in a way.

00:34:19.642 --> 00:34:22.150
You had already written, I think,

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:24.070
or had thought about the problem of

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:26.893
weapons of mass destruction,
terrorist organization,

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:31.596
the whole notion of rogue states,

00:34:31.596 --> 00:34:34.563
is kind of defining a new world.

00:34:34.563 --> 00:34:37.916
So one of the challenges I guess you had

00:34:37.916 --> 00:34:42.916
were to define terms such
as a terrorist organization.

00:34:43.247 --> 00:34:45.561
What is torture?

00:34:45.561 --> 00:34:47.653
And so talk a little about that.

00:34:47.653 --> 00:34:50.900
Did you have clients here to help you

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:52.440
come up with these definitions?

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.850
That is clients within the government?

00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:56.501
- Even before you get to those things,

00:34:56.501 --> 00:35:01.330
the first term of definition
is whether it was war in fact,

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:04.680
which I think still
continues to be at root,

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.510
the basic area of disagreement

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:09.892
about people who criticize or agree

00:35:09.892 --> 00:35:12.666
with the current administration's
terrorism policies.

00:35:12.666 --> 00:35:14.763
Whether it's a war at all.

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:18.240
But then right, then
you have to talk about

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:21.100
who's really legitimately
a member of the enemy.

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:23.240
What force can you use against them?

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:24.410
How long can you detain them?

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:25.867
How do you try them?

00:35:25.867 --> 00:35:26.700
How do you interrogate them?

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:29.472
You're right, all those questions come up

00:35:29.472 --> 00:35:31.691
in a way they haven't come up before

00:35:31.691 --> 00:35:34.780
because this is not a nation state

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.480
and because of the way they fight.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.104
They don't come up abstractly so I mean,

00:35:40.104 --> 00:35:42.970
as a professor in academic
you like to think,

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:46.040
oh the governments at the very beginning

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.960
thought coherently about everything

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:50.469
and applied basic principles throughout.

00:35:50.469 --> 00:35:53.304
In the government, it
doesn't really work that way

00:35:53.304 --> 00:35:57.785
and the government these
issues come up piece meal

00:35:57.785 --> 00:36:00.751
based on specific questions of policy

00:36:00.751 --> 00:36:03.910
or specific legal questions
that are put to you

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:05.870
by other agencies.

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:07.790
So one thing about the place I work

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:11.908
is that's not a proactive
agency in the sense,

00:36:11.908 --> 00:36:14.231
we just declared on September 12th,

00:36:14.231 --> 00:36:15.720
we have to rethink everything

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:16.600
and this is how we're gonna do it.

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.560
It's not really a policy making arm.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.230
It's more of a reactive.

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:24.700
Other agencies had to confront these kinds

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:26.960
of question in the course of fighting

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:30.277
the war on terrorism,
came back and asked us

00:36:30.277 --> 00:36:32.763
what our best opinion was.

00:36:33.785 --> 00:36:37.246
And so they may lack a certain kind of

00:36:37.246 --> 00:36:41.412
comprehensiveness or cohesiveness

00:36:41.412 --> 00:36:45.010
from issue to issue that,
academics or scholars

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:47.373
or people would like but that's
because that's the nature,

00:36:47.373 --> 00:36:50.323
the government deals with
the problems as they arise.

00:36:52.498 --> 00:36:53.840
The other thing about government work

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.870
that was really surprising to me is how,

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:58.420
and I think we don't really
understand as academic

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:01.160
because academics we
can spend years studying

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.815
one decision made by the government.

00:37:03.815 --> 00:37:06.783
And I think that's, so
we can collect almost,

00:37:06.783 --> 00:37:09.740
collect immense amount of information,

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:11.430
rethink all the different possibilities,

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:13.230
the consequences and weigh them.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:15.250
The thing that's very
hard to understand for us

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:17.330
is that in the government, the government

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:19.360
has to make decisions under extraordinary

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.344
pressures of time, extremely
limited information

00:37:22.344 --> 00:37:26.050
and so it has to make a decision.

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:27.766
It doesn't have the
luxury of full analysis

00:37:27.766 --> 00:37:31.990
that one would, and
war only make sit worse

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:34.728
because it compresses the
time and the consequences

00:37:34.728 --> 00:37:38.140
of the wrong decision are much higher

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:40.400
than I think they are
for, again a question

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.748
of social policy or domestic policy.

00:37:42.748 --> 00:37:45.850
- This question about what
was the nature of this war

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:49.496
and whether we were at
war seems to be pivotal

00:37:49.496 --> 00:37:52.840
and I have never understood the notion

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.760
of a war on terror.

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:57.760
It's sort of like a war
on airplanes or something.

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:02.760
Was that a political
decision that mucks up

00:38:03.396 --> 00:38:06.958
the legal sphere?

00:38:06.958 --> 00:38:08.590
- Agree with what you're suggesting.

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:11.208
I think the war, calling
it the war on terrorism

00:38:11.208 --> 00:38:14.510
is a rhetorical device that I think

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:16.649
speech writers probably came up with

00:38:16.649 --> 00:38:20.983
the night of September 11th,
probably or September 12th.

00:38:20.983 --> 00:38:22.850
It's very much at odds
I think with the way

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:25.115
we have to understand
the war as a legal matter

00:38:25.115 --> 00:38:27.220
or a constitutional matter.

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.939
I quite agree that we
can't really be at war

00:38:28.939 --> 00:38:33.939
with what is at base,
just a way of fighting,

00:38:34.633 --> 00:38:36.749
it's a method of fighting, terrorism.

00:38:36.749 --> 00:38:39.323
We couldn't be at war with comicazi.

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:44.060
What we are at war with has
to be an entity of some kind.

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:45.819
I think that's called a lot of problems

00:38:45.819 --> 00:38:49.863
because people say,
well we don't really use

00:38:49.863 --> 00:38:52.202
wartime methods on drugs.

00:38:52.202 --> 00:38:54.557
We have a war on drugs
and we have a war on crim.

00:38:54.557 --> 00:38:56.460
We have a war on poverty.

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:59.000
We don't use the military,
we don't use force,

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.761
we don't detain and so on.

00:39:00.761 --> 00:39:03.130
But I think this is different.

00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:06.720
I think we are at war
legally with Al Qaeda

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:09.509
and the groups that are
supporting and helping Al Qaeda

00:39:09.509 --> 00:39:12.321
and anybody else who was
connected with the 9/11 attacks.

00:39:12.321 --> 00:39:15.680
And I think the law can help us define

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.520
what that conflict is, but yeah,

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.830
when you say war on
terror then you're sort of

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:21.612
blurring that line and
I think it causes people

00:39:21.612 --> 00:39:24.742
unnecessary concern about the steps

00:39:24.742 --> 00:39:26.450
that the government is legitimately

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:27.875
and entitled to undertake.

00:39:27.875 --> 00:39:32.875
- One of the controversies about the memos

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:36.393
that you wrote relates to torture.

00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:40.510
Again, I don't know that these are,

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:43.150
have been released in the public domain,

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:47.490
but the memo that you
wrote is quoted as saying

00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:50.650
that physical pain amounted to torture

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:52.940
must be equivalent in intensity

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:56.144
to the pain accompanying
serious physical injury

00:39:56.144 --> 00:39:59.870
such as organ failure,
impairment of bodily function,

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:01.029
or even death.

00:40:01.029 --> 00:40:04.351
For purely mental pain or
suffering to amount to torture

00:40:04.351 --> 00:40:08.358
it must result in significant
psychological harm

00:40:08.358 --> 00:40:11.260
of significant duration,
that is lasts for months

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:12.093
or for years.

00:40:12.093 --> 00:40:17.093
These opinions, this memo became a very

00:40:17.391 --> 00:40:21.371
controversial and I
wanna take it to actually

00:40:21.371 --> 00:40:24.630
talk about kind of broader issues.

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:27.815
I'm not a constitution or
international law scholar

00:40:27.815 --> 00:40:31.630
so what I wanna ask about is in doing

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:34.621
the writing of these memos,

00:40:34.621 --> 00:40:39.621
did your philosophy about
the president's power

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:42.090
and how it really isn't constrained

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:45.280
in a time of war lead you to come up

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:48.154
with narrower definitions

00:40:48.154 --> 00:40:53.030
of the particular issue or was that really

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:55.140
what you found in the law?

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:58.527
- In that case, in the
language you quoted it doesn't.

00:40:58.527 --> 00:41:03.527
The hard thing about that
problem was that congress

00:41:03.661 --> 00:41:06.301
prohibits torture in a criminal statute.

00:41:06.301 --> 00:41:10.772
But it doesn't give much
definition to what torture is.

00:41:10.772 --> 00:41:13.340
And the job of the executive
branch is try to give

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.480
some objective meaning that's not based

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:18.250
just one what one person
versus another person

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:19.180
might think it is.

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:21.592
We may all have very
different definitions of it.

00:41:21.592 --> 00:41:25.370
And used unfortunately vague terms,

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:26.460
didn't give examples.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:30.810
It didn't point to cases and so on.

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:34.519
It used language that
was torture is severe

00:41:34.519 --> 00:41:37.045
physical pain or suffering
basically is about it.

00:41:37.045 --> 00:41:39.160
And so the language
actually, you're right,

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.645
it was ones that was
drawn from other statutes

00:41:41.645 --> 00:41:44.203
that congress had passed
where it had define

00:41:44.203 --> 00:41:46.377
what severe physical pain or suffering.

00:41:46.377 --> 00:41:48.123
- And it was domestic legislation.

00:41:48.123 --> 00:41:49.980
- Yes, it was domestic legislation.

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:51.910
It didn't have to do with foreign affairs,

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:55.800
but you try to read all
of congress' statutes

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.750
coherently as one body of law.

00:41:57.750 --> 00:42:02.413
And it was in an area about
emergency medical treatment.

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:05.690
But it was the only other
area of law we could find

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:07.523
where congress had defined.

00:42:07.523 --> 00:42:09.090
The other thing that was
lacking is this had never

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:11.238
come up in American court.

00:42:11.238 --> 00:42:13.694
So there's no interpretation of that law

00:42:13.694 --> 00:42:16.105
by any judicial decision
which be another normal place

00:42:16.105 --> 00:42:18.955
you would look to find some definitions.

00:42:18.955 --> 00:42:23.300
So in all of that, what we did, I thought

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:25.210
was standard approaches to figure out

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:28.230
what a vague law or a
law of first impression

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:29.063
that no one's interpreted means.

00:42:29.063 --> 00:42:31.365
And in fact we also
looked at the experience

00:42:31.365 --> 00:42:34.914
of the Iraelis, the British.

00:42:34.914 --> 00:42:38.540
Their courts had
interpreted the definition

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:40.453
between torture and non-torture too.

00:42:42.023 --> 00:42:47.023
Later in the memo, the
view about presidential

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.180
power does come up.

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:50.954
Not as to the definitions,
but when we're asked

00:42:50.954 --> 00:42:55.240
what would actually
happen if the president

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.980
had ordered interrogation method,

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:01.338
which people thought
actually did cross the line.

00:43:01.338 --> 00:43:05.467
And in that circumstance,
my view was that the,

00:43:05.467 --> 00:43:08.660
and it continues to
be, that congress can't

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:11.210
use the criminal law to
prevent the president

00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:13.230
from using his constitutional authorities

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:14.716
to make a decision.

00:43:14.716 --> 00:43:18.420
And that we had historically, as a country

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:21.830
and under the constitution,
given to the president

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:23.870
the control over battlefield tactics,

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:26.470
battlefield strategies and that congress

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:28.943
had never really tried
to interfere with those.

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:33.260
Now again, this doesn't
mean congress can't use

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:34.786
any of its other powers.

00:43:34.786 --> 00:43:37.501
Funding, investigation, oversight.

00:43:37.501 --> 00:43:40.897
Ultimately impeachment,
to constrain a president

00:43:40.897 --> 00:43:44.840
that he or she, that
congress disagrees with.

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:47.368
But I don't think what it can do is say,

00:43:47.368 --> 00:43:50.760
if the president uses one of this powers

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:53.030
in a way we don't like,
it's actually in violation

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:54.120
of the criminal law.

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:55.869
That actually brings me where I'm back to

00:43:55.869 --> 00:43:58.141
a question you asked me in
the beginning about Reagan.

00:43:58.141 --> 00:44:00.310
That was a problem I thought existed under

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:02.760
the Reagan Administration,
was that you had the,

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:05.010
what I think of as the criminalization

00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:08.420
of policy disputes between
the president and congress.

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:11.500
And that's what I
thought would happen here

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:13.940
if such a hypothetical arose.

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:16.860
Now in the end it was my
view that that didn't happen,

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.870
that the president didn't in fact,

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:22.352
did not cross that line
so that part of the memo,

00:44:22.352 --> 00:44:25.800
which is also heavily
criticized didn't actually

00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:29.870
become operative, it
didn't become relevant

00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:32.826
to the actual policies
that were later decided on.

00:44:32.826 --> 00:44:37.826
- In your book really see
the president as preaminant

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:43.770
in deciding what treaties mean basically,

00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:46.080
and even abrigating those treaties.

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.810
And you limit congress to the role

00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:53.810
of the implementation
through domestic legislation.

00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:59.370
And I guess, that's prelude to what I hear

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:04.460
in all of this, which
is that a lot of this

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:06.432
was very bad politics.

00:45:06.432 --> 00:45:09.170
That wasn't your domain, but you know,

00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:12.620
in the sense that if you
have a narrow definition

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:15.614
like this and it's kept
secret and then it leaks,

00:45:15.614 --> 00:45:18.406
the response of the
international community

00:45:18.406 --> 00:45:21.160
to what is being said and so on.

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:25.762
So there's a whirlwind of negativity

00:45:25.762 --> 00:45:30.539
that's just lying in wait
to suddenly spring out.

00:45:30.539 --> 00:45:33.306
- Harry, I completely agree with you

00:45:33.306 --> 00:45:36.550
and I wouldn't deny that those thoughts,

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:39.010
I wasn't thinking about
those kinds of things.

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:42.550
In the sense that if someone was concerned

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:46.390
about the political
dimensions of these kinds

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:48.840
of decisions, the safest thing to do would

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:50.750
be to just do what we used to do

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:52.733
and not make any great change of policy.

00:45:52.733 --> 00:45:55.570
If you didn't want to
get any criticism at all,

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:57.011
the safest thing to do would just be say

00:45:57.011 --> 00:45:59.100
Geneva Conventions apply.

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:02.604
Every member of Al Qaeda is
a prisoner of war and so on.

00:46:02.604 --> 00:46:06.420
It would be the risk
reverse political choice.

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:10.700
I think however, given
and maybe it requires

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:13.840
putting oneself back in the time of 9/11

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:17.630
and the media aftermath, the
pressures on the government

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:20.570
to stop another 9/11
attack were very high.

00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:22.321
It's very hard to remember today,

00:46:22.321 --> 00:46:26.025
particularly out here in
California, what it was like.

00:46:26.025 --> 00:46:29.975
And so you have this I
think competing value

00:46:29.975 --> 00:46:32.670
that runs against that which is

00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:36.530
trying to take those
measures in a balanced way.

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:39.990
Not in an overly aggressive
way to try to make sure

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:42.440
another terrorist attack
like 9/11 doesn't happen.

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:45.980
Everyone thought there'd be
another in fairly short order

00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:48.310
and the government has
been fairly successful

00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:49.890
in stopping them.

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:52.483
But you're quite right, I
think the politics of it,

00:46:52.483 --> 00:46:55.850
anybody could have foreseen
if they thought about it,

00:46:55.850 --> 00:46:57.700
that yeah you're gonna take these measures

00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:59.600
and when they become public as they all

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.532
do eventually it will be
extremely controversial

00:47:01.532 --> 00:47:05.510
and you will suffer negative
political costs for them.

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:06.691
No doubt about.

00:47:06.691 --> 00:47:08.560
- Is there a problem
here in the sense that we

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:11.710
haven't really thought
through a lot of these

00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:16.260
definitions because
where these definitions,

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.976
and I'm being vague here, but this is what

00:47:17.976 --> 00:47:21.930
we'll call the Bush response and the legal

00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:25.680
memorandum that went with it,
that there is a notion here

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:30.656
of war 24/7 and if you live with that

00:47:30.656 --> 00:47:34.786
over time then a lot of what we think

00:47:34.786 --> 00:47:37.742
and know and appreciate about our system

00:47:37.742 --> 00:47:40.870
doesn't seem to be operative, basically.

00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:42.833
Intrusion on people's privacy.

00:47:42.833 --> 00:47:47.833
The notion that power is
always balanced in our system.

00:47:48.464 --> 00:47:51.830
So there are general views that we have,

00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:56.697
I being a lamin, the
lamin add in our audience,

00:47:56.697 --> 00:48:00.482
of what our system is
about that indirectly

00:48:00.482 --> 00:48:04.085
becomes discredited
basically, by the impact

00:48:04.085 --> 00:48:05.640
of all of this.

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.050
The notion that war is 24/7,

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:10.568
the president can do anything and so on.

00:48:10.568 --> 00:48:14.340
- I would look at it a little
differently, obviously.

00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:18.723
I would say that yes
this is a new kind of war

00:48:18.723 --> 00:48:21.999
and it does require rethinking
of some basic concepts

00:48:21.999 --> 00:48:25.033
and also of how we approach war,

00:48:25.033 --> 00:48:29.190
since managing it and deciding issues

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:30.610
about it domestically.

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:34.030
It doesn't, I don't think it require,

00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:38.133
it has this sort of the
huge political consequences

00:48:38.133 --> 00:48:40.637
that people worry about and your question

00:48:40.637 --> 00:48:43.468
expresses worry about, in the sense that

00:48:43.468 --> 00:48:48.070
if you look at where
we've been since 9/11,

00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:51.030
we have had the normal
operation, I would think,

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:52.300
of the political process.

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:54.865
We have, about to have our
second presidential election.

00:48:54.865 --> 00:48:58.367
Several congressional elections.

00:48:58.367 --> 00:49:00.920
I don't think there's
been any real distortion

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:01.753
in the political process.

00:49:01.753 --> 00:49:04.243
You look at the work in the economy,

00:49:04.243 --> 00:49:06.751
you look at the normal social activity.

00:49:06.751 --> 00:49:09.510
They seem not to be that
traumatically affected

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:11.300
if you compare it to past wars.

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:13.095
So I think that's,

00:49:13.095 --> 00:49:14.982
I kind of think of it as,

00:49:14.982 --> 00:49:18.390
think of it in terms of
another discipline as way.

00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:20.780
Medicine, in the sense
that what you've got to do

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:22.937
to fight Al Qaeda is you have to actually

00:49:22.937 --> 00:49:26.890
be much more precise
and surgical in the way

00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:29.691
you fight them so that you
don't affect the whole body,

00:49:29.691 --> 00:49:31.567
the body of politic.

00:49:31.567 --> 00:49:34.497
Whereas in previous wars you had much more

00:49:34.497 --> 00:49:37.120
aggressive and wide ranging measures

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:38.350
that are taken by the government.

00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:41.340
You compare this to World
War two, World War one,

00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:43.640
and the Civil War and
what happened domestically

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.850
in terms of civil liberties and privacy

00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:48.540
I think was far worse than
anything that's happened.

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:51.460
Today I just think people
don't remember the history

00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:53.622
or don't study what happened
in those previous conflicts.

00:49:53.622 --> 00:49:57.070
I quite agree, we would lose the war if we

00:49:57.070 --> 00:50:01.560
actually took those measures
in response to terrorism today.

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:04.080
So the job of, I think the Mishusha's done

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.800
a much better job than
people give credit for

00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:07.680
of fighting this war, but at the same time

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:11.370
trying to preserve as
much of normal piece time

00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:13.222
civil liberties as possible.

00:50:13.222 --> 00:50:16.849
And not really airing as
far over as say Lincoln

00:50:16.849 --> 00:50:19.345
or Roosevelt or Wilson have.

00:50:19.345 --> 00:50:24.345
- One sense that I was left
with in reading your books is,

00:50:26.812 --> 00:50:30.450
and I wanna be judicious
here, but I'm kind of naive

00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:34.388
about the way beauracracies work.

00:50:34.388 --> 00:50:38.250
And of course you're
here at the university

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:40.200
so you have some familiarity with that.

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:42.833
- The beauracracy here is far worse

00:50:42.833 --> 00:50:45.940
that anything that exists
in Washington, I assure you.

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:49.680
- But the idea that if for
example, if we look at the

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:54.375
example of the torture memo
and how certain clients

00:50:54.375 --> 00:50:58.235
of your office, mainly the CIA,

00:50:58.235 --> 00:51:01.496
well even in the military,
the kind of break downs

00:51:01.496 --> 00:51:05.060
you witness in Iraq and having to do

00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:10.060
with the transfer of a
limited use say in Guantanemo

00:51:11.273 --> 00:51:15.308
to a broader war in Iraq that
was very different situation.

00:51:15.308 --> 00:51:17.952
Talk a little about that
and is that just a problem

00:51:17.952 --> 00:51:21.900
that lawyers have
generally as a rule maker?

00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:22.740
- No, I think

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:26.370
it's, how would I put this?

00:51:26.370 --> 00:51:29.740
I think it's difficult
because when you work

00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:34.140
in the office of justice,
your job is interpret the law

00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:36.398
and to say, here is the law,
here are the rules it sets.

00:51:36.398 --> 00:51:39.880
And within those rules,
sort of like saying

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:42.340
here are the lines of the football field

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:44.270
and within those lines you play the game.

00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:45.850
We're not gonna tell you
how you play the game,

00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:47.750
but you can't go beyond those rules.

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:52.300
And what the job of that
department had traditionally been

00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:54.380
was then to implement the rules too.

00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:57.074
There's a separation
between interpreting the law

00:51:57.074 --> 00:52:00.950
and developing and
prosecuting the policies

00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:03.298
within the rules that you have set out.

00:52:03.298 --> 00:52:08.298
And so to extent there is any kind of

00:52:08.767 --> 00:52:10.910
problem in implementation.

00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:13.350
I think your question is,
well you may have decided

00:52:13.350 --> 00:52:16.241
these policies and they
may have made sense

00:52:16.241 --> 00:52:19.595
in the abstract, you didn't take account

00:52:19.595 --> 00:52:21.970
of the fact that there
are gonna be problems

00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:24.360
in the implementation, that
people will violate the rules

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:26.226
or they'll go too far.

00:52:26.226 --> 00:52:29.560
And again, this is not
unusual in the sense

00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:32.507
that if you compare it
to domestic society,

00:52:32.507 --> 00:52:36.549
we have very clear rules
about what police can do.

00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:39.410
We have thousands of cases
every year in the federal

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:41.370
court system and the
state court system about

00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:43.210
police who go too far.

00:52:43.210 --> 00:52:45.436
Or prison guards who go too far.

00:52:45.436 --> 00:52:50.436
And it is a problem,
but how do you make sure

00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:53.548
that those agents of the
government follow the rules

00:52:53.548 --> 00:52:56.524
and how do create a
system to correct errors.

00:52:56.524 --> 00:53:01.524
And so thinking about now
the sir my scholars hat

00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:04.990
on I suppose your
question can be translated

00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:07.130
into this idea, well
you did not anticipate

00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:08.901
how high the errors would be.

00:53:08.901 --> 00:53:12.260
And you would have to think about,

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:14.700
well what would the system
to correct those errors

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:16.684
look like and how much would it cost.

00:53:16.684 --> 00:53:20.830
And what's the benefit of
following the rules you set out.

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:24.527
We have errors, we have
errors in beauracratic systems

00:53:24.527 --> 00:53:28.570
in the United States, in
the university all the time.

00:53:28.570 --> 00:53:30.520
But there are costs we live with in order

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:32.000
to get the benefits or whatever it is.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.557
So those are all variables I think of.

00:53:34.557 --> 00:53:36.808
I have to say in the
writing on these issues,

00:53:36.808 --> 00:53:40.942
that really isn't something
the memos were about

00:53:40.942 --> 00:53:42.395
or designed to do.

00:53:42.395 --> 00:53:45.480
And in some ways as a lawyer,

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:46.940
would not have been my job.

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:49.110
I would've been going
too far if I had said,

00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:50.800
here I'm interpreting this law,

00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:52.510
but here are these other things
you better be worried about.

00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:54.770
It wouldn't be part of
the job of that office.

00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:57.717
It might be advice one could give,

00:53:57.717 --> 00:54:00.930
but doesn't have anything to do with a law

00:54:00.930 --> 00:54:02.710
and my view wouldn't
be entitled to any kind

00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:06.310
of special value as opposed to anyone else

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:07.650
in the governments on those issues.

00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:09.766
In fact, I might be someone
who's less qualified

00:54:09.766 --> 00:54:13.232
to advise someone about that
because my specialization

00:54:13.232 --> 00:54:16.390
is just interpreting law
here and not figuring out

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:18.374
how do you actually now
make it work in practice.

00:54:18.374 --> 00:54:23.374
- You wrote in this book,
the War by Other Means,

00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:29.070
which I guess I should show,
I never showed our audience,

00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:30.700
which is an account of your experience.

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:31.890
You wrote I think in the--

00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:33.710
- My publishers, though they're different,

00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:36.040
they all like to stick
stars on the book covers.

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:37.580
- I see, yeah.

00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:41.730
You wrote upon confrontation and questions

00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:44.117
of its policies, the Bush Administration

00:54:44.117 --> 00:54:47.000
tended to run and hide.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.373
I have a sense that you say,
okay this is what I think.

00:54:50.373 --> 00:54:53.350
My scholarship tells me this.

00:54:53.350 --> 00:54:55.493
My political inclinations.

00:54:55.493 --> 00:54:58.879
And you would incline
more toward the airing

00:54:58.879 --> 00:55:01.685
of these things so
there should be a debate

00:55:01.685 --> 00:55:04.510
and that the political process would then

00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:08.230
maybe retreat from what you
thought was the best, yeah.

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:09.315
- I agree.

00:55:09.315 --> 00:55:11.410
I think the one problem,

00:55:11.410 --> 00:55:14.220
a big problem in a lot of these
wars on terrors and issues

00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:18.950
is it's not just that
initially there wasn't debate,

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:21.836
but then after a period
of time you could have

00:55:21.836 --> 00:55:24.459
debate, obviously, and I
think the administration

00:55:24.459 --> 00:55:26.724
ceded the field to its critics.

00:55:26.724 --> 00:55:29.228
I think the administration
has very good reasons

00:55:29.228 --> 00:55:32.590
for a lot of the policies
that we should, it wasn't,

00:55:32.590 --> 00:55:35.340
but if you read the press
and follow it publicly,

00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:36.270
you would think that these were the most

00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:39.460
irrational arbitrary decisions just made

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:41.533
to agrandize the power of the president

00:55:41.533 --> 00:55:45.220
or the vice president and I don't think

00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:46.053
that's the case at all.

00:55:46.053 --> 00:55:47.660
I think these are,

00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:49.810
and I think it's an illusion
to think they're easy.

00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:51.721
I think these are very hard questions

00:55:51.721 --> 00:55:54.121
and there are costs and benefits to every

00:55:54.121 --> 00:55:55.593
decision you make.

00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:58.790
And I think the
administration just doesn't

00:55:58.790 --> 00:56:00.560
explain itself very well or chose,

00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:03.133
I think with the, when
the Geneva Conventions

00:56:03.133 --> 00:56:05.289
and interrogation issue,
chose not to explain at all.

00:56:05.289 --> 00:56:08.747
And I think only when it
came down to the wire tapping

00:56:08.747 --> 00:56:12.440
cases did the administration
really start coming out

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.250
and explaining why it did what it did,

00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:15.883
why it thought it could do that.

00:56:15.883 --> 00:56:18.564
And then we also started learning later

00:56:18.564 --> 00:56:21.950
that the executive branch was actually

00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:23.900
secretly briefing and
consulting with members

00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:25.890
of congress about all of these things

00:56:25.890 --> 00:56:28.066
to try to get some kind of...

00:56:28.066 --> 00:56:30.250
In response to one of
your previous questions,

00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:32.650
how do you deal with this,
you have war time pressures

00:56:32.650 --> 00:56:34.580
but have a government that's supposed to

00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:37.060
openly disclose policy choices.

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:38.920
What the administration
clearly tried to do

00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:41.790
was to not have the
information become public

00:56:41.790 --> 00:56:43.940
so it would help the
enemy, but at the same time

00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:47.260
try to have some kind of sort of

00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:49.770
political consultation by secretly talking

00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:51.388
to leaders of congress.

00:56:51.388 --> 00:56:54.666
But I agree, that doesn't
substitute for a full

00:56:54.666 --> 00:56:57.460
bore robust public discussion,

00:56:57.460 --> 00:56:59.580
and I don't understand
why you wouldn't have it

00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:01.010
once it's already become public.

00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:02.944
But that's what they did and I think it's,

00:57:02.944 --> 00:57:04.610
I think that's a big problem

00:57:04.610 --> 00:57:07.160
and sort of a self inflicted wound

00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:09.500
that the administration has suffered.

00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:11.587
- One final question
requiring a brief answer

00:57:11.587 --> 00:57:13.780
because we're running out
of time, but you know,

00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:16.548
my sense of American
politics is the pendulum

00:57:16.548 --> 00:57:19.911
swings back the other way over time.

00:57:19.911 --> 00:57:22.519
Liberal, conservative, whatever.

00:57:22.519 --> 00:57:25.370
Do you see that happening
here and what will

00:57:25.370 --> 00:57:29.190
be the consequences for both the country

00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:30.540
and actually for the people who were

00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:31.633
involved in these decisions?

00:57:31.633 --> 00:57:33.240
- Yeah so very interesting question.

00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:38.150
I think after Vietnam you say
and the Nixon Administration,

00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:40.313
you saw weakening of executive power.

00:57:40.313 --> 00:57:42.710
The thing that's, I think, fairly striking

00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:45.682
is that it actually lasted
fairly short period of time.

00:57:45.682 --> 00:57:48.900
It lasted the rest of
Nixon's Administration

00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:50.564
which under President Ford and then the

00:57:50.564 --> 00:57:52.595
Carter Administration, one term.

00:57:52.595 --> 00:57:55.240
And then by the Reagan
Administration you had

00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.610
a lot of people in the political system

00:57:56.610 --> 00:57:59.293
wanting a return to a vigorous executive.

00:57:59.293 --> 00:58:03.700
So it's certainly possible
that the dissatisfaction

00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:06.110
with the war, although
I think it's primarily

00:58:06.110 --> 00:58:08.750
the war in Iraq and not
the war on terrorism

00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:11.219
that's causing the great dissatisfaction,

00:58:11.219 --> 00:58:15.020
will produce a shift away
from executive power.

00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:18.290
But I think it's gonna
return, not because I happen

00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:21.360
to favor it that way
or I think it's because

00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:23.351
of complexity of the world
and foreign challenges,

00:58:23.351 --> 00:58:26.866
and the threat of
terrorism's not going away.

00:58:26.866 --> 00:58:29.530
And we're not gonna have
a congress manage that

00:58:29.530 --> 00:58:31.310
day to day in the details.

00:58:31.310 --> 00:58:33.530
It's still gonna be the job,
and always gonna be the job,

00:58:33.530 --> 00:58:35.040
of the executive branch.

00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:38.520
- John, I wanna thank you very
much for being with us today

00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:42.660
and I wanna show your
two books because I think

00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:46.430
they should be read because you are

00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:49.650
fearless in your willingness to discuss

00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:54.250
the issues that were raised by 9/11

00:58:54.250 --> 00:58:56.670
and the response of this administration.

00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:58.960
Thank you very much for
coming on our program.

00:58:58.960 --> 00:58:59.793
- Thank you, Harry.

00:58:59.793 --> 00:59:00.626
It's a pleasure.

00:59:00.626 --> 00:59:02.450
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:04.323
for this Conversation with History.

00:59:05.212 --> 00:59:07.795
(upbeat music)
