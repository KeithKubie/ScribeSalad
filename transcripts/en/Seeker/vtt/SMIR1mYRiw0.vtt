00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.760
Ever wanted to be invisible?

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:12.459
Well science is getting closer to making that
fantasy, a reality.

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:14.919
So invisibility cloaks seem like the realm
of fantasy.

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:16.640
But science is working on it.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.179
We see things when light bounces off an object
and reaches our eyes.

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:25.430
To make something invisible to our eyes, researchers
have to find ways to bend light or other forms

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.029
of electromagnetic radiation around an object.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.989
Previous versions of an invisibility cloak
were less of a cloak and looked more like

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.590
a medical device.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.590
One involved a series of lenses that bend
light around an object, you could find out

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.000
more about there here in Amy’s video.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.220
But scalability proved to be an issue.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.150
It couldn’t cover large or irregularly shaped
objects, like a human body for example.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.050
It was really limited to simple objects like
a cylinder and only at specific viewing angles.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.890
If you were to walk around the object, it
would be visible.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.519
But in the two years since, other researchers
have come up with their own versions of an

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:00.840
invisibility cloak.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.060
A team of researchers at UC Berkeley came
with a metamaterial that’s super thin according

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.360
to a paper published in the journal Science.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.220
The thin cloak is only 80 nanometers thick,
made up of tiny gold antennas that make you

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.620
think you’re looking at a flat surface instead
of a three dimensional object.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.670
t’s because this metamaterial changes the
way light is scattered.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.970
When we look at someone, our brains work to
interpret the way light is scattered by their

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.299
face and body.

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.439
But the cloak, disrupts the way light scatters.

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.090
So instead of seeing the person in front of
us, we would see a flat surface.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.090
Pretty clever huh?

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.110
. One of the authors of the study told The
Washington Post that “Each antenna is designed

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.460
to react with the light and scatter it back.”

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.360
And it’s so thin that it actually acts like
a cloak by wrapping around the object it’s

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.360
hiding.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.000
The benefit of this material is that it can
cloak irregularly shaped objects, like the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
human body.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.840
But don’t get too excited, so far the material
can only cover an object about one square

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.900
millimeter or about the size of a grain of
sand.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.360
So that’s very tiny.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.850
And only at a very specific wavelength of
light.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.890
So, while we’re inching closer to a true
invisibility cloak, we’ve got some major

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.409
hurdles to jump over first.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.860
Since we’re playing with light waves and
bending them and scattering them at will,

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.130
things start to get a little strange.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.330
It does a weird timey-wimey thing.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.950
In reflecting and scattering light, it actually
delays light, it delays the reflection.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.870
So there’s a lag effect, where the image
appears slower than that thing it’s reflecting.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.710
Like time is moving at two different rates.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.640
So if you’re walking by a cloaked, invisible
box, a bird flying by would pass at normal

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.820
speed, but if it flew inside the box, it would
be a few seconds slower.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.080
And most of the cloaks so far, have to stay
still.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.250
As soon as you move, the illusion is broken.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.660
You’ve heard of the doppler effect, it’s
where the pitch of sound changes as a object

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.450
moves past you, and that’s because of how
the sound waves are emitted when an object

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.260
is moving fast, it changes the space between
the waves, thus changing the pitch.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.770
And according to a study published in the
journal Physical Review A, a similar thing

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.420
causes a fast moving cloaked object to appear
visible.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.900
Basically the frequency of the light waves
changes as the object moves, which causes

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.280
distortions in the image.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.870
And as the object moves faster these changes
get more noticeable.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.320
Which, kind of defeats the purpose of the
cloak in the first place.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.660
The other issue with these kinds of invisibility
cloaks, is that while it might make an object

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.750
invisible, if someone were inside of that
object, they couldn’t see out.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.760
But this paper also makes the case that these
distortions, might actually enable someone

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.010
in the cloak to be able to see out.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.760
So perhaps there’s solutions on the horizon
for some of the tricky science behind invisibility

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.760
cloaks.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.950
For now, I’m just going to go read some
fantasy books until science perfects it.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.310
Telescope push
If you want an incredible behind-the-scenes

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.340
look at the James Webb Space Telescope, make
sure to check out Discovery’s brand new

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.150
documentary Telescope!

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.010
The world premiere is this Saturday, February
20 at 9pm on the Discovery Channel.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.410
We’ll be watching too!

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.400
It’s crazy to think about how technology
is making fantasy a reality.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.680
Like scientists are already working on mind
control!

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:25.040
