00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
Well, brief mentions in other videos about the Q-word,

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.740
*Laughs*

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.940
you know, the magic computers that are going to break all encryption

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.000
and beat everyone at their own game and be the next big thing and be on all our smartphones.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.440
Should we put some reality on this? Where are we at with quantum computing?

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.180
I Work at a company called Righetti computing. We're a company in Berkeley, California

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:32.400
And we build quantum computers from the ground up. We do the silicon fabrication all the way up to how we program the machines

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.890
I in particular

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.149
Think a lot about how we program the machines how we interface with it at some point

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.450
Somebody has to type something into a keyboard to make it do something and that's mostly where I think about things quantum computers

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.329
Really should be thought of as a way to

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.009
Augment our existing compute infrastructure exists in computers solve problems, and that's not going away there. They will continue to solve good problems

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.160
So a quantum computer really should be thought of as a is a special-purpose machine that can solve certain problems

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.570
a lot better

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:12.000
Than existing computers can solve them. In fact, I think thinking of it like a GPU is is pretty fruitful that

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.860
GPUs are, are, they are computers in a sense. But really they're they're better thought of as like a coprocessor to your main computer. They

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.959
GPUs are extremely good at solving a variety of problems

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.100
you could sort of

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.699
Wrangle a GPU to solve any problem you want to but it's you know regular computers are good at that so quantum computers

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.700
I think of as like on the side

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.339
Unfortunately current quantum computers are gigantic. They're they you know, they're like the old computers like the ENIAC they fill a room

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.039
But nonetheless you you hook your computer up to this and it does separate problem-solving as a company

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.649
We build these quantum computers and deploy them there. They're

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.420
Accessible right now on the cloud. There's something that I on my laptop anywhere

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.680
Actually, I don't need any special interface can connect up to them and do computations with them

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.329
And we're at a point now where?

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:06.989
the fundamental unit of resource of a quantum computer just as we take regular computers and think about them in terms of

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.929
bits and gigabytes and so on on a quantum computer

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.979
These are measured in qubits, which are very special because every time you add a qubit

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.819
You're you're doubling the capacity of the computer in some way. So

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:26.109
Last year, we released a machine that has around eight qubits. And now the current machine we have is about nineteen qubits

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.960
so it's not that we

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.650
Approximately just doubled the qubit because each qubit itself is doubling

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.980
so you have to think of that number of doublings each time from eight to nineteen problems that deal with lots of

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.600
interactions or lots of

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.859
Possibilities so to speak are where quantum computer sort of shine

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.860
so one big area of application is

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.390
in quantum computing is the simulation of molecules molecules are are made up of a bunch of atoms and each of these atoms is is

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.290
Applying a force to the other atoms they're pushing and pulling each other and they're just lots of ways in which the atoms interact with

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.809
one another and a quantum computer is extremely good at

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.809
Keeping track of all that and dealing with that in a very efficient way that classical computers which are normal computers

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.720
Don't deal with quite as well

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.829
Likewise other types of problems like optimization which in mathematics means kind of finding the best or worst

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.350
possible solution to a problem

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.580
Quantum computers are showing a lot of promise and with that said though

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.209
There's one point I want to make which is sort of in popular science people think that quantum computers just sort of try every possibility

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.579
At the same time you get all these sort of kooky

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.640
Interpretations of multiple universes and so on and quantum computers, don't do that. They do not try every possibility at the same time

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.439
But the second point is that applications of quantum computing is a very active field of research

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.320
quantum computers currently are

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.780
They're called noisy quantum computers. They they sort of act like analog devices not digital devices

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.670
And so there's all this a little bits of error and little bits of noise that come into the system

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.369
and so it's an active field of research to see what

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:11.229
Algorithms and what problems are very robust to this noise and it turns out that this molecular simulation is an example of a problem

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.710
That's very robust to noise

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:18.670
Whereas what? You might heard of like Shor's algorithm and factoring and breaking encryption are not robust annoys at all

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.219
They're very difficult to to do so that's a very active field of research both at the company that I work at

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.750
As well as more broadly the community the sort of room size computers are sort of where we're at

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.199
the way in which these computers have been constructed is

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:40.489
Using sort of off-the-shelf components that have not been specially made for the construction of that machine in general

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.590
So you find generally with these quantum computers you find big racks of analog

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.399
electronics these electronics that that have existed for other applications

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.020
and so

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.960
It's definitely not at a point where we've we've sort of custom fabricated the entirety of the machine

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.790
I'm not just talking about the quantum chip itself

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:04.219
But the thing that the quantum chip is housed in the electronics that go with the quantum chip, etc, etc

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.660
We're only just starting

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.889
We just in general as a in the field of quantum computation are only just starting to make like customized

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.169
electronics and the like for these systems

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:21.139
The other aspect of this is that just like the ENIAC for example

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:25.159
Which had vacuum tubes that burnt out and you had to go replace them

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.260
Literal bugs getting in there and so on neither of those things happen with quantum computers

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:36.589
But what does happen is that the system in general isn't shown to be stable across, you know?

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.070
Five or ten years and just hasn't existed that long

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.780
And so components are are often swapped out often changed

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.440
It's not robust to changes in the environment

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:54.040
like if somebody walks by with a big magnet the whole thing kind of goes awry, so it's a really sort of

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.560
Finicky machine not unlike the early computers like the ENIAC and so on

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.500
How far are we off quantum smartphones?

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:10.520
Yeah, that is that is really really far away because we need to cool these chips down to like the same temperature or colder than

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.720
The temperature of outer space so you need big refrigerators as they're called

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.240
Not going to happen for a good while

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.060
The interesting thing though is

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.949
When we have multiple qubits, and this is really where the power of quantum computation happens

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.320
We can actually think of it sort of simply

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:34.589
Diagrammatically that if qubits if I just represent them sort of as a circle here, maybe we have three the idea

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.010
Is that these qubits can interact this guy can interact with this guy?
