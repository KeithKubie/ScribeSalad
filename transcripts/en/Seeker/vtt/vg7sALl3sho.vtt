00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.281
Arachnophobia is one of the most common fears.

00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:03.899
But fear not my friends!

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.139
There are some pretty sweet spiders out there
that deserve our love and attention.

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.469
Hey there, Julia here for DNews.

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:20.689
I used to be really afraid of spiders, I hated
them, but over the past few years I’ve slowly

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.029
started to accept the fact that some are pretty
cool.

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.010
Take for instance, the Feather-legged lace
weaver that charges their web with electricity!

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.540
While most spiders spin webs just micrometres
thick and use a sticky glue-like substance

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.170
to trap their prey, this English garden spider’s
silky strands are only a few nanometres thick.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.120
And the way it tugs at its thin thread as
it’s spinning the web, gives it a tiny burst

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.860
of electrostatic charge.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.850
This makes it especially sticky to a passing
fly.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.210
And there’s a species of spiders that can
count.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.210
Science fiction?

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.210
Nope.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.210
Real science.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.000
A researcher at the University of Wisconsin
recently showed that Golden Orb Weavers posses

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.700
a sense of numerosity.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.610
By moving around the spider’s prey, the
researchers saw the spiders went looking for

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.600
it even if their meal was replaced by another
object.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.270
This indicated that not only do they keep
track of how many prey they have in their

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.400
web, but that they have some sense of memory
too.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:20.750
The camel Spider AKA Sun Spider AKA Wind Scorpion
is found in the middle eastern desert.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.690
These spiders get a bad rap.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.970
Not only are they big, up to 6 inches in length,
and pretty hairy, but they’re scary fast.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.060
they can run up to 10 mph.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.440
They aren’t venomous but because they are
scary as all get out, they’ve been rumored

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.450
to chase down or even eat soldiers in Afghanistan.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.860
They don’t actually eat people, but they
do chow down on bugs, lizards, birds and even

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.860
rodents.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.000
And they aren’t chasing soldiers, just their
shadows.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.640
This species hates the sun, their name even
means “those who flee from the sun” in

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.640
Latin.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.920
Another spider that has yet to be named was
recently discovered in the Peruvian Amazon.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.159
Other spiders in this genus build decoys in
their webs with leaves and dirt, but this

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.320
species makes them look just like a larger
spider, including 8 leg-like shapes.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.010
The smaller, real spider, sits in the corner
of his web, shaking the web.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.310
And like a puppet on strings, the decoy dances!

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.010
This defense mechanism might have evolved
to evade predators.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.590
A hungry bird might be confused and go for
the web instead of the spider.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.370
Argyroneta aquatica aka the Diving Bell Spider:
Like its name suggests, this spider is the

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.450
only fully aquatic spider species.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.060
To achieve this feat and be still be able
to breathe, it creates an air-filled bubble

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.700
held by hairs on its abdomen and legs.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.230
This bubble acts as a lung, filtering the
oxygen out of the water.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.790
Rather than building a web, they build a Diving
Bell filled with air where they can eat, digest,

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:39.790
and mate.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.070
Other awesome arachnids include the Small
Bird Dung Spider, which as its name suggests,

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.380
looks like crap.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.380
Literally.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.310
It’s black and white to look like bird poo.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.099
This camouflage will definitely deter a hungry
bird.

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.350
And like most crazy creatures they’re found
most along the Eastern and Southern coasts

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.890
of Australia.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:03.620
Alright dudes, last but not least on our list
is the Puppy Spider aka South American Goliath

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.980
Spider. and yes, it’s called the puppy spider
because it’s as big as a small dog.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.330
I’m not kidding.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.550
They can grow up to a foot long and weigh
up to 6 oz.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.030
And like a puppy you can hear them walk.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.180
The hardened tips on their feet make a clicking
noise, like puppy nails on a hardwood floor.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:27.690
But you might not want one as a pet, they’re
the nastiest on our list.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.540
While not deadly to humans, their venomous
bite packs a punch.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.050
One scientist describes the pain as “like
driving a nail through your hand.”

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:43.170
Do you have a favorite spider, or did I just
scare you away from them even more.
