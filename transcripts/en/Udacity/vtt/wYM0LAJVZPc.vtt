00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.660
In the coming lectures, I'll talk about
these tools that compute the derivatives

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.350
for you, and a lot about what's good and
bad about grading descent.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.770
For the moment, though, we'll assume
that I give you the optimizer as a black

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.060
box that you can simply use.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.090
There are two last practical things
that stand in your way of training

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.690
your first model.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.049
First is how do you fill image
pixels to this classifier and

00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:25.830
then where do you initialize
the optimization?

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.630
Let's look into this.
