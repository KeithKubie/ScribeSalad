00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:14.241
The 
idiom “You can’t have your cake and eat

00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:19.730
it too” deliciously illustrates the concept
of making trade-offs and realizing that you

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.530
can’t have something if you have another.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.400
The phrase is often used when referring to
compromises and alludes to making a choice

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.880
between two options that could never be reconciled.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.740
In other words, the two options that are mutually
exclusive.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.210
Other cultures have adopted the spirit of
this phrase to fit into their own languages.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.059
For example, in Russian the (translated) phrase
is “You can’t sit on two chairs.”

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.399
In German, the saying goes “You can’t
dance at two weddings.”

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.469
In Yiddish, the adage goes much like the German,
except “one tuchis” is added on to the

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:52.469
end.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:00.030
Tuchis is Yiddish for backside, or less delicately,
the butt; so, “You can’t sit on two chairs

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.670
with the same butt.”

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.800
Of course, with the cake expression…

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.660
I mean, it’s your cake; why can’t you
eat it too?

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.660
Surely that can’t be the original expression,
as it doesn’t make sense as written.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.360
So where did this expression come from?

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.750
The phrase was actually used as early as 1538
in a letter from Thomas Howard, the third

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.170
Duke of Norfolk, to Thomas Cromwell, chief
minister to King Henry VIII.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.450
In the letter, found and archived by British
History Online, Duke of Norfolk writes:

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.190
I require you to send me, by this bearer,
my will, which ye have sealed in a box.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.010
I must alter things therein, for my substance
in money and plate is not so good now by 2,000l.,

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.340
“a man can not have his cake and eat his
cake.”

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.920
The idiom was later published in A Dialogue
Conteynyng Prouerbes and Epigrammes by John

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.160
Heywood in 1562.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.630
Heywood switches the clauses so it reads,
“Wolde ye bothe eate your cake, and haue

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.630
your cake?”

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.590
(Several other well-known phrases or “figures
of speech” have been attributed to Heywood,

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.750
including “two heads are better than one”
and “Rome was not built in a day.”)

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.200
Over the next few hundred years, the phrase
regularly showed up in books, plays, and other

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.200
writings.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.720
For instance, in 1738, the phrase showed up
in Jonathan Swift’s political satire “Polite

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.879
Conversation” when the character Lady Answerall
exclaims, “She cannot eat her cake and have

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:21.930
her cake.”

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.019
According to the New York Times, Swift’s
plays were well-known at the time for mocking

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.379
and satirizing language.

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:33.260
It appears that, with Swift’s use of “cake,”
he was in fact commenting on the silliness

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.120
of the phrase.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.870
Linguists have debated for years over the
proper order of the verb phrases.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.340
Up until the 19th and 20th centuries, more
often than not, the proverb would read in

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.629
some variation of “You can’t EAT your
cake and HAVE it too,” which of course makes

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:54.019
a tad more sense than the modern version;
though in the end, the basic sentiment is

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.409
the same- once you eat your cake, no more
cake!

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.690
But according to Google Ngram Viewer (a handy
tracker of usage of phrases in published works

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.879
over time), somewhere between 1938 and 1939,
the percentages switch and “You can’t

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.159
HAVE your cake and EAT it too” became more
prevalent.

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.310
Right around this time, President Franklin
D. Roosevelt used the now less common version

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.239
of the proverb in his 1940 State of the Union
address when referring to the need to increase

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.379
spending for national defense:

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.549
As will appear in the annual budget tomorrow,
the only important increase in any part of

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.269
the budget is the estimate for national defense.

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.840
Practically all other important items show
a reduction.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.620
But you know, you can’t eat your cake and
have it too.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.069
As alluded too above, some linguists have
insisted that “Have…Eat” iteration is

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.840
not correct due to the actual plausibility
of the statement.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.680
You, in fact, can have your cake and then
eat it.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.909
That isn’t impossible, therefore it negates
what the actual idiom stands for, not unlike

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:57.799
the common error of saying, “I could care
less!” when one means “could not care

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:58.799
less.”

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.689
On the other hand, eating it and, then, having
it is impossible and absurd, hence why this

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:06.069
statement is in fact the correct turn of phrase.

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.889
Despite the “Have…Eat” version being
more prevalent in today’s society, one amateur

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:16.700
linguist in particular insisted on using the
“correct” version in a manifesto he wrote.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.660
That person was Theodore J. Kaczynski, aka
the Unabomber.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.130
“The Unabomber” had been mailing and placing
homemade bombs aimed at maiming people who

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.940
were involved with modern technologies since
1978.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.520
The FBI had been trying to track him down
for decades.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.170
Finally, in April 1995, the FBI had a break
in the case when the Unabomber’s manifesto

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.820
entitled “Industrial Society and its Future”
was sent to major publications across the

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.640
country and was, under the threat of violence,
demanded to be released to the public.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.230
If it was with conditions met, he promised
to stop his bombings.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.380
In September 1995, it was published in the
New York Times and Washington Post.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.130
In it, he derides that the industrial revolution
has been a “disaster for the human race”

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.000
and calls for a “revolution against technology.”

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.670
Additionally, he provides this phrase: “As
for the negative consequences of eliminating

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.820
industrial society — well, you can’t eat
your cake and have it too — to gain one

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.480
thing you have to sacrifice another.”

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.850
Upon seeing this phrasing in the morning paper,
David Kaczynski finally decided his wife might

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.040
be right and his brother really might be the
Unabomber.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.440
For their whole lives, their mother would
correct them and insist that this was the

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.470
correct usage of the phrase.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.700
This and other similarities in Ted’s writing
style and his political beliefs, convinced

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.150
David he needed to speak up.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.180
David passed this information, along with
old family letters demonstrating Ted’s writing

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.471
style, to the FBI who employed forensic linguistics
to compare the manifesto to other pieces of

00:05:42.471 --> 00:05:44.620
writing Ted had given to his family.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.190
This information, and other stylistic evidence,
convinced a judge to submit a search warrant.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.140
On April 3, 1996, Ted Kaczynski was arrested
by the FBI at his cabin deep in the woods

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.150
of Montana.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.820
His own demand to be heard did him in.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:15.569
As the Unabomber would say, you can’t eat
your cake and have it too.
