00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.270
 These books go on this ring. How is it discovered and (spoiler alert) how it is destroyed. 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.170
 While Tolkien created the largest and most consistent fictional universe, he did not mind being 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.450
 Sometimes imprecise - so if you've finished the story and hate yourself: wait, what can you do? 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.409
 and where do you see this ring? This is your video. 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:20.599
 First the first: The Unique Ring is not the only ring - it is the Lord of the Ring * s *, 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:22.699
 after all - and this man is Sauron. 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.179
 Long before the story began, Sauron disguised himself and visited the elves to work 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.779
 with his master craftsman Celebrimbor to forge the rings of power. Together they did 16 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.710
 called the lower rings, then Celebrimbor took Sauron's formula and made three of his own 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.000
 which ended up being more powerful than the original 16. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.910
 Why make rings based on the suggestion of a stranger whose abstract has a lapse of one thousand years? 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.530
 Because he promised that the rings would fix the elves' biggest problem: this world is running out of energy. 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.440
 The amount of greatness, genius and magic decreases as the time goes by. 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.350
 For the elves, magical and immortal creatures, this is bad news. Sauron told them that the rings would keep 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.540
 what their carriers matter more to them. That's why the ethnic regiments are so great 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.960
 Compared with the rest of the world, their rings have been preserved. 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.810
 Unlike what the famous poem implies, the elves made all the rings for themselves with the intention of 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.539
 give exactly 0 to men and dwarves, from whom they think they are smelly - 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.479
 that's obviously something was wrong. What brings us again to the Unique Ring to govern them all. 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.280
 Sauron's main skill is to master the minds of others - that's why 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.409
 able to control both large armies in part - and secretly created this ring for 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.939
 Concentrate its power in some way - this formula to build rings, unknown to Celebrimbor, 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.649
 He also made the carriers of the nineteen most vulnerable rings. 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.179
 Basically: the Unique Ring increases its attack and the other rings reduce its defense. 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.119
 Plan A was to control a handful of high level elves. But when the One Ring was put 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.249
 The basic starting level allowed them to withstand and remove the rings just in time. 

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:49.340
 Sauron captured Celebrimbor and tortured him until he gave him the 16 lower rings - 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.079
 But he died before revealing who protected the three most powerful. 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:58.359
 So Sauron now had 16 rings to control the mind and had to throw towards plan B: the dwarves. 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:02.069
 Sauron handled seven rings in the hands of the dwarves but that was not the case either 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.499
 rotted well - Dwarves are rudimentary creatures that Sauron found impossible to control. 

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:11.330
 But the rings were not great help to the dwarves, who loved wealth above all things 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.830
 reason why the rings caused that their treasures grew sufficient enough to attract dragons that the dwarves ate 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.910
 and his precious rings. 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.040
 Finally, in the hands of men, always the corruptible species, the rings worked as expected: Sauron 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.750
 he controlled his minds. And, as mortals, they valued their lives above all else, rather than the rings 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.070
 they extended for thousands of years. It lengthened them so long that men turned into invisible spectra. 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.280
 In any way, this plan of domination does not go unnoticed, there is a great war - Sauron is defeated 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.390
 and the Single Ring is dissipated, it is lost. 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.370
 But the Unique Ring is rogue. He has an own mind and wants to return to Sauron, 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.570
 which brings us back to his powers. 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.790
 First: the ring seduces everyone (good, almost everyone) with the promise that yes, this small 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.260
 Ring can be a powerful weapon or a tool to remodel the world, and my mother, you are not you 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.070
 the best person to use it? Let's defeat the powerful demigod who lives there 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.980
 to start, do not you think? Hmmm? 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.730
 That is why the Hobbits are great ring carriers: because they are very happy as things are 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.820
 They are and do not aspire to greatness. Of course, there is Gollum who started out as a Hobbit, 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.990
 but if we consider that it has a couple of hundreds of years it is kept quite good. 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.620
 Put the ring on a table and most men would not be able to finish it 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.470
 Coffee before going to Mordor to master the world and do it right this time. 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.410
 It's worth considering that the promises of the Unique Ring are lies - no one could 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.830
 to overthrow Sauron with him really. The Ring just wants to deceive the carrier to be found 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.420
 which brings us to ... 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.200
 Invisibility 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.580
 What is outside the minds of the characters, is the only tangible power that the ring exposes 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.120
 the rest - The invisibility seems great, but while you love that troll 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.540
 Shines like a fanalet in the hidden world, in which they also conceal spectrums with a ring 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.730
 You can easily see them. 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.470
 To sum up: 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.210
 The Unique Ring a) It makes you invisible in the most useless way 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.860
 b) He is probably full of lies because 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.790
 c) It is a part of Sauron and works for him. 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.340
 He is so connected that his destruction eliminates him forever more. But the formula binds 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.569
 the Unique Ring with the rest. So when it is destroyed, so are the others. 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:06.010
 That's why the elves are so serious. The victory over Sauron also means that the rings do not 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.690
 They will preserve more their reins, and everything will be reduced. These books are the end 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.040
 of the age of magic and the beginning of the age of men. 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.790
