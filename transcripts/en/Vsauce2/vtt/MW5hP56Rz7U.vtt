00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.570
This 3D Printed tracheal implant saved this
baby's life.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.570
And some cockroaches have evolved to avoid
poison traps that use sugary bait.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:11.969
So yeah.

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:12.969
Vsauce!

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:18.350
Kevin here - this is Mind Blow

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.880
This robot tells you if you have bad breath.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.150
Developed by CrazyLabo and the Kitakyushu
National College of Technology the humanoid

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.410
responds to the smell of your breath with
phrases like "it smells like citrus" - and

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.790
it works by using gas sensors that create
a chemical footprint which can be matched

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.449
to specific odors.

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.930
There's also a robot dog that will smell your
feet.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.069
While these are novel applications - they
have more serious ones for this technology

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:48.359
down the road in medical fields.

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.870
Cosmologists believe they've found the first
hard evidence of multiple universes.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.999
Data from the Plank Satellite of cosmic radiation
shows large cold spots where according to

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:01.229
our understanding of physics shouldn't exist.

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.900
Theoretical Physicist Dr. Mersini-Houghton
believes the anomalies are caused by other

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.160
universes pulling on our universe as it formed
during the Big Bang and while many scientists

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.930
are skeptical of other universes these unexplained
features of the map will at the least require

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.890
new physics to be understood according to
the European Space Agency.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.590
Tracking Point has developed a interface similar
to a fighter jet display for their precision

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.440
guided firearms.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.140
It not only displays information like range,
wind speed and shot angle but allows the user

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.470
to lock onto the target with a desired impact
point.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.820
Critics say it takes the fair chase principle
away from hunting and other wonder if this

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.300
technology should be in the hands of civilians
and they range in price from 17 to $22,000.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.150
Newly discovered mini-spider from china

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.050
Antiquity music has developed the Wheelharp
a chamber string orchestra keyboard.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.120
It allows you to play 61 bowed strings - there
are currently four prototypes and they're

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:10.610
crowd funding the project right now - here's
what it sounds like...

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.260
Seal is a wearable swim monitoring system
that warns parents and lifeguards if someone

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.350
is drowning.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.330
The neck band has four levels of alert that
can be set depending on the experience of

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.770
the swimmer and when in danger it sends a
warning signal or full alarm to the monitoring

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.770
hub.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.050
Find the link below for more...

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.610
Bare Conductive has created electrically conductive
paint.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.750
It allows you to apply paints to walls and
other surfaces that enable a kind of liquid

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.750
wiring.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.090
It's non-toxic and can be used for simple
things like turn on lights or creating interactive

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.520
art or posters.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.520
Hot.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.520
Pink.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.520
Slug.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.790
Mobile eye visions technologies is developing
a camera-only autonomous driving system that

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.319
uses just a few hundred dollars worth of materials.

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.410
While not as advanced as the self-driving
google car it uses technology currently seen

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.380
in Volvos that predict and react to pedestrians
and cyclists and they have plans to introduce

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.150
more advanced systems by 2016.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.300
Finally, Sonic Water is a cymatics installation
visualizing sound and vibration with the music

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:17.040
of Kymat...

00:03:17.040 --> 00:04:04.260
I'm gonna leave you with a 3D printed robot
that plays pool and as always - thanks for

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:18.440
watching.
