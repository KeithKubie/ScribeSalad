00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.000
In order to make a diet soda (at least one
people would popularly drink), a sugar substitute

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.730
was needed. The first such artificial sweetener,
saccharin, was discovered by accident. In

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.180
the late 19th century, Constantin Fahlberg,
after a long day working at the lab of the

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.029
famed chemist Ira Remsen in Baltimore, Maryland,
was at home eating dinner when he picked up

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.349
a roll and bit into it. The roll was incredibly
sweet. Fahlberg continued with his meal, soon

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.880
realizing it wasn’t just the roll that was
sweet, it was everything his hand touched.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.260
He had, quite literally, brought his work
home with him, with some compound from that

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.769
day’s experiments on his hands. (Yes, the
first non-toxic artificial sweetener was discovered

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.860
because a scientist didn’t wash his hands
after getting chemicals all over them- not

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.749
unlike how the effects of LSD were discovered.)

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:53.370
According to his statement to the Baltimore
Sun, when he returned to his lab, he “proceeded

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.640
to taste the contents of every beaker and
evaporating dish on the lab table. Luckily

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.059
for me, none contained any corrosive or poisonous
liquid.” Finally, he discovered what had

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.410
been on his hands: a substance from an overheated
beaker “in which o-sulfobenzoic acid had

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.940
reacted with phosphorus (V) chloride and ammonia,
producing benzoic sulfinide.” Fahlberg and

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.100
Remsen jointly published a paper together
describing the “saccharin synthesis” process,

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.150
but neither of them initially really understood
or knew the potential it had for commercial

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.150
use.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.150
Through the early 20th century, saccharin’s
popularity as a sugar substitute grew. It

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.400
was cheap, easy to make, and very sweet- approximately
200-700 times sweeter than sugar, ounce for

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.750
ounce. Plus, at least according to initial
tests, it had no adverse side effects. In

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.810
fact, doctors started prescribing saccharin
as a catch-all treatment, for things like

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.490
headaches, nausea, etc.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.070
However, it was not without its detractors.
For instance, President Teddy Roosevelt had

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.420
a row with the Department of Agriculture’s
head chemist, Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.161
over saccharin. Wiley was staunchly against
the substance, stating it was a “a coal

00:01:57.161 --> 00:02:02.180
tar product totally devoid of food value and
extremely injurious to health.”

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.440
Roosevelt reportedly said of this, “Anyone
who says saccharin is injurious to health

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.470
is an idiot. Dr. Rixey (Roosevelt’s personal
physician) gives it to me every day.”(Needless

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.290
to say, Wiley soon lost much of his credibility
and his job.)

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.519
Due to sugar rationing in both World War I
and World War II, saccharin use increased

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.959
and it became a very common ingredient in
various product in both the United States

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:25.959
and Europe.

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.489
However, by the 1950s, saccharin started declining
in popularity. Research began indicating that

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.769
large doses of saccharin led to bladder tumors
and cancer in mice. Later, it was revealed

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.939
that high PH levels found in mice, and not
humans, reacted differently with saccharin

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:46.819
than human body chemistry. Once the exact
cause of the tumors was determined, exhaustive

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.670
tests were done to see if the same thing was
happening with primates. In the end, the results

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.420
came up completely and overwhelmingly negative.
(Thanks to this, in 2000, saccharin was removed

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.730
from U.S. National Toxicology Program’s
list of substances that might cause cancer.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.060
The next year, both the state of California
and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.609
removed it from their list of cancer causing
substances. In 2010, the Environmental Protection

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.700
Agency concurred, stating that “saccharin
is no longer considered a potential hazard

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.969
to human health.”)

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:21.719
But being a supposed cancer causing agent
wasn’t the only issue with saccharin as

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:27.319
a sugar substitute, it also left a metallic
taste in people’s mouths, leading to other

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.620
sugar substitutes being developed. People
still had a sweet tooth, but didn’t want

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.189
the calories and other potential issues with
sugar.

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:39.659
This all brings us to the first diet soda,
No-Cal.

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:44.400
In 1904, Hyman Kirsch opened his first soda
store in the Williamsburg neighborhood of

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.689
Brooklyn. An immigrant from Crimea, Kirsch
thought his primarily Jewish neighborhood

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:52.749
would be delighted by the fruit-flavored seltzer
he used to make while still in the old country.

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:56.959
He was right and Kirsch Beverages Inc. was
born. (Incidentally, “Kirsch” is Yiddish

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:03.590
and it loosely translates to “juices of
black morello cherries.” So, naturally their

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.169
signature flavor was black cherry.)

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:10.610
This regional soda sold well enough to provide
Kirsch and his family a small fortune. He

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.010
became a prominent member of his community
and nearly fifty years later, helped found

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.699
the Jewish Sanitarium for Chronic Disease
in Brooklyn, New York. (It is still there

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.700
today, now known as the Kingsbrook Jewish
Medical Center).

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.320
What does this have to do with diet soda?
While vice-president at this institution,

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.440
Kirsch noticed that many of the patients at
the Jewish Sanitarium were diabetic. Considering

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.990
he was a soda man, he wanted to provide a
sweet treat for these patients by creating

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.050
a beverage that was sugar-free. However, he
didn’t want to use saccharine to sweeten,

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.490
for the reasons mentioned above. So, as explained
in a 1953 New York Times article about him

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.780
and his son Morris, the two

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.259
“got together in their own laboratories
with Dr. S. S. Epstein, their research man,

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:58.680
and explored the field of synthetic sweeteners.
Saccharin and other chemical sweeteners left

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.199
a metallic aftertaste. Then, from a commercial
laboratory, they got cyclamate calcium, and

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:10.080
No-Cal was accepted by the diabetic and those
with cardiovascular illnesses who could not

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.620
tolerate salts in the sanitarium.”

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.909
No-Cal, of course meaning “no calories,”
was born.

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:20.970
At first, they only offered a mild ginger
ale flavor and sold it at dietetic counters.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.889
Soon, they realized it wasn’t just diabetics
who were buying the soda, but people who wanted

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:29.590
a tasty carbonated beverage, but none of the
calories that normally go with it. They initially

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.849
diversified to two other flavors, root beer
and their traditional black cherry, and then

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:39.699
later added lime, cola, and chocolate flavors.
They started marketing it to “weight-conscious”

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:43.159
women, with ads featuring a woman attempting
to zip up a skirt with the words, “Time

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:49.349
to Switch to No-Cal. Absolutely Non-Fattening.”
By the end of 1953, mere months after introducing

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:54.700
the drink to diabetic patients, the soda was
pacing for five million dollars per year in

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.090
sales (about $42 million today).

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.220
Canada Dry was the next company to get involved
in the diet soda craze. They put a no calorie

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.599
ginger ale on the market called “Glamour”
(also pretty obviously aimed at women) in

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:13.250
1954. Between No-Cal and Glamour, by 1957,
over 120 million bottles of diet soda were

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.949
being sold per year.

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:20.360
In 1958, Royal Crown Cola got into the game
and introduced Diet Rite. As was the case

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.409
initially with No-Cal, the cola was aimed
at diabetics and was sold at medical supply

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:30.320
stores. Three years later, in 1961, Diet-Rite
appeared on Chicago grocery shelves and diet

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.430
cola became the new fad there. One year later,
Diet-Rite was being sold across the country.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.280
The biggest soda companies, Coca-Cola and
Pepsi, rushed to develop their own diet colas

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:46.419
– Coca-Cola’s Tab and Pepsi’s Patio
Cola. By 1965, diet cola accounted for 15%

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:49.120
of the entire soft drink market.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.850
With the major players now in the game, Kirsch’s
No-Cal rapidly faded to nothing in market

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.590
share, but not before starting a revolution
in carbonated beverage drinks.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.870
According to Tristan Donovan’s book Fizz:
How Soda Shook Up the World, the name Tab

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.150
was picked at random. After being warned by
the company’s lawyers that naming a sugar-free,

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.289
no calorie soda “Diet Coca-Cola” would
somehow undermine the trademark, Coca-Cola

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:17.349
executives programmed an IBM 1401 computer
to randomly spit out three and four letter

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:21.560
word combinations. After a list of 250,000
names, the company finally settled on Tab.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.570
Saccharin should technically be referred to
as, “anhydroorthosulphaminebenzoic acid.”

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:29.469
Fahlberg picked something different for obvious
reasons. The name chosen, saccharin, is derived

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:34.400
from the word, “saccharine” meaning “of
or resembling sugar.” This ultimately derived

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.750
from the Latin “saccharon,” meaning “sugar,”
which itself ultimately derived from the Sanskrit

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:45.870
“sarkara,” meaning “gravel, grit.”
The artificial sweetener in No-Cal was also

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:50.050
discovered by accident. This time, it was
Michael Sveda of the University of Illinois

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:54.520
who under normal circumstances might have
done better to be careful about what he was

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.030
ingesting. Sveda claimed he was smoking while
working on synthesizing anti-fever medicine

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:03.180
when he set his cigarette down for a moment.
In the process, the cigarette came in contact

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.560
with a substance on his lab bench. When he
put the cigarette back in his mouth, it tasted

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:31.319
extremely sweet. After doing a little investigation,
he discovered the substance

00:08:31.319 --> 00:08:36.339
was calcium cyclamate, aka sodium cyclamate.
