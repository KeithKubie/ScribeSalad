00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.060
The best answer is the second one here.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.050
The argument goes like this.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.940
As I stated in the hint,
the longest representation of a number

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.390
after i steps is order n plus i.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.650
Addition can lengthen the binary
representation of a number

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.690
by at most one bit.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.560
Next, observe that the total number
of symbols used, let's say l,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.780
increases by at most order ri
as the i step is simulated.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.930
We might get this increase by writing
a number to the random access device

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.410
to a location that we
haven't written to before.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.640
Thus, after step j,
the total number of symbols used,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.913
is going to be order n + j squared.

00:00:43.913 --> 00:00:48.800
Finally, each step only takes a constant
number of passes over the symbols used

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.542
on the tape, so

00:00:49.542 --> 00:00:54.750
we can bound the total number of steps
with this sum here, to get the result.
