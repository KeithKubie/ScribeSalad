00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:02.156
Narrator: We've talked a lot about

00:00:02.156 --> 00:00:04.781
aggregate demand over the last few videos,

00:00:04.781 --> 00:00:06.354
so in this video, I thought I would talk

00:00:06.354 --> 00:00:08.902
a little bit about aggregate supply.

00:00:08.902 --> 00:00:10.447
In particular, we're going to think about

00:00:10.447 --> 00:00:12.993
aggregate supply in the long-run.

00:00:12.993 --> 00:00:15.556
In economics, whether
it's in micro or macro

00:00:15.556 --> 00:00:17.132
economics, when we think about long-run,

00:00:17.132 --> 00:00:19.017
we're thinking about
enough time for a lot of

00:00:19.017 --> 00:00:22.419
fixed costs and a lot of
fixed contracts to expire.

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.407
In the short-term, you
might be stuck into some

00:00:24.407 --> 00:00:28.033
labor contract, or stuck
into your using some factory

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:30.551
that you've already paid
money for, so it was a fixed

00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:33.269
cost, but over the long-run
you'll have a chance that

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:34.860
factory will wear down
and you'll have a chance

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.590
to decide whether you
want another factory or

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.120
the price of the factory might change;

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.813
or in the long-run, you'll have a chance

00:00:39.813 --> 00:00:41.681
contracts will expire,
and you'll have a chance

00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:44.164
to renegotiate those
contracts at a new price.

00:00:44.164 --> 00:00:45.931
That's what we really mean

00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:47.839
when we talk about the long-run.

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.456
I'm going to plot aggregate
supply on the same axis

00:00:51.456 --> 00:00:54.155
as we plotted aggregate
demand, and we're going

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:55.777
to focus on the long-run
now, and then we're going

00:00:55.777 --> 00:00:57.107
to think about what
actually might happen in the

00:00:57.107 --> 00:01:00.258
short-run while we are
in fixed-price contracts,

00:01:00.258 --> 00:01:02.065
or we already have spent
money on something,

00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:04.433
or we have already, in
some ways, there are sticky

00:01:04.433 --> 00:01:06.598
things that can't adjust as quickly.

00:01:06.598 --> 00:01:08.500
But, we'll first focus on the long-run.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.202
On this axis, I'm just
going to plot price, and

00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:12.797
remember, we're thinking
in macro-economic terms.

00:01:12.797 --> 00:01:15.387
This is some measure of the prices

00:01:15.387 --> 00:01:17.762
of the goods and services in our economy.

00:01:17.762 --> 00:01:19.322
This axis right over here,

00:01:19.322 --> 00:01:24.685
the horizontal axis is
going to be real GDP.

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:26.401
Once again, this is just
a model, you should take

00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:29.639
everything in economics
with a huge grain of salt.

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:31.803
These are over-simplifications
of a highly,

00:01:31.803 --> 00:01:33.838
highly complex thing, the economy.

00:01:33.838 --> 00:01:35.154
Millions and millions of actors doing

00:01:35.154 --> 00:01:37.513
complex things, human
beings, each of them and

00:01:37.513 --> 00:01:39.749
their brain have billions
and billions and billions

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:42.534
of neurons, doing all sorts
of unpredictable things.

00:01:42.534 --> 00:01:43.755
But economists like to make

00:01:43.755 --> 00:01:46.818
really simplifying,
super-simplifying assumptions,

00:01:46.818 --> 00:01:49.425
so that we can deal with
it in a attractable way,

00:01:49.425 --> 00:01:51.846
and in a even dealing
in a mathematical way.

00:01:51.846 --> 00:01:54.608
The assumtion that economists often make

00:01:54.608 --> 00:01:56.123
when we think about aggregate supply

00:01:56.123 --> 00:01:57.781
and aggregate demand is, in the long-run,

00:01:57.781 --> 00:02:00.686
real GDP actually does
not depend on prices

00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:03.175
in the long-run; so, what you have is,

00:02:03.175 --> 00:02:04.967
regardless of what the
price is, you're going

00:02:04.967 --> 00:02:06.815
to have the same real GDP.

00:02:06.815 --> 00:02:09.709
You can view this as a natural level

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.712
of productivity for the economy.

00:02:11.712 --> 00:02:13.641
This is some level right over here.

00:02:13.641 --> 00:02:15.003
It's important to realize this is just

00:02:15.003 --> 00:02:18.263
a snap shot in time, and this
is all else things equal,

00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:20.579
so we're not assuming that
we're having changes in

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.196
productivity overtime;
this is just a snap shot if

00:02:24.196 --> 00:02:26.127
we did have any of those
things that change.

00:02:26.127 --> 00:02:30.125
For example, if the population
increased, then that

00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:33.725
would cause this level to
shift to the right, then

00:02:33.725 --> 00:02:36.446
we would have a higher
natural level of productivity.

00:02:36.446 --> 00:02:39.354
If, for whatever reason, we
were able to create tools

00:02:39.354 --> 00:02:42.391
so that it was easier to
find people jobs, there's

00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:44.688
always a natural rate of unemployment.

00:02:44.688 --> 00:02:46.502
There's frictions, people
have to look for jobs,

00:02:46.502 --> 00:02:48.702
some people have to retrain
to get their skills,

00:02:48.702 --> 00:02:50.573
but maybe we improve
that in some way so that

00:02:50.573 --> 00:02:52.614
there's some website
where people can find jobs

00:02:52.614 --> 00:02:54.728
easier, or easier ways to train for jobs,

00:02:54.728 --> 00:02:56.365
and the natural level of
unemployment goes down,

00:02:56.365 --> 00:02:58.050
more people can produce, that would also

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.257
shift this curve to the right.

00:03:00.257 --> 00:03:02.603
You could have a reality where there's

00:03:02.603 --> 00:03:06.043
technological improvements
that would also,

00:03:06.043 --> 00:03:07.358
and then all of a sudden, on an average,

00:03:07.358 --> 00:03:09.006
people would become more productive;

00:03:09.006 --> 00:03:10.817
that could shift things to the right.

00:03:10.817 --> 00:03:13.224
You could have discovery
of natural resources,

00:03:13.224 --> 00:03:15.830
new land that is super
fertile, and everything else;

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.083
that could also shift things to the right.

00:03:18.083 --> 00:03:20.967
You could have a war, and maybe your

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:25.651
factories get bombed, or
bad things happen in a war,

00:03:25.651 --> 00:03:27.954
especially if the war is on your soil,

00:03:27.954 --> 00:03:32.210
and that could actually
shift things to the left.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.917
So, it's important to realize
that this is just taking

00:03:33.917 --> 00:03:35.552
a snap shot in time, and a lot of these

00:03:35.552 --> 00:03:37.489
other things that we
think about would just

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.579
shift it in 1 direction or another.

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.454
I'm going to leave you
there, and this is a kind of

00:03:44.454 --> 00:03:46.278
it might not seem
intuitive at first, because

00:03:46.278 --> 00:03:48.517
you're saying, "Wait, look,
if prices were to change

00:03:48.517 --> 00:03:50.062
dramatically, if all of a
sudden everything in the

00:03:50.062 --> 00:03:52.387
economy got twice as
expensive, that would have

00:03:52.387 --> 00:03:54.901
some impact on peoples'
minds and that they would

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:58.696
behave differently and all
the rest, and that might

00:03:58.696 --> 00:04:01.182
affect how much they can produce."

00:04:01.182 --> 00:04:02.264
We did think a little
about that when we thought

00:04:02.264 --> 00:04:04.130
about aggregate demand, but when we think

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.018
about aggregate supply,
we're just thinking

00:04:06.018 --> 00:04:07.859
about their capability to produce.

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.317
We're saying all else equal.

00:04:09.317 --> 00:04:10.735
We're saying that peoples'
mind-shifts aren't

00:04:10.735 --> 00:04:13.948
changing, their willingness
to work isn't changing,

00:04:13.948 --> 00:04:16.330
nothing else is changing,
technology isn't changing.

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.267
Given that, price really
is just a numeric thing.

00:04:19.267 --> 00:04:20.930
If you just looked at the resources

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.125
and the productive
capability of a country,

00:04:23.125 --> 00:04:25.632
the factors of production,
the people and all the rest,

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:28.980
regardless of what the
prices are, they in theory,

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.788
should be able to produce the same level

00:04:30.788 --> 00:04:33.861
of goods and services.
