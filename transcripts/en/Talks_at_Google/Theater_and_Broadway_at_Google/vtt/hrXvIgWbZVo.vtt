00:00:00.994 --> 00:00:04.473
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.772
ANNIE WILKES: I am your
number one fan, I sure am.

00:00:37.772 --> 00:00:40.860
And trust me, there
ain't no number two.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.337
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.140
ALAN SEALES: Whoo!

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.640
All right.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.970
So it would probably
be easiest here

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.770
if you-- let's start with
you, Michael, on the end.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.920
Just go down the line here
and introduce yourselves.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.445
MARK KAUFMAN: Mark Kaufman.

00:01:15.445 --> 00:01:16.040
ALAN SEALES: Oh, Mark.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.540
Sorry.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.150
MARK KAUFMAN: No-- producer.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.270
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN: Michael
Friedman, composer.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.420
LEON ADDISON BROWN: Leon
Addison Brown, actor.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.190
LAURIE METCALF: Laurie
Metcalf, act-- or.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.207
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:25.207 --> 00:01:26.290
WILL FREARS: Are you sure?

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.482
LAURIE METCALF: Yes, I am sure.

00:01:28.482 --> 00:01:29.940
WILL FREARS: Will
Frears, director.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.710
ALAN SEALES: Laurie, you were
covering your ears during that.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.060
Is that--

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.476
LAURIE METCALF: I had to be
tapped to walk up on the stage

00:01:34.476 --> 00:01:37.860
because I was bent over like
that with my ears covered.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.130
Because I can't
watch any of that.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.580
Because it's very
distressing to me.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.330
ALAN SEALES: Does it
scare you to watch it

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.829
as much as it scares
the rest of us?

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.080
LAURIE METCALF:
No, it's not scary.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.432
I can't watch myself--

00:01:50.432 --> 00:01:51.390
ALAN SEALES: Oh, right.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.931
LAURIE METCALF:
--because in my head,

00:01:52.931 --> 00:01:55.530
it looks completely different
than what that just is.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.439
So I can't see it.

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.480
ALAN SEALES: Interesting.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.780
So you've had a very
versatile career.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.579
I mean, you've been
in many movies, lots

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.370
of television, "Roseanne,"
of course, where

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.491
you won three Emmy awards.

00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:09.949
Numerous theater
productions, where

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:11.610
you got two Tony nominations.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.440
And you're even the voice of
Andy's mom in the "Toy Story"

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.720
movies, which I was
very happy to discover.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.295
Is there any particular genre
that you like more than others?

00:02:21.295 --> 00:02:22.560
LAURIE METCALF: Oh,
yeah, theater, by far.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.830
ALAN SEALES: Really?

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.990
LAURIE METCALF: Yeah.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.910
Maybe it's because I
came up in theater,

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.340
with Steppenwolf
Theatre in Chicago,

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.290
and we're in our 40th
season, I think, now.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.150
And so I started
there, and that's

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.570
where I learned-- I like the
instant gratification of being

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.270
in front of a live audience.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.570
And I like the rehearsal
process very much.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.520
I like the three, four weeks
spent in a rehearsal room

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.850
really hammering out things.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.160
And I like the run of the show.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.440
It's all really
different skill sets,

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.820
but I much prefer theater.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.445
ALAN SEALES: Wow, so you've been
through the rehearsal process.

00:02:57.445 --> 00:03:00.990
So with movies, I don't imagine
you rehearse the whole thing

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.629
all at once.

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:02.420
LAURIE METCALF: No.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.150
ALAN SEALES: So you rehearse.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.640
You go in, and you're like,
oh, here are my lines.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.540
You've usually got them
in your back pocket.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.850
LAURIE METCALF: Exactly.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.560
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.220
And you rehearse it.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.553
LAURIE METCALF: You do it out
of order, out of sequence.

00:03:10.553 --> 00:03:13.710
You're shooting the very last
scene of the movie first.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.650
ALAN SEALES: So is that a
challenge for a show like

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.240
"Misery," where you're on stage
pretty much 90% of the time,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.740
I would say?

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.948
LAURIE METCALF: Yes, we get
on the "Misery-go-round,"

00:03:22.948 --> 00:03:25.550
and we don't get off
for an hour and a half.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.244
ALAN SEALES: A literal go-round.

00:03:27.244 --> 00:03:28.660
Yeah, I want to
come back to that.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.990
The set is phenomenal.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.050
But approaching the character of
Annie Wilkes, your crazy number

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.980
one fan obsession person,
I mean, she's nuts.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.016
Do you have any personal
sympathy for her?

00:03:42.016 --> 00:03:43.140
LAURIE METCALF: Yeah, I do.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.050
I have a lot of sympathy.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.300
That's what attracted
me to the part.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.780
Because I was looking for-- we
were just talking about it--

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.400
the heart of the character,
because there has to be.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.970
It can't just be
labeled a "monster."

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.270
And so there are very
few tiny, tiny hints

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.510
in the script of maybe the
way that she was brought up,

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.070
maybe her relationship
to her mother,

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.720
her relationship to her
miserable stepfather,

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.290
as she just fleetingly mentions.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.980
The fact that she deals
with Bruce's character

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.000
in a certain way, everything
is very black and white.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.750
There's a scene
where she makes him--

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.950
it's kind of like washing
his mouth out with soap

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.380
and drink this water.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.220
But to me, it just always was
about how she was brought up.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:38.890
And so that she wasn't born
this person that is abusive.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.730
And there's a back history
that's hinted at that.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.820
When you see it,
hopefully, you forgive

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.257
her a lot of her craziness.

00:04:50.257 --> 00:04:51.840
ALAN SEALES: Yeah,
it was weird for me

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.360
to watch because at
first-- I'm going

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.500
to try to talk without
giving away any spoilers.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.075
Because you guys have
to go see the show.

00:04:59.075 --> 00:04:59.950
At first, I thought--

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:00.640
LAURIE METCALF:
But don't everybody

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.890
know-- doesn't most-- what's the
majority of people that know,

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.390
I mean, what happens?

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.370
ALAN SEALES: Who's seen
the movie or read the book?

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.785
OK, I guess that
is the majority.

00:05:09.785 --> 00:05:11.335
LAURIE METCALF: Most.

00:05:11.335 --> 00:05:13.460
ALAN SEALES: I had not seen
either-- seen the movie

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.990
or read the book-- so I
went in completely fresh.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.330
And--

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.266
LAURIE METCALF: That's
got to be disturbing.

00:05:20.266 --> 00:05:21.682
ALAN SEALES: Yes,
that's why I was

00:05:21.682 --> 00:05:24.340
so excited to talk to you
guys, because I'm still

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.614
disturbed for many reasons.

00:05:26.614 --> 00:05:28.530
And Leon, we'll get to
your scene in a second.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.180
God, it scared the
shit out of me.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.350
Excuse me, Spencer.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.145
Yeah, so your character
gets so manic.

00:05:37.145 --> 00:05:42.330
And at first, I was very
sympathetic with her.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.750
And I was like, oh,
OK, she means well.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:46.940
She's very, very nice.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.027
And then it's just like,
well, that escalated quickly.

00:05:50.027 --> 00:05:52.110
Again, I don't know want
to give away the spoilers

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.360
for those who haven't seen it.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.940
But they're like
disfiguration, right?

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.140
That's not a spoiler.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.440
You've got to go see it.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.705
So how did you
approach this from sort

00:06:04.705 --> 00:06:07.140
of a character leveling,
emotional leveling perspective?

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.120
LAURIE METCALF: Yeah,
you do have to plot.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.230
It has to ramp up.

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.240
You can't just go full--

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.240
ALAN SEALES: Full crazy?

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.698
LAURIE METCALF:
Full crazy-- right,

00:06:14.698 --> 00:06:17.770
right-- right out of the gate.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.080
There are some entry level
drugs that get to the--

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:28.880
but the mania, I think,
comes from her out

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.430
of proportion fandom for
this particular writer.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.160
And so the times where she
is rewarded with something--

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.860
hearing that he's got
another book coming out, or--

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.630
ALAN SEALES: Forcing
it to happen?

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.280
LAURIE METCALF: And so
those are the times where

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.020
she spikes up in the mania.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:57.070
And another time is when
he's been doing some writing.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.220
And he has said that her
favorite character, Misery

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.950
Chastain, now comes
from nobility, which she

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.280
knew all the time [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.180
And then there's another
spike of rolling around

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.260
on the bed like a crazy person.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:15.030
So those are the
fun mania moments.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.599
And then there are others
that are not so fun for him.

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:19.390
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.770
So working with
director Will Frears,

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.060
how much of the
character of Annie

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.170
did you bring to
the table combined

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.410
with what Laurie brought?

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.000
WILL FREARS: I mean,
I don't think--

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.550
I like to think we
sort of-- I mean,

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.633
mostly I listen to Laurie
because she's brilliant,

00:07:34.633 --> 00:07:37.190
and I try not to get in her way.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.070
We talk a lot.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.330
I mean, as we were
getting started,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.370
we would spend hours
together talking about it,

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:47.150
talking where we agreed,
where we disagreed,

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.010
where we saw things.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.320
And one of the great
pleasures of the whole thing

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:56.550
is that it's been astonishing
to watch Laurie take what

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.710
is a sort of iconic figure
in a particular thing

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:03.010
and sort of reinvent it
entirely as she sees her,

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:05.886
and to find this incredible
kind of sympathy.

00:08:05.886 --> 00:08:07.510
I think the thing we
agreed on, always,

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.301
was that she couldn't
be a monster, though.

00:08:09.301 --> 00:08:13.220
We always felt that we had
to look for her humanity

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.200
and that everything she did, we
both, right from the beginning,

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.360
forgave for, and
tried to understand.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.710
And then from there, really, I
think it's been that I've felt

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.440
like, if I'm lucky enough
to have Laurie like that,

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.460
don't get into-- I mean, suggest
and nudge but don't-- to just

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:34.049
try and see what she's doing
and help her illuminate that,

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:38.350
but to very much give her her
head and see where she takes

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:38.851
it.

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:41.266
It's thrilling, and every time
I go back and see the show,

00:08:41.266 --> 00:08:42.696
I'm like, oh, that's a new--

00:08:42.696 --> 00:08:43.093
ALAN SEALES: [CHUCKLES]

00:08:43.093 --> 00:08:44.426
WILL FREARS: --oh, she's clever.

00:08:44.426 --> 00:08:45.340
That's very smart.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:45.760
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.718
WILL FREARS: It's really
exciting to come back.

00:08:47.718 --> 00:08:50.704
I've become such a fan that
I go back as Annie Wilkes.

00:08:50.704 --> 00:08:53.120
ALAN SEALES: Is that unusual
to be a fan of your own show?

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.110
WILL FREARS: I'm not
a fan of my show.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.943
I'm a fan of Laurie.

00:08:54.943 --> 00:08:58.230
They're very-- I'm a fan
of everyone else in it.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.280
I'm not at all a fan--
I sit there and cringe

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.140
for my own work.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.640
And then I think,
oh, they're smart.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.000
Thanks for rescuing me again.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.870
No, part of the
pleasure for this thing

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.630
is this is-- because I
haven't had a show on Broadway

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.000
before-- to watch a show
run this long, for me,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:13.710
is a real treat.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:17.650
And to see Bruce and Laurie
and Leon find new things,

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.370
change things, add nuance,
add meaning, add texture,

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.910
so that every time I go back,
it's things they've found.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.470
It's not at all things that
I have been like, oh, god,

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:27.803
that was such a good idea by me.

00:09:27.803 --> 00:09:31.340
It's watching them investigate
another part of the play,

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.069
find a new beat,
find a different way

00:09:33.069 --> 00:09:33.860
of doing something.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.340
It's just a kind
of-- it's a treat.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.954
Because, as Laurie said at the
beginning, it sort of lives.

00:09:38.954 --> 00:09:40.370
It's a living
organism, and so you

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.410
get to go back and visit it.

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.374
But it's not at all as
a fan-- not a fan of me

00:09:44.374 --> 00:09:46.040
ALAN SEALES: Yeah,
which is, personally,

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.320
why I enjoy doing
theater over film.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.560
Because even though up to
rehearsals, the script changes,

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.870
and whatnot, you lock it in.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.720
But even though it's locked, you
can say the exact same things

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.652
every night and have them mean
completely different things.

00:09:59.652 --> 00:10:00.860
They have different subtexts.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:04.930
So Will, you've been
involved with movies,

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:08.084
both in front of the camera
and behind the camera.

00:10:08.084 --> 00:10:10.500
WILL FREARS: Only once in
front, and I was playing myself.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.864
So it wasn't huge.

00:10:11.864 --> 00:10:14.030
It was interesting that
somebody called me and said,

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.410
will you come play
a theater director?

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:16.130
And I was like, yeah.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:16.580
OK.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:17.788
ALAN SEALES: All right, easy.

00:10:17.788 --> 00:10:19.470
And action.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.350
So you were an actor
and writer and whatnot,

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.433
but you've been doing a
lot of directing recently.

00:10:23.433 --> 00:10:25.760
How did you get
involved with "Misery"?

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.840
WILL FREARS: I got a
call from my agent.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.052
It's a sort of really-- it's
the most traditional story.

00:10:32.052 --> 00:10:33.510
I got a call from
my agent, saying,

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.907
what are you doing next week?

00:10:35.907 --> 00:10:38.490
And I said, well, I'm quite busy
next week, because on Sunday,

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.120
my wife is going into hospital
and we're-- she's going to have

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:41.797
a baby.

00:10:41.797 --> 00:10:42.880
ALAN SEALES: Oh, congrats.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.838
WILL FREARS: Thank you.

00:10:43.838 --> 00:10:45.703
And he said, OK, but
later in the week.

00:10:45.703 --> 00:10:46.699
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:46.699 --> 00:10:48.240
ALAN SEALES: I
[INAUDIBLE] and sleep.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.073
WILL FREARS: Uh-huh.

00:10:49.073 --> 00:10:51.270
And I said, well, could
we do it next week?

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.520
And he said that
there had been a call,

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.340
and could I go and
meet about "Misery."

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.620
And so I sat in the
hospital room at NYU

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.890
with my two-day-old
daughter, and I'm just

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:06.990
reading this book-- trying
to reconcile becoming

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.170
a father with this horror.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:10.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:14.150
ALAN SEALES: Please don't
make it turn out like this.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:18.300
WILL FREARS: And I took
meetings with everyone.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.410
And I took meetings with Mark.

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:22.800
Mark and I had breakfast at
the Brooklyn Diner, I think,

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.000
was where we first sat down.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.150
MARK KAUFMAN: That was
our first meal, yeah.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:29.500
WILL FREARS: And I started
working with Bill Goldman,

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.480
And that was how it started,
and we sort of clicked.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:39.240
And the original draft of the
script was all in projections.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.780
It was all done with
like, she does a thing,

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:46.040
and then an image would
flash on the screen.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.931
And I said to Bill,
I was like, look,

00:11:47.931 --> 00:11:49.680
you don't have to give
me this job at all.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.804
But if you don't do these
things for real on stage,

00:11:51.804 --> 00:11:53.890
the audience is
going to hate you.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.680
There's quite some significant
acts of violence in the play,

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.560
and they were all
done back there.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.050
And I was like, look, if
you don't actually do the--

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:01.100
ALAN SEALES: Like a
silhouette, or something?

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.433
WILL FREARS: No, like a picture.

00:12:02.433 --> 00:12:03.780
Like in still-- like a film.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.680
And I was, like, you have to
do the thing-- for those of you

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.410
who know what the thing
is, you have to do that,

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.200
or they'll hate you for it.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.227
And he went, can
you really do that?

00:12:14.227 --> 00:12:14.935
And I said, yeah.

00:12:14.935 --> 00:12:17.194
And he said, fuck.

00:12:17.194 --> 00:12:18.360
ALAN SEALES: Sorry, Spencer.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.970
WILL FREARS: Sorry--
or not sorry.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:24.470
And that was how
we started working.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:25.970
And so the first
thing we did was we

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.920
took out all these projections
and went on from there.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.880
And that was five years ago.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:32.880
ALAN SEALES: Five years?

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:33.380
Wow.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.593
OK.

00:12:34.593 --> 00:12:35.676
WILL FREARS: Two children.

00:12:35.676 --> 00:12:38.410
ALAN SEALES: So Mark,
I guess five years ago,

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.330
you started this.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.580
Warner Brothers, big studio--
big studio execs sitting here,

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:44.790
right?

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.890
Yes, that's what I
tell myself, and that's

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.260
what you should tell yourself.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.629
And so you got involved.

00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:52.670
We were talking a little
bit at lunch about this.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:56.530
But I want to go into
a little bit more.

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.630
This is the first
show on Broadway

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.460
I've seen where I've realized
that a big movie studioesque

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.480
kind of organization
owned the rights

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.550
and then put it on stage.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.760
So how did Warner
Brothers, in general,

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.390
even get to own the
rights in the first place?

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.750
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN: Well, I'll
go with the quick answers.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.530
First of all, we're sort of
following in the footsteps

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:16.270
of other studios.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.180
Disney, obviously,
started paving the way

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.690
with their shows.

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.340
And Universal's
involved in "Wicked."

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.980
But I actually didn't
put it into development.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.110
I came after it had already
been in development.

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.050
So I was the next
regime who decides,

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:32.350
do things move forward or
do things sort of stop?

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:35.230
And one of the things--
my very first meeting

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:37.089
when I started the
studio was "Misery"

00:13:37.089 --> 00:13:39.380
is in development with Bill
Goldman, who I had actually

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.750
hired for another project,
as a movie studio executive,

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:43.260
to write.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.110
So we had a shorthand.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:48.280
And I met Will, as he said,
at the Brooklyn Diner.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.630
And there was something
about "Misery"

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.820
that I just really loved.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.340
And I always felt-- part
of what I was brought on

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.110
to do when I was
hired at the studio

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:00.920
was to go through the catalog
and see which movie or TV

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.880
projects or cartoons felt
like they belonged on stage.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.440
And "Misery" felt like
such a natural to me.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.420
And I had also this
very interesting story

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.230
with Bill Goldman.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.800
I was in graduate
school, and Bill Goldman

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.050
came to speak to
us about "Misery."

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:19.150
So I had this weird
connection from almost--

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:22.080
it had to be 20-something
years earlier.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.850
And I also had this weird
connection to-- when I grew up,

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:27.670
there was a play
called "Deathtrap"

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:28.890
that I was obsessed with.

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:31.050
And I saw it three, four times.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:33.037
And I always wanted to
do that on Broadway.

00:14:33.037 --> 00:14:34.620
And they don't do
those shows anymore.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.020
So this sort of ticked three
or four different boxes.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.770
I wanted to work with Bill.

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:41.680
I was really taken by Will.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.779
I loved the property.

00:14:42.779 --> 00:14:44.320
I'd seen the movie
and read the book.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.130
And it just felt like a natural
to push forward, and we did.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.920
ALAN SEALES: You
said, Bill Goldman.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.180
William Goldman--

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.020
MARK KAUFMAN: Sorry.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.853
ALAN SEALES: --wrote
the original screenplay

00:14:53.853 --> 00:14:56.200
for the movie with Kathy Bates.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.736
So was it a kind of a
no-brainer to bring him back?

00:14:58.736 --> 00:15:00.360
Because he wrote the
screenplay, right?

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.710
Or wrote the book for this.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:04.670
MARK KAUFMAN: He actually
comes from theater

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.780
before he was in movies.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.040
Years ago, he
wrote, oh, my god, I

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.110
think it was a Kander and
Ebb musical with his brother

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:15.040
James, the happy time
in the late '50s.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.460
And he wrote a bunch
of books about theater.

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:18.980
"Season" is an incredible book.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.840
If anybody hasn't read
it, it's unbelievable.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.100
So he was already hired.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.010
So it was just a matter of
do we continue with him?

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.597
And I was in awe of him
in our first meeting,

00:15:29.597 --> 00:15:31.180
when he was telling
me all the things.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.780
And I have to say,
Will had already

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.660
handled the projection stuff.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.540
So I didn't-- those were so
taken care of by the time I

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:38.270
came on.

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.470
So now, I got the
exciting stuff.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.145
And Bill, when I
remember-- William,

00:15:43.145 --> 00:15:46.377
sorry-- when we had our first
lunch, he was telling me this.

00:15:46.377 --> 00:15:47.960
And I was like a kid
in a candy store.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.730
I was like, oh, my
god, this is great.

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:51.260
And so it just got me excited.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.430
And it was very easy to push it.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:57.095
ALAN SEALES: So were there any
budgetary or licensing hurdles

00:15:57.095 --> 00:15:57.770
to overcome?

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:59.700
Or was it just like,
oh, cool, put it on.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:00.200
Let's do it?

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.616
MARK KAUFMAN: Well, we shared
the rights with Castle Rock.

00:16:02.616 --> 00:16:03.800
It was actually their idea.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.720
Liz Glotzer and
Martin Shafer came

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.810
to Warner Brothers, the
previous regime in theater

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:10.170
to do the play.

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:12.150
So they put it into development.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.802
And so we shared the
rights with them,

00:16:13.802 --> 00:16:15.510
so it was an obvious
thing going forward.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.112
But we also did an out-of-town.

00:16:17.112 --> 00:16:19.570
After we worked on it a little
bit, we went to Bucks County

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:22.440
in Pennsylvania and did an
out-of-town tryout there.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.380
And the response was terrific.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.686
And we also knew-- it set
us on a path of, oh, these

00:16:26.686 --> 00:16:29.550
are the things we need
to do going forward.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.710
And I think we made
great progress.

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:37.750
And you said, when Laurie
and Bruce got into the room

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:41.954
with Will, I mean, they
sat there and talked

00:16:41.954 --> 00:16:42.620
for a long time.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.203
I was not part of
those conversations,

00:16:44.203 --> 00:16:47.100
because they really wanted
to just become that group.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.760
And what came out of it
was incredible and really

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.834
just sort of pushed it further
down the path to Broadway.

00:16:53.834 --> 00:16:54.500
ALAN SEALES: So.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:58.642
I mean, WBTV has
done a lot of stuff.

00:16:58.642 --> 00:17:00.850
And even right now on
Broadway, "The Curious Incident

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:02.350
of the Dog in the
Night-Time" is you guys.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.589
"Bridges of Madison
County," "Elf," the "Charlie

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:06.964
and the Chocolate Factory"
musical that's in London right

00:17:06.964 --> 00:17:09.290
now, that you guys own.

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:13.665
So compared to those--
you keep going on

00:17:13.665 --> 00:17:15.540
about "Misery," about
it was just like, yeah,

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:15.960
it's a no-brainer.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:16.751
We do it, we do it.

00:17:16.751 --> 00:17:19.030
But compared to all of
those, are all of them

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:20.160
that easy to greenlight?

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:20.720
Or were you--

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.040
MARK KAUFMAN: No.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.123
ALAN SEALES: --just coming
in here like, oh, yeah,

00:17:23.123 --> 00:17:24.939
Laurie Metcalf, genius, do it?

00:17:24.939 --> 00:17:27.105
MARK KAUFMAN: By the way,
that was an easy decision.

00:17:27.105 --> 00:17:28.700
Laurie Metcalf, genius, do it.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.950
Yes, that was easy.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:31.250
No, they're not all that easy.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.520
And some are good ideas,
and some are bad ideas,

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.681
and some will get reworked.

00:17:35.681 --> 00:17:37.430
One of the things I
was very excited about

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.512
was we do a lot of musicals.

00:17:39.512 --> 00:17:40.220
We did "Charlie."

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:40.910
We did "Elf."

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:42.535
We were involved with
"Madison County."

00:17:42.535 --> 00:17:45.205
The National Theatre came to
us for "Curious Incident."

00:17:45.205 --> 00:17:48.520
We jumped on that.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.970
We wanted to do something
else after "Misery."

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.030
And we said, all
right, what movie

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:56.287
lends itself to the same--
what is another movie that

00:17:56.287 --> 00:17:57.870
could be turned into
a play that feels

00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:58.974
like it's very theatrical?

00:17:58.974 --> 00:18:00.390
We're not just
doing it because we

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:01.681
want to put something on stage.

00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:04.780
But it really feels like it
would take it a step forward

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.650
by being on stage.

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:08.450
And our next-- we just
announced last week,

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:11.520
we're going to be doing "Dog Day
Afternoon," with Stephen Adly

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.030
Guirgis adapting it.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:14.809
So it has to be the right idea.

00:18:14.809 --> 00:18:16.600
And I think that sounds
like the right idea

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.808
for the way it was picked up.

00:18:17.808 --> 00:18:20.176
But we'll develop
it and we'll see.

00:18:20.176 --> 00:18:21.280
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.460
So Michael Friedman,
original music

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:25.900
and original sound design.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.972
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN: No,
Darron West is the sound.

00:18:27.972 --> 00:18:28.930
ALAN SEALES: Oh, sorry.

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:29.730
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN: He
would be very mad at me

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:31.004
if I said I did the sound.

00:18:31.004 --> 00:18:31.670
ALAN SEALES: Oh.

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:33.870
So, I mean, over and
over again, the lighting

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:38.070
and the sound design are used
to indicate the passing of time,

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.630
which I think the way that
you did it in the show

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:41.440
was brilliant.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.900
Was that one of the
original slides,

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.200
or it's just the stuff
that we shall not

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.585
talk about that was slides?

00:18:48.585 --> 00:18:50.210
WILL FREARS: Oh,
everything was slides.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.690
I mean, the whole thing was.

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:54.320
It was like there was a bed
and a projection machine.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.580
It was like, this is
a-- then he does this.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.038
Then he does-- and
it would-- you'd

00:18:58.038 --> 00:19:00.460
just be like-- I'm so--
like it was just all slides.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.680
It was like something
from the 19th century.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.180
Yeah.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:07.684
ALAN SEALES: Well, the sound
and the lighting-- yeah,

00:19:07.684 --> 00:19:09.100
I think it's
absolutely brilliant.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.558
And I was wondering,
because I knew

00:19:10.558 --> 00:19:13.586
that it was going to take
place over multiple days

00:19:13.586 --> 00:19:14.460
and going into weeks.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.360
And I was like, OK, first
off, there's one room.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.410
OK, it rotated to
start, but that's it.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:24.150
But how did you guys come
up with the overall concept

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:26.540
for the underscoring
of the show,

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.280
in addition to the lighting?

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.047
You guys have things like
mobile gobos that move,

00:19:31.047 --> 00:19:33.380
that make it look like cars
are driving by, and whatnot.

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:33.620
It' brilliant.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.260
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN: Well, David
Weiner, our lighting designer,

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:36.950
is a genius at
that kind of thing.

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:40.780
So it is, as you
say, the thing that's

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.650
trickiest to do in theater
is to have time pass,

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:45.640
because our show
is 90 minutes long.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.450
And a novel can
take a lot of time.

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:52.320
So there are a lot of
scenes in the play.

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.090
And so, the major thing that
we had to come up with first

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:58.960
was how to tell the story of
now one night passes, now four

00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.990
nights pass.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:01.031
It's been snowing a lot.

00:20:01.031 --> 00:20:01.780
It's been raining.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.580
The seasons are changing.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.877
So we all worked--
it was actually

00:20:06.877 --> 00:20:07.960
one of the hardest things.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.501
I think, also on
the actors, in terms

00:20:09.501 --> 00:20:11.740
of exactly how long those
transitions should be,

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.360
and where the play
needs to breathe,

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.740
and where the play
needs to get tauter.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.860
So the music and sound
and lighting departments

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:25.510
all spent long and tedious
hours building those.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.340
So I'm glad that you
liked them, because they

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:29.300
were really hard to do.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.180
I've never seen,
actually, a show

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:33.210
that exists quite
in that way in terms

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:35.490
of telling a story about
time between the scenes.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.500
And I hope that it allows
the actors to then get

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.090
the right lift-off
into each scene.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:42.860
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, I
found it extremely unique.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.446
Did you get tech
butt while you were

00:20:44.446 --> 00:20:45.570
sitting in the house, yeah?

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:46.675
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN: We
got a lot of tech butt.

00:20:46.675 --> 00:20:47.140
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:47.540
They were saying--

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.040
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN: I never want
to eat the ramen at the place

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:50.920
on 44th Street again.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.597
ALAN SEALES: They were marveling
at our Googler at La Place,

00:20:53.597 --> 00:20:54.430
over here, the cafe.

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:55.980
And I said, you've got to
watch out for the Googler 20.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:58.188
And they said, you've got
to watch out for tech butt.

00:20:58.188 --> 00:21:01.485
When you sit in the house all
the time, you get tech butt.

00:21:01.485 --> 00:21:03.110
WILL FREARS: Everyone's
very graciously

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:09.220
put a bucket of candy on your
table, and you just look.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.100
ALAN SEALES: So how
is the composing

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:16.170
of music for a play different
from the composition

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:17.010
for a musical?

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:17.750
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN:
Well, I'll admit

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.250
that when I was telling people
I was working on "Misery,"

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:23.552
there would be this weird
look of horror in their faces.

00:21:23.552 --> 00:21:25.260
And then I'd say, oh,
it's not a musical.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.898
And they'd go, oh,
that's a good idea.

00:21:26.898 --> 00:21:28.332
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:28.332 --> 00:21:34.070
So it was like, oh, you think
I'd write a really bad musical.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:37.420
But the trick of-- I
mean, horror movies

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.930
rely on music hugely.

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.330
And the tricky
part of "Misery" is

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:43.670
the tone is really interesting.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.780
Because it's both scary,
and psychological,

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.404
and suspenseful, and at
the same time, very funny.

00:21:49.404 --> 00:21:51.570
And the thing that music
can do better than anything

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:53.710
is destroy humor.

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:56.410
So my first job,
in a funny way, was

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.740
to not kill what the actors
were doing beautifully,

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:01.580
that as soon as you
add music under it,

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:04.660
the audience is just sitting
there and nothing happens.

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.225
So like Will said, getting
out of the actor's way

00:22:07.225 --> 00:22:08.470
is part of my job.

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:12.390
But the fun part
was, horror allows

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:15.590
you to do all sorts of
things-- bad taste things

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:17.760
that I would never allow myself.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.610
Anyone who sees the show,
the final cue of the show

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:24.370
is completely tasteless.

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:30.560
But one of the fun things in
the show is that in the script,

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.350
Annie's different mood
shifts are indicated by what

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:36.720
Liberace she's listening to.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.450
So we started with the idea
of this Liberace piano.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:44.460
And I sort of let that start
infecting the other music.

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:47.434
And then I just watched
"Psycho" over and over again.

00:22:47.434 --> 00:22:49.350
The score of "Psycho"
is the best horror movie

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:50.020
score of all time.

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:51.186
ALAN SEALES: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:22:51.186 --> 00:22:52.670
Wow.

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:56.360
So Leon Addison Brown,
you play Buster.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.980
I watched the show
last week, like I

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:02.370
said, having not read the
book or watched the movie.

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.990
And your-- gosh,
how do I-- I don't

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.870
want to give any spoilers away.

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:08.640
Your--

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.470
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN:
Climactic moment.

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:10.040
WILL FREARS: Climactic thing.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.456
ALAN SEALES: Your
climactic moment

00:23:11.456 --> 00:23:13.340
scared the everloving
shit out of me.

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.660
And I was sitting
house-right, so I

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.060
didn't see Laurie behind you.

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:19.560
So I was completely-- I
didn't anticipate anything.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.760
And I was like, why is
he just standing there

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:21.611
weirdly like that?

00:23:21.611 --> 00:23:22.110
OK.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.830
And then, boom, it
happened-- literally.

00:23:28.456 --> 00:23:30.300
Does your character--
I mean, you kind of

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.405
come in and out of the
scene the whole time.

00:23:32.405 --> 00:23:34.280
Backstage, do you have
your own character arc

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.420
that you're dealing
with with all of this?

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.014
LEON ADDISON BROWN: I do.

00:23:38.014 --> 00:23:41.150
The difficult thing about
it is that I warm up,

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:43.080
and then I have to wait.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.650
So by the time I
get on, I'm feeling

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:46.536
like I need to warm up again.

00:23:46.536 --> 00:23:48.430
Then you're on for
that little short time,

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:49.750
and then you wait again.

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:53.550
So that part of it is
difficult, just staying in it.

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:55.900
So I listen to the
whole show every night.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:59.560
I'm actually sometimes watching
the monitor when I'm not

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:03.650
getting changed, just to
sort of keep myself in it,

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:06.145
so I don't feel like I'm
starting from zero again.

00:24:06.145 --> 00:24:07.590
I watch the time pass.

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:09.152
I watch the seasons change.

00:24:09.152 --> 00:24:10.420
I just do all that stuff.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.170
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:13.440
Oh, so, talk about
the seasons changing,

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.190
I want to talk about
the set for a second.

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:17.930
Because I believe that it's
just brilliantly designed.

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:19.730
And I hope you can
comment on-- hopefully,

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:20.896
you have some input on this.

00:24:20.896 --> 00:24:21.852
I want to praise you.

00:24:21.852 --> 00:24:22.977
WILL FREARS: I hope so too.

00:24:22.977 --> 00:24:24.480
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.380
The set, for those who will go
see it-- I'm not giving things

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.838
away, because the first thing
that happens is the whole set

00:24:29.838 --> 00:24:34.250
turns-- there's four rooms
essentially in this house.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:37.580
So the whole stage
is a giant turntable,

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:41.315
and you get to see at various
points each of the four rooms,

00:24:41.315 --> 00:24:43.050
or three rooms and outside.

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:46.654
And part of the white walls move
to shift around for the actors,

00:24:46.654 --> 00:24:47.820
to give you guys more space.

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:50.475
And I think it's
absolutely brilliant.

00:24:50.475 --> 00:24:53.070
How did that set come to be?

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:55.549
It's very unique compared to
anything I've seen before.

00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:57.090
WILL FREARS: It came
to be, actually,

00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:00.650
in a very specific way, which
is that David Korins, who's not

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:04.942
here, and I were having a
sort of early conversation

00:25:04.942 --> 00:25:06.400
about what we wanted
it to be like.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.099
And we felt very strongly.

00:25:08.099 --> 00:25:10.140
I mean, it all comes back
to the same idea, which

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:11.730
is making room for the actors.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:17.270
We wanted to put Annie's
house on the stage.

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:19.330
We didn't want to have
an idea about a house,

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:23.645
or some comment from
outside, or an opinion.

00:25:23.645 --> 00:25:26.730
We wanted to give her the
place where she lived,

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:30.510
that we could reveal more story
that way, that we could find--

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:33.190
and that we wanted-- and this
was a word we used endlessly--

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:34.810
we wanted claustrophobia.

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:37.640
We wanted a kind of super
claustrophobic realism.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.390
And so anytime you
break the plane,

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:42.876
you allow the
audience to breathe.

00:25:42.876 --> 00:25:44.750
And that's why we don't
have an intermission.

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:47.547
It's why there's no blackouts.

00:25:47.547 --> 00:25:49.130
There aren't meant
to be rest moments.

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:54.950
And so the idea was let's
put her whole house on stage.

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:57.610
And then once we go--
when the house moves,

00:25:57.610 --> 00:26:00.169
we want to follow-- we
want to be in real time.

00:26:00.169 --> 00:26:02.210
It is, again, the thing
Michael was saying about,

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:03.418
like we go back all the time.

00:26:03.418 --> 00:26:05.530
And when the house
is in motion, we

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:07.300
want it to be really
in motion, happening

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.830
in front of your eyes.

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:11.280
And so the idea was to
just try and jam it all.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.750
I remember David
calling me one day

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:15.190
and saying-- or me calling him
and saying, how's it going?

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:17.340
He said, I'm almost
being a good set

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:20.760
designer, because I've almost
got it all on the turntable.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.550
And before that,
we would have bits

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:25.170
like, oh, we can't get the
stairs on the turntable.

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:26.890
And we just kept compressing it.

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:29.370
And every time we
compressed it, it

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:31.070
got more claustrophobic
and more real.

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:33.121
And we just kept pushing
it further and further

00:26:33.121 --> 00:26:33.870
in that direction.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:37.170
And then you and
David would talk about

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:40.010
what was in the house,
so that everything

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:44.900
has texture and detail and
is informed by the story,

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:48.440
not just comment from outside.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.470
And also, that I
was always taken

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:54.200
by the idea of a cabin in the
woods and a kind of "Hansel

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.350
and Gretel" kind
of feeling of like,

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:58.957
that I thought it was important
to have the desolation,

00:26:58.957 --> 00:27:00.540
to really feel that
this was happening

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.180
in the middle of nowhere.

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.660
So that was how we did it.

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.240
And we just kept
going with that idea

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.768
instead of pushing it
further and further.

00:27:09.768 --> 00:27:11.070
ALAN SEALES: Wow.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.160
So is it interesting?

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.490
Laurie, have you ever
worked with a set like this?

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:16.440
You basically don't get
any time to breathe.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.240
You and Bruce are on stage
pretty much the whole time.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:23.444
As he said, it's real time,
including the passage of time.

00:27:23.444 --> 00:27:25.860
LAURIE METCALF: We do have
some moments of tag team, where

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:29.220
Bruce is on stage
alone and figuring out

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.000
how he's going to get out of
the room with whatever key

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.750
he can manufacture, and stuff.

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:37.216
But when he's doing
that, I'm backstage

00:27:37.216 --> 00:27:38.590
getting ready for
something else.

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:42.350
We don't really leave it.

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:44.189
We do get literally
stuck on that thing.

00:27:44.189 --> 00:27:45.730
ALAN SEALES: Is
there a big crew back

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:47.396
there that's all of
a sudden just coming

00:27:47.396 --> 00:27:50.640
to dump props and everything,
and take the snow off the side?

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:54.274
LAURIE METCALF: Our tech
week was hellish, because--

00:27:54.274 --> 00:27:55.440
WILL FREARS: It was awesome.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.770
LAURIE METCALF: --as you're
timing the light cues

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:01.910
with the music and the
revolve, then Bruce

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:05.020
is timing how fast he's
going in a wheelchair,

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.100
and the lights are
shift, and the music--

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.790
it's all shifting as he
passes through the doorway.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:14.100
And then you reveal the hallway.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:16.940
And your audience is seeing
it for the first time.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:21.750
But it was so
intricate, and we just

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.720
had to time it over and
over and over again.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.190
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN: You were
very patient with us--

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:30.597
MARK KAUFMAN: --as we
tortured you with music.

00:28:30.597 --> 00:28:31.930
ALAN SEALES: Has the turntable--

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:34.150
LAURIE METCALF: 25 scenes,
and each one has a--

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:34.740
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN: Oh, don't ask.

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:35.881
Don't ask that question.

00:28:35.881 --> 00:28:36.630
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:39.307
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN: No, and
don't ask, That's a curse.

00:28:39.307 --> 00:28:40.640
LAURIE METCALF: What did he say?

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.670
Oh, "Has it."

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:43.370
ALAN SEALES: Has the turntable--

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:43.690
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN: No.

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:44.210
WILL FREARS: No.

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:44.490
ALAN SEALES: Good

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:45.070
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN:
No, don't say ever.

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:45.970
Please don't say it.

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:48.057
MARK KAUFMAN: Never broken.

00:28:48.057 --> 00:28:49.390
ALAN SEALES: What would happen--

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:51.515
LAURIE METCALF: But there
was a million props also.

00:28:51.515 --> 00:28:53.060
The handling of
all that had to get

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:55.654
swept up into this tech week.

00:28:55.654 --> 00:28:57.320
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN: We
had a bad few days,

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.042
where in spring, there
was some snow on the roof.

00:29:00.042 --> 00:29:02.000
ALAN SEALES: People just
forgot to take it off?

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.708
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN: No,
no one knew how to.

00:29:03.708 --> 00:29:06.220
There was no moment in
which it could be taken off.

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:07.914
Somehow they
heroically take it off.

00:29:07.914 --> 00:29:09.330
ALAN SEALES: It's
all very subtle.

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:09.970
I love it.

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:14.810
Because you see the flowers
get put on the porch, and then

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:17.720
all of a sudden, oh yeah,
the snow is melting.

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:20.405
Yeah, it all just worked.

00:29:20.405 --> 00:29:21.780
LAURIE METCALF:
And I think Bruce

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:26.710
and I are wearing, individually,
like seven layers of things.

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:29.850
It doesn't seem like there would
be a lot of wardrobe changes,

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:30.620
but there are.

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.430
ALAN SEALES: Oh, so you
just layer everything then?

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:33.440
LAURIE METCALF: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:33.700
ALAN SEALES: I guess Bruce--

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.386
LAURIE METCALF: And quick ones
happening backstage, a lot

00:29:36.386 --> 00:29:38.082
of quick stuff back there.

00:29:38.082 --> 00:29:38.790
ALAN SEALES: Wow.

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:41.070
So the rehearsals you
were talking about,

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:41.990
how long were they?

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:43.754
You said they were
six to seven weeks?

00:29:43.754 --> 00:29:44.420
WILL FREARS: No.

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:45.280
ALAN SEALES: Longer?

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:45.510
WILL FREARS: No.

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:46.282
Pfft.

00:29:46.282 --> 00:29:47.730
Along three weeks?

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:48.770
LAURIE METCALF: Three.

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:50.311
WILL FREARS: Three
weeks in the room.

00:29:50.311 --> 00:29:55.010
So three weeks with--
and Bruce as well.

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:59.090
And then a week in
the theater in tech.

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:01.944
And then four weeks of
previews, so we would rehearse

00:30:01.944 --> 00:30:04.610
in the afternoon, and then these
guys would have to go on and do

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:05.470
it in the evening.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:07.590
And then they'd get
handed endlessly, like,

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:08.970
oh, we want to
change everything.

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:10.511
ALAN SEALES: Yeah,
I was going to ask

00:30:10.511 --> 00:30:13.760
if the script kept changing
up until opening night.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:14.760
WILL FREARS: Oh, yeah.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.180
ALAN SEALES: Even afterwards?

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.710
WILL FREARS: Not
opening, but close.

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:17.570
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:18.070
Yeah.

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:19.260
Question over here?

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:19.801
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:19.801 --> 00:30:20.730
My name is Chris.

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:22.021
Thanks to everybody for coming.

00:30:22.021 --> 00:30:23.110
This is very cool.

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:27.312
I'm curious, with "Misery" being
such an iconic film, and a book

00:30:27.312 --> 00:30:30.360
before that, and it coming to
the stage for the first time,

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:34.910
how do you balance using what
came before as inspiration,

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:37.480
but not letting it
make whatever you do

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.601
and create-- not
reducing the freshness?

00:30:40.601 --> 00:30:41.850
Do you use it for inspiration?

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:48.180
Or do you just clean slate,
kind of power through?

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.540
LAURIE METCALF: Well,
I was clever enough

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:53.969
to stay away from the movie,
because I knew if I watched-- I

00:30:53.969 --> 00:30:55.260
saw the movie when it came out.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:57.885
But if I looked at
that again, which

00:30:57.885 --> 00:30:59.660
I'm going to as
soon as we close--

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:01.440
I want to see it
again-- but I knew

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.340
that Kathy's wonderful
performance would stick

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.770
in my head in a really bad way.

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:09.720
But I did go back to the
book, which I had also

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.000
read when it came out.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.352
And to revisit that
was really helpful.

00:31:15.352 --> 00:31:20.230
It's a lot about Paul
Sheldon's interior life

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:25.680
and the torture that he's
having to take from this woman.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.250
The book is also
very, very theatrical.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:32.210
There's a lot of
really-- even more

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:34.820
gruesome things happen
in the book that

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:37.040
were chosen to be in the movie.

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:40.150
And then ours is
a hybrid of both.

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:42.470
Because we have things
that are from the book,

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:45.212
that weren't in the
movie, and vice versa.

00:31:45.212 --> 00:31:54.710
So there were so
many options, I felt,

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:58.000
going into "Misery"
the play, that it

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.065
was daunting in that way.

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:08.297
But I like that it's a blend.

00:32:08.297 --> 00:32:10.880
WILL FREARS: One of the things
that we realized when we did it

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:16.320
in Pennsylvania was that he's
stuck on stage the whole time.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:19.500
He's stuck in this room,
and so you have to--

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.820
and this was what's
wonderful about the movie.

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:24.520
And because I am a
coward, I'd never

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:28.100
watched the movie because the
trailer scared me too much.

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:31.080
So I didn't watch it until
I sat in the NYU hospital

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:34.150
room with my
two-day-old on my chest.

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:37.150
But the movie is
brilliant in what it takes

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:40.840
from-- the book is spectacular.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.540
And it's all in
Paul's voice, and it's

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.050
all Paul's point of view.

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:46.650
And what Bill Goldman
does in the movie that's

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:48.890
so brilliant, as a human,
he finds this new way

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:52.709
of looking at Annie, and
going out into Annie's world.

00:32:52.709 --> 00:32:53.500
And it's wonderful.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.166
But then when you
went back to the play,

00:32:55.166 --> 00:32:57.620
you were like, we
don't have a camera.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:01.050
This can only happen between
the two of them in this room.

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:03.089
And so everything sort
of got-- the stuff

00:33:03.089 --> 00:33:05.380
we took from the book, the
stuff we got from the movie,

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.400
it all had to be
recompressed into

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.249
like, how does this happen
between the two of them?

00:33:10.249 --> 00:33:11.790
How can this happen
in the space that

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:15.010
exists in their conversation
or in what they're not saying?

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:18.680
And I think that was the big--
that everything from both

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.720
the mediums had to be
channeled back into like,

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.840
can this take place
between the two of them

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.930
in the space that exists
between the two of them?

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:30.140
And I think that was our
main-- I went back to the movie

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.147
at the end.

00:33:32.147 --> 00:33:33.730
Once it was all
worked out in my head,

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:35.790
and I would be sort
of stuck in places.

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:38.073
And then I felt like I
had a secure enough grip

00:33:38.073 --> 00:33:40.572
of the story I was telling,
that then I would go back and be

00:33:40.572 --> 00:33:41.610
like, how did they do it?

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:42.750
Because I might just steal that.

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:43.530
So I would use it.

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:45.030
Once I knew what I
was doing, I felt

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:48.450
liberated to steal from very,
very clever people in a way

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:51.920
that, earlier on, I would
have felt, as Laurie says,

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.865
like I would have just ended up
trying to mimic a lot of stuff

00:33:54.865 --> 00:33:56.490
from the movie, rather
than at the end,

00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:57.906
being able to go
back and be like,

00:33:57.906 --> 00:33:59.350
oh, oh, I'll have a bit of that.

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:01.324
That's clever.

00:34:01.324 --> 00:34:03.365
And so that was it, but
I haven't seen the movie.

00:34:03.365 --> 00:34:05.180
So I can't remember the last
time I watched the whole movie.

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.263
I would watch and be like
how do they do that bit?

00:34:07.263 --> 00:34:09.792
And I would go back and watch
that over and over again.

00:34:09.792 --> 00:34:11.250
LEON ADDISON BROWN:
I saw the movie

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:13.870
when it came out many years ago.

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:17.840
And reading the book,
I was a little shocked

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.940
that Buster is actually
a composite, I think,

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:22.889
of different police
officers that show up.

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:28.530
And so I didn't have to-- I was
hoping that I could get stuff

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:29.889
from the book for him.

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:35.360
But I had to go find my own
cop book which was amazing.

00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:42.830
Mr. Goldman must have
sat down and talked

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:44.010
to detectives, or something.

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:45.760
Because some of the
answers that she gives

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:49.600
are all these cues and
clues in it about, hmm,

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:50.920
there's something here.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.139
There's something
here in every scene.

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:56.775
And I was like, thank you.

00:34:56.775 --> 00:34:57.650
MARK KAUFMAN: Can I--

00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:57.970
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, go ahead.

00:34:57.970 --> 00:34:58.940
MARK KAUFMAN: --I just want
to add one thing, though.

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.189
One of the things I think
we've done very successfully

00:35:01.189 --> 00:35:04.360
is when we sought out to
do this in the first place,

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.410
we have the book.

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:06.220
You have the movie.

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.280
And we wanted to create
something that was its own.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.821
So yes, it pulls
from the other ones.

00:35:09.821 --> 00:35:12.390
But it has things that are
also unique to the play that

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:14.530
aren't in either the
book or the movie.

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:18.150
So we set out to not create
a souvenir of either,

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.100
but a companion piece,
the same way the movie

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:21.475
is a companion
piece of the book.

00:35:21.475 --> 00:35:23.570
And I think that's what
we've done successfully.

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:27.220
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN: And one
more thing, which is there's

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:31.162
one iconic moment in the
movie that is not in the book,

00:35:31.162 --> 00:35:33.370
or it's very different in
the book, which is probably

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:36.170
the most famous iconic moment
in the movie-- no spoilers.

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:38.150
But we had to get that right.

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:39.140
WILL FREARS: Yes.

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:39.620
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN: We knew.

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.661
And we didn't quite get
it right in Pennsylvania,

00:35:41.661 --> 00:35:43.540
and the audience
didn't quite forgive us

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:44.600
for not getting it right.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:47.020
And no, and it was the big
thing we had to get right.

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:51.241
And it was pretty exciting when
the actors, and the designers,

00:35:51.241 --> 00:35:52.990
and the director, and
all the stage hands,

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:54.770
when everyone
finally came together

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:58.380
to make that moment work was
really probably when we knew.

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.480
The audience reaction suddenly
was like, oh, we gave you

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:02.585
what you were waiting for.

00:36:02.585 --> 00:36:04.880
And that's also a
very wonderful thing

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.960
to be able to do
for an audience.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.620
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:13.030
Were you influenced at all
by the music in the movie?

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:16.270
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN: I quickly
started watching it.

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:19.089
And Marc Shaiman wrote
a really good score.

00:36:19.089 --> 00:36:20.130
It's Marc Shaiman, right?

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:20.965
MARK KAUFMAN: Marc Shaiman,
the "Hairspray" composer.

00:36:20.965 --> 00:36:22.100
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN: Marc
Shaiman, who did "Hairspray,

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.070
wrote a really good score.

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:25.960
It's actually
strangely unhelpful

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.852
because movies are so
different from plays.

00:36:28.852 --> 00:36:30.310
So it was nice to
start watching it

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:31.643
and go, oh, I couldn't use that.

00:36:31.643 --> 00:36:32.836
None of this would work.

00:36:32.836 --> 00:36:34.230
ALAN SEALES: [CHUCKLES]

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.960
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN:
Let's start over.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:35.260
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:35.760
Yeah.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.530
Question over here?

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:38.314
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:38.314 --> 00:36:40.230
Mark, you mentioned that
"Misery" spoke to you

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:43.700
because of the theatricalism
you felt inherent in the piece.

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:46.020
I was wondering, in general,
when Warner Brothers

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:49.100
is choosing shows to adapt for
the theater, what you look for.

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.822
And also, more to
the point, if there

00:36:50.822 --> 00:36:52.530
is going to be a
"Goonies-- The Musical"?

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:53.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:54.530
MARK KAUFMAN: Wow.

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:57.660
ALAN SEALES: Good question.

00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.960
MARK KAUFMAN: Well, again,
there are different ways

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.970
to do theater.

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:02.860
There's the musical.

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:04.030
There's the play.

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:05.100
There are reviews.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:08.410
There are now immersive theater,
like there are pieces where

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:09.940
you follow the actors around.

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.895
So as far as what
we look for, it's

00:37:11.895 --> 00:37:13.740
just something that
feels like it naturally

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:16.970
adapts to the stage.

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:18.690
It has to have a theatricality.

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:21.790
It has to feel like
you could transform it

00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:22.757
into something else.

00:37:22.757 --> 00:37:25.090
It feels like, to me, though,
when we're putting theater

00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:26.780
together, it's the next step.

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:29.260
It can't just be, oh,
let's take the movie

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:30.680
and just do it on stage.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.390
Like I said before
about "Misery,"

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:35.299
it can't be the
souvenir of the piece.

00:37:35.299 --> 00:37:36.590
it has to be a companion piece.

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:39.747
And what can you add to the
piece by putting it on stage?

00:37:39.747 --> 00:37:41.580
I think with "Elf," we
were very successful.

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.670
And "Hairspray" was
incredibly successful

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:49.142
because the John Waters movie
and the musical on Broadway

00:37:49.142 --> 00:37:50.600
were two complete
different things,

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:55.480
as I feel the Adam Shankman
movie was another step forward.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:59.301
And so I guess my
long answer to that

00:37:59.301 --> 00:38:01.800
is that we look for something
that feels like it organically

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:06.040
feels like it belongs on stage,
where there is relationship,

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:11.450
some emotional arc, some sort
of reason to have it sing.

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:12.400
We're doing "Dave."

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.945
We're doing "Seventeen Again."

00:38:13.945 --> 00:38:17.900
These pieces feel like
they belong on stage.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:22.260
And I guess time will tell
whether we're right or not.

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.850
But we're trying.

00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:27.470
ALAN SEALES: You mentioned
the audience a second ago.

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:29.330
The audience, they finally were
like, yes, you gave it to us.

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:30.320
This is what we want.

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:34.420
Is the overall audience
reaction this time--

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:36.300
I guess, first off,
first question, how

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.050
is it different here in New
York versus at Bucks County?

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:41.070
WILL FREARS: I think
we're different now.

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:45.960
I think part of it is
that in Bucks County,

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.050
we were testing it out.

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:52.670
And I think, I look
back, we were much more--

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:55.947
we worked in a way that I I'm
glad we've moved away from.

00:38:55.947 --> 00:38:58.030
We did much more like we're
going to be scary now.

00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:00.228
Like the thunder was
endlessly the loudest thunder

00:39:00.228 --> 00:39:01.760
you'd ever heard.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.270
And the lightning was
like really "lightningy."

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:05.020
And I think that--

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:05.700
ALAN SEALES: Lightningy.

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:06.700
WILL FREARS: Lightningy.

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:09.520
And I think that what we
did was we found a way,

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.430
and so in a way, we didn't
yet trust what we had.

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:14.230
I mean, we were
right not to, which

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:17.500
is that we didn't trust it,
so we handed over everything

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:18.480
to see what worked.

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.521
And I think that what we
came out of Pennsylvania

00:39:20.521 --> 00:39:24.130
with was a much clearer sense
of the story we were telling.

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:27.070
I mean, it was the most-- I'd
like to do it with anything

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:28.690
I direct, which is do it once.

00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:31.200
Figure out where you've
gotten off track,

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:34.630
and then go back and
do it again better.

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:39.440
To have had the opportunity to
learn from it was a real treat,

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:42.020
so thank you, Mark.

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:44.791
And I think we went back and
went like, oh, now we know

00:39:44.791 --> 00:39:46.040
the story we're going to tell.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:48.670
Now we can be more interesting.

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:50.780
We can be bolder.

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:53.220
We can be stranger because we
know what it is we're doing.

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.910
And we trust it more, so
we don't have to just make

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:57.355
the thunder really loud.

00:39:57.355 --> 00:39:58.980
I mean, we do in
places still, but it's

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:03.610
less-- we stopped tap
dancing quite so fast.

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:06.990
And I think that's what we
came into rehearsal with.

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:09.990
And then I think Laurie and
Bruce, once they showed up,

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:14.385
brought such extra-- I think
that the actors in Pennsylvania

00:40:14.385 --> 00:40:16.510
were very much that doing
what we needed them to do

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:17.676
to see what the play worked.

00:40:17.676 --> 00:40:20.130
And Laurie and Bruce
bring such originality,

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:22.690
and eccentricity,
and strangeness to it

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:26.310
that it's become a kind
of-- the one in Pennsylvania

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:28.090
was really like,
here's the movie.

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:29.580
We're kind of figuring it out.

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:32.470
And here I think
we have a thing.

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:34.750
We've pulled the script apart.

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:36.850
Laurie and Bruce give
these sort of very strange,

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:39.170
very interesting, very
human performances.

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:43.430
The design leads in
more interesting places.

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:46.080
So it has a confidence
now, I think,

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.850
that it didn't have
in Bucks County.

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:49.892
In Bucks County, it
really was sort of--

00:40:49.892 --> 00:40:51.100
ALAN SEALES: Experimentation.

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:52.640
WILL FREARS: Yeah, or
not experimentive enough,

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:54.710
where they're like, hey,
hey, do you like it?

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:56.342
Do you like it?

00:40:56.342 --> 00:40:57.800
MARK KAUFMAN: The
set evolved also.

00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.150
ALAN SEALES: I was
going to ask about that.

00:40:59.150 --> 00:40:59.720
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN: A lot.

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:00.560
Yeah.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:01.360
ALAN SEALES: Was it
the original house

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.812
with the turntable there too?

00:41:02.812 --> 00:41:03.770
MARK KAUFMAN: No.

00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:05.470
WILL FREARS: The room
was quite similar.

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:08.590
The door was in the same place,
but I think that was about it.

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:11.160
No, no, you spend your
life trying to figure out

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:12.190
where the door goes.

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:13.370
Once you figure out
where the door goes,

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:15.110
pretty much everything
else makes sense.

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:19.000
But the door-- no,
how to you move?

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.170
She comes in.

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:20.900
He's in bed.

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:23.441
Nobody's moving, so you've got
to figure out the relationship

00:41:23.441 --> 00:41:25.100
between bed and door.

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:27.036
It's like 80% percent
of the blocking.

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:31.405
Desperate to get
away from the door.

00:41:31.405 --> 00:41:32.675
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:41:32.675 --> 00:41:34.439
Yeah, question over here?

00:41:34.439 --> 00:41:34.980
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:35.729
I have a question.

00:41:37.995 --> 00:41:40.370
I guess when you first got
together in the room and said,

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:42.687
this is how we are going to
scare audiences and really

00:41:42.687 --> 00:41:44.770
bring them in, how do you
think being in a theater

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:47.430
and seeing this
performance live is

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:50.510
different from being scared--
somebody sitting in a movie

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:55.350
theater and being brought into
a film versus being on stage

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:58.109
and seeing it?

00:41:58.109 --> 00:41:59.650
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN:
Well, it's actually

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:01.080
happening in front of you.

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.030
I mean, which I know
is the obvious answer,

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:05.330
but it's also true.

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:06.259
These are real people.

00:42:06.259 --> 00:42:08.050
I mean, that's my
experience watching this.

00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:09.772
These are real people.

00:42:09.772 --> 00:42:10.980
WILL FREARS: And real bodies.

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:13.146
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN: Yeah,
real people and real bodies.

00:42:13.146 --> 00:42:16.640
And a few times, wait,
that can't be a real body.

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.250
But that experience
which is that this

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:21.580
is happening in front of you,
and they are actually doing it.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.730
I mean there's a fight
at the end, where

00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:26.180
Bruce and Laurie go at
each other in a rather

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:28.270
frightening way.

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:30.600
And a fight on stage is a
completely different thing

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.456
than a fight in a movie.

00:42:33.456 --> 00:42:34.830
There's a little
bit of distance.

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:37.288
As exciting as the movie is,
it's a different and, I think,

00:42:37.288 --> 00:42:38.730
a more distanced experience.

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:40.220
WILL FREARS: And I think that
the pleasure of being scared

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:41.680
in a movie so much
is the edit, that you

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.100
cut, you change
the angle, or you

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:44.391
play a thing that wasn't there.

00:42:44.391 --> 00:42:49.660
And I think what we're going
for is that it builds up

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:52.320
to this incredibly kind of
climactic violent moment,

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.870
and to train the audience
to believe everything.

00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:58.714
And what you do is
you keep not cutting.

00:42:58.714 --> 00:42:59.880
You keep not going to black.

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:02.430
You keep not giving
a kind of [GASP]

00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:05.134
so that it all-- there's a
sort of cumulative effect

00:43:05.134 --> 00:43:06.800
of a different--
almost like you haven't

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.662
been allowed to stop looking.

00:43:08.662 --> 00:43:10.620
Laurie is there the whole
time and you're going

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:12.130
to have to keep looking at her.

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:13.230
We're not cutting away.

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:16.230
We're not giving you anything
outside of this room.

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:19.052
I mean, the movie cuts
its passage of time.

00:43:19.052 --> 00:43:21.260
It cuts to the mountains
and you watch the snow melt.

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:24.594
But you cut to the mountains,
and you breathe for a second.

00:43:24.594 --> 00:43:25.760
We don't have any mountains.

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:26.420
We've only got--

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:28.780
LAURIE METCALF: We also don't
have the benefit of close-ups.

00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:29.488
WILL FREARS: Yes.

00:43:29.488 --> 00:43:31.160
LAURIE METCALF: So
that's a big one.

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:35.142
You can get a lot of mileage
out of a really good close-up,

00:43:35.142 --> 00:43:37.656
and we can't do that.

00:43:37.656 --> 00:43:38.570
WILL FREARS: No.

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:42.360
ALAN SEALES: There's a lot of
realistic blood as well, which

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:44.600
speaking as an audience
member not involved

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.400
in the production--

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:47.025
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN: We
have a blood room.

00:43:47.025 --> 00:43:48.579
ALAN SEALES: Do you, really?

00:43:48.579 --> 00:43:49.870
WILL FREARS: Don't go in there.

00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:53.140
ALAN SEALES: Buster just
goes in and coats himself.

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:59.790
Yeah, that was the difference
for me versus in a movie,

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:00.290
I guess.

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:02.010
Like I'm looking
at it, and I know

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:03.890
it's not real anyway,
because it's a movie.

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:07.835
But of course, in theater,
I know it's not real.

00:44:07.835 --> 00:44:10.610
People aren't getting hurt every
night, over and over again--

00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:13.060
most of the time.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:16.540
But for me, like you said,
seeing real people involved

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:18.420
with this, and seeing
all of a sudden,

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:22.580
Buster's little climactic scene,
and the noise, and the boom,

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:24.380
it's-- all right.

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:26.119
I don't-- sorry.

00:44:26.119 --> 00:44:27.660
WILL FREARS: No, I
just wanted to ask

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:31.420
you, Laurie, as the
person who is scary,

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:34.130
how much do you-- like I
have this idea about what

00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:35.310
we're doing to scare people.

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:39.302
But you are the agent
of scariness on stage.

00:44:39.302 --> 00:44:41.010
How much do you think
about that as you--

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:44.320
LAURIE METCALF: I don't
think about it at all.

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:45.355
Am I scary in it?

00:44:45.355 --> 00:44:45.980
WILL FREARS: Terrifying, yes.

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:47.960
ALAN SEALES: Oh, yeah, yeah,
by the end of it, yeah.

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:48.835
WILL FREARS: Oh, and
like really scary.

00:44:48.835 --> 00:44:51.001
LAURIE METCALF: Well,
hopefully, the reason for that

00:44:51.001 --> 00:44:52.859
is that she's just
unpredictable, right?

00:44:52.859 --> 00:44:53.650
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:55.608
LAURIE METCALF: So you
don't know what-- first,

00:44:55.608 --> 00:44:58.111
you start to get a hint of
what she might be capable of.

00:44:58.111 --> 00:44:58.860
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:00.340
LAURIE METCALF: So I
guess it's the-- yeah,

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:01.570
it's the unpredictability.

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:06.690
So I don't have to try
and actually scare people.

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:11.190
That's not where that's
coming from, right?

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:12.517
The fear is coming from.

00:45:12.517 --> 00:45:13.350
Because it can't be.

00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:17.240
Nobody can-- you look
this big on the stage.

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:18.917
No, that can't be scary.

00:45:18.917 --> 00:45:20.860
WILL FREARS: I mean, it is.

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:22.610
LAURIE METCALF: But I
guess it's just her.

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:28.090
Sometimes the rage that's in
her, I guess, might be scary.

00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:31.964
My kids don't think so,
but audiences might.

00:45:31.964 --> 00:45:33.130
ALAN SEALES: We totally did.

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:35.397
And for me, like you said,
it's the unpredictability,

00:45:35.397 --> 00:45:37.480
especially when it comes
to causing physical harm.

00:45:39.842 --> 00:45:41.300
That's what pushed
me over the edge

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:43.236
is that, OK, she's
a little nuts.

00:45:43.236 --> 00:45:44.360
She says some weird things.

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:47.280
And then all of a sudden,
like about halfway through.

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.440
it escalates very, very quickly.

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:53.092
And for me, watching it,
the character of Annie,

00:45:53.092 --> 00:45:54.800
it was like just
another day in the park.

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.210
Like, oh, well, this is
what's going to happen,

00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:57.400
and boom, there it happened.

00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.650
And while the rest of us--
the audience-- is cringing.

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:02.470
And there are people all
around me in the audience

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:03.994
talking as if it's
a horror movie.

00:46:03.994 --> 00:46:05.035
They're like, oh, my god.

00:46:05.035 --> 00:46:05.850
Is she going to go inside?

00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:06.400
What's going to happen?

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:06.950
It's going to hit her like that?

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:07.280
LAURIE METCALF: Really?

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.840
ALAN SEALES: Oh, yeah, there's
people whispering behind me,

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:10.800
like watch this.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.320
What's going on?

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.780
And I realized that
people are literally

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:16.780
watching it like they're
watching a horror film.

00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:18.320
MARK KAUFMAN: The
sound of 1,200 people

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:19.300
in the Longacre screaming--

00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:19.630
WILL FREARS: The Broadhurst.

00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:20.850
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN:
--is like the coolest.

00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:22.350
The Broadhurst--
don't mention that.

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:23.660
(LOUDLY) Broadhurst!

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:28.079
Screaming is like the awesomest
sound I've ever heard.

00:46:28.079 --> 00:46:29.620
ALAN SEALES: Yeah,
it was incredible.

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:30.310
LAURIE METCALF: And laughing.

00:46:30.310 --> 00:46:31.220
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN: And laughing.

00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:33.095
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, there
were the funny parts

00:46:33.095 --> 00:46:35.550
in there too, which was a
wonderful juxtaposition.

00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:36.900
Man, your character, you just--

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:39.200
LAURIE METCALF: That's why
we call it a "thrilomedy."

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:40.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:42.656
ALAN SEALES: It's like "The
Martian" being a comedy.

00:46:42.656 --> 00:46:44.153
LAURIE METCALF: Yeah.

00:46:44.153 --> 00:46:45.736
ALAN SEALES: Yeah,
question over here?

00:46:45.736 --> 00:46:46.550
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:49.710
I was actually going to
ask about what you just

00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:50.510
touched upon.

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:54.470
But when I watched the
movie, I didn't find it

00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:57.140
very funny or pleasant at all.

00:46:57.140 --> 00:47:01.036
It was a very unsettling movie.

00:47:01.036 --> 00:47:03.030
And then when I saw
it in the theater,

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:05.277
I saw it during previews,
so it might have changed.

00:47:05.277 --> 00:47:10.487
But the scene everyone keeps
avoiding talking about--

00:47:10.487 --> 00:47:11.401
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:11.401 --> 00:47:11.860
LEON ADDISON BROWN:
The one where

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:13.290
Buster falls from the roof?

00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:15.607
Or the one where--

00:47:15.607 --> 00:47:16.940
ALAN SEALES: The bungee jumping.

00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:18.510
AUDIENCE: --finally figures out.

00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:21.280
And then, you know.

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:24.300
When I saw that, there were
a lot of shocked screams

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:27.206
but then this wave of laughter.

00:47:27.206 --> 00:47:32.420
And I just thought that was
like a really-- I did not expect

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:34.096
the play to be like that.

00:47:34.096 --> 00:47:37.890
But do you think that's
a necessary property

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:39.710
of doing horror in a theater?

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:41.980
Or is that something
you were going for?

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:44.960
Or a combination of both?

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:47.740
MARK KAUFMAN: I think we were
all surprised about-- I mean,

00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:50.410
from when we started previews,
the audience's response

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:51.050
was terrific.

00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:54.500
And I think what we were--
I, at least, personally,

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.330
what I was most
surprised about was

00:47:56.330 --> 00:47:59.000
about how much
humor was in there,

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.500
and how people got
on for the ride.

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:03.770
And I wasn't sure whether it was
because they knew the character

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:06.710
from the book, or whether
they-- Laurie's performance is

00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:09.410
extraordinary.

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:13.010
So whether they love her,
or hate her, or whatever,

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:14.200
they follow her.

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.790
And they feel sympathy for her.

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:18.520
And she really elicits
this amazing reaction

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:19.270
from the audience.

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:22.410
And I think some of it is
release, and some of it

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:24.300
is just because
they feel for her.

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:27.076
But it's genuine laughter,
which is pretty extraordinary.

00:48:27.076 --> 00:48:28.575
MICHAEL FRIEDMAN:
I think sometimes,

00:48:28.575 --> 00:48:32.790
though, in the theater, when
there's a moment of horror,

00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:35.852
the audience has the
reaction and then realizes

00:48:35.852 --> 00:48:37.060
they've all had the reaction.

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:39.710
And that part of the
humor that comes out of it

00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:41.440
is what you said, the
release, which is,

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:42.740
we all just screamed together.

00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:43.690
That was really scary.

00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:46.640
And then they kind of
laugh, and it's almost

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:48.140
an automatic nervous response.

00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:51.180
It's fun to watch the
audience in those moments

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:53.104
and try to figure
out the psychology.

00:48:53.104 --> 00:48:54.020
ALAN SEALES: Oh, yeah.

00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:56.940
It was after moments like
that that, and traditionally

00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:59.340
through theater, you don't
talk through it, and whatnot.

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:02.069
But then as every moment
just stairstepped,

00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:03.610
and the tension kept
building, people

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:05.955
were just having
whole conversations.

00:49:05.955 --> 00:49:08.080
This one guy was sitting
behind me completely about

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:09.450
to just lose his mind
because he didn't know

00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:11.040
what you were going to do next.

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:16.102
And it was exciting for me to
experience all these people

00:49:16.102 --> 00:49:19.380
around me getting as
nervous and as excited

00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:21.520
as I know that you
guys intend them to be.

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:24.800
So job accomplished,
job well done.

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.310
So thank you very much.

00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:28.670
If there are no more
questions, we'll wrap up.

00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:30.380
We're out of time here.

00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:33.080
Playing at the Broadhurst
Theatre, 235 West 44th,

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:34.580
between 7th and 8th Avenue.

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:40.960
Thank you all so
much for coming.

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:41.770
MARK KAUFMAN: And
get your tickets now

00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:43.570
because we only have
five more weeks.

00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:45.403
ALAN SEALES: Five more
weeks, a limited run.

00:49:45.403 --> 00:49:46.390
Yeah, get tickets now.

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:46.710
Cool.

00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:47.180
Thank you.

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:48.138
WILL FREARS: Thank you.
