00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.790
Do you ever feel like it was a mistake that
you were born human? While everyone else is

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.470
dreaming about becoming the next best entrepreneur,
nurse or artist,

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:24.440
I've got a little secret for you; my dream
is to become a professional house cat. But

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.080
with further research, I might not have to
dream any longer.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.700
In fact, I may be living it already.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.590
Are you sick and tired of being misunderstood?

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:44.399
Here are 9 signs you're secretly a cat; one:
you're cute, small and sassy.

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.380
Have you experienced short people problems
all your life as a cat?

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.840
It's not an issue but quite normal.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.530
People think you're adorable and cuddly but
the minute someone has wronged you, you're

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.149
not afraid to show them your claws.

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.860
This is why you're usually respected.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:09.340
On the surface, you're usually calm, cool
and collected, but underneath, you're a simmering

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.580
volcano ready to explode under enough pressure.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.159
You never forget a kind gesture though.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.880
Two; you can't stand messiness.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.090
Who else here can't stand a messy room?

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.049
Cats enjoy structure, consistency and routine.

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.890
Does that sound like you?

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.450
When impulse is not your middle name and you
have a high degree of self-discipline and

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:41.479
control, your coworkers often admire your
work ethic; clean reliable and detail-oriented.

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.800
You make a natural role model.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.140

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:02.350
Now, on to point three, three; sleeping is
your favorite hobby.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.220
Cats love to nap.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.229
If this screams you, don't worry about other
people calling you boring.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.020
It's not your fault you're so popular and
get invited out to so many social events,

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.380
but decline them frequently just to cozy up
in your bed.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.569
I mean, who could resist warm sheets and soft
pillows?

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.200
Four; your curious about everything.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.310
You might not always go out of your way to
attend parties or strike up a conversation

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.910
with strangers, but this doesn't mean you
aren't observant.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.819
You pay attention to the world around you
and take great pleasure in examining how things

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:38.890
work.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.880
This makes you a natural bookworm, scholarly
enthusiast and lifelong partner.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.450
Five; you are protective of your freedom.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.760
Everybody knows a cat needs no one to complete
them.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.170
Fiercely independent, you enjoy your space
and are rather proud of being self-sufficient.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.519
This however doesn't mean you dislike company.

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.319
Which brings us to the next sign, six; you
enjoy affection in small doses.

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.930
For others to get close to you, they have
to earn it.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.790
You don't trust people easily, but when the
right people enter your life, you allow yourself

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.450
to be vulnerable with them.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.640
You value the quality of your relationship
more than the quantity.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.390
This makes you a loyal friend and romantic
partner because the minute someone hurts someone

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.380
you care about, you do everything in your
power to protect them.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.500
This is why cats are so reliable.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.540
Seven; you stay up when everyone else is asleep.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.840
Do you have nocturnal tendencies?

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.610
While your neighbors are sleeping, you might
be the only one up eating ramen and watching

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.620
your favorite Netflix show.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.740
Have no shame, this is just how you operate.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.830
The hard part though is regretting you stayed
up the minute your alarm goes off.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.799
Unfortunately, being a cat stuck in a human's
body requires you to go to school and work.

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.380
Eight; you're known to be picky.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.739
Ranging from the foods you eat to the way
you are touched by others, you have specific

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.129
preferences.

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.659
Others might consider you high maintenance
but you recognize that you're not for everyone.

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:13.870
The right people wouldn't mind and would respect
your tastes.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.049
Nine; people often mistake you for being indifferent.

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.830
Do you identify as an introvert?

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.460
Others may think you're reserved, unapproachable
and serious.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.870
But if they just allow you to grow comfortable
with them, they'll come to find you're actually

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.650
playful and affectionate.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.270
Before you know it, you'll be cuddled up next
to them and spend every waking moment with

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.910
someone you value who values you back too.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.410
