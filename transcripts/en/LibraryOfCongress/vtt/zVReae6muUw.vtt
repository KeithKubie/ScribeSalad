00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.210
&gt;&gt; Automated: From the Library
of Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:11.050
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: It is my pleasure
to present to you Nadia Hashimi,

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.110
who is a pediatrician from
Potomac, Maryland, who also happens

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.700
to write bestselling novels.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.230
Her books include When the
Moon is Low and the Pearl

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.890
that Broke its Shell, which
are rooted in Afghanistan,

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.360
the home country of her parents.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.220
One Half from the East is her
first novel for young adults.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.520
Set in modern day Afghanistan, it
follows the life of a bacha posh,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.850
a preteen girl dressed as a boy.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.800
One critic said One Half
from the East is well-told

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.810
through appealing characters,
and that it sheds light

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.220
from a unique cultural
perspective on the link

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.180
between vastly different, rigidly
enforced rules for boys and girls

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.610
and gender identity issues.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.510
It's my pleasure to present
to you Nadia Hashimi.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.980
[ Applause ]

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.880
&gt;&gt; Nadia Hashimi: Hi everyone.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.450
It's a real pleasure
to be here today.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.670
We're in a really big
space, so I'm going to try

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.780
to have my voice carry enough.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.080
I have my phone with me.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.590
I swear this is just
to check time and not

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.140
because I'm going to
be texting anyone.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.710
So, I'll tell you a little bit
about where this story came from

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.710
and why I bothered writing it.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.000
As was mentioned, I
am a pediatrician.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.010
My family came to the United
States from Afghanistan.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.970
My parents came over in the early
1970s, and they came to Afghanistan

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.760
because they wanted to kind of
explore the opportunities here.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.480
But they didn't come because
things were as bad in Afghanistan

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.400
as they are, or have been in
the past couple of decades.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.960
So, I come from a family where
my mother grew up with sisters

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.140
who all went to school,
who were all encouraged

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.800
to pursue higher education.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.350
My mother became an
engineer in Afghanistan.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.780
Her sisters worked in the
airlines, at the United Nations,

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.400 position:56%
in all areas of professional fields.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.380
So, I grew up with that
information, with that knowledge,

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.990
with that picture of Afghanistan
in my mind, of it being a country

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.830 position:56%
where women could do lots of things.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.130
And as I was growing up,

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.620
I was watching a very
different Afghanistan.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.920
And we know that the history

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.170
of Afghanistan has
been really tumultuous,

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.630
it's been really violent, and
it's been very disappointing.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.670
Especially for what it's
done to the rights of women.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.420
And as a young girl, I was always
very aware that I had a lot

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.860
of opportunities and I had a lot of
liberties that not every girl had.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.420
I had a family who
really supported me.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.530
And if I said that I wanted to be
a doctor they would say, "Well,

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.200 position:56%
let's see how we can get you there."

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.380
So, I became a doctor
and about a year later,

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.270
I decided I wanted to
try writing stories.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.060
I'd been a someone who
loved reading always,

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.370
and books I thought were a way

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.750
to explore the world,
to explore myself.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.250
And I decided to try writing.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.030
And to try writing, I decided I
wanted to write about the thing

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.360
that was most important to me,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.320
the stories that were
most compelling to me.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.350
And as a girl who grew up in a
country where I could be so much

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.840
and do so much, I decided I
wanted to write about the struggle

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.920
that girls in other parts
of the world experienced.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.900
So, my first novel was
actually for adults

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.990
and it's called The Pearl
That Broke its Shell.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.430
And it's the story of a
young girl in Afghanistan,

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.860
and she is the youngest in a
sisterhood of only daughters.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.330
So, this family decides to take --

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.890
make use of an old custom in
Afghanistan, and they decide

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.720
to make this young
girl a bacha posh.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.290
And what a bacha posh is,
is a girl dressed as a boy.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.830
She's transformed just physically

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.580
and reintroduced into
society as a boy.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.770
But when she becomes a boy in
Afghanistan, she gets a whole lot

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.240 position:56%
of liberties and privileges that she
wouldn't otherwise have as a girl.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.460
And she begins to take
on a confidence

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.760
that she wouldn't otherwise
have as a girl

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.510
because there are things
that she can do.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.780
She can raise her voice;
she can run in the streets.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.630 position:56%
She can look people directly in the
eye when she's having conversations.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.510
The expectations on a
girl are very different.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.180
And we see that happen
not just in Afghanistan,

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.020
but we do see that happen
in other countries too.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.070
I've seen that happen in
the United States as well.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.970
Not just for me when I was a
girl, but I've seen it happen

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.630
for me throughout my career, also.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.700
So, this young girl in my
first novel is transformed

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.760
into a bacha posh, and all of a
sudden she's got a whole new life

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.150
and she's got a whole new
set of potentials within her,

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.720
until she becomes a child
bride at the age of 13.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.480
And then she's got to
figure out how she's going

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.170
to survive these circumstances.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.520
Now the conversations that stemmed
from that book, the book clubs

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.900
that I've been able to Skype in
with, the feedback that I got

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.730
from emails, was amazing.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.070
People were really -- they
found a lot to talk about.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.400
You know, what is the
meaning of gender?

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.700
What are the rights of girls?

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.000
How much does religion and culture
have to do with what we expect

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.080 position:56%
from our daughters and what kinds of
limitations we put on our daughters?

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.180
And so, from that came
the idea that,

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.400
why not do this for
a younger audience?

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.340
Why not start these conversations
with a crowd that is maybe younger

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.060 position:56%
but still smart enough, and so tuned

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.310
in to what we need
to be talking about?

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.770
Where we can change the
expectations from a younger age.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.580
So, that's the reason that I
wanted to write this story.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.730
And in this story, we meet
a young character, Obadiah.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:06:00.140
And Obadiah is also in a
family that only has daughters.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.220
And Obadiah's father is injured
badly in a bombing in Afghanistan.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.820
And we do hear about these
things that continue happen to --

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.170
happening in Afghanistan.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.750
So, Obadiah's father
is badly injured

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.280
and their circumstances
change drastically.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.950
So, whereas her father was once a
bread winner, he's now demoralized.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.250
He's an amputee.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.080
He can no longer provide for
his family, and they're forced

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.330 position:56%
to move back to a village to get the
support of their extended family.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.870
And from there, they decide, at
the encouragement of an aunt,

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.270
to maybe make Obadiah
into a bacha posh,

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.850
and maybe this will bring
good fortune unto the family

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:45.260
and boost her father's spirits
and help to restore them a bit.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.870
And so, Obadiah, who has lived
10 years of her life as a girl,

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.630
all of a sudden becomes a boy.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.800
And she has to figure out,
what does this mean about her?

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.340
How different is she just
because she is a boy?

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.750 position:56%
And she, in school, meets another
child, another boy, once she becomes

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:09.900 position:56%
that boy, and this boy kind of takes
an interest in her in a curious way.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.610
And then she figures out that
this boy has a secret too.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.940
So, I'll read to you a
short passage from the book.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.580
And in this scene, this is where
Obadiah has met this other boy

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.470
and has figured out
what's going on here.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:28.160
"I take a deep breath in
and exhale my question.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.460
Careful to lower my voice,

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.170
even though there no
one within yards of us.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.700
'Are you a bacha posh?'

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.670
'Of course I am,' he
says with a funny smile.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.960
His voice is softer than it
was the last time we spoke.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.660
Something heavy in the
air between us disappears.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.000
I can't help but stare
at his lips and his face.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.610
Just for a second, I
can see him as a girl.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:54.900
I picture him with long hair
and his face makes total sense.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.940
'But I'm not new to
this like you are.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.970 position:56%
You better get used to it quickly
or you'll attract a lot of attention

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:02.300
and it won't be good attention.'

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.600
I bite my lip.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.900
I know he's right.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.510
Several kids look at
me with curiosity.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:09.030
Others don't notice me at all.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.620
Then there are there rare
ones that stare outright,

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.700
like they've spotted
an extinct animal.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.900
'What should I do?'

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.200
'You're a bacha posh.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.600
Forget everything else
and be a boy.'

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.600 position:56%
'But I've been a girl my whole life.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.890
How can I forget everything?'

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:27.910
'It's not as hard you might think.'

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.040
He fidgets with his
hat, adjusting the rim

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.260 position:56%
so it shields his eyes from the sun.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.300
'I think I can help you.'

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.600
'What's your name?'

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.900
I ask him.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.120
'Rahim.' His grin is mischievous.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.600
'Rahim,' I repeat.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.390
'And before?'

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:43.740
'Rahima,' he says.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.260
His grin fades.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.740
Her grin fades?

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.310
What should I call this person?

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.500
I figure he won't like me very
much if I refer to him as a girl

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.180
in any way, even if
it's just in my head.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:58.930
I make up my mind that Rahim
will be a boy and nothing else.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.320
But now that name sounds like
it belongs to someone else.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.850
I don't think I would
even turn my head

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.870
if I heard someone calling
Rahima on the street.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.320
Is it possible to leave
your name behind?

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.510
Could I ever not be Obadiah?

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:11.960
I can't imagine it.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.540
That might be what's holding
me back from being like Rahim.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.850
We sit on an old tire left on
the side of the schoolyard.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.890
Rahim is wearing jeans thinned
at the knees and a polo t-shirt.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.050
I'm wearing cargo pants
meant for a boy younger

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:27.640
than me, so my ankles stick out.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.740
'Was it hard for you?'

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.510
He does not ask me what I mean.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.700
He does not shy away
from the question.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.010
He knows why I'm asking.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:40.100
It's nice being able to
talk to someone who gets me.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.880
In the beginning, I was a
girl dressed in boy clothes.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.760
That was really hard.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.560
I didn't know how to act.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.630
I wanted to cross my legs
and fix my head scarf.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.270
He laughs at the thought of it.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.780
I laugh, too, trying to
imagine what Rahim would look

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.820
like with a head scarf
tied to his wizard's hat.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.670
It's as silly as the American
actor dressed like a grandmother.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:03.930
But then I realized I couldn't
be a girl dressed in boy clothes.

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:07.110
I had to be a boy wearing
my clothes.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:08.540
This is the best thing.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.800
You can wake up and throw on
those ugly too-short pants

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.410
and run to school.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:16.010
You should up jump and down
and be loud when you want

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.150
to be and eat all you can.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.760
You should tell people what
you think, score goals,

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.150
and let your father look at you

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:25.530
like you're the future
president of Afghanistan.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:27.090
'How do I do that?'

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:28.390
Rahim stares at me.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.180
I start to regret my question.

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:34.300
I feel like he's about to pick me
apart in that painful way he does.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.600
'Stand up,' he says.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.450
His voice goes from
delicate to rough in no time.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.180
I do it, wondering
for a split second

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.440
if I have tire treads
on my backside.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.690
'You remember what I
told you the other day?

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.300
Look at the way you stand,
the way you hide your eyes.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:51.100
Being a boy is not all in
your pants; it's in your head.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.400
It's in your shoulders.'

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.370
He's jabbing at me
to make his point.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:55.770
'Cut it out,' I mutter.

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.590
'What?' Rahim cocks his head to
the side and flicks my earlobe.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.960
I swipe at his hand but I'm too
late and get nothing but air.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.210
'I said cut it out.'

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:06.510
I'm annoyed.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.220
Rahim has a way of spoiling
conversations with his antics.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.490
He palms my forehead and
pushes me toward the ground.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:14.150
This time I kick at him.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.530
I fall to the ground too,
but manage to bring my foot

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.470
to his shin on the way down.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.660
He lets out a howl and
claps triumphantly.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.280
'Better,' he says.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.580
'Stand tall.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.590
Stick your chin out like
you're daring me to hit it.

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:27.890
Set your feet apart.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:29.190
Keep your palms open.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:30.970
Let your arms swing while you walk.

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:34.570
If you hear something behind
you, turn around and look for it.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.130
When you run, slap your
whole foot on the ground.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:38.590
Not just your toes.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:40.950
Are you carrying eggs
in your pockets?'

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.510
'Eggs?' 'No?

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.240
Then don't walk like you are.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.060
Run like you're not
afraid of cracking shells.'

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.730
He points at my feet, not
just my chin and my elbows.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.820
I listen to his words
and feel my body loosen.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.330
It's easier to breathe.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.050
Why is that?

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:57.590
'What else?'

00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:59.850
'You're a boy, not
a bacha posh, Obide.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:02.380
If you get that, there
is nothing else.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.190
'Boys aren't supposed
to have weaknesses.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:06.330
Boys are built of rock and metal.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.930
We eat meat and show our teeth.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:10.460
And girls?

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.050
Girls are made of flower
pedals and paper bags.

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.590
They eat berries and sip hot
tea like something might jump

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.870 position:56%
out of the hot water and bite them.'

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.170
I was torn.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.540
Half of me angry at his depiction
of girls, and the other half

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.620
of me proud not to be one for now.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.670
'I don't know if that true,' I say.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:28.500
I don't want to contradict
him but I've never thought

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.790
of myself as a paper bag.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.090
'Tell me honestly.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.020
You're happy being a bacha posh?'

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.320
'Is that even a question?

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.880
Why would I want to
be anything else?'

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.450
He looks at me as if I've
got potatoes for ears.

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.010
'You know what it is to be a girl.

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.560
Was it anything worth being?'

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.120
I'm not sure how to answer.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.490
He starts to stroll the
length of the schoolyard.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:51.510
I follow, trying to
synchronize my pace with his.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:53.980
Left foot, right foot, left foot.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:58.260
His legs are longer than mine
and I fall off beat often.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.220
'Me? I didn't like it one bit.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.520
I didn't realize I had a choice

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.100
or I would have asked my
mother to change me years ago.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.540
Do you know what I used
to do when I was a girl?

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.660
Help in the kitchen, help with
the laundry, serve tea to guests,

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.090
run from the boys in the streets.'

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:14.880
Well, I did all those things
too until a few weeks ago.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.180
Did I hate it?

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.480
Maybe I did.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.110
Maybe it was all awful and
I didn't know any better.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:21.520
Maybe everything had been blurry

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.660
until this exact moment,
this one conversation.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.180
'It just feels so strange
right now,' I confess.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.480
'It'll get easier.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.780
It sort of just happens.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.760
For me, it happened the
day I got this hat.'

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.610
He points to his blue cap.

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:38.420
'The day I got this, I knocked over
four boys playing Gorsai and stayed

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.960
on my feet for the whole game.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.320
I haven't fallen once as
long as I have this hat on.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.000
It's my good luck charm.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.090
Stick close by and it'll
rub off on you too.'

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:50.040
Rahim looks over at his friends who
are heading back into the school.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.760
I feel lucky to have
this exciting new friend.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.600
If we were girls, we
wouldn't have ever met.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.850
It's only because we're
a special kind of boy

00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:59.990
that we have found each other.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:02.750
Maybe his hat has rubbed
off on me already.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:06.390
When he turns back to me, I
can see the girl in his eyes.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:10.290
He takes my hand and squeezes it
between his long, thin fingers.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.890
'Nobody helped me when I first
changed, but I'm going to help you.

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:15.820
We'll be like brothers,' he laughs.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.120
I laugh too.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.980
Not because he's funny,
but because I'm happy.

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.130
He always seems to have a look on
his face, and now that I can stare

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.980
at him straight on, and not
out of the corner of my eye,

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.660
I can see what that look really is.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:32.510
Rahim looks like he
can do anything."

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:38.350
[ Applause ]

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:40.830
Thank you.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:42.710
So, you know, one of the
reasons that I mentioned I wanted

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:47.600
to write this story was, you
know, books are multipurpose tools

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.880
and one thing that they do
is they can impart knowledge

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.920
about another culture, about
another set of customs,

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.530
about another religion, about
another geographical area.

00:14:56.530 --> 00:15:00.610
And we can travel with books and
that's what we do in these stories.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:02.900
But I think there are also
really good ways to learn --

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.530
to use these books to
stimulate conversations

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:08.320
where children can start
to look inside too.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.160
And so, for kids who are
picking up these books,

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.200
you know, our kids are smart.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.750
They're smart readers and
they're able to grasp things

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:16.870
that we might not think
that they can.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:21.110 position:56%
But I've been talking to a lot of
young students, and they really have

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:24.160
that ability to perceive
themselves in stories,

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.400
to pick out from characters
what they relate to

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.770
and what they don't relate to.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:30.470
And I think there's a
lot that they can learn

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.650
from a story that's more
of a mirror for them.

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.210
Where they start to look inside
and think about what kind

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:40.020
of a character they would want
to be in their own journeys.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.560
And I know that's what I
did when I was a child,

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.630
reading under the covers
past my bed time.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:47.400
And I hope that that's
what, you know,

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.510
kids will do with the
stories that I'm sharing.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:51.900
And I think through
the conversations

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:55.480
that we've been having, that
is what we've been seeing.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.060
So, I'm going to leave it there and
I'm going open it up to questions.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.590
I think we have a few minutes
if I've timed this right.

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:05.530
We have about 10 minutes for
questions and I will take questions

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:10.460
on anything, and from all
ages, so kids feel to speak up.

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:11.760
Yes?

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Hi, so, I
read all of your novels.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:16.640
I'm currently reading A
House Without Windows,

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.630
and my friend and our
buddy read them.

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:22.040
And it's just interesting to see
the tension between the women

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.740
from Afghanistan of old
versus in this book.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.040
Because I find myself gasping.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.060
Like, you can't think that
you can't do that, you know?

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.760
And I giggle every time I read one

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.260
of the recipes for
the -- is it jadu?

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.560
The little spell?

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.860
&gt;&gt; Nadia Hashimi: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.740
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: How did
you come up with those?

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.230
It tickles me every time.

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:41.530
&gt;&gt; Nadia Hashimi: It's a --

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:44.640
so the question is actually
about my third adult novel,

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.940
which I get to plug right now

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.780
because she brought
it up, not me, right?

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.420
So, that's A House Without
Windows, which is a story

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.410
of a woman who's imprisoned
in Afghanistan for --

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:54.890
she's accused of murdering
her husband.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:58.720
She meets other women who are in
prison for crimes of immorality.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.530
It's a very loose and vague term.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:05.350
And her -- the mother and that
character, is a very colorful woman

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:08.960
who is a skilled sorceress.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.970 position:56%
So, she practices jadu, sort of this
black magic that's in Afghanistan.

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:14.830
That was a fun thing for
me to be able to throw

00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:16.870
in these little bits of culture.

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.100
And so, how did I come
up with all of that?

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:23.690
Well, I didn't have to come up with
it because, in my husband's family,

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:28.720
there is someone a generation back,
or two generations back actually,

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.360
who sort of dabbled in
this area of black magic.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.160
And so, some of the
things that they --

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.110
the stories that are passed down
to us, the things that she did

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:42.380
like chopping up snake skins
and folding it into the spinach

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.780
and feeding it to her nemesis and
then watching her nemesis kind

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:48.360
of itch and crawl at the
next family gathering.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.760
So, those are stories that have
been passed down in our family.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.400
And there is sort of this
superstitious belief that threads

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.250
through Afghanistan, and then
some rare people are able to take

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:00.910
that into the realm of black magic.

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.470
And I thought that was such
a cool concept that I wanted

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.220
to incorporate it into the story.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.520
So.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.820
&gt;&gt;Speaker 1: It's awesome,
I love it.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.120
&gt;&gt; Nadia Hashimi: Thank you.

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.440
&gt;&gt;Nadia Hashimi: Hi.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.740
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Hi.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.040
It's such a pleasure meeting
you, because we chose your book

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:21.930
for our book club and its coming
this Tuesday when the moon is low.

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:25.260
What I want to know though, you're
a doctor as well as a writer,

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.960
which of these professions
do you like?

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.290
Medicine or writing?

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:31.590
&gt;&gt; Nadia Hashimi: Yeah.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:32.890
That's a very tough question.

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:34.600
So, I always compare it to
being invited to two parties

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:38.210 position:56%
on a Saturday night and not
knowing which one you want to go to.

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:40.900
I think, you know, as a
doctor, you get to do so much.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.730
You're -- and as, especially as
a pediatrician, you're involved

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:48.070
in a family's life at some
really poignant moments,

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:52.090 position:56%
some really sensitive times, and you
can make a really big difference.

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:55.110
Even just by reassuring,
if nothing else.

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:58.830
I also really enjoy what
I'm able to do with books.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.810
I'm able to reach, I think,
more people through my stories.

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:04.770
I'm able to reach people
across the world.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:08.410
And, you know, when I get messages
from people that they were inspired

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.440
or touched or were able to gain,
you know, some kind of hope

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:15.730
for themselves through my fictional
characters, it's pretty humbling.

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:19.800
So, I think they're both incredible
fields and I everyday feel blessed

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.830
that I can do both
of them in some way.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.130
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Thank you.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.210
&gt;&gt; Nadia Hashimi: Thank you.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:28.180
&gt;&gt;Speaker 3: This might
not be a fair question,

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.210
but what future do you
see for Afghanistan

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:34.290
and what are the implications
for women?

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:36.310
&gt;&gt; Nadia Hashimi: So, that's a
really great question is, you know,

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:37.850
and it's a very complicated one.

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.850
What is the future for
women in Afghanistan?

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:44.880 position:56%
I think it's very easy to look at
the day-to-day events in Afghanistan

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.580
and see setbacks and
see disappointments,

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.570
because those things
happen all the time.

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:51.640
And not just for women
in Afghanistan,

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:55.180
but for the general population
and security in Afghanistan.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:58.540 position:56%
There are, you know, recent
attacks either specifically on women

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:02.050
or on the broader population when
you have more extremist elements

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.840
who still are making their
presence very much felt.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:10.030 position:56%
But when I take a step back and look
at what has happened in Afghanistan

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:13.220
between the time of the Taliban
-- during the time of the Taliban,

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.270
I mean, we all know that it
was just really terrible there.

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:19.190
And I've spoken with afghan
-- an afghan MP, actually,

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:22.610
a parliamentarian who said it
was the darkest time for women

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:27.880
in Afghanistan, not being able to
be really part of the world at all.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.700
To go from that, to know that in
2014 there was a woman who ran

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.580
on the ticket for vice
presidency in Afghanistan,

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:39.340 position:56%
to know there are female journalists
who are sharing the stories

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:42.170
of what's happening in Afghanistan
with their fellow countrymen.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:46.180
To know that there are women who
are teachers, who are performers,

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.310
who are expanding their
role in the arts,

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:50.190
in the sciences and all fields.

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:51.570
They're working so hard to do that.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.420
And yes, they're facing
a lot of backlash.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:57.030 position:56%
Yes, they have more obstacles than I
have had growing up in this country.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:01.470
But I think that they are working
so hard to be their own heroes,

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:04.800
that I can't imagine them giving
up the fight at any point.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.540 position:56%
So, as long they have an environment
that at all opens the doors

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.950
for them, I think they're going
to continue to make progress.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:17.490
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Hi.

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:18.790
&gt;&gt; Nadia Hashimi: Hi.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:20.090
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: What
sort of research went

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:21.390
into doing these types of books?

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:22.690
&gt;&gt; Nadia Hashimi: So, all
different kinds of research.

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:26.420 position:56%
I -- luckily, I have my family to
turn to, and I have the rich stories

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.640
that come from both my family,
from my husband's family.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.190
And then of course I
do research making sure

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:33.490
that if there are political events

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:35.110
that are happening at
certain key moments.

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:38.140
If I do, for example, in my
historical fiction aspect,

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:43.550 position:56%
I go through and I use archived sort
of information that anthropologists

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:46.530
and others have put together
in the form of textbooks.

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:50.940
I use photographs a lot so that
I can paint a geographic picture

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.950
of the area that I'm talking about.

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.860
And I'm pretty diligent, so
even if I talk about, you know,

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.480
the trees that are in an area,
I make sure that I research

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.980
and know the species of trees that
are growing in one particular area,

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:07.290
because I do want to create an
authentic picture of that country.

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:10.400
So, the research is
actually a really fun part.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.320
I -- for my recent adult book,

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.570
I was able to use a human rights
watch report on the situation,

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:19.010
who had interviewed women in
prison in Afghanistan and gone

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:22.340 position:56%
through their arrest registries and,
you know, faced off with the women

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:25.610
to figure out what had happened
and collected their cases.

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:31.370
So, the research is an
incredible part of it.

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:32.670
Yeah.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:34.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Hi.

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.480
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: All right.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.780
Well, hi. I had a quick question.

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:42.750
Well, not that quick maybe, but
what's one of your favorite moments

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:47.770
from The Pearl That Broke its Shell
and from When the Moon is Low?

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:49.530
&gt;&gt; Nadia Hashimi: Okay, from
The Pearl That Broke its Shell,

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:51.490
I think one of my favorite
moments come from one

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:52.790
of my favorite characters.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:57.070
And it is -- and this will say
a lot about me personally, okay,

00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:00.930
but there is a moment where
there is a wedding ceremony

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:04.750
and they have brought a religious
figure, this Mullad, to come

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:07.530 position:56%
and officiate this and say a prayer.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:10.940
And as he's going through, the
prayer of course is in Arabic,

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:15.740
and he stumbles and he messes up
a word in it because, you know,

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.230
Afghans don't speak Arabic,

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:21.720
but we learn the prayers
sort of by hearing them.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.610
And nobody realizes
that he messes up,

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:28.750
except for this young girl's very
spunky aunt who's always there

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:30.520
and who's always in her corner.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.800
And she points out, in
front of a room full

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.600
of people, that he screwed up.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.830
And he repeats it and she's
like, "You screwed up again."

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:40.790
And she calls him on it.

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:43.100
And when she calls him
on it, she's showing him

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.160
that he really is not
an authentic voice.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.460
He's not a spokesperson.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.630
He is not an authority
for the religion.

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:51.470
That they own their religions
themselves and that he is not

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:54.900
above being fallible
and completely wrong.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:59.270
And in that moment, I loved that
character and I wish I could do

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:01.820
that at all times, everywhere I go.

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:05.380
Thank you for the question.

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:08.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: So, this is a kind of
more basic question, but what is one

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.150
of the favorite books
that you've written?

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:12.450
And --

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:15.180
&gt;&gt; Nadia Hashimi: I get that
question a lot, and it's a really,

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:17.650
really tough question, because
sometimes I feel like it's,

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:20.360
you know, of your children,
which one is your favorite?

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.610
I think I like them all in
sort of a different way.

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:27.510
This one of course right now
is sort of very near and dear

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:30.820
to me, because I like writing.

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:34.330
I like talking about women's issues
and girl's empowerment and all

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:37.830
of that stuff, and what it means
to be a global citizen really.

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:39.610
That's what we've been
talking about lately

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:44.090
for children of any
kind of identity.

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:48.570 position:56%
And to be able to have this book and
have conversations with young people

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:53.240 position:56%
who are really so smart, and who are
going to go on to do amazing things,

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.400
and if I can at least be one
conversation that happens

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.790
on your way to being amazing,

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:00.490
then that's an incredible
opportunity for me.

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:02.970
So, right now this book
is giving me a lot.

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:14.260
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: I read One Half
from The East and I liked it.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.220
Do you think you're going to
write anymore children's books?

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:18.520
&gt;&gt; Nadia Hashimi: I am.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.840
So, I'm really glad to
hear that you liked it.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.280
Thank you for reading
it and I'm working

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.180
on my second children's
book right now.

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:28.490
It should be out, we think
in the winter of 2018.

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:32.670
I'll be finishing it soon, but it
takes that long for a book to go

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:35.420
from something that I've
written, to an actual book

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:36.720
that you can hold in your hand.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.340
Because there's so many people
that work to make it so.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:42.500
But I really love writing
and it's my passion now

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.980
and so I don't think I'll stop.

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.700
So, I hope you keep reading.

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.430
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Thank you.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:49.770
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Hi, I'm from Texas

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:53.530
and our book club has chosen your
Pearl novel for our next book.

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:55.380
I haven't read it yet, but I'd

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:59.180
like to let them know next
month how you got started,

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:01.520
having your first book
published, and how--

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.420
what, just simply what
the process was for you.

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:07.730
&gt;&gt; Nadia Hashimi: It was sort of
a very amazing process for me.

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:10.050
When I started writing,
I wrote for myself.

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:12.500
I wasn't sure what
would happen to it.

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.820
I didn't tell anybody
that I was writing

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.800
because you never know
what's going to happen,

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.100
what's going to come of it.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.990
I didn't know anything about
the industry, so I sat down

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:23.790
and I Googled, "How do
you get a book published?"

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:27.030
And what Google told me was that
you have to get an agent first

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:29.160
and then an agent will submit it.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:33.270 position:56%
And so, I started writing early on
in -- actually when I was expecting.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:34.570
And I had a deadline.

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.400
I need to finish this before
this baby comes into my world.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.150
And I wanted it out to literary
agents submitted before the baby

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:42.450
came in.

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:43.750
And that's what I did.

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:47.540
And I was in labor when I got
a phone call from an agent

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.030
who wanted to represent my books.

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:53.210
So, I will never forget my
publishing process, because it was

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:56.510
such a memorable moment where
I couldn't answer the phone.

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:59.190
And my husband had to
give her a call and say,

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:01.970
"She's not really into
talking right now."

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:09.580
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: Well, what's
your favorite author?

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:10.880
&gt;&gt; Nadia Hashimi: Who's
my favorite author?

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.420
Now that's a really,
really tough one,

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.150
because there are so
many authors, right?

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:15.920
And all these authors
are so different.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.640
Some write really good mysteries.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.660
Some just give us really smart
stories in a different way.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:23.120
Some take us into history.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.850
So, for me to pick my favorite
is really, really tough.

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:27.860
I will names a few.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.400
I love [inaudible] and not just

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:33.060
because he gave a great
plug for my first book.

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:37.370
I think Jhumpa Lahiri is amazing.

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:41.180
Joyce Carol Oates, who I
actually was able to sit at with

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.080
at dinner last night
with Joyce Carol Oates.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.380
She's amazing.

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:46.590
Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:51.930
And Judy Blume, who you might
recognize from some of that.

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.120
So, that's a handful,
but there's so many.

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:57.340
I learned something
from every single book.

00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.640
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: Thank you.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.190
&gt;&gt; Nadia Hashimi: Thank you.

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:03.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Do you
plan to write any books

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:05.900
for the children in Afghanistan?

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:07.770
&gt;&gt; Nadia Hashimi: So, the question
is, "Do I plan to write books

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:09.070
for the children in Afghanistan?"

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:14.050
And I think, you know, every book
that I write, I write for everyone.

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:17.530
And I write, you know, not just
for children to read this book

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:22.470 position:56%
in the United States or in Canada,
but I write it for a child anywhere.

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:25.170
And, you know, I write this
for children in Afghanistan

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:29.070
to see themselves as
strong, as capable,

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:31.980
as full of potential no matter
what clothes you're wearing.

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.010
No matter what your name is.

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:37.420
And I want that same message
to be conveyed to children

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:39.010
who are in this country too.

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:41.350
And in that way, I
think that, you know,

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:44.940
a story can really be
universal in at its core theme.

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.870
We should be able to find
something that we can relate to,

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:49.690
and I'm hoping that
this book will find ways

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:51.680
to relate to children everywhere.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.980
&gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Thank you.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.280
&gt;&gt; Nadia Hashimi: Thank you.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:55.910
All right, thank you
so much for your time.

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:57.440
I appreciate you all attending.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.120
Have a great festival.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.840
&gt;&gt; Automated: This has
been a presentation

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.820
of the Library of Congress.
