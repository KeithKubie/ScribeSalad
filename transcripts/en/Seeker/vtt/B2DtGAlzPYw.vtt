00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.340
The polar vortex is upon us!

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.380
Sinners turn up your local heat sources, prepare
for the oncoming snowpocalypse!

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.340
Where did this thing come from?

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.910
Hey cold ones, this is DNews, I’m Trace.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.140
If you’d asked me about the POLAR VORTEX
in 2013, I’d have assumed it was the bad

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.410
guy in some new cheesy superhero show.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.939
In 2014, when a blizzard and cold system struck
for some reason it got a new, catchy name:

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.699
the Polar Vortex.

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:36.440
It was so popular, Bloomberg joked it was
in the “uncontested lead” for “buzzword

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.540
of 2014”

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.490
This “new” meteorological term was everywhere!

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.930
Except that, the polar vortex as you know
it is a lie.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.480
It’s not new.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.620
What the media dubbed ‘the polar vortex’
is really just the arctic or polar jet stream,

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.980
also known as one of the “Westerlies,”
or circumpolar vortex; we’ve known about

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:54.980
it for decades.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.580
Though, now that we have a cute term for it,
we’re hearing it more!

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.800
You’re not imagining things.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.970
I’m about to say something confusing, but
trust me on this.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.041
The polar vortex is spilling out of the top
of the planet... scientists think… because

00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:07.170
of global warming.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.090
Yes, it’s getting colder because it’s
getting warmer.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.580
It’s called the “warm Arctic-cold continents”
pattern.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.190
Atmospheric science is complicated.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.890
But, again, the polar vortex isn’t a new
thing.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.590
In January 1985, we hit record cold temperatures,
negative 34 degrees in North Carolina, paired

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.660
with blizzards in the Northeast -- even Florida
was affected!

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.880
Then, in December of 1989, another very cold
huge blizzard hit, dropping record snow and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.610
dipping the temperature to zero in North Carolina
. They didn’t call it the polar vortex,

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.170
instead referring to “Cross-polar flow”
or the polar jet stream was pushing this cold

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.170
air onto us.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.050
Blizzards and polar air hit in 1977, ‘78,
‘82 ‘85, ‘89.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.470
In ‘93 they called it “the storm of the
century!”

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.780
‘96, 2008 you get it.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.030
In 2014, a bit of this jet stream shifted,
allowing polar air to “slosh out of the

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.361
bowl” on top of the planet.

00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:04.720
Jet streams and low-pressure systems were
hitting the U.S. almost every year -- all

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.830
thanks to this ‘polar vortex.’

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.960
OK.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.099
So.

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.680
What is this thing…

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.549
Here is the top of the Earth, just chilling.

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.560
That is a sweet Earth you might say.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.610
And that is the circumpolar vortex.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.610
A.k.a.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.799
‘The polar vortex.”

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.940
As the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
puts it: the jet stream is “wobbling”

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.939
because the circumpolar vortex is basically
a low-pressure cold system that is held in

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.659
place, by the west-to-east moving jet stream.

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:37.379
But in recent years, the oval-shaped jet stream
on top of our planet is breaking down.

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.109
It’s been on this trend for decades.

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:44.290
And, a study in October 2016’s Nature explores
how climate change is a possible cause.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.999
The warming of our planet is weakening the
polar jet stream, reducing sea ice and causing

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:50.999
this “sloshing of cold air.”

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:55.779
That cold air causes cold temperatures, and
crazy winter weather.

00:02:55.779 --> 00:03:00.420
On top of that, as the jet stream changes,
the polar vortex is shifting from North America

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.919
to Europe and Asia.

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:05.010
You can secretly cheer, but you’d be wrong
to do so.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.620
A weaker polar jet stream means more cold
air down away from the poles, not less -- it

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.939
might mean longer winters, with the polar
vortex showing up in March.

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:16.540
This stuff is really complicated.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.580
And, to further complicate things.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.629
There are two polar vortices!

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.379
One circumpolar vortex floats in the stratosphere,
which rests 50 kilometers above the Earth,

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:30.239
and another circumpolar vortex sits in troposphere
(between 5 and 20 kilometers).

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.519
So what you’re feeling on your frozen face,
is just the influence of these polar winds,

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.989
not necessarily the polar winds themselves.

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:37.989
Whew.

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.150
This could get chilly.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.300
Oh, and P.S. there are polar vortices at the
bottom of the planet, too.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.559
To be honest, as much as we humans love going
to the beach, we can only hope that the cold

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:50.659
air stays cold.

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.750
Because if that sea ice melts, we’re screwed.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.750
Global warming.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.019
Not only is it hotter, but it’s colder too.

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.209
Why doesn’t winter disprove global warming?

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.209
Don’t worry.

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.449
Got the answer to that for you right here.

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:05.629
I remember cold, probably why I have a MOP
of hair in that vid.

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.930
How do you feel about the media blowing up
these winter norms?

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.650
Tell us about it down in the comments, make
sure you come back here everyday for more

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.499
DNews and thanks for watching!
