about dark matter and how we know it

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910
about dark matter and how we know it
 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.470
about dark matter and how we know it
exists they show you a map of the

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480
exists they show you a map of the
 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.550

Milky Way our galaxy and then they say

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570
Milky Way our galaxy and then they say
 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.230

AHA dark matter must admit I don't

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240
AHA dark matter must admit I don't

follow the logic so how do we know

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810
follow the logic so how do we know
 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.179
follow the logic so how do we know
there's dark matter yeah hi Keith how do

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189
there's dark matter yeah hi Keith how do
 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.849
there's dark matter yeah hi Keith how do
we know that Dark Matter exists well

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859
we know that Dark Matter exists well
 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.520
