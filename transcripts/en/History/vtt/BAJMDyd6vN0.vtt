00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:01.601
[rock music playing]

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:03.002
MIKE: Is that it?

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:05.004
It certainly looks like it.

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:07.574
[cheering]

00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:10.076
Oh, my goodness gracious.

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:11.344
Yeah, man.

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:13.246
We found Aeromith's van.

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.581
It's history, baby.

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:15.949
Raymond's boots on the ground.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:16.683
He's animated.

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:17.650
He's excited.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.251
This is cool.

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:36.770
I'm afraid to
say how long it is,

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.205
but it's like 40 years has
we've been in this thing.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.608
I just flashed
back to when we first

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:43.943
started the band because
it was an amazing thing.

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:46.813
All of a sudden, here's
the thing that we lived in.

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:48.515
It was like our dressing room.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:51.084
It was like a rolling hotel.

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:54.254
I'll tell you right now, I
have a picture of the inside

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:55.855
of this van with me in it.
- Really?

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:57.457
- Get out of here.
- Yes I do.

00:00:57.457 --> 00:00:58.525
Yes I do.
- Do you really?

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:00.427
I have a picture of
me inside this van.

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:02.729
It was-- it-- it was in
the "Draw The Line" book.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.166
There's a picture of me and
Steven Tyler, and Joey Kramer,

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.734
and Joe Perry inside--
MIKE: Yeah, from the back door.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.102
Inside the van
from the back door.

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:10.036
FRANK: But in the windows--

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:10.937
That's cool.

00:01:10.937 --> 00:01:11.971
MIKE: Which one are you?

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:12.906
RAYMOND: That's me
with the long hair.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:13.740
MIKE: Oh, that's
you right there.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.774
RAY: Yeah, that's me all right.

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:15.875
[laughing]

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:18.311
Back when my hair was brown.

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:21.014
RAYMOND: We put the band
together originally in 1970.

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:23.716
I was around until
about almost 1972.

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:26.186
And then I left the band,
and I moved up to Maine.

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:27.687
I wanted to be a hippie.

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:29.522
And then about a year
later, Steven called me up.

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:30.990
He said, we just
signed our first album.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.792
Dude, I want you to come
back to work for the band.

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:34.761
So I came back to work for
the band, not as a musician,

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:36.796
but as one of the guys
in that organization.

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:38.364
I decided, listen,
I have a good idea.

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:39.799
Why don't we start a
merchandise company.

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.770
I redesigned the Aerosmith logo
to the one that we use today,

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.538
and I went into the
merchandise business with them.

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:47.774
And that's what I did
for about eight years.

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.843
So I was with them
altogether until about 1979.

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:50.877
Yeah.

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:53.246
Look, look, look,
look, look, the rug.

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:56.749
That's the rug.
Look, it's the rug.

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.218
This is it, baby.

00:01:58.218 --> 00:01:59.619
Cool.
Cool.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.420
Get out of here.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.421
This is it.

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:04.657
This is the Aerosmith
van from 1970.

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:07.360
MIKE: Raymond is so
excited and so jacked up,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.561
that he's like,
dude, take a picture

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:09.896
of me in this same spot.

00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:11.364
Get the rug in.

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:12.565
There it is, right there, man.

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:13.833
RAYMOND: All right, man.

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:16.002
I mean, you couldn't even
write this kind of stuff.

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:19.539
It's taken me back, because
I remember the van just the way

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:20.440
it is like this.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.641
There was like six of us.

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.443
There are five guys in
the band and Mark Lehman,

00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:25.278
who owned the van.

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:27.380
And we would play jobs
up in New Hampshire.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.017
We'd drive from Boston up
to New Hampshire for $125,

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:33.419
that after a gas, and
the tolls, and the food,

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:36.389
and back, we'd all make
like about $3 a piece.

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.926
And it just reminded me
of the humble beginnings,

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:42.295
and I look at where
they've gone today.

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:43.796
It's just amazing.
- Look at the paint.

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:46.766
So who painted this?

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:49.936
RAYMOND: Mark Lehman, who was
the guy who owned the van,

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:52.405
had a friend in Boston,
that was like an artist.

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:55.308
So he decided to do it all
chrome version of himself.

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:56.676
And he came up.

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:57.577
FRANK: That's like the keep
on trucking dude or something.

00:02:57.577 --> 00:02:58.711
Oh, that's him.
That's Mark.

00:02:58.711 --> 00:02:59.679
FRANK: It's him?
MIKE: That's the guy that drove?

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:00.179
RAYMOND: That's
what he looked like.

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:01.147
Yeah.

00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:02.248
MIKE: Oh, that's
what he looked like?

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:03.082
RAYMOND: That's what
he looked like exactly.

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:04.484
MIKE: Yeah.
- No, no, no.

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:06.419
In the song, in the song which
says, "bald as an egg at 18,"

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.087
that's what he's talking about.

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:09.289
Oh, he was 18 and bald?

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:10.390
RAYMOND: He's
talking about that.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.457
FRANK: Yeah.

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:12.358
RAYMOND: That's who
he's talking about.

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:13.026
MIKE: Oh, my gosh.
FRANK: Wow.

00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:24.203
After I left the band, I
heard a story that they had

00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:25.738
a foreign [inaudible]
Mark, and he just

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:27.307
disappeared into nowhere, man.

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:28.841
Raymond's like, Mark took off.

00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:31.744
We had no idea where he
was, and when he took off,

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.880
he took the van.
He owned it.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.849
And now, I guess this is where
it's been all these years.

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.752
The whole thing
just disappeared.

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:44.457
Joe and Mark were good friends
before we formed the band.

00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:45.725
This is definitely the van.

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:46.960
There's no doubt about it.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.294
This is it.
MIKE: Congratulations, man.

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:49.362
RAYMOND: You found it, man.
FRANK: This is pretty cool.

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:50.663
MIKE: That's all you
need to hear, man.

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:51.731
FRANK: Yeah.

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:52.999
A real important
thing here is that that

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:55.234
is the first time that
Aerosmith was ever written out.

00:03:55.234 --> 00:03:57.737
Now, we never wound
up using a logo.

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:00.907
I myself designed the
logo that we use today,

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:03.810
but that's the first time
it was ever written out.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.979
FRANK: Phil's getting
awful quiet over there.

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:07.814
I can see his eyes getting big.

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:09.482
The wheels are spinning.

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:10.650
It's hitting him.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.018
How did you guys
come up with the name?

00:04:12.018 --> 00:04:14.253
Well, Joey Kramer, apparently
when he was in high school,

00:04:14.253 --> 00:04:15.722
used to scribble
names for bands.

00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:17.357
And that's one of the
names that he came up with.

00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:20.059
MIKE: Aerosmith, huh?
RAYMOND: Yeah.

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:22.395
So he had a vision
of being in a band.

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:23.196
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:24.530
Yeah, definitely.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.099
He was spending his time in
class writing names of bands

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:26.799
down.

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:27.734
Exactly, exactly, yeah.

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:29.369
He was destined
to be a musician.

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:30.069
Exactly.

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:31.137
It was meant to be.

00:04:31.137 --> 00:04:33.873
When Raymond actually
confirmed the fact

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:37.577
that it was the real thing,
the excitement in him

00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:38.778
got me excited.

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:40.213
MIKE: I very much
appreciate you coming out

00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:41.881
here on such a short notice.
- Yeah.

00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:44.784
I'm back in 1970
again, and I felt

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:48.254
like, you know what, I had a
lot of good times in this van.

00:04:48.254 --> 00:04:49.255
And I'm glad that we found it.
