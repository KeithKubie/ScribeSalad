the prime example of the kind of field
 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.850
the prime example of the kind of field
which didn't obey these axioms was

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860
which didn't obey these axioms was
 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.910
which didn't obey these axioms was

Maxwell's electromagnetic fields as as
it occurs in quantum electrodynamics

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250
it occurs in quantum electrodynamics
 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.039
it occurs in quantum electrodynamics
quantum electrodynamics is a theory

quantum electrodynamics is a theory
 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.380
quantum electrodynamics is a theory
which doesn't involve this phenomenon of

which doesn't involve this phenomenon of
 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.480
which doesn't involve this phenomenon of
symmetry breaking but once it was clear

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490
symmetry breaking but once it was clear
 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.690
symmetry breaking but once it was clear
that there were fields of the maximal

type which which didn't obey the the
 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.749
type which which didn't obey the the
axioms then the way was opened to

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759
axioms then the way was opened to
 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.450
axioms then the way was opened to
introducing these fields of this type in

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460
introducing these fields of this type in
 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.590
introducing these fields of this type in
to the theory kind of theory which Nambu

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600
to the theory kind of theory which Nambu
 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.600
to the theory kind of theory which Nambu
which started of of symmetry breaking

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610
which started of of symmetry breaking
 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.840
which started of of symmetry breaking
and that's essentially what what

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850
and that's essentially what what
 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.220
and that's essentially what what
happened to me over a weekend during

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230
happened to me over a weekend during
 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.440
happened to me over a weekend during
which I gradually realized that I knew

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450
which I gradually realized that I knew
 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.240
which I gradually realized that I knew
two things which had to be brought

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250
two things which had to be brought
 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.510
two things which had to be brought
together it was related to the fact that

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520
together it was related to the fact that
 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.980
together it was related to the fact that
I had read papers not long before by

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990
I had read papers not long before by
 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.570
I had read papers not long before by
Julian Schwinger who was one of the

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580
Julian Schwinger who was one of the
 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.860
Julian Schwinger who was one of the
people who shared the quantum

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870
people who shared the quantum
 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.070
people who shared the quantum
electrodynamics prize and that was 65 I

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080
electrodynamics prize and that was 65 I
 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.930
electrodynamics prize and that was 65 I
think and he had a way of formulating

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940
think and he had a way of formulating
 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.760
think and he had a way of formulating
that theory which was a little bit

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770
that theory which was a little bit
 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.100
that theory which was a little bit
different from what most people

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110
different from what most people
 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.510
different from what most people
preferred and it it resulted in some

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520
preferred and it it resulted in some
 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.890
preferred and it it resulted in some
equations which were explicitly

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900
 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.820
violating apparently violating the rules

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830
violating apparently violating the rules
 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:18.160
violating apparently violating the rules
of Einstein relativity theory but the

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170
of Einstein relativity theory but the
 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.960
of Einstein relativity theory but the
physics was not affected by this it was

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970
physics was not affected by this it was
 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.130
physics was not affected by this it was
just a peculiarity of the formal

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140
just a peculiarity of the formal
 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.940
just a peculiarity of the formal
mathematics and so it was it was my

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950
mathematics and so it was it was my
 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.970
mathematics and so it was it was my
recollection of of equations written by

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980
recollection of of equations written by
 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.630
recollection of of equations written by
Julian Schwinger which which made me see

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640
Julian Schwinger which which made me see
 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.220
Julian Schwinger which which made me see
that this was what had to be done but it

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230
that this was what had to be done but it
 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.990
that this was what had to be done but it
was a process which wasn't sudden that

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000
was a process which wasn't sudden that
 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.990
was a process which wasn't sudden that
it was a during the weekend and I had to

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000
it was a during the weekend and I had to
 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.970
it was a during the weekend and I had to
go back to my office on the Monday and

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980
go back to my office on the Monday and
 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.100
go back to my office on the Monday and
check that I hadn't made hadn't made a

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110
check that I hadn't made hadn't made a
 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.100
check that I hadn't made hadn't made a
mistake about this
