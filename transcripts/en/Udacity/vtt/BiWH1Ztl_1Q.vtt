I hope now you understand a bit more about

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.710
how information gets passed down from parent to offspring.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.910
&gt;&gt; I mean, I know I sure do. I'm just wondering where

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.920
all these different alleles and variations come from in the first place.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.490
&gt;&gt; Well, then it sounds like you're ready for

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.670
our next lesson on the origin of mutation and variation.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.440
&gt;&gt; Awesome. I just need to figure out

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.280
how to get out of this pedigree first. Yeah,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.190
that sounds like a good plan to me. I

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.310
can't seem to get past my cousins over here.
