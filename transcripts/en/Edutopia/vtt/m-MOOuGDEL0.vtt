00:00:05.096 --> 00:00:06.636
&gt;&gt;Student: Oh, see numbers as a spiral.

00:00:06.886 --> 00:00:09.206
&gt;&gt;Blair: So what do we have
to do to solve our problem?

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:10.986
&gt;&gt;Students: Prepare.
&gt;&gt;Blair: Prepare.

00:00:11.076 --> 00:00:12.986
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Because of the use of
the problem solving procedure,

00:00:12.986 --> 00:00:16.296
students are becoming more and more
confident in understanding the problem.

00:00:16.606 --> 00:00:19.366
They find a strategy that's
going to work best for them.

00:00:19.616 --> 00:00:21.416
It gives them that sense
of independence.

00:00:26.106 --> 00:00:29.686
&gt;&gt;Alexa: At Concourse Village Elementary
School, we want children to analyze,

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:31.256
contribute and communicate.

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:34.786
We consistently ask children
to make their thinking visible,

00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:38.396
so that their ideas are clearly
communicated with the world.

00:00:38.616 --> 00:00:40.086
&gt;&gt;Blair: Good morning, good morning.

00:00:41.036 --> 00:00:42.286
&gt;&gt;Alexa: So for example, in math,

00:00:42.556 --> 00:00:45.136
you will see children use the
problem solving procedure.

00:00:45.296 --> 00:00:48.346
It's a five step process. The
children are able to take us

00:00:48.346 --> 00:00:51.146
through their thinking of how to
unpack their math word problem.

00:00:51.636 --> 00:00:55.496
&gt;&gt;Rachel: First you read the problem to
understand it, then you think about it.

00:00:56.286 --> 00:01:00.406
Then you solve the problem, then
you describe how you solve it,

00:01:00.406 --> 00:01:02.386
and last is your connections.

00:01:03.406 --> 00:01:07.846
We use the procedure so it's
easier to understand the problem,

00:01:07.846 --> 00:01:10.016
and when you're looking at
it, you know what to do.

00:01:10.306 --> 00:01:11.836
&gt;&gt;Blair: High five, love
what you're doing.

00:01:12.286 --> 00:01:15.506
&gt;&gt;It helps them to become more
organized with their thoughts.

00:01:15.786 --> 00:01:18.116
It becomes almost like
a checklist for them.

00:01:18.596 --> 00:01:21.056
It's also important because
their reading skills are going

00:01:21.056 --> 00:01:23.476
to improve also throughout
the whole entire time.

00:01:23.476 --> 00:01:25.206
They're really honing
in on specific words,

00:01:25.376 --> 00:01:27.316
so it's going to help them get the gist

00:01:27.346 --> 00:01:29.906
and really understand the
content of what they're reading.

00:01:30.616 --> 00:01:33.696
&gt;&gt;Rachel: The math problem
was about JC and Emma.

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:37.606
They were playing this game on
their computer and they were trying

00:01:37.606 --> 00:01:39.386
to see who got the most points.

00:01:39.626 --> 00:01:41.946
&gt;&gt;Blair: So who made the
most points I each round?

00:01:42.506 --> 00:01:46.526
&gt;&gt;In the first step, we're asking
scholars to understand what they read.

00:01:46.526 --> 00:01:50.436
We want them to annotate those important
words, to circle their questions,

00:01:50.436 --> 00:01:52.416
and we create a "what I know" chart.

00:01:52.416 --> 00:01:56.166
&gt;&gt;Student: The third
round, Emma has 62,984.

00:01:57.226 --> 00:02:00.426
&gt;&gt;Blair: We also want them to
write their "I have to" statement.

00:02:00.426 --> 00:02:02.996
What do they have to do in
order to solve this problem?

00:02:03.036 --> 00:02:05.546
It solidifies in their
head what the intention

00:02:05.546 --> 00:02:07.176
and what the goal is of their problem.

00:02:07.406 --> 00:02:11.856
&gt;&gt;Student: I think it means how
they compare their information.

00:02:13.046 --> 00:02:17.326
&gt;&gt;Ariel: After you understand,
you think. You've got to think

00:02:17.326 --> 00:02:20.606
about your strategy and
then you'll do an "I will".

00:02:20.896 --> 00:02:24.796
&gt;&gt;Blair: I will use a table, I will
multiply, I will add, I will divide.

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:27.256
In the third set, they're solving.

00:02:27.646 --> 00:02:30.836
&gt;&gt;Rachel: I compare who got
the most points in each round,

00:02:31.386 --> 00:02:34.386
and who got the most points altogether.

00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:39.226
I mostly work by myself, and some
of the help is from my friends.

00:02:39.316 --> 00:02:41.956
&gt;&gt;Student: Look, Rachel,
it's 7,000 plus 4,000.

00:02:41.956 --> 00:02:44.366
He got 52,000 plus 200.

00:02:45.516 --> 00:02:48.376
&gt;&gt;Blair: In the fourth step,
they are communicating.

00:02:48.636 --> 00:02:51.576
Their communication involves
labelling and making sure

00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:54.016
that their answers are clearly
written and they're explained.

00:02:54.266 --> 00:02:57.056
&gt;&gt;Rachel: Because when
someone looks at your problem,

00:02:57.056 --> 00:02:58.396
and it's not just you looking at it,

00:02:58.396 --> 00:03:00.526
they have to understand
what you're writing.

00:03:00.736 --> 00:03:03.016
You're trying to show how
you're solving the problem.

00:03:03.806 --> 00:03:08.566
&gt;&gt;Blair: They're going to then create
connections regarding any other math

00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:09.476
that they've done previously.

00:03:09.636 --> 00:03:12.156
So they're going to look at the
numbers, identify if they're even

00:03:12.156 --> 00:03:14.066
or odd, greater than, less than.

00:03:14.066 --> 00:03:15.626
Then they have to provide
a sentence for that

00:03:15.626 --> 00:03:17.486
and explain their thinking even further.

00:03:17.946 --> 00:03:19.866
&gt;&gt;That's good recognition.
&gt;&gt;Student: That's right.

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:22.086
&gt;&gt;Alexa: So through the
problem solving procedure,

00:03:22.406 --> 00:03:24.686
we would see their entire
thinking process of how

00:03:24.686 --> 00:03:26.016
to unpack this word problem.

00:03:26.196 --> 00:03:28.956
It has to be very clear and
visible so that anyone that picks it

00:03:28.956 --> 00:03:31.006
up is able to make meaning.

00:03:31.496 --> 00:03:33.836
Then we know their strengths
as a mathematician,

00:03:33.886 --> 00:03:35.686
versus just getting the right answers.
