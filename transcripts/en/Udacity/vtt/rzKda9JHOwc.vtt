00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's go through it together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Href is actually one of the arguments to this anchor tag.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It's not displayed.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If the user clicks on this link, they'll go to Wikipedia.org,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but they'll never see the href. This is not shown.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Mary, on the other hand, is not the name of a tag or the argument to a tag.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It will be shown.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Similarly, Vindication will be shown.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It'll be shown as part of a link and italicized, but it'll be there.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Wikipedia is part of the argument to this anchor tag,so it will not be shown.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Wrote, however, will be shown, and then this i, the italic tag, isn't shown.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Instead, the next is actually slanted.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Here we're taking a look at how it would render in a web browser.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We can see Mary Wollstonecraft wrote A Vindication of the Rights of Women.

00:00:54.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Href, Wikipedia, and i are not printed on the screen.
