00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.020
Oh my goodness

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.760
Hey, what's up guys welcome back to the lab today

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.300
We're filming this video in the dark because we're doing something a little bit different

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.880
I had a comment pop-up from Jacob Militello

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.159
Who said try to get a plasma globe and break the glass and turn it on and see what happens so Jacob

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.459
I went on Amazon. I picked this thing up. This is a $500 plasma globe

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.810
It's about the biggest one I could find and just arrived the other day, so I got my trusty sledgehammer

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.020
We got this globe powered up

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.940
Let's go ahead and smash the glass and see if we can answer your question

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.050
Now before we actually smash this thing open

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.009
I thought it'd be fun to play with it and kind of explore the properties of a plasma globe

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.710
What is it? How does it work? What's it made of now?

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.270
I have to admit when this thing first arrived

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.029
I picked it up and kind of thought it was fake because it's

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:48.839
Extremely extremely light I would have thought that this dome was made of glass. I'm feeling it it almost feels like it's made of plastic

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.620
Although when I look at it. I can actually see Ridge lines in there, so the question

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.109
I want to answer first is this actually glass or is it plastic because we try smashing it with our hammer

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.670
I actually want it to crack

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.940
and I want it to just you know do a little seam line and

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.860
Destroy the whole thing so I'm guessing this is glass

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.400
But I'm not 100% sure. Now if we take a look at the back of the power adapter here

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.940
You can see how much power is going in and how much is being converted

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.110
It's pulling house power and converting it to 12 volts at about 3 amps if you look inside the globe

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.959
You'll see this little center tower, and that's essentially a tesla coil

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.529
And it steps that 12 volts up to somewhere in the thousands of volts

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.129
Now it could be two thousand volts or it could be twenty thousand volts at this point

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.519
I don't really have any way of knowing because there's no markings anywhere on the unit itself

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.849
Now if you remember my thank-you video where we passed seven million

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.540
subscribers

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.579
I went to the science center and found a giant plasma globe like this and here's a piece of aluminum foil to actually draw the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.459
Arc outside of the globe we're going to see if we can do that with this one as well

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.659
All we have to do is take a piece of aluminum foil and put it down on top of the glass and this builds up

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.419
A capacitive charge and if we take something like a piece of metal and touch it with our fingers we can actually get close to

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.759
The metal and get those sparks to jump out

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.210
You can see the spark is quite a bit smaller than the one that we had at the science Center

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.219
That's because the power pumping through this thing is

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.879
Substantially less and even though we can use it to burn holes in a piece of paper

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.449
It's not quite enough to actually light the paper off now the next question

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.520
I have in my mind is this dome made of plastic

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.969
Or is it actually glass. My question comes because it's extremely lightweight

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.900
which makes it hard to this is glass.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.239
But, we should be able to tell pretty easily by taking the tip of a screwdriver and giving it a gentle tap

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.069
Okay, so it's got a very sharp ting  and you can actually hear it resonate on the inside. If you look really closely you can

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.969
see the ridges and the swirls where it looks like the glasses blown expanded so I am confident

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.150
this is glass which means it should shatter under the weight of our hammer.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.490
All right, so good news guys

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.440
It looks like our globe is glass we've got

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.140
thousands of volts of electricity pumping here,  the question is what happens now if we take our hammer

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.760
And we smash the glass while this thing is running

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.260
Is the electricity going to jump out is it going to kill me is there going to be any safety concern at all?

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.460
We don't know that's what we're here to find out let's get to it

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.460
Now I'm putting on my glasses for safety,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.680
But it really would be better to have some kind of a full face shield

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.860
Because we don't exactly know what's inside of this globe is it under vacuum pressure?

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.400
Or is it filled with some kind of inert gas like argon, or nitrogen?

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.490
We're not exactly sure

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.879
But we have seen from previous experience with vacuum chambers that when it smashes it implodes and basically falls straight down

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.870
So that is a risk I'm willing to take for you however. I'm going to put on some heavier duty gloves first

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.049
The other thing that I noticed is if I pulled my hand on the globe here

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.210
And I accidentally touch any exposed skin to the aluminum trim around my workbench. It gives me a little bite

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.219
I can actually feel the electricity jumping through my body

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.210
Cool makes you smell like burning hair or burning flesh

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.989
I wonder if I should like tilt this and actually hold it in my hand as I smash it

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.100
It's super cool. You can see the way my fingers glow in the back of the globe

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.030
Yeah, I think I'm going to do it

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.890
I'm actually just going to hold this while I smash it because that seems like the unsafe thing to do, doesn't it?

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.820
Okay, this where I start getting a little bit nervous guys, so we're going to do it here we going three two one

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.560
Ohhh

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.840
my goodness

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.160
Holy heck I could not have predicted that

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:09.139
That did not implode that exploded that like shot glass out everywhere all over my workbench

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:16.788
It didn't cut me though and look here the electricity doesn't appear to actually be shooting anymore

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.820
I'm not sure if it turned off

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.559
That was amazing. We got to look at the replay on that look at all this glass look at all the Shards oh

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.229
My goodness that was incredible okay, so watching this on a slow-mo replay. Here's the windup

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.520
Hammers coming down

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.520
makes contact and

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:45.109
Interesting like the top of the dome kind of flew upwards and then everything underneath is kind of like imploded and fell down

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.590
So that was really interesting guys so I can't tell if it exploded or imploded

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.489
It was kind of like sheared in half the top popped off and everything else just fell down

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.169
All I can say is there's a tremendous amount of force, and that was a lot louder than I was expecting

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.420
All I can say is I feel really lucky. I have no cuts no damage. I'm no worse for wear

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.300
Look at this

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.060
This is the glass and what what's really interesting about this is if you look at this side of the glass it's extremely thin

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.200
But then you look at this side

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.800
And it's substantially thicker so like obviously the glass changes thicknesses as well

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:32.369
That's pretty bizarre. I wouldn't have expected that and because that popped off so dramatically. I'm wondering if whatever gas was inside

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.660
There was actually pressurized like this might have actually been under pressure if it were a vacuum

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.529
It would have sucked in but I'm pretty sure that was a pop that was like an explosion Outward

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:46.770
So maybe pressurized argon or pressurized nitrogen is in there now. This is crazy guys the dome is gone

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.759
You don't see any more arcs flailing around. I don't feel any charge in the atmosphere

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.830
I don't see any electricity, but if I touch it

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.830
You can actually hear it buzzing you can hear it hissing and if I take the tip of a screwdriver and touch it

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.580
You can see a little arc start flying there not nearly as dramatic as the long

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.249
Octopus arms that were inside the dome because I think there's only a couple thousand volts of electricity there

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.010
Because we're in the standard atmosphere now with nitrogen oxygen

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.160
It just doesn't have the same effect, so yeah

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.610
Basically if you pay $500 for a plasma globe of your own don't smash it open

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.180
It looks a lot cooler if you just leave it on your table and let it roll. Oh

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:28.530
and if you look really closely you can actually see a purple glow around my fingers you see that it gets really hot so

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.470
It's that heats up really fast

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.120
You know the crazy thing about this is you can see the arcs line near the tip of the screwdriver and my finger is right

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.630
beside it making contact

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.630
But I feel absolutely nothing

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.929
Oh, what the heck just happened there? Oh

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.220
Are we melting the glass?

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.970
Something weird is happening

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.809
It can actually draw this art out

00:06:57.479 --> 00:06:59.070
substantially

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:04.699
and wonder what change to make that happen can we actually crack the glass do we burn a hole through it, maybe

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:10.849
Interesting that it's travelling upwards probably cuz the key to the flame is rising

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.749
Well there you have it guys. We made an epic mess glass everywhere

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.380
I'm going to have to get busy cleaning this up

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:22.189
But we did this for you jacob to help answer that burning question you had and so what happens if you smash the glass on

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:26.779
A plasma globe and turn it on you can go check your youtube inbox Jacob. I'm sending a twenty five bucks

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.470
Hey, thanks for joining us for this experiment. We'll be looking for you next one. Talk to you then

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.729
Clean-up on aisle three I'm saying that a lot to use this oh

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.199
Dang it

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:44.629
