00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.530
A headline circulating around
says that eggs, meat and dairy

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.190
are essential for
brain development.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.815
So what does this mean for
vegetarians and vegans?

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.240
Anthony, here, for DNews.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.550
And on the sliding
scale of vegetarianism,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.660
I'm kind of like
beginner to middle.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.135
I'm a lacto-ovo
vegetarian, which

00:00:21.135 --> 00:00:23.792
means I eat eggs and dairy,
but no other animal products.

00:00:23.792 --> 00:00:25.250
And then on the
far end, of course,

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.210
you have vegans who don't eat
any animal products at all.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.770
It's tricky to stay healthy
as a vegetarian or a vegan,

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.978
because you've always got
to watch what you're eating

00:00:32.978 --> 00:00:34.360
and make sure you
get replacement

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.930
sources for everything you'd
normally get from an animal.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.139
Except a new study from
the University of Montreal

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:40.680
is going around
online saying there's

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.070
a nutrient only found
in meat, eggs and dairy

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.322
that's essential for
brain development.

00:00:45.322 --> 00:00:46.280
It's called asparagine.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.340
It is an amino acid that we've
always considered an essential

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.340
to get through our diet.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.640
It's one of the 20 most
common amino acids on earth.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.660
Amino acids are used
to make the proteins

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.750
that you need to survive.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.580
They're responsible for
strength, repair and rebuilding

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.640
inside your body.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.080
The asparagine is mostly
involved with the development

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.000
and operation of your nerves.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.640
Our liver actually makes a lot
of it out of other amino acids

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.480
automatically, enough to
provide for our whole body.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.520
So here's where the study's
framing and headline sort of

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.550
fall apart, compared
to the actual content.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.000
Even though just about all
of us make enough asparagine

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.090
automatically, there
is a small percentage

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.910
of the population with
a genetic defect that

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.730
causes them to not make as
much as everyone else, which

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.240
can lead to severe
intellectual disability

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.030
and even atrophy in their brain.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.150
It just doesn't grow or change.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.630
The headline seems to imply
that if you have this defect,

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.450
you will need eggs,
meat and dairy.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.580
So a vegan or vegetarian
diet could be dangerous.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.400
First of all, how
rare is this defect?

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.876
Well, so far only nine
children around the world

00:01:47.876 --> 00:01:49.000
have been found to have it.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.700
And in those
children, the addition

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.160
of asparagine in
the diet can help

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.510
boost the amount in their
body and get more of it

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.230
across the blood brain
barrier, which could counteract

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.030
the effects of
the genetic issue.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.340
So it seems like being vegan
would only be dangerous

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.770
for those people, right?

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.570
Well, not even that.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.950
See while the headline calls
out meat, eggs and dairy,

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.570
remember that asparagine is one
of the most common amino acids

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.150
on earth.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.650
It's also in whole grains,
legumes, soy, basically

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.460
the staples of a vegan diet.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.880
I love saying the word legume.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.590
So if you're a
veggiesaurus and you're

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.960
seeing this story floating
around, and it got you nervous.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.590
Don't worry.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.820
Your brain is fine.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.320
Well, as fine as it ever was.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.989
I cannot speak for how
your brain was before.

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.530
Though if your
friends are like mine,

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.950
they think your brain is crazy
and the only cure is bacon.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.320
And I don't think
there's any research that

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.290
will ever change that.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.180
What food myths are floating
around that drive you nuts?

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.680
Is there anything you wanted
to know about food that you'd

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.846
like us to clear up for you?
