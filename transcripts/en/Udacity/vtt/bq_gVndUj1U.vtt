00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.750
Now that we have a better handle on what these selections actually represent,

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.730
let's go back to our circles.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.540
Get the exit selection on it.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.620
Again, which corresponds to every circle except year 1930.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.970
And call the D3 function remove.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.670
So this has the effect of finding every element on the page

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.890
through the exit selection that doesn't belong there and simply removing them.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.210
If we run this code and look at our map, how it's been updated, it's hard to

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.490
see since the attendance was so small, but there's a single dot remaining here.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.420
I'll try to zoom in.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.640
And you can see here, it corresponds to the 1930 games.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.370
So our exit and remove have worked correctly.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.430
Going back to our text editor,

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.000
now that we've removed every element that doesn't belong there.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.590
Let us add or update any element that should change on the page.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.270
As you can see here much of the code is identical to the code that drew

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.470
our initial circles and this is very intentional because we

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.620
want all the circles representing the attendance of games to look similarly.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.180
As you can see here for the circles new data bound,

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.980
which is all the circles on the page, bound to new data filtered.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.550
And our key function we take the enter selection, so anything that's not

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.570
currently on the page we want to append a circle to the page,

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.380
and then set all of the same properties.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.670
Notice here that I didn't include any of the calls to .style, and

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.030
I've abstracted all the styles of circles up into CSS in the head

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.670
of the page rather than duplicate a lot of

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.300
the same code to change the styling on the circles as well.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.180
It's cleaner and easier if we're going to be adding and

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.500
removing a bunch of circles on the page to not have to specify every time that

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.390
we want the same styles that every other circle had.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.150
So now let's put all the code together that we both run in the console and

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.660
that I've shown here, to first remove the circles that don't belong there and

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.700
then add any circles that need to be there.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.930
As you can see here, we're simply removing any circles in the exit selection and

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.360
appending any circles in the enter selection.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.430
Let's go back to our console and just test that this circle adding and

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.080
removing works as we expect.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.650
And here we've stopped right before we called the update function.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.200
So let's see what happens if we call update with the year 1930.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.370
As expected, every circle disappeared except for

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.254
the tiny, tiny circle representing the year 1930.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.080
Let's try to show the most recent World Cup in Brazil, passing update of 2014.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.910
As you can see here, the 1930 World Cup was removed and

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.380
we've added the Brazil World Cup.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.870
So it appears that our update function is working correctly.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.880
GIven what I've shown you, what do you think happens if we try to update a year

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.719
in which there were no World Cup, for example the year 1969?
