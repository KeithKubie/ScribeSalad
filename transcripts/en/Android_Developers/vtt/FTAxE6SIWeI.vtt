Sharkey: One thing I like
about Android

00:00:01.634 --> 00:00:03.934
is how easy it is
to jump into the environment.

00:00:03.934 --> 00:00:06.567
I've been a Java developer
for the past couple years,

00:00:06.567 --> 00:00:08.033
and I was easily able
to jump in

00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:09.367
and start
writing applications,

00:00:09.367 --> 00:00:11.567
and get results
in just a couple minutes.

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:14.400
Something I'd really like to see
from Android in the future

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.100
is the ability
to write desktop widgets,

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.000
so that a user
could drag and drop information

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.467
such as a weather widget,

00:00:19.467 --> 00:00:21.400
or maybe a stock ticker,
right onto their desktop.
