00:00:01.321 --> 00:00:02.029
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:04.450
So welcome today to
"Chefs at Google."

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.260
We have my pleasure to present
Taylor Boetticher and Ryan

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.530
Harris from The Fatted Calf
in Napa and San Francisco.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.510
And they're going to do a Cuban
sandwich for you guys today,

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.400
and then a little demo on the
butchering of this half a hog

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.450
we have over here.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.120
And then we'll have a
little Q&amp;A after it's over.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.120
So please, stick around.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.639
Have a little bite to
eat, and enjoy yourselves.

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:27.680
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Hello.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.020
Thank you so much for coming.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.250
We really appreciate it.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.430
Yeah, we are from The
Fatted Calf Charcuterie,

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.340
and we always like to start
our demos with a little snack,

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.450
because who doesn't like snacks?

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.040
So one of the recipes that
I'm going to demo today

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.040
is the Cuban, which is one of
our takes on a classic Northern

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.530
Italian porchetta.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.770
It's the recipe that's
on the cover the book.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.160
It looks like just about
everybody has a copy.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.030
The Cuban-- hi.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.830
This is a riff on traditional
Northern Italian porchetta,

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:58.850
like I said.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.100
It's seasoned with
cumin instead of fennel.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.870
It's got orange zest
instead of lemon zest.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.810
It also some smoked paprika,
a little bit of Allspice,

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.750
garlic, and some
chopped oregano too.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.120
So the sandwiches that
we're making for you,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.890
they have a little
bit of the Cuban roast

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.884
that we've already
smoked and then sliced.

00:01:15.884 --> 00:01:18.300
And we've got some ham on there
too, some bread and butter

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.162
pickles, and some red onion,
as well as a little aioli.

00:01:21.162 --> 00:01:22.870
So we'll be finishing
those up, and we're

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.040
going to pass those around.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.710
And then I'm going to demo the
different cuts that we usually

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.990
take from a half a hog.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.870
This one came from
the Stone Valley

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.240
Ranch, which is up by Chico.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.860
It's one of three or four
farms the we will work with

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.890
to get our pork from.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.700
Very tasty stuff.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.660
It's certified
organic Berkshire.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.420
We're going to talk about
different ways to cut pork.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.382
Depending on what your
final desired outcome is,

00:01:47.382 --> 00:01:49.090
I will talk a little
bit about husbandry.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.160
We'll talk about seasoning.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.550
Good, basic cutting techniques.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.370
Things like that.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.859
And of course, we'll answer
any questions you have as well.

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:57.150
Again, so thank you for coming.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.570
And I hope you all still have
room for a little sandwich.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.700
You like?

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.319
Oh, good.

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.860
Our pleasure.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.504
Of course, thanks for having us.

00:02:07.504 --> 00:02:09.130
AUDIENCE: Did you
guys make the pickle?

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.129
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Yeah.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.022
We made the pickles.

00:02:11.022 --> 00:02:12.980
Everything that's on
there except for the buns.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.441
Jason took care of the buns.

00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:17.190
AUDIENCE: Do you sell
pickles in the shop?

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.231
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: We do.

00:02:18.231 --> 00:02:19.300
Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.740
Thank you.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.301
No, that's fine.

00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:22.800
Great.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.385
Thank you.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.170
Thanks.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.400
Well, something that's
seemingly so simple

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.650
can be a thing of beauty.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.990
It all comes down to
the little attention

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.120
to detail that makes a
difference between good meat,

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.750
beer, wine, cheese,
programming, whatever.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.580
OK.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.570
So now, onto the guest of honor.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:56.370
This is the left half of
an organic Berkshire hog,

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.400
like I said, from the Stone
Valley Farm up by Chico.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.780
And there are many, many
different great things

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.439
you can get off of
a whole half hog.

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.730
If you're going to take on
something like this at home,

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.700
I highly recommend
getting some friends.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.310
Getting a good work table.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.660
Making sure you've
got all your gear.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:25.760
What we deem pretty crucial to
cutting pretty much anything,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.780
whether it's lamb,
or beef, or pork,

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.320
you're going to want a
good, decent boning knife.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.530
Usually, I don't advocate
spending more than $30

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.620
on a boning knife.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.160
Because we're
pretty hard on them.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.940
We're going to be working
right next to bone, hitting

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.230
on the steel pretty frequently.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.450
And then, you want
something also

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.990
that isn't so thick that
it won't take and hold

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.050
a really good edge.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.200
So I usually use
Victorinox or Forschner.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.640
Whatever's comfortable for you.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.290
I also don't like boning
knives for this kind of job

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.850
that are too flexible,
because they can slip,

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.420
and you don't want that.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.300
So beyond the boning knife,
a good Ali-Baba-like cimeter.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.530
Something good and long
that you can really

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.310
get through really
long cuts with.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.550
And then a bone saw.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.810
Those are really the only
tools you really need.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.430
So I'm just going to
lay out exactly what cut

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.670
comes from where.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.261
And then I'm going to show you
a few basic boning techniques

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.510
and talk about different cuts.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.944
Different ways of cutting.

00:04:24.944 --> 00:04:26.610
The way that we cut
pork in this country

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.540
is very different than the
way they cut it in France,

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.956
the way that they
cut it in Italy,

00:04:29.956 --> 00:04:33.030
the way they cut it in Mexico,
China, everywhere else.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.340
But I'm going to
be demoing, pretty

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.220
much, it's a very
traditional Italian way.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.761
We're going to take
the hind leg off.

00:04:38.761 --> 00:04:42.950
Show you how to cut that for
prosciutto, which is, again,

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.390
pretty traditional Italian.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.460
Hi.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.530
Great cut.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.534
We're going to take
the shoulder off also.

00:04:48.534 --> 00:04:51.200
I'm just going to show you a few
different ways you can cut that

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.795
into roast.

00:04:52.795 --> 00:04:54.170
There's also some
different chops

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.830
you can take out of the
shoulder, which are really nice

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:56.330
also.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.730
One of our more popular cuts
we do at The Fatted Calf

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.800
is a shoulder rib chop that's
seasoned with a little salt,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.550
and garlic, and fennel pollen.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.900
It's a great cut.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.270
We got the fore-shank,
the trotters,

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.800
is where ossobuco and brine
and smoked ham hunks come from.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.630
So the trotter is really good
for adding gelatin to tureens,

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.910
and adding just good
umami and soul power

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.330
to braises and things
like pata beans.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.100
Things like that.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.460
And then we've got, of course,
the interior, the middle here,

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.480
as it's poetically named.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.640
That comprises the
loin, the belly,

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.440
which is obviously where
bacon and panchetta come from.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.690
Great cuts.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.540
And then we're going to talk
about the tenderloin, and also

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.715
the rest of these ribs.

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:43.340
This is the cut that we're going
to be taking out and de-boning

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.220
to make our Cuban.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.679
So the first thing
I like to do is

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:48.720
to just kind of get a good
idea about where we're

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.640
going, what we're
looking at, by taking out

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.030
all this interior fat.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.200
This is the fat that
surrounds the kidney.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.610
It's also called leaf lard.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.710
This is the baker's best friend.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.680
This is really good
for things that you

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.970
want to puff up, like
pie dough, biscuit

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.230
dough, things like that.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.819
You grind and render this
with a little bit of water,

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:07.610
and then strain it.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.750
It'll hold really well in your
fridge for quite a long time.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.230
And one of the key
tenants of charcuterie

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.910
is to use everything
and not waste anything.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.170
That goes doubly for fat.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.920
So the first thing
we like to do is

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.940
to just start to make
it into smaller pieces.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.572
As of right now,
we've got a split hog.

00:06:25.572 --> 00:06:27.780
We're going to separate this
in the three prime cuts.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.270
We're going to take our hind
leg off for the the fresh ham.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.065
We're going to take
our shoulder off.

00:06:31.065 --> 00:06:32.940
And that's going to
leave us with the middle.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.080
So the first thing we like to
do is to take the shoulder off.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.240
And to do that,
what we usually do

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.360
is we separate it in between
the fourth in the fifth rib.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.740
And then we're going to
saw through this backbone.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.230
Sometimes depending on the age
and the breed of the animal,

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.605
the shoulder blade will be
either solid bone, which we'll

00:06:48.605 --> 00:06:50.540
need to use the saw
for, or it'll just

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.420
be softer cartilage, which
we can use, as I call it,

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.190
Ali-Baba.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.640
That'll get through it.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:03.620
So again, right here there,
the first rib can kind of hide,

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.720
so you have to get
in there and find it.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.910
I'm just going to go one,
two, three, and four.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.880
And in between
ribs four and five,

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.989
we're just going to put our
knife right through the middle,

00:07:13.989 --> 00:07:16.280
lift it up just to make sure
we're all the way through.

00:07:18.831 --> 00:07:20.830
And again, kind of like
with the shoulder blade,

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.175
sometimes the breast
plate can be solid bone.

00:07:24.175 --> 00:07:26.754
The thing you want to keep
in mind with tools like this,

00:07:26.754 --> 00:07:29.170
the bone saw, you only want
to use for bone, because it'll

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:33.120
really tear the hell out of any
muscle you try and cut it with.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:39.357
So if it's not happening
with the knife--

00:07:39.357 --> 00:07:41.315
and you'll be able to
tell once you're through.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.750
Just like that.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:51.270
So now we take Ali-Baba
and just finish that cut.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:04.630
And we're going to go all the
way back up to the backbone.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:07.002
Now, we're going to
pick up our bone saw.

00:08:07.002 --> 00:08:07.960
Go through there again.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.860
[SAWING]

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.110
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: That looks
like an accident waiting

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.744
to happen.

00:08:19.744 --> 00:08:31.578
[SAWING]

00:08:31.578 --> 00:08:32.494
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: OK.

00:08:32.494 --> 00:08:33.744
So we're through the backbone.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.900
And again, we're going
to follow that same cut.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.180
And we're through.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.130
OK.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:57.434
So now, we've got
that piece taken off.

00:08:57.434 --> 00:08:59.850
That's starting to look a
little bit more familiar, right?

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.410
You can see the pork
chop right in there?

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:07.400
That's where our rib chops
start, right in there.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.830
We'll put that back down.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:10.964
OK.

00:09:10.964 --> 00:09:12.130
Little intimidating, I know.

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:15.930
But once it starts
getting smaller,

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.547
you'll be able to see where
different parts come from.

00:09:18.547 --> 00:09:20.380
To take the hind leg
off, what we usually do

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.730
is we'll look at where
the backbone starts

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.330
to curve into the
tail right down here.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.500
Right on the inside, this right
here is where tenderloin is.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.000
The tenderloin is
sometimes confused

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.416
with the loin,
which actually sits

00:09:31.416 --> 00:09:32.900
on the outside of the backbone.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.640
The tenderloin sits on the
inside of the backbone.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:37.950
Much softer muscle.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:43.000
And a lot of times, it's kind
of maligned as a flavorless cut.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.727
And it isn't necessarily
true, you just

00:09:44.727 --> 00:09:46.060
have to know what to do with it.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.380
What we do is we brush it
with mustard and rosemary,

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.900
and we wrap it in panchetta,
which is pretty much the best

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.844
way to make anything taste good,
is we wrap it in panchetta.

00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:56.760
AUDIENCE: Nothing goes
better with pork than--

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.968
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: More pork.

00:09:57.968 --> 00:09:58.580
Exactly.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.230
If there's a lily to be
gilded, we'll find it.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:05.670
So we're just going to
follow that one cut.

00:10:11.754 --> 00:10:15.960
And again, the same
principle all the way

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.360
back up to the backbone.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.227
We'll take our saw.

00:10:21.227 --> 00:10:32.254
[SAWING]

00:10:32.254 --> 00:10:33.170
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: OK.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:34.253
Sounds like we're through.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.130
OK.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:53.850
So now we've got hind leg,
shoulder, and our middle.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.750
And at this point,
we've got all these ribs

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:58.011
here to contend with.

00:10:58.011 --> 00:11:00.510
If we were cutting this in the
American way, what I would do

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.930
is I would split this
whole thing in half

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.270
and take the belly
away from the ribs,

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:07.280
or the belly away
from the loin, rather.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.789
And this is when we get
spare ribs versus baby ribs.

00:11:09.789 --> 00:11:11.330
At this point,
there's no such thing.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:12.390
There's just ribs.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.915
Spare ribs are the ones that
are connected to the belly.

00:11:14.915 --> 00:11:16.040
They're a little bit wider.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.142
A little bit tougher.

00:11:17.142 --> 00:11:18.850
And those are the ones
that generally you

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:22.280
see done at barbecue
competitions,

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.360
because they're a little bit
harder to get from point A

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.136
to point B.

00:11:26.136 --> 00:11:28.010
Whereas with baby backs,
you can just kind of

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:31.690
toss them on a hot grille and
wind up with something good.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:36.090
But the mark of a good
barbecue guy or gal

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:38.540
is how well you
can do a spare rib.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.580
We're not going
to be doing that.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.690
What we are going
to be doing is we're

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.787
going to be taking each one of
these ribs out individually.

00:11:46.787 --> 00:11:48.620
The reason we're going
to do that is, again,

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.590
to maximize the amount of
meat that we'll end up with

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:52.880
left behind.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.380
Also, it's going
to leave behind all

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.040
these natural little
grooves in there that

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.206
are going to hold onto all
the garlic, and the salt,

00:11:58.206 --> 00:12:01.460
and the orange zest,
and everything.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.770
So let's get started.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:28.090
So I'm working it
right against the bone.

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.235
We want to leave behind
as much meat as possible.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.530
A little brute force
when necessary.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:37.652
When in doubt.

00:12:37.652 --> 00:12:40.110
So we're going to wind up taking
out each one of these ribs

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:40.922
individually.

00:12:40.922 --> 00:12:43.380
The cool thing about these ribs
is that because of the fact

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.255
that you don't have all
the connective tissue

00:12:45.255 --> 00:12:47.190
in between them, which
is the reason you need

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.830
to either braise them slowly,
or to smoke them really slowly

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.247
over a long period of time,
without that connective tissue

00:12:52.247 --> 00:12:54.538
on there, and you can just
toss these onto a hot grille

00:12:54.538 --> 00:12:56.960
or into a hot oven with
a quick marinade on them.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.418
They've got a ton of flavor,
and they're a lot more tender.

00:13:01.391 --> 00:13:01.890
Right down--

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:36.410
The guy that I learned how
to make this from in Italy

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.120
could do this in about
three minutes flat.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:39.970
He was very fast.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:45.250
And he would do it reciting
Dante the whole time too.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.550
Pretty cool.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.365
So I'm going to
turn this around.

00:13:49.365 --> 00:13:50.740
That's one other
thing you always

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.040
want to keep in mind when taking
on some kind of big project

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:53.540
like this.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.580
If something isn't
working out ergonomically,

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.310
you always want to
be able to twist

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:01.380
and turn it just so that
you're working in a way that's

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.640
most comfortable
and safe to you.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.940
Does anyone have any
questions about any of this?

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:15.460
Yes?

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.780
AUDIENCE: What's the
story with [INAUDIBLE]?

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.220
So this is clearly not
refrigerated right now.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:20.900
TAYLOR BOETTICHER:
Not right now.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.040
AUDIENCE: How long can you
leave it out until it goes bad?

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.090
TAYLOR BOETTICHER:
About two hours.

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:24.600
Yeah.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.270
Two hours.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:29.290
Actually, the USDA
guidelines say four.

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:32.607
We're going to have this done
in about 45 minutes or so.

00:14:32.607 --> 00:14:34.440
AUDIENCE: And then you
can put it back and--

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.120
TAYLOR BOETTICHER:
That's correct.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.950
Yeah, we're going
to get it seasoned.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:39.500
And then we're going to
roll it up and tie it.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.350
Then we're going to
go back in the fridge

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.250
and get it cooked off tomorrow.

00:14:46.554 --> 00:14:48.550
Yes?

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.490
AUDIENCE: You're
mentioning USDA reminded me

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:54.040
of a very popular
issue, what temperature

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.772
to cook fresh pork to.

00:14:56.772 --> 00:15:01.200
Because I know you're
aware that the USDA has

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.407
a very high recommended
temperature.

00:15:04.407 --> 00:15:11.490
But a lot of chefs these
days seem to prefer 141, 145.

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:12.760
What's your opinion?

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.510
TAYLOR BOETTICHER:
Well, the USDA actually

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.690
did just revisit that.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:20.680
And they changed it to
145 for cooked pork.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.280
You can take it to 160.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.300
It depends on what
you're looking for.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.910
With a pork loin roast, this guy
right here gets really tender.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:31.030
If you overcook it, it gets
really tough really fast.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.050
So we like to cook
that one to about 140.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:37.191
With shoulder and leg, the
connective tissue in there

00:15:37.191 --> 00:15:39.440
starts to break down at a
slightly higher temperature,

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.590
about 150.

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:44.370
And that's actually what
gives it the most flavor,

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.690
is when that connective
tissue starts to break down.

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:49.602
So with shoulder and leg,
I like to take them to 150.

00:15:49.602 --> 00:15:51.560
Unless you're making
pulled pork, in which case

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.740
you want it to collapse.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:56.310
And then we take it
to like, 181, 185.

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:57.600
Any other questions?

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.360
Yes?

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.110
AUDIENCE: You've seen
a lot of prosciutto,

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:02.681
but not a lot of
other legs cured.

00:16:02.681 --> 00:16:03.680
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Yeah.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:04.440
AUDIENCE: Is there
any particular

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.960
reason why we don't see like,
lamb prosciutto and goat

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:07.980
prosciutto?

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.050
TAYLOR BOETTICHER:
Some chefs make it.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.420
The thing about lamb
and goat in particular

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:15.880
is that when you age that
fat, it gets a lot stronger.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.570
So it's not to
everybody's taste.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:25.200
Also pork, as you can see,
has the skin left on it.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.920
Whereas with lamb, and
with beef, and with goat,

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.300
you can't leave the skin on
it because it will spoil.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.700
And that skin, is it edible,
like it is with pork?

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.420
You don't get like
beef crackling or lamb

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:36.850
crackling, things like that.

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:40.620
So it's kind of a
stronger flavor.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:44.240
And without that skin also,
when you dry cure something,

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.290
the skin acts like a
natural armor coating.

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.340
It keeps it from going
off, and it keeps them

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.395
from drying out too much also.

00:16:52.395 --> 00:16:54.270
As a matter of fact,
when we make prosciutto,

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:58.220
and we got the skin on the
outside, this interior meat

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:03.350
part, after it's been
salted for about six months

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.880
or so, what we'll do is we'll
make a paste of rice flour

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:10.270
and lard, and rub that all over
the inside of the hind leg.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:13.390
And that kind of mimics
what the skin does.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:16.329
So it keeps it curing and
drying out on the inside,

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:20.250
but without getting too hard or
too dried out on the outside.

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:24.170
So I know people who are making
lamb and goat prosciutto.

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:25.060
It can be good.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.715
It can be very, very
strong though too.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.270
AUDIENCE: And I've also seen
prosciuttos that were skin on

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:33.320
and hair on?

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.320
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Yeah.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.260
That's wild boar prosciutto.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:40.190
AUDIENCE: Is there any trick
to doing that sanitarily?

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:42.660
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: No.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:46.884
Well, the reason that we don't
make wild boar prosciutto much

00:17:46.884 --> 00:17:48.675
in this country, at
least not commercially,

00:17:48.675 --> 00:17:53.860
is we don't have the same
concentration of wild board

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.140
that they do like, in Italy.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.890
You know, the cinghiale.

00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:59.770
And there, they're
allowed to make it,

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:01.900
because it's a much
older practice.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:05.980
Whereas here, our guidelines
are a bit different.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.730
AUDIENCE: What about
at home for yourself?

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:08.180
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: I'm sorry?

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:08.840
AUDIENCE: What
about just for home?

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:09.580
TAYLOR BOETTICHER:
Oh, you can definitely

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.700
do it at home by
yourself, for sure.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.700
You need to make sure you
get a wild boar that's

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:14.783
big enough, for one thing.

00:18:14.783 --> 00:18:17.610
Because if it's too small,
the salt to meat ratios

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:19.010
don't really work out so well.

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:20.610
And the reason that
they don't shave

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:23.110
those, the reason that they
don't take all that hair off,

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:25.580
is because with wild
pigs, the follicles

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:27.050
run a little bit
too deep in there

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:28.640
for them to be
able to scold them.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.270
The way they get the hair off
of a commercially-bred pigs,

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:34.250
even if it's a pastured
pig like this one,

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:36.900
they put them in scolding tub
after they've been slaughtered.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:37.941
And then they hang it up.

00:18:37.941 --> 00:18:40.520
And they're able to just get
all that hair of with a planing

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.120
knife.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.430
With a while boar, like I
said, the roots run too deep,

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.270
and they're not able
to get that off.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:48.700
Usually what they'll
do in Italy is

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:52.310
they'll just shave the
skin off as they slice it.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:54.220
And that's how
they sell it there.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.600
It' good stuff.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.970
Just it's rare to
see around here.

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:01.940
AUDIENCE: So as I understand
it, one of the potential risks

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.414
or pitfalls of home
charcuterie is botulism.

00:19:04.414 --> 00:19:05.830
TAYLOR BOETTICHER:
That's correct.

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:08.310
AUDIENCE: But I'm just wondering
like, how legitimate of a risk

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.670
is that?

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:10.840
And from your practice, like,
do you guys inspect for that?

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.280
Or do you just assume that
you're preparation is so--

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.394
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: We do.

00:19:14.394 --> 00:19:15.560
I'm sorry, go ahead, please.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.950
AUDIENCE: No, that
was my question.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:17.950
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Yeah.

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.295
Botulism is
definitely a concern.

00:19:21.295 --> 00:19:24.280
It's usually an issue
more with canned products.

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:27.140
And that's one of the
functions also of nitrates.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:30.490
Nitrates will kill any
possibility of botulism

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:34.700
in the finished product.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:38.540
So one teaspoon of, it's
called the curing mix.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:39.510
It's mostly salt.

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:40.795
It's about 6% nitrate.

00:19:40.795 --> 00:19:42.420
And then it's dyed
pink with beat juice

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.720
so that you don't accidentally
put a bunch into your scones

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.150
or something like that.

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.490
But there are many
different things

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:54.750
that can come up
with curing at home.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.300
Which is why we
advocate starting small.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.500
Starting with small batches
of smaller type salamis.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.040
We wouldn't suggest to somebody
to start with a prosciutto.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.536
Start with like, a
coppa, or a cacciatorini,

00:20:06.536 --> 00:20:08.160
or a guanciale, or
something like that.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.450
Something small.

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:12.400
And a lot of times also, you can
tell when something's gone off.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.150
It won't look right,
it won't smell right,

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:15.860
and it won't taste right.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.530
We've evolved with these
senses to tell us like, hey,

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:21.560
that's potentially dangerous.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:22.060
So, yeah.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:25.060
Using a small amount of
nitrate and practicing.

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.860
Just doing a little
bit at a time

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.160
is really the best
way to do that.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.160
In a larger commercial
operation such as ours,

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.710
we're constantly
sending stuff out

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:36.665
to be tested or inspected
by four different agencies.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:40.760
Yes?

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.590
AUDIENCE: I'm just
curious, because I'm

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:43.423
really interested in
doing home charcuterie,

00:20:43.423 --> 00:20:44.800
but I'm terrified of it as well.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.280
Is there any kind of home test?

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.420
Or is just literally,
smells all right?

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.290
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: I mean, yeah.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:51.460
If it's nice bright red.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.418
I mean, are you talking
about like, dry curing?

00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:54.266
Something like that?

00:20:54.266 --> 00:20:54.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:57.410
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: You want
to have the right environment.

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:00.440
We cover that a lot in our book.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.090
Curing salt will
definitely help you.

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:03.120
Using enough salt.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.930
And also, if you're
even slightly in doubt,

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:05.936
just toss it.

00:21:05.936 --> 00:21:06.560
Or bring it by.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.310
I'll take a look
at it at the shop.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:09.767
Yeah.

00:21:09.767 --> 00:21:10.600
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.849
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Absolutely.

00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:16.065
Does somebody else
have a question?

00:21:18.895 --> 00:21:20.540
AUDIENCE: I have
like, 700 questions.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:21.456
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: OK.

00:21:21.456 --> 00:21:22.000
Sure.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.440
AUDIENCE: I'm kind of
star struck right now.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.620
I preordered your book.

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:30.420
Gosh, I don't even
know where to start.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.060
Do You do these types
of butchery classes

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:33.920
for the public?

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:34.690
TAYLOR BOETTICHER:
Every Saturday.

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:35.250
AUDIENCE: You do?

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:36.370
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Absolutely.

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:37.100
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.099
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Yeah.

00:21:38.099 --> 00:21:39.183
AUDIENCE: Is that in Napa?

00:21:39.183 --> 00:21:40.515
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Just in Napa.

00:21:40.515 --> 00:21:42.850
Our kitchen in San Francisco
is a little bit too small.

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:48.160
But we have 12 person classes
with three instructors.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.310
About three hours long.

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:53.570
And they include snacks,
and wine, and lunch,

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:56.290
and a big bag of goodies to
take home at the end of the day.

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:56.980
So, yeah.

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:57.800
Absolutely.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.060
Yeah, that's one of my
favorite parts of the week,

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:04.490
is teaching classes
and meeting new people.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:07.200
AUDIENCE: My friends are
going to be happy about that.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.471
And my other question is,
what type-- I'm sorry,

00:22:09.471 --> 00:22:10.470
I came in a little late.

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:11.914
What type of a pig is this?

00:22:11.914 --> 00:22:13.580
TAYLOR BOETTICHER:
This a Berkshire hog,

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:18.520
which is also the Japanese
kind of [INAUDIBLE], what's

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:19.350
called a Kurobuta.

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:22.719
I'm sorry?

00:22:22.719 --> 00:22:24.010
AUDIENCE: Kurobuta is the same?

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:24.968
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Yes.

00:22:24.968 --> 00:22:26.560
Yeah.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.370
Yeah, it's same breed.

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:33.420
As I understand
it, it was a gift

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:38.010
given to the emperor by
a British ambassador.

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.530
And so, it's the same
breed, just different names.

00:22:43.026 --> 00:22:44.900
AUDIENCE: Do you ever
cook with the wild boar

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.358
that we were talking
about earlier?

00:22:46.358 --> 00:22:49.534
Because I have a friend
that hunts in Midland.

00:22:49.534 --> 00:22:50.450
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: OK.

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:51.080
In Texas?

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:51.788
AUDIENCE: No, no.

00:22:51.788 --> 00:22:52.500
I'm sorry.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.984
I think it's Midland near Napa.

00:22:54.984 --> 00:22:55.900
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: OK.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:56.870
Oh, Middletown?

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:57.080
AUDIENCE: Middletown.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:57.563
That's it.

00:22:57.563 --> 00:22:58.479
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: OK.

00:22:58.479 --> 00:22:59.819
That place is lousy with them.

00:22:59.819 --> 00:23:00.610
They're everywhere.

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:00.830
AUDIENCE: Really?

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:01.950
Is that good meat?

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:03.158
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: It can be.

00:23:03.158 --> 00:23:03.930
Yeah, it depends.

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:05.700
That's a lot more of
a seasonal product.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:09.460
And it depends a lot
on the time of year

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.400
and what it's been eating,
and things like that.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.380
So like wintertime, when
there's a lot to forage

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:19.460
and there's plenty of
moisture, and they're

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.240
really well-hydrated,
yeah, it can be great.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.030
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:23.190
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: OK.

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:24.260
So I've gotten all the ribs out.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.801
What I'm going to
do now is I'm going

00:23:25.801 --> 00:23:27.850
to move the tenderloin
over a little bit.

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:30.820
I'm going to take this whole
backbone out in one big piece.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:36.230
First, I'm just going
to get rid of any blood

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:37.700
vessels and glands.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.960
One of the things that we
emphasize a lot when we're

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:44.920
teaching our class is just
how little waste there really

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.756
is on a whole pig.

00:23:46.756 --> 00:23:47.630
There's next to none.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.200
So this is the tenderloin.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.380
And ordinarily, if we wanted
to cook this on its own,

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.150
we'd just take the
whole thing out.

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:01.876
What we're going to do
instead, though, we're

00:24:01.876 --> 00:24:03.750
just going to work right
around the backbone.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.420
So, the whole thing will
come out in one fell swoop.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:47.090
Great stock.

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:48.714
Ramen, broth-making.

00:24:48.714 --> 00:24:49.505
All that fun stuff.

00:24:53.118 --> 00:24:53.618
OK.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.951
Get this [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:59.951 --> 00:25:04.061
[SCRAPING]

00:25:04.061 --> 00:25:06.296
TAYLOR BOETTICHER:
How we doing, boss?

00:25:06.296 --> 00:25:07.248
RYAN HARRIS: All set.

00:25:07.248 --> 00:25:08.676
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Nice.

00:25:08.676 --> 00:25:10.650
AUDIENCE: What are
the best knives?

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:12.900
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: I like
to use a good cheapie boning

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.100
knife that's not too flexible.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:17.970
Forshner and Victorinox
are great ones.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:21.380
They basically have
pretty much every knife

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.660
you could think of, from
cimeters, boning knives,

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:24.743
bread knives, chef knives.

00:25:24.743 --> 00:25:28.409
All that fun stuff.

00:25:28.409 --> 00:25:29.450
AUDIENCE: Quick question.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:30.408
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Yes?

00:25:30.408 --> 00:25:32.670
AUDIENCE: I'm also star
struck, by the way.

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:34.628
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: You
all are too [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:40.360
AUDIENCE: My question
is economically

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.280
speaking, how much
does for a half--

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.862
if I were to go
want to get a pig,

00:25:44.862 --> 00:25:46.070
generally speaking, how much?

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:48.099
Is it significantly
cheaper than buying it--

00:25:48.099 --> 00:25:50.640
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: It would be
cheaper than buying it in cuts

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.600
absolutely.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.524
Especially because, when
you buy it like this,

00:25:55.524 --> 00:25:57.940
you're paying for the loin,
and the leg, and the shoulder.

00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.962
It's all the same
price for a pound.

00:25:59.962 --> 00:26:01.670
If you buy just the
loin, generally, it's

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:03.003
going to be like, twice as much.

00:26:03.003 --> 00:26:06.580
So I think we sell a hog this
size for about $6 a pound,

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:10.570
whereas shoulder's usually
about $8, loin is about $13,

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:14.510
belly is about $9, and
hind leg is about $8.

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:19.490
This is about
180-pounder, so half of it

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:21.630
is going to be about 90 pounds.

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:23.720
It's $500 to $600.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.852
RYAN HARRIS: We paid
$335 whole sale.

00:26:25.852 --> 00:26:27.330
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Oh, cool.

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:29.746
RYAN HARRIS: So if you guys
can wrap your head around that

00:26:29.746 --> 00:26:31.460
a little bit, that
was $350 worth of pig.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.060
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Oh, yeah.

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:36.250
For something like this, for
a split, yeah, absolutely.

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:39.102
And I'm sure you can get the
Google wholesale price too.

00:26:39.102 --> 00:26:42.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.240
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: And it
sounds like a lot off the top,

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.780
but when you consider
how much meat it is

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:51.020
and how much you're
going to get out of it,

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.782
this will keep you in
pig for a good long time.

00:26:53.782 --> 00:26:55.490
RYAN HARRIS: Entertained
for a while too.

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:58.450
TAYLOR BOETTICHER:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:01.260
So what I'm doing right
now is I'm just taking out

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.170
the bottom of the breast plate.

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:05.500
You all notice sometimes
when you get ribs,

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.185
you get those little cartilage
end spits at the bottom?

00:27:08.185 --> 00:27:10.929
They're super tasty?

00:27:10.929 --> 00:27:12.720
That's what these guys
are right down here.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:20.760
AUDIENCE: Somebody asked
about lamb prosciutto earlier.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:21.790
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Yeah.

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:24.040
AUDIENCE: I know Salumi in
Seattle does lamb prosciutto.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:24.450
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: They do.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:24.830
Yeah.

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:26.871
AUDIENCE: And I wanted to
ask you, they certainly

00:27:26.871 --> 00:27:28.970
got a lot of national attention.

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:30.360
Are you big fans of theirs?

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.060
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Of Salumi?

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:31.880
Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.424
Some of the stuff they
make is phenomenal.

00:27:34.424 --> 00:27:36.430
You don't find too
much in the way

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:42.440
of competitive backbiting
in the salumi world.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.180
There are so few of us,
and we all know each other.

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:50.500
And it's the kind of thing
that to do this for a living

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:54.470
and to be good at it enough so
that people will actually come

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:59.130
and buy what you're making,
we all know each other,

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:00.860
and we all compare
notes, and are

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:02.890
very supportive of each other.

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:05.510
And Armandino Batali
has been making

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:07.520
salumi for a really long time.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.080
He's really good at it.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.970
I was talking with Stephanie
about Bruce Aidells at lunch.

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:16.250
And we're really lucky to
have somebody like him.

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:19.270
He is an advocate, a teacher.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:20.890
He's got great stories.

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:23.665
And he's just overall just been
a really, really supportive

00:28:23.665 --> 00:28:25.790
and great guy.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:28.930
So yeah, some of the stuff
that I've had from Salumi

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:29.830
is fantastic.

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.840
Like, I really like
the mole salami.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.592
I haven't been able
to get up there.

00:28:33.592 --> 00:28:35.300
But the things that
I have had from there

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:36.797
have been really, really good.

00:28:36.797 --> 00:28:38.630
AUDIENCE: Have you ever
had their culatello?

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:39.200
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: I have.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:39.890
Yup.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:42.470
And it's almost as good
as the Italian culatello.

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:43.540
Almost.

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:47.390
But that's a tall order.

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:47.890
OK.

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:51.106
So at this point, I've got
just about all the bones out.

00:28:51.106 --> 00:28:53.480
So we need to get this left
little bit of shoulder blade.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:29:00.415
This last little bit
of hind red bone.

00:29:14.234 --> 00:29:15.650
And what we're
going to do next is

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:20.223
we're going to turn this over
and score the skin on it.

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:35.440
The reason we score the skin is
because if you don't do that,

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.930
you won't get crackling.

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:37.950
And you want crackling.

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:40.300
Crackling is very important
part of this roast.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.520
So when we do it,
what I like to do

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.450
is turn the boning
knife upside down

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:47.440
and just use the
back of the knife.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.330
You're just looking
to scratch it.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:52.540
Because if you cut too deep,
what happens is as it cooks,

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:53.229
it expands.

00:29:53.229 --> 00:29:54.770
And it's going to
open up, and you're

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:59.180
going to lose a ton of
fat and meat juices.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.050
And really, the only
point of scoring

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:06.900
it is to allow the steam
somewhere to go, and to allow

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.700
some of that subcutaneous
fat to start rendering out.

00:30:12.932 --> 00:30:14.140
So that's all you need to do.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.799
You're just scratching.

00:30:15.799 --> 00:30:17.090
I'm going to turn it back over.

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:22.440
Do you want start wrapping
some of these parts up?

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.760
Do you mind?

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.710
AUDIENCE: Is that loin
completely boneless?

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:26.668
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Yes.

00:30:26.668 --> 00:30:29.312
This is completely boneless.

00:30:29.312 --> 00:30:30.300
Yeah.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.926
You can just pop it
right over there.

00:30:31.926 --> 00:30:32.426
Thanks.

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:37.560
So, yeah.

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:40.690
I'll just get in here and
check it out again real quick.

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:44.300
A couple little
pieces down here.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:44.940
Thank you, sir.

00:30:48.825 --> 00:30:50.450
AUDIENCE: How much
are the classes now?

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:51.740
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: 175.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.385
That's three hours.

00:30:53.385 --> 00:30:57.200
It includes lunch, a bunch of
stuff to take home, recipe kit.

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.090
We also give a discount
on the day of class

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:00.360
too for people who take it.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.980
So we like to think
it's a good value.

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:11.246
So that one last
little bit here.

00:31:11.246 --> 00:31:13.019
AUDIENCE: Is the class
a hands-on class?

00:31:13.019 --> 00:31:14.060
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: It is.

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:18.140
It's as hands-on or as
hands-off as you want it to be.

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:20.200
Most the time, people
really want to get in there

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.700
and use the saw and
everything else.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:25.070
Sometimes people are taking
it like, with their spouse

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:26.780
just to be supportive.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:30.170
And they'll just hang back,
and take notes, and snack.

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:32.030
Exactly.

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:33.150
And take a lot of photos.

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:35.505
But yeah, they are hands-on.

00:31:35.505 --> 00:31:36.880
But we don't grade,
and if people

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.940
don't want to get in there and
be hands-on, that's OK too.

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.510
We want it to be customized.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:46.720
We want it to be fun, and
entertaining, and informative,

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.110
and as hands-on or hands-off
as people want it to be.

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:52.760
OK.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:57.200
So let's start seasoning it.

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.315
One last little piece.

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:03.920
OK.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:07.020
So the order in which
we're going to season this

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.446
is actually really important.

00:32:09.446 --> 00:32:11.570
The reason being because
some of these ingredients,

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:14.320
we're going to really get in and
smear them on and massage them

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.690
in, whereas some are just
going to get kind of sprinkled.

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:20.716
So with that in mind,
we always do the garlic

00:32:20.716 --> 00:32:22.340
and he orange zest
first, because we're

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:25.570
going to really be working
that in pretty good.

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:33.140
So the whole idea here is
that especially with something

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:35.950
like this, this is
about a 25-pound roast.

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:39.180
So you need to use
a lot of seasoning.

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.091
A lot, a lot, a lot.

00:32:41.091 --> 00:32:41.590
It is.

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:43.120
It's kind of too
much of everything.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.880
But they all prop
each other up so

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:50.046
that it's really well-balanced,
yet over the top.

00:32:50.046 --> 00:32:51.670
And this roast is
one of the means that

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:56.190
was in that sandwich that made
for you all a little while ago.

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:58.450
It's called the Cuban.

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:00.660
Sounds like something
out of a spy novel.

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:01.470
Get me the Cuban.

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:08.230
AUDIENCE: Did you chop
the garlic and the zest

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:10.041
before you started grinding it?

00:33:10.041 --> 00:33:12.040
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: We
just mortar and pestle it.

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:13.706
I started it a little
bit so it wouldn't

00:33:13.706 --> 00:33:15.110
go flying into the camera.

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:17.285
But normally, we just smash it.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:21.000
Yeah.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.900
And remember little pocket
where the shoulder blade was?

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:25.960
I want to make sure you
give that a little love.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:30.580
All those little grooves in
between where the ribs were?

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:38.360
OK.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:44.300
So next, there's
expertly zested orange.

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:48.020
You always want to use zest
because it has the most

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:52.470
oils, whereas juice
is very acidic,

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:55.970
and it can sometimes
denature the meat.

00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:59.470
So instead of being
nice solid roast,

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:00.830
it'll kind of break it down.

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:02.730
Same idea with like, ceviche.

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:10.460
That's how it cooks the
meat, is by acidulating it.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:13.280
So for this, you really
want to use this zest.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.010
And these are kind
of fundamentals.

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:19.328
You can definitely
mix it up a bit.

00:34:19.328 --> 00:34:21.244
If you've got a Meyer
lemon tree in your yard,

00:34:21.244 --> 00:34:22.660
and you wanted to
use meyer lemon,

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:23.989
you could definitely do that.

00:34:23.989 --> 00:34:25.396
You could use lime.

00:34:25.396 --> 00:34:27.770
That's really strong, and you
want to be careful with it,

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:29.830
but you can definitely do it.

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:33.520
Orange, Seville
orange, blood orange.

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:34.500
Any of that.

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:35.000
All good.

00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:47.870
So that's on there pretty good.

00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:51.300
And now is the salt.

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.880
So this is where you really want
to channel your inner Thomas

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:59.670
Keller and go from really high
up, because the higher up you

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:02.540
go, the more evenly
it's going to disperse.

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:04.810
And you need to use a lot of it.

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:08.440
Keep in mind, this is
a big glorious roast.

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.610
And especially with
all the other goodies

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:13.140
we're going to be
putting on there,

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:16.517
you need it to have a
good amount of salt.

00:35:16.517 --> 00:35:17.600
Don't neglect your pocket.

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:21.235
Gonna lift that bad boy up.

00:35:21.235 --> 00:35:24.310
This is the skirt
steak by the way,

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:27.696
if you're all
familiar with that.

00:35:27.696 --> 00:35:30.120
AUDIENCE: What type
of salt are you using?

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.240
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: We
sea salt or kosher salt.

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.420
Whatever you like, the
most important thing

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:38.070
is that it's not iodized table
salt, because that's gross.

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:44.450
But we use Giusto's sea
salt, the local product.

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:45.980
Good stuff.

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:47.730
And you can buy it
in a 50-pound bag.

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:50.470
Which is good.

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:52.112
We use a lot of salt.

00:35:52.112 --> 00:35:53.800
AUDIENCE: Would you
ever brine this?

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.425
TAYLOR BOETTICHER:
I wouldn't brine it,

00:35:55.425 --> 00:35:58.101
just because it would
ruin your crackling.

00:35:58.101 --> 00:35:59.350
You could definitely brine it.

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:02.180
I'm definitely pro-brining.

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:06.000
Especially when it
comes to leaner cuts.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.350
A lot of times, we'll
take where this back half

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:11.600
or the tenderloin was, this is
where t-bone or porter house

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:12.285
chops come from.

00:36:12.285 --> 00:36:13.660
We'll take those
chops, and we'll

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:17.300
brine them with a hard cider,
and sugar, and salt brine.

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:20.750
And then we'll cold smoke
them, so that basically, you

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:23.680
get like, a cold
smoked hard cider brand

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.860
pork chop that is just one of
the best things on the planet.

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:28.386
It's really good.

00:36:28.386 --> 00:36:30.470
AUDIENCE: How do you feel
about injection brining?

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:31.511
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Works.

00:36:31.511 --> 00:36:32.070
Good stuff.

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:32.699
Absolutely.

00:36:32.699 --> 00:36:34.990
You can definitely injection
brine something like this.

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:36.406
A lot of times,
we'll do that when

00:36:36.406 --> 00:36:38.110
we dress up whole
pigs for people.

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:41.670
Because that way, for one thing,
finding a container big enough

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:44.386
to submerge them like this
is kind of challenging.

00:36:44.386 --> 00:36:46.760
But especially with a really
big cut like that, hind leg,

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:50.280
you know, sometimes you put
a lot of salt on the outside,

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.260
but it still never quite
penetrates all the way

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:54.750
through to the bone.

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:59.040
So what we'll do is we'll season
the cavity with whatever spices

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.950
the client wants.

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:02.850
Generally, they want
porchetta seasoning.

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:05.357
But then, we will
take a little bit

00:37:05.357 --> 00:37:06.940
of the garlic brine
or something else,

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:08.315
and we'll inject
just the thicker

00:37:08.315 --> 00:37:10.020
parts of the whole pig for them.

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.750
And it helps keep it juicy too.

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:14.750
RYAN HARRIS: If you can't
get a hold of a middle

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:16.250
and you want to
brine your loin, you

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:18.892
can always buy loin with on
belly, brine the loin, brine

00:37:18.892 --> 00:37:20.850
the belly, and you get
the best of both worlds.

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:21.270
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Yeah.

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:22.360
And you still get
some skin on it too.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.735
RYAN HARRIS: It doesn't quite
slice like the middle does.

00:37:27.572 --> 00:37:31.400
AUDIENCE: Is there an ideal
cut to begin with for curing?

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.650
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: For curing?

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:32.950
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:34.990
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Yeah, like
I was saying, something small.

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:36.560
Guanciale is a really good one.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.610
That's cured pork jowl.

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:41.030
That one cures really
well, because it's

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:42.840
got a very high fat content.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.600
Its about 90%, whereas
like, pork belly's only 80%.

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.100
So it's just giving you an idea.

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:52.240
But it's really good, because
it doesn't take all that long.

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:57.664
And it also gives you a
lot of bang for your buck.

00:37:57.664 --> 00:37:59.080
It doesn't take
that long to cure,

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:03.070
but you use it for
starting sauces, braises,

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:03.990
things like that.

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:06.149
If you're familiar
with carbonara,

00:38:06.149 --> 00:38:07.190
like the sauce carbonara?

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:10.360
That's traditionally the cut
that's used for carbonara,

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.670
is guanciale.

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:12.780
Really popular in Rome.

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:14.990
You don't see a lot here.

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:18.150
But generally, we advocate
with just about everything

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:20.860
starting small, and working
your way up from there.

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:23.260
AUDIENCE: We used to get a
lot of smoked guanciale in LA.

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:24.426
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Oh, yeah.

00:38:24.426 --> 00:38:26.629
Face bacon.

00:38:26.629 --> 00:38:29.045
So now, we're going to put a
little bit of Allspice on it.

00:38:35.027 --> 00:38:36.610
And this one being
a bit strong, we're

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:38.380
not going to go
too crazy with it.

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.000
OK.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.540
Then, cumin.

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:50.784
Cumin and fennel are cousins.

00:38:50.784 --> 00:38:52.200
I don't know if
you all knew that.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.050
AUDIENCE: Really?

00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:54.216
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: They are.

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.270
And at this point, you
want to kind of stop

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:05.829
seeing the color of the
meat, and go really crazy

00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:07.620
with the amount of
spice that goes on here.

00:39:27.426 --> 00:39:29.050
AUDIENCE: Do you
grind your own spices?

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:30.008
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Yes.

00:39:30.008 --> 00:39:31.150
Absolutely.

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:33.360
Yeah, we toast them and
grind them as we need them

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.530
and as we use them.

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:39.660
The only one we used
to buy ground was mace,

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:43.380
but then we found a supplier who
we could get whole mace from.

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.070
Have you ever seen whole mace?

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:46.730
It's really cool.

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:50.650
It's the outside
covering of a nutmeg.

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:51.250
Yeah.

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:53.577
And that's what mace is.

00:39:53.577 --> 00:39:55.410
AUDIENCE: I thought
that was poison, though.

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:56.350
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Sorry?

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:57.910
AUDIENCE: I thought
that was poison.

00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:58.570
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Mace?

00:39:58.570 --> 00:39:59.486
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:02.107 --> 00:40:04.440
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Well,
outside of nutmeg, I mean, I've

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.996
been using it for years.

00:40:05.996 --> 00:40:07.492
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:07.492 --> 00:40:09.075
TAYLOR BOETTICHER:
Not that poisonous.

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:13.280
OK.

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.950
So that's about enough.

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:18.540
So now we're going to
do about equal parts

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:23.035
of sweet, smoked paprika
and hot smoked paprika.

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:28.547
I'm going to try not to do a
number on your carpet here.

00:40:28.547 --> 00:40:29.046
It's nice.

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:38.870
If you don't like spicy, you can
use bittersweet or all sweet.

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:40.395
You don't have to use the hot.

00:40:58.464 --> 00:41:01.450
AUDIENCE: Are there
curing or other techniques

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:05.306
that you can do in Europe,
but that for whatever reason,

00:41:05.306 --> 00:41:06.805
the USDA or whatever
government body

00:41:06.805 --> 00:41:08.638
doesn't permit you to
do in America that you

00:41:08.638 --> 00:41:09.930
wish you could.

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:13.306
TAYLOR BOETTICHER:
That I wish I could--

00:41:13.306 --> 00:41:16.475
we're allowed to do pretty
much anything we want to do,

00:41:16.475 --> 00:41:17.850
with the exception
of what he was

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:19.670
talking about with wild boar.

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:22.880
But we really don't have enough
access to much wild boar here

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.260
anyway.

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:26.410
I mean, that would
be really cool.

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:34.024
Because at its best, wild
boar, it's a different beast.

00:41:34.024 --> 00:41:35.440
It's kind of like
pork meets beef.

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.320
It's really, really super meaty.

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:45.634
But no, not that I can think of.

00:41:45.634 --> 00:41:48.050
With good reason, there's a
lot of regulations surrounding

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:51.960
this, just to make sure that
the whole supply from start

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.282
to finish is safe.

00:41:54.282 --> 00:41:55.990
And yeah, there are
a lot of regulations.

00:41:55.990 --> 00:42:00.280
But they're for
everyone's benefit.

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:03.069
And it takes a lot of time
doing all the paperwork

00:42:03.069 --> 00:42:04.110
and everything like that.

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:06.460
And we like to complain
about it a little,

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:10.190
bit because at heart,
we're cooks and butchers.

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:13.410
And we're into this for the
artisanal passion of it,

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:16.590
and not to necessarily be
logging times and temperatures

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:17.250
all day long.

00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:20.902
But for the most part, no.

00:42:20.902 --> 00:42:23.720
Once we can demonstrate
to our inspectors

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:27.080
that it's proven to
be safe, and that we

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:29.460
know what we're doing, that
we're keeping track of it

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:33.352
from start to finish,
we're pretty much safe.

00:42:33.352 --> 00:42:38.212
If it's safe and people
like it, then go for it.

00:42:38.212 --> 00:42:41.328
AUDIENCE: Why do you think
in Spain, if you walk just

00:42:41.328 --> 00:42:44.170
walk down the streets, there's
just dozens of-- all the bars

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:46.645
have cured hams, and
here, it's such a rarity.

00:42:46.645 --> 00:42:48.020
TAYLOR BOETTICHER:
Because nobody

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.145
loves ham like the Spaniards.

00:42:50.145 --> 00:42:50.645
Nobody.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.600
Their regulations are a
little bit more relaxed.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:59.650
We wouldn't be able to keep them
out of refrigeration like that.

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:01.480
Whereas in Spain,
they cure their hams

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:05.060
enough so that it is a
truly shelf stable product.

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.460
Once that thing is
cured, and they cure them

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:09.099
for like, two years.

00:43:09.099 --> 00:43:11.640
And the reason I say that nobody
loves ham like the Spaniards

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:16.040
is because they really don't
care about keeping enough

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.640
going so that the whole world
can have it whenever they want

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.640
it, and that they can
sell it for a cheap price.

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.750
They cure it until it's ready.

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:26.950
Whereas in Parma, and France,
and even here to a degree,

00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:30.440
the impetus is to get it up,
and get it down, and get it out

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:33.461
into the world, so that
they can see a return on it.

00:43:33.461 --> 00:43:33.960
Yes?

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:35.793
AUDIENCE: I don't know
how much market there

00:43:35.793 --> 00:43:38.543
is in the US for
Spanish style ham

00:43:38.543 --> 00:43:41.410
at up to 130 Euros per kilo.

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:42.410
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Yeah.

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:44.220
The pata negra and
the Bellota-Bellota

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:45.332
is very expensive.

00:43:45.332 --> 00:43:46.790
And that's the
reason behind it, is

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:49.010
because it's made from
really well-raised pigs that

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:51.810
are out there on
pasture eating acorns.

00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:53.900
Some of the Spanish
producers, they'll

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:57.090
only use one side of the
pig, because the other side,

00:43:57.090 --> 00:44:01.070
they constantly rub against
a tree and they scratch.

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:03.440
And they think that
that side is inferior.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.530
There's a little bit of
superstition involved,

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:08.520
but that's valid.

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:09.780
OK.

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:14.390
Let me get all this extraneous
gear out of the way here.

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:18.840
Thanks.

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:24.080
And so now, we've got this huge,
glorious well-seasoned roast.

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:28.150
I'm going to roll this
bad boy up and tie it.

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:30.724
So, you usually want to
start from the loin side,

00:44:30.724 --> 00:44:32.390
because you want the
belly to kind of be

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:33.556
wrapping around the outside.

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:46.540
OK.

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:50.785
We take our trusty
Fatted Calf brand

00:44:50.785 --> 00:44:52.646
16 ply red and
white cotton twine.

00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:58.804
And basically what
we're doing here

00:44:58.804 --> 00:44:59.970
is we're making a slip knot.

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:10.894
So we're just going to make
a few knots, one at each end,

00:45:10.894 --> 00:45:11.810
and one in the middle.

00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:13.810
And then we're going to
go and fill in the gaps.

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:32.470
I'm doubling this over because
it's such a mighty cut,

00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:34.420
that one length just
won't really do it.

00:45:47.635 --> 00:45:49.260
This is going to take
me a few minutes,

00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:51.830
so if anyone has any
questions, fire away.

00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:54.080
AUDIENCE: Have you ever
worked with Mangalitsa before?

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:57.000
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: I have.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.470
My opinion is that
it's too warm in the US

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:02.620
to raise Mangalitsa really well.

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:05.860
The reason that it has all
that fur and that really thick

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:09.490
fat cap on it is because
it's native to Hungary,

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:10.720
and it gets cold.

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:14.560
It gets really,
really, really cold.

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:16.690
Yeah, I've had some
that's really tasty.

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:22.295
Honestly, it cost twice as much
as any other heritage pasture

00:46:22.295 --> 00:46:23.790
raised pig.

00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:26.455
And it's just not worth it.

00:46:26.455 --> 00:46:27.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:29.370
I know some of
Italian restaurants

00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:32.354
were making a big deal
about it a few years ago.

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:37.970
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: I think
it was kind of a good idea.

00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:39.910
I think some things
are just best left

00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:42.083
to where they were originated.

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:49.530
At some point soon,
there might be

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:52.840
a farmer who does
it really well.

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:53.890
They're temperamental.

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:57.190
And they take a lot
longer to get to weight.

00:46:57.190 --> 00:47:02.220
Also, they have such
a high fat ratio,

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:05.300
that when you say you're
a farmer who sells that,

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:08.110
you're selling somebody 50% fat.

00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:11.400
And you have to charge them
an astronomical fee for it.

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:13.199
It's a hard sell.

00:47:13.199 --> 00:47:15.240
That's the long and short
of what I'm getting at.

00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:23.090
What we prefer to use for
really fatty cuts like that

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:27.380
when we want to make like, lardo
or lonza, things like that,

00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:29.620
we like to get Gloucester
Old Spot, which

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:32.798
is a British large breed.

00:47:32.798 --> 00:47:35.430
They're very similar.

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:40.275
But the meat itself
is really good too.

00:47:40.275 --> 00:47:41.775
And also, it's a
bit more available.

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:50.460
AUDIENCE: The last time I
heard, Wooly Pigs in in Spokane

00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:52.880
still had a monopoly
on it I guess.

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:55.680
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Well,
basically, that guy,

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:59.560
he had the only breeding
stock in this country.

00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:02.670
And so when he would
sell piglets to people,

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:05.410
he would sell them
fixed, so that somebody

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:08.635
couldn't go and start
their own breeding program.

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:15.870
That's not really how
I like to operate.

00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:19.320
But as you can tell from the
book, I'm not big on secrets.

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.240
If there's something
that I've learned,

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:24.990
I'd like to pass it along.

00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:27.402
AUDIENCE: Is there
a reason you're only

00:48:27.402 --> 00:48:29.150
coming from the rear side?

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:31.950
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Oh, that's
just where I'm starting.

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:35.519
It's from years and years
of practice, I guess.

00:48:35.519 --> 00:48:37.810
You can definitely start it
from the other side though.

00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:38.309
For sure.

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.285
It's a secret.

00:48:43.285 --> 00:48:45.743
AUDIENCE: What are some of your
favorite restaurants around

00:48:45.743 --> 00:48:46.300
here?

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:47.550
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Favorite
restaurants around here?

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:48.610
Like Southbank?

00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:50.620
Or like, San Francisco?

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:52.030
I love La Ciccia.

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:53.730
Love, love, love La Ciccia.

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:55.600
It's a Sardinian place.

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:58.310
Mostly seafood.

00:48:58.310 --> 00:49:01.730
Really, really wonderful family.

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:03.090
Unusual different food.

00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:05.056
Great wine list.

00:49:05.056 --> 00:49:07.840
I love Nopa.

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:11.050
You all had Laurence
here, right?

00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:14.180
I think they do
an incredible job.

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:17.640
Where else do I really like?

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.460
I like the Chocolate Lab.

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:20.520
It's Recchuiti's place.

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:22.940
You know, the chocolate company?

00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:24.870
They have a little cafe
that they started down

00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:27.040
in the Dogpatch neighborhood
that's really good.

00:49:31.948 --> 00:49:33.198
I don't get out much. [LAUGHS]

00:49:33.198 --> 00:49:34.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:37.510
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Let's see.

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:40.010
If it's in a
tortilla, I'm into it.

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:41.719
I love, love some taco.

00:49:41.719 --> 00:49:43.010
RYAN HARRIS: The Burritoeatery.

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:43.860
TAYLOR BOETTICHER:
Yeah, the Burritory.

00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:44.360
Yeah.

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:49.540
A buddy of ours, a guy who was
working with us at The Fatted

00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:54.920
Calf in Napa for awhile,
he started a truck.

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.600
It's Sonoran.

00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:58.210
Sonoran burritos.

00:49:58.210 --> 00:50:00.610
And the tortillas themselves,
we had some this morning.

00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:02.140
They just unreal.

00:50:06.128 --> 00:50:07.520
AUDIENCE: Is he
still up in Napa?

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:10.620
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: He's
at Soma Street Food Park

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:11.452
every Thursday?

00:50:11.452 --> 00:50:13.160
RYAN HARRIS: Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday.

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:13.520
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: OK.

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:14.250
Cool.

00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:15.700
AUDIENCE: Any in San Francisco?

00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:16.400
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Yes.

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:16.900
Yeah.

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:19.150
The one right over
there by Trader Joe's.

00:50:22.428 --> 00:50:24.262
AUDIENCE: You said on Thursdays?

00:50:24.262 --> 00:50:26.720
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, apparently.

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:27.020
RYAN HARRIS: Yeah.

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:28.270
The hours vary each week.

00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:29.186
It's on their website.

00:50:29.186 --> 00:50:32.620
He's there every
Thursday, Friday.

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:34.119
And its always good.

00:50:34.119 --> 00:50:35.160
AUDIENCE: It's Burritory.

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:35.410
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Yeah.

00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:35.830
Burritory.

00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:36.330
Yeah.

00:50:42.534 --> 00:50:46.970
AUDIENCE: You're emphasizing
most detailed use of the pig,

00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:49.930
but are you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:51.691
TAYLOR BOETTICHER:
Yes, absolutely.

00:50:51.691 --> 00:50:53.940
AUDIENCE: You didn't mention
Encanto when [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:56.106
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: I haven't
been there for a while,

00:50:56.106 --> 00:50:58.010
to be honest with you.

00:50:58.010 --> 00:50:58.960
It's very good.

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:02.380
But it's kind of like
a bus man's holiday.

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:07.520
When I go out to eat, I usually
don't go to pork temples.

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.980
But yeah, Encanto's very good.

00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:18.510
AUDIENCE: They don't have
as much offal on the menu

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:21.330
as I'm sure Chris would like.

00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:26.370
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Yeah,
it can wear you down,

00:51:26.370 --> 00:51:29.323
eating a lot a of that.

00:51:29.323 --> 00:51:35.050
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] like
to sell more [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:38.090
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Well, he does
those fifth quarter dinners.

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:39.240
AUDIENCE: I had that once.

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:40.781
TAYLOR BOETTICHER:
How'd you like it?

00:51:40.781 --> 00:51:42.514
AUDIENCE: Oh, we loved it.

00:51:42.514 --> 00:51:44.672
It was my wife and
another couple.

00:51:44.672 --> 00:51:49.367
And our waiter commented,
aren't you guys finished?

00:51:49.367 --> 00:51:52.690
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Well,
it's very rich stuff.

00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:57.890
The way I like to use
offal is diced in tureens,

00:51:57.890 --> 00:52:00.270
like as a garner, so you get
like, a little bit of it.

00:52:03.211 --> 00:52:03.710
OK.

00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:05.260
I think we're just about there.

00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:07.192
So I'm going to
cut this in half.

00:52:07.192 --> 00:52:08.650
I'm just going to
show you all what

00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:09.816
it looks like on the inside.

00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:22.030
OK.

00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:23.196
And that's the Cuban.

00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:29.020
A little boneless
Cuban pork roll.

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:32.540
Any other questions?

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:34.400
AUDIENCE: So how long
does that cure for?

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:36.450
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: It's
best to let it cure,

00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:38.450
or to sit with the
seasoning on it,

00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:41.097
for-- I like to let it sit
for about two, three days.

00:52:41.097 --> 00:52:42.430
AUDIENCE: And then you roast it?

00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:42.980
TAYLOR BOETTICHER:
And then you roast it.

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:43.480
Exactly.

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:44.606
Yeah.

00:52:44.606 --> 00:52:45.980
Yeah, because all
that seasoning,

00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:48.210
it does wind up permeating
through the meat.

00:52:48.210 --> 00:52:50.690
If we were to toss this in the
oven right now and carve it,

00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:51.640
it'd be good.

00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:53.780
But it's going to be
better after a couple days,

00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:54.140
with all the salt--

00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:55.020
AUDIENCE: And once you
roast it, how quickly

00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:56.420
do you have sell it before it--

00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:58.430
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Oh,
we sell it that day.

00:52:58.430 --> 00:52:59.080
Yeah, yeah.

00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:03.355
When we roast porchetta, as
soon as it's out of the oven,

00:53:03.355 --> 00:53:05.730
we'll put it on the counter,
and we'll sell it by weight.

00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:07.320
If there's any left
after a few hours,

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:09.194
we'll wrap it up,
refrigerate it, and turn it

00:53:09.194 --> 00:53:10.804
into sandwiches the next day.

00:53:10.804 --> 00:53:12.762
AUDIENCE: Is this actually
different than like,

00:53:12.762 --> 00:53:13.485
a porchetta?

00:53:13.485 --> 00:53:15.110
TAYLOR BOETTICHER:
The cut is the same,

00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:17.340
but it's just the seasonings
that are different.

00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:21.880
Yeah, I mean, we've done Korean
style ones with soy, and honey,

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:25.220
and ginger, and Korean chili
flake, and a normal coriander,

00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:26.300
and cilantro.

00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:28.000
That one's a lot of fun.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.650
Again, there's Meyer lemon.

00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:32.700
You could use lime.

00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:37.460
You basically want like, a
balance of toasted spices,

00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:40.740
citrus, garlic, a
good amount of salt,

00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:42.980
and whatever else
you want in there.

00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:46.590
But yeah, it definitely
is open to interpretation.

00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:47.582
Yeah.

00:53:47.582 --> 00:53:48.290
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:50.290
I'd like to thank you
guys for coming out today.

00:53:50.290 --> 00:53:51.190
Taylor and Ryan.

00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.930
Awesome job.

00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:52.390
TAYLOR BOETTICHER: Thank
you so much for having us.

00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:53.390
MALE SPEAKER: Beautiful.

00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:55.350
Let's give them a
round of applause.
