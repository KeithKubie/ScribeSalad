Hey Jeremy.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.520
&gt;&gt; Oh, hi Mark, just a second.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.330
&gt;&gt; What are you doing here?

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.080
&gt;&gt; I'm building the libraries
my app depends on.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.170
&gt;&gt; What?
&gt;&gt; I'm building the libraries my

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:11.770
app depends on.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.690
I've got like eight Gradle projects
set up, and I've got to build them in

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.760
exactly the right order, making sure
each project's output is ready to be

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.950
consumed by the next project, then I
send them all over to this project here,

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.050
where they get built into my app.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.910
&gt;&gt; Wow, impressive.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.166
&gt;&gt; I know right, it's pretty spiffy.

00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:29.160
&gt;&gt; Oh man, multi projects.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.040
&gt;&gt; Oh no.
I know that face,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.830
that's the face you make when Gradle can
automate something I've been working

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:34.840
hard to do on my own.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.400
&gt;&gt; No no, keep it up.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.090
&gt;&gt; Come on Mark, Gradle can
handle all this for me, right?

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.480
&gt;&gt; No, no, this is the way to do it.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.930
&gt;&gt; Bro, don't hold out on me.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.495
Come on, help me automate all this.

00:00:43.495 --> 00:00:45.420
&gt;&gt; All right,
let's set up the multi project build.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.920
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
