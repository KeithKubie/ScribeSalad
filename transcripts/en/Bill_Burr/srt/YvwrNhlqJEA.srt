Huh?

19
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,820

that in the podcasting world,

20
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,930

00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:04,430
Okay.

22
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,230
What the fuck is Labor Day anyways?

23
00:01:06,231 --> 00:01:09,920
Does this have something to do with the
troops? How hard they're working, right?

24
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,100
And you're not doing shit cause you're
not wearing a uniform, right? Huh?

25
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:15,980
You fucking civilian piece of shit.

26
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:17,550
Okay.

27
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,190
Don't you love how that's the vibe now,

28
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,810
how about a round of
applause for our troops?

29
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,390
I am around the plus the rest
of us paying the fucking taxes.

30
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:28,160

over there and it's never going to fucking

31
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:31,970
end until what? We bankrupt
the whole fucking thing.
And five have all the money.

32
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,490

in awhile. Your fucking ass. All right.

36
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:47,034

40
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Labor Day is a public holiday or a day
of festivities held in honor of working

41
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:05,610
people in the United States and Canada.

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,690
I'm on the first Monday in September
and in many countries on May 1st,

44
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,150
why do we always have to
be different over here?

45
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,990
You know the whole fucking
world's on the metric system. Oh,

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,990

Now we're on standards September 1st.

48
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,420
The rest of the world respecting
the summer or at least the spring.

51
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,010
Hey Buddy.
You know,

52
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,090

56
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:00,960
Okay.

57

Fucking Moscatos the size of
your fucking freckled ball head.

00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,780
You fucking orange mother fucker.

59
00:03:08,781 --> 00:03:13,520
I got a good fucking mind to get out
of my truck and go ahead and show you

60
00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:14,480
what's what.

61
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:17,370

00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:24,770
Okay.

65
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:29,540
Oh, you fucking whining, crying
fucking snowflakes out there

66
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,180
bitching about global warming.

67
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,490
You want to see warming I my fucking nuts,
mother fucker.

68
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:48,780
I'm a God damn coal miner. You
understand me? I'm a coal miner in 2018.

69
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,900
What a fuck what I want to go out,

70
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,170

continue doing a fucking job that's out

71
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,723
oxalate.

72
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,110
I don't give a fuck if I'm
digging in a national park.

73
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:06,490
Stepping on a fucking Bald
Eagle fucking head. All right?

74
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,920
If that's going to put spam on my
fucking table, I'm going to do it.

75
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:16,470
And at some orange to play
where a motherfucker where
the goddamn read Todd down.

76
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:19,080
Who's fucking knees going to
do it for me and a God damn.

77
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,250
And I'm going to vote for

78
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,920
dear America.
Um,

79
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,870
yeah.

80
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,610
So you always wonder
what my neighbors think.

81
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,320
Okay.

82
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,890
You know how many people live in that
house in, are any of them in a good mood?

83
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,580
Oh Jesus.
So it's Labor Day.

84
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,180
Now let me ask you a question since
it's a fucking day off, right? Does,

85
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:49,840
does your wife's give you the day off?
Huh?

86
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,880
Or does she want you to run around and
do a bunch of Goddamn jobs that need to

87
00:04:56,981 --> 00:05:00,580
be done while she stays in the
house doing God knows what.

88
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,680
Right? I was hoping we could get those
boxes there. Is that what you were hoping?

89
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,320
Well God gave you a
couple of arms in a back.

90
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:10,360
Okay.

91
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,900
Start lifting this weight.

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,460
Yeah,

93
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,260
he's fucking ladies. I swear to God it
can you, can you ever just sit down?

94
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:23,660
Okay.

95
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:28,070
What is a couch for in their world other
than to throw too many fucking pillows

96
00:05:28,071 --> 00:05:29,930
on it. See, can't even fucking sit down.

97
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,870
And the second year it's like they know
the second year fucking Goddamn assets.

98
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,070
The couch and your head's on the pillow
and you grabbed the remote to watch a

99
00:05:40,071 --> 00:05:42,480
little college football.
What happened?

100
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,290
Yeah.

101
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,123
Hi.

102
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,460
Yeah,

103
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,920
sorry. I am in a mood. I'm
actually happy married guy.

104
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:53,080
I don't even know why I'm doing this.
I'm just trying to make you guys laugh.

105
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,320
All right. Cause I bet in
those relationship. All right,

106
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,470
my wife's coolest shit though. You know,
the other night I was hanging out, right?

107
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,990
Smoking a Sega, uh Oh no, I
wasn't supposed to hang out.

108
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:10,070
I ended up just fucking partner called
me up and we ended up hanging out and

109
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:14,380
she's like, you know, she sent me
the usual texts and I was like,

110
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,440
I'm down the comedy store, I'm
smoking a cigar. Some buddies of mine,

111
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:22,670
we did a spot, uh, sorry. And she goes,
she goes, now hang out with your friends,

112
00:06:22,671 --> 00:06:27,560
have a good time. And I texted
her back. Best wife ever. Right?

113
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,810
You can't complain if your wife does that
once a fucking year you, you got a gym,

114
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,550
you know, and my wife consistently does
that unless, you know, at two three,

115
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,290
you know,
the next night when I went out again,

116
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,660
that took a little four day vacation is
what I did here as I stayed on my diet.

117
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:47,510
By the way, I had a couple of
little missteps here or there,

118
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:50,690
but generally speaking, I've been
drinking a little fucking smoothie here.

119
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:56,560
You know, I don't know what I'm
doing. I've got to add some cardio,

120
00:06:56,561 --> 00:07:00,650
but you don't accept that I got this
fucking Shit beat out of me by some God

121
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:05,230
damn bugs. I don't even know where they
always go after my left foot, you know?

122
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:10,180
I'm like the fucking Daniel Day Lewis,
a bug bites my left foot.

123
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,720
They just go after it
right now it is on fire.

124
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:15,460
Yeah.

125
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,270
You know,

126
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,710
I literally have to put like some that
oxy 10 on it and then I got to put a sock

127
00:07:20,711 --> 00:07:23,530
on it like so I won't
scratch it. Like, you know,

128
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:25,930
when you put a fucking the Goddamn I,

129
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:30,931
someone said chandelier a fucking
lamp shade over dogs fucking,

130
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,480
you know,
so you can't turn around by itself.

131
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,350
The problem is that's why should I just
stick a fucking one of those lampshades

132
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,220
on my uh,
on my ankle.

133
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:45,390
But the problem is I'm a God damn human
being made in the image of our Lord and

134
00:07:46,271 --> 00:07:47,770
Savior,
Jesus Christ.

135
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:52,771
So I have the ability to figure out how
to take off said lamp shade and start

136
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:56,860
scratching the fuck out of my ankle.

137
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:03,650
It was so bad the other night actually
woke me up like nothing could touch it.

138
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,850
It was on fucking fire and a dude.
These are next level.

139
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:11,570
These are next level global warming.
Fucking mosquitoes. All right.

140
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,470
If you've got a pair of jeans on or
Dungarees as they used to be called,

141
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:20,060
they'll bite right through them.
They don't give a shit, you know?

142
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:21,923
Okay.

143
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,920
I wish I could be some assassin
fucking mosquitoes. Right.

144
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,840
And rather than just bite and regular old
fucking people and given a malaria and

145
00:08:31,841 --> 00:08:33,570
that shit,
like I could just blue,

146
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:35,860
cool.

147
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,980
Fucking just go find one of
those Bilderberg meetings.

148
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:43,810
I just find who the fuck is in
front of all his goddamn madness.

149
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:50,000
Sorry guys. I don't know. This is
why I don't watch the fucking news.

150
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,030
Um,
yeah,

151
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,730
just go on a 100 million fucking miles
an hour into the brick wall and all these

152
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:59,340
fucking rich people think that somehow
they're going to have a parachute.

153
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,810
And I guess what the rest of
us are all going to die. Is
that what it is? Oh, Bill,

154
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:07,890
come on. It's a holiday. All right.
All right, let's talk football here.

155
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,020
Let's talk football.
BOMP bomp bomp bomp bomp um,

156
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:19,080
how about those red sox
lost of the white sox last night,

157
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:20,730
eight to nothing for the first time.

158
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:25,350
We're actually kind of playing like 500
ball and I think it's a great thing.

159
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,790
I don't want to go to the
fucking playoffs. Not knowing
what losing feels like.

160
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:34,320
Like, wait, what's this? Are the wheels
coming off? I wanted to more be like,

161
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,290
oh yeah, this, we got
out of this. All right.

162
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,020
Sales still on the disabled
list as far as I know.

163
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,710
And I don't know if price is a pitch
since he got hit by that comebacker liner

164
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:52,050
off his wrist. X Rays were negative,
were dealing further fucking studies.

165
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:58,380
So a, we shall see. We'll see what's
gonna happen. Um, last day. So, um,

166
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,300
the Astros,

167
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:05,300
the team to beat the defending world
series champions getting zero respect out

168
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:07,710
there in Houston.
You know,

169
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:11,550
you would think that the baseball team
was as fat as the average person in

170
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:15,480
Houston. And, and don't even fucking
wrinkle your Goddamn snout up at me.

171
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:19,800
If you fucking live in Houston,
you guys went back to back.

172
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,120
You had a goddamn dynasty
of being fucking, uh,

173
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,790
nominated or winning the fattest
city in the United States of America.

174
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,780
All right. And this is the fattest
fucking country evidently. Okay.

175
00:10:34,781 --> 00:10:37,420
You are,
you are a fat person's fatty Houston.

176
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,913
Yeah.

177
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:45,390
Down there. Fucking barbecue
and everything aren't, you know,

178
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,700
do you know I was just actually
was actually just in Houston,

179
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:52,790
there is not a p a juice
joint and that entire city

180
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,520
lettuce is illegal. This
is, this is a US city.

181
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,333
Okay.

182
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,980
Now, are you wondering why they
had that Biblical flood down there?

183
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,650
Maybe God was like this.

184
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,610
This is a level of slough
that I have never seen. See,

185
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:16,420
that's why there's never a
flood out here in Hollywood,

186
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,550
okay?
Because we are so righteous.

187
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,730
We
are so living

188
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,610
day to day

189
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,500
in his image, in his word. I want you all
right now. I want you to close your eyes.

190
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:37,800
I want you to close your eyes
right now and just know that Jesus,

191
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,260
he wants you to live in Hollywood.
He wants you to go there.

192
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,880
He wants you to do some coke.

193
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,700
He wants you to get a girlfriend,

194
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,190
tried to fuck her friend and try to get
both of them to fuck you at the same

195
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:52,540
time. He wants that. I'm sorry,
that was my Joel Olsteen.

196
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,890
That's why he didn't open
the Goddamn doors when that,

197
00:11:57,891 --> 00:12:01,390
when that flood fucking came in, just
like, I don't have enough fucking,

198
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:04,390
what am I fucking Jesus going to keep
pulling out fucking barbecued fish for

199
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,610
these people. I, I don't.

200
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:11,620
I simply do not have enough
wafers to sustain this.

201
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,010
That's going to be a riot. They can,
they're gonna rip up my blue carpet.

202
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,340
Okay.

203
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,460
Um, he was content to let those
fatties just float right by the arena.

204
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,050
Right. Well, you know what
I would've done? I would've
put some fucking moorings.

205
00:12:25,051 --> 00:12:27,060
Is that what you call those things?
You get dock a boat too.

206
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,240
I would have thrown some rope out there.
And you said those fatties fucking,

207
00:12:30,241 --> 00:12:31,074
you know,

208
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,340
now they're like a bunch of dinghies
until the water came down. I mean,

209
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,920
what was Joel Olsteen supposed to do?

210
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,793
Okay.

211
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:49,740
Joel Osteen's in shape. He lives
in Houston. You know why that is?

212
00:12:49,741 --> 00:12:52,370
It's America. I, Hey,

213
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:58,010
I saw the image of a skinny Joe Olsteen
and my pop tart the other day when I was

214
00:12:58,231 --> 00:12:59,610
in downtown Houston.

215
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:05,930
You ever take two pop tarts or heat
them up and you stick a glaze down in,

216
00:13:05,931 --> 00:13:10,390
in the middle of it? Cause she
don't, you know, live in Houston.

217
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,560
He lay in a bath, this laugh, um,

218
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,220
I to drink smoothies more
before I do a podcast.

219
00:13:18,221 --> 00:13:23,221
I have incredible energy and a new
level of disrespect for a lot of things.

220
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,610
Dude,
my fucking foot,

221
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,800
my fucking foot is driving me nuts.
And then I got,

222
00:13:31,801 --> 00:13:36,570
I got a bug bite on the back of my arm
and then I got another one on my lower

223
00:13:36,571 --> 00:13:40,110
back, like just to the right of
where a tramp stamp would be.

224
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:43,320
Did I ever tell you guys I was dumb enough
to get one of those in the nineties?

225
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,700
I did. I got a Boston Bruins
stamp. Tramp do, you know,

226
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:54,770
and I said Real men wear black and I had
that right above my ass and I had to,

227
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,580
I had to work so hard.

228
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:01,663
I'm sorry,

229
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,680
in stand up to finally be able to
afford enough money to begin my laser

230
00:14:07,891 --> 00:14:09,150
treatments to remove it.

231
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,640
I know a lot of you probably always
wondered why I never wear a half shirt on

232
00:14:14,641 --> 00:14:16,350
stage.
Well that is why.

233
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,383
Okay.

234
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:24,270
I mean, I guess my big fault
is that I'm a hockey fan. Okay.

235
00:14:24,271 --> 00:14:29,040
There I said it. Um, did you guys
watch any college football yesterday?

236
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,220
How about college football?
Just taking over this weekend.

237
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:35,220
The way the NFL does
towards the end of the year,

238
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,250
the NFL is give a fuck that you
got Christmas shopping to do.

239
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,280
They don't care that you got
you're Jewish and you got to buy.

240
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,330
Fuck was an eight gifts.
Nine gifts for each fucking person,

241
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,680
right?
Is that candle fucking goes

242
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,570
candle number one. What do
you got? Well, how do you do
what? Jewish people? D a d. A.

243
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:59,320
D a build the build up the gifts.
That's why you gotta do it, right?

244
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,230
You gotta start with the
weakest thing you got right.

245
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,870
What do you guy got a pair of socks,

246
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,753
you know,

247
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,520
and you just gradually
build the whole outfit up.

248
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:13,923
MMM.

249
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,550
To show up and for Kwanzaa,
right to the NFL does not give a fuck.

250
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,000
Come the end of the year. They
like, we own all the weekends.

251
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,230
We're taking all the fucking money.

252
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,103
All right.

253
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,450
We're showing games on Saturday that we
thought were going to matter, but don't,

254
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,740
we're kicking off the NFL season
this Thursday. This Thursday.

255
00:15:37,741 --> 00:15:42,090
The NFL season is back.
Ladies and gentlemen,

256
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,670
NFL football is back.

257
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,283
Okay.

258
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,000
And for the next 17 fucking weeks

259
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,500
with the bye week

260
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,180
I ever fucking long the,
the, the, the, the, the, the,
the, the, the, the, the, the,

261
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:57,950
the fucking season is
now the regular season.

262
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,063
Okay.

263
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,920
I like to think that this country
can set aside all of the issues

264
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,550
that are weighing us down and we can lose
ourselves in the bread and circus that

265
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:16,440
is professional football.
And when does it start bill all?

266
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,770
What? Put it up. Put it on.

267
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,260
It starts Thursday night,

268
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:28,760
Thursday night with yellow
defending super bowl champions.

269
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,620
The Philadelphia Eagles.

270
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:34,340
Did you ever think you'd ever
hear that in your fucking life?

271
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,340
People of Philadelphia?
You know you didn't.

272
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:38,800
Okay.

273
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,820
Don't even act like you did.
Right? Where the fuck am I?

274
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,370
You guys are playing the dirty birds

275
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,120
down there and fucking
Atlanta. It's, it's,

276
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:51,530
it's the battle of the
birds this Thursday night.

277
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:55,790
This is the only Thursday game worth
watching for the entire fucking season.

278
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,490
You might not have asked

279
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,560
because this is the only
one with a fucking teams
didn't play four days earlier

280
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,380
and they're all banged up.
Yes.

281
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,130
The Eagles who will be
wearing green on green. Yes.

282
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,420
The Falcons will be wearing, I don't
know, black and red on black and red.

283
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,740
It's a home game for the
eagles. They're probably going
to bring the, the, the, the,

284
00:17:18,741 --> 00:17:20,570
the championship flag up there.

285
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:25,571
And can you imagine how many people in
the city of Philadelphia are not going to

286
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:30,611
be able to time their alcohol intake to
when the flag is going to be raised and

287
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:36,170
they'll be in that little jail in
the Eagle's stadium looking out,

288
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,490
you know? Well, the police laugh at them.

289
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,180
The local cops as they play iron
maiden's Ryman, the ancient mariner,

290
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,583
right.

291
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:50,510
Some are combined Ryman, the ancient
Mariner with the of Monte Cristo. I'm on,

292
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:55,610
he's looking out the fucking his
jail cell and he could see the ocean.

293
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,940
You could see how free,
you know,

294
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,130
see the boats going by and
he was just sitting in there.

295
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,430
Um, and then later he got a
Gig on sesame street. Anyways,

296
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,010
it starts with the eagles and the falcons.

297
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,440
Now I got you. If you're asking yourself,

298
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:20,240
will this be a hangover game?
Are The eagles still celebrating?

299
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,483
Yeah.

300
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,040
Who am I? Patriots playing?
Tom Brady coming up,

301
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,110
one of his great games as
a pro against the eagles.

302
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,560
A lot of people forget that [inaudible]
taught, taught the fucking ball.

303
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,550
He threw for over 500 yards
in a Superbowl and lost.

304
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,250
Okay, now let's the patriots go
to the Superbowl again this year.

305
00:18:41,251 --> 00:18:44,070
You tell me when the fuck that's
ever going to happen again.

306
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:45,990
Yeah.

307
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:50,850
Everybody talking about Joe Dimaggio,
Oh, oh 56 game hitting streak,

308
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,020
whatever. Anybody can fucking do. That

309
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,600
56 game hitting streak is, is uh, is
pretty, God dammit. Impressive. You know,

310
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,470
to the point, they literally were
writing songs, Jolt Tin, Joe Dimaggio,

311
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:08,490
whatever they were doing,
right?

312
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:13,290
President was paying
attention than anybody write
a fucking song with Tom Brady

313
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:17,130
threw for 500 fucking yards
and a goddamn super Superbowl.

314
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,500
People have thrown for half that much,

315
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,370
smoked a cigar and
paraded around with them.

316
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:28,430
He threw enough yards to win to fucking
trophies in one game and the man lost.

317
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,540
So everybody's sitting around going,
how it can Tom keep doing it?

318
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,460
He's fucking old and blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay.

319
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:42,840
And I'm sitting over here with no
more hair left on top of my head.

320
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:46,860
The pullout going,
the problem is not Tommy.

321
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,200
I would say it's our defense.

322
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,100
That's what I teach. I would say
that that was the fucking problem.

323
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,830
That was such a fucking weird game.
Um,

324
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,870
I would love to go back
and watch it at some point

325
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,870
and just try to figure out how there was
only fucking two plants are three pumps

326
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:15,840
. The whole fucking game. The
weirdest Goddamn game I've
ever seen in my life. Um,

327
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,720
it's like both on offenses showed up to
play and the e in the fucking defense

328
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:24,340
was just like this. This is a Superbowl.
I just can't get comfortable. Um,

329
00:20:24,341 --> 00:20:28,900
what else we could, we got the
bangles or the bangles is, uh,

330
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,790
is Paul verse.
He calls them the bangles,

331
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:34,870
calls them the girl group there and he
calls the girl group the bangles. Okay.

332
00:20:34,871 --> 00:20:38,860
But Paul Versey, he marches to the beat
of his own drummer is playing the cult.

333
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,750
Andrew Luck. And I'm gonna
tell you something right now.

334
00:20:40,751 --> 00:20:43,210
I'm tasting right now by an Andrew Look.
All right.

335
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,580
If you're fucking sitting
there right in life,

336
00:20:45,581 --> 00:20:50,140
keeps kicking you in the Dick and
you're landed face down in the dust,

337
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,730
you know, and you just don't want to
get up anymore. Watch Andrew Luck.

338
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:59,530
Take a fucking hit. It does give a
fuck. Gets up. He congratulates the gay.

339
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,550
Great job man. I'll probably be filling
that in my early fifties. Congratulations.

340
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:05,950
See on the next play.
I love that guy.

341
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,940
This is me actually saying something
popped positive about the Indianapolis

342
00:21:09,941 --> 00:21:13,550
Colts. As much as I hate
him or say, all right,

343
00:21:13,551 --> 00:21:17,780
Andrew luck the way he conducts himself
out there with such fucking class.

344
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,740
I see.
It actually actually transcends the fact

345
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,080
that he takes a paycheck from that corrupt
piece of shit that Flim flam the boss

346
00:21:29,811 --> 00:21:34,280
hog or the fucking NFL.
Um,

347
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:38,380
anyways, the bills are playing the ravens.
This is what I got to be asking my,

348
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:43,160
if I'm a buffalo bills fan and I got my
face in a plate full of fucking wings

349
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:47,270
over at anchor bar or fucking Duffy's,
whatever the fuck you supposed to go.

350
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,890
I got to be asking myself,

351
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:53,720
is this the year where the
bills for the finally return

352
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,010
to their AFC championship winning glory?

353
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:05,360
Do the bills finally get back to
their peak going to a Superbowl?

354
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,500
Yeah.

355
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,350
Sorry. You know, I'm going to get
people in the AFC east. A lot of shit.

356
00:22:12,351 --> 00:22:15,890
The Buccaneers and the saints,
uh, drew breeze, by the way.

357
00:22:15,891 --> 00:22:18,440
Not a lot of people realize this guy.
He's second all time.

358
00:22:18,441 --> 00:22:22,580
I think he's strong for more yards than
Tom Brady and nobody pays attention to

359
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,670
him. Who's, who's kidding, who?
He's not dreamy. Like Tom Brady.

360
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,970
He's not as tall as Tom Brady.
You know,

361
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,170
supermodels are not knocking on his door.

362
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:37,460
He is a regular Joe.
He's a family man,

363
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,210
you know,

364
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:45,040
and he's down there and [inaudible] a
fucking city that the devil is even scared

365
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:48,610
to go to. And he has gone.
He's been able to maintain

366
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,320
the, the, the fucking values
that he was, he was brought up.

367
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,010
And I would say that is actually more
impressive to me than actually the amount

368
00:22:58,011 --> 00:23:00,680
of yards he's thrown in his
career were taken collars.

369
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,510
Yeah.

370
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,940
Patriots are playing the Texans.
Right.

371
00:23:04,941 --> 00:23:06,740
And that fucking saint
quarterbacks coming back,

372
00:23:06,741 --> 00:23:11,500
I already forgot everybody's names.
Was that kid from Louisville.

373
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,500
So Clemson animal,
the fuck he's from.

374
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,490
But um,
I know he's amazing and JJ watts is back.

375
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,620
So this should be an early test
for these delinquent patriots.

376
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:29,350
The 40 niners verse, the Vikings, I don't
even know what's going on over there.

377
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,850
Okay. Is Kaepernick still kneeling on
the ground? Kapnik doesn't have a Gig.

378
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:39,350
The Vikings, the vikings who
are at their peak right now.

379
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:41,480
Okay.

380
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,810
Doing what they do.
Come in,

381
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,190
fucking it up. Waiting to the next
season. And they are on the rope.

382
00:23:49,191 --> 00:23:53,690
Can they finally,
can they finally turn the fucking corner?

383
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,600
What else? What else is going
on? The giants are looking good.

384
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,990
They got that maniac running
back from fucking Penn state.

385
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,880
They're playing the Jaguars,
the browns,

386
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,300
they got that fucking dude from
Oklahoma, right? Or that the other,

387
00:24:10,301 --> 00:24:14,620
the guy on TV said was undrafted bl
and he went on his fucking show with an

388
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:19,460
undrafted will short. They got
this kid, little bit of swagger,

389
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:23,000
the Cleveland browns playing the Steelers
right out of the gate. Jesus Christ.

390
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:25,640
Those two cities don't even get a
chance to put their fucking feets up.

391
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,510
I cannot fucking wait.
I am taping all of these games.

392
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:33,740
And your Los Angeles Rams
versus the Oakland, soon to be

393
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,670
last Vegas Raiders. I mean, how great
a fucking game is that going to be?

394
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,280
That's the game right there.
That's the game of the week right there.

395
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,960
Rams first Raiders. As far as I'm
concerned. That's the one I want to see.

396
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,300
Oh, the 49 is have, what's his
face? Seattle's a Richard Sherman.

397
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,180
They got him coming back from the,
the, the fucking dreaded Achilles

398
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:05,250
tendon injury. See what he can do for
the 40 niners you know what I mean? Um,

399
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,253
all right.
There you go.

400
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,620
So good luck to all you guys
unless you're playing the patriots.

401
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,150
Um, and now let's talk college football.
How great was it? College football?

402
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:16,540
You know,

403
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:20,140
they were smart enough to not have all
those cupcake games the beginning of the

404
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,570
year. I mean, when I was growing
up, like September was a joke.

405
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,190
You get your football cad from your
bookie and what would they be saying?

406
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:32,370
It'd be just like Nebraska would be
favored by 59 against like Kent State and

407
00:25:32,591 --> 00:25:35,170
you'd take Kenn state and then
like they would be up like,

408
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:39,790
like fucking 35 to nothing at the half.
And you're like tea they would cover.

409
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:42,923
Yeah.

410
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:46,600
Um, anyways, I watched my Lsu,

411
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:51,870
my adopted Lsu Tigers against the Miami
hurricanes and a good friend of mine is

412
00:25:51,941 --> 00:25:56,050
a huge Miami hurricane fan to the point
that I actually root for the Miami

413
00:25:56,051 --> 00:26:00,460
hurricanes because I'm friends with him.
Not that I was ever a hurricane fan,

414
00:26:00,461 --> 00:26:04,360
I wasn't.
So he was playing my adopted Lsu Tigers.

415
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,900
His team was playing my team.
So I texted him before the game.

416
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:12,650
I said the Miami tropical depression,
you know,

417
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:15,370
like when they think it's going to be a
hurricane and then they downgraded to a

418
00:26:15,371 --> 00:26:20,260
tropical storm. Well, the downgrade of
tropical storm is tropical depression,

419
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:24,730
I believe, according to the weather
that I looked up. So he's like,

420
00:26:24,731 --> 00:26:27,880
fuck you man. So we bought him a
better rounded drinks, some cigar.

421
00:26:27,881 --> 00:26:32,050
I can't even fucking remember.
And I gotta tell you right now,

422
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,101
I thought,
you know,

423
00:26:33,101 --> 00:26:37,660
Lsu the entire time I've been a fan of
these guys since like 2008 when I moved

424
00:26:37,661 --> 00:26:40,000
out here, 2007, 2008.

425
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:45,060
So 2007 when I came out to
La and I actually had time
to watch college football.

426
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,523
MMM.

427
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:52,450
And I'd like less Meyers and how he
would go for it on fourth down and trick

428
00:26:52,451 --> 00:26:54,310
plays and all that shit.
And you know, and I just,

429
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,830
I wasn't going to just jump
on the Alabama bandwagon.

430
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,230
Isn't it amazing that they're
still at the peak 10 years later?

431
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:01,863
MMM.

432
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,670
There's still the team to beat. Uh, so I
was like, I'm going to go with these guys.

433
00:27:04,671 --> 00:27:07,730
So I've been watching them for 10 years
and for 10 years we have not had a

434
00:27:07,731 --> 00:27:11,800
fucking quarterback.
They were doing that awful thing,

435
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,740
like that old school college football
thing where it was just like,

436
00:27:14,741 --> 00:27:17,350
this is a running down put
in the black quarterback.

437
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:21,160
This is oh passing down,
put in the white quarterback.

438
00:27:21,161 --> 00:27:23,680
They were doing that shit
in the two thousands. Right.

439
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:25,920
Um,
yeah.

440
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:30,060
And then I think there they're all time
rushing leader was their quarterback,

441
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,190
you know,
which is not a good stat.

442
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,210
They've had these beats at defense. They
actually had Odell Beckham at one point.

443
00:27:39,211 --> 00:27:41,040
My buddy was saying like,
what a fucking waste.

444
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:44,280
They had nobody to throw
it to throw it to them. Um,

445
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,980
so I'm watching the game yesterday.

446
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:50,940
This kid Joe Burrow I guess transferred
some from some other college.

447
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:57,120
Um, I was losing my mind watching this
guy. This guy's a fucking quarterback,

448
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:02,770
you know, people getting in
his face, giving them shit.
He's giving them shit back.

449
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:08,430
He's fucking, he's reading
the blitz, you know, he's,

450
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,870
he was doing all this type of
shit and I was all excited.

451
00:28:10,871 --> 00:28:13,360
And then I was just like,
this guy has got to have like 250 yards.

452
00:28:13,361 --> 00:28:15,070
He only had a hundred,
144.

453
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:19,210
That's how much the QB
position is suffered.

454
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:21,280
While I've been watching these guys,
uh,

455
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:24,640
that I was excited that there was a
guy in the middle of the third quarter.

456
00:28:24,641 --> 00:28:28,900
I had 144 yards passing.
Um, and their new coach,

457
00:28:28,901 --> 00:28:33,710
I hope I say his name right.
Uh, ed or Darren or Jerome,

458
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,800
I don't even know how to say his name,
but all I know is he's,

459
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,930
he's got that by you fucking accent and
he, he sounds like fucking Hulk Hogan.

460
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,040
He sounds like he's doing a wrestling
promo. I was waiting for me.

461
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,390
Let me tell you something brother.
Um,

462
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:51,010
I'll try and get you a clip of him and
he flips out and screams and yells at the

463
00:28:51,011 --> 00:28:55,810
players add, uh, that reminds me of what
a football coach was when I was a kid. Uh,

464
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,800
Lsu for the most part
just handled 25th ranked.

465
00:28:59,801 --> 00:29:04,750
Lsu just handled eighth ranked Miami,
tropical depression,

466
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:09,280
Miami hurricanes. And uh,
but in typical Lsu fashion,

467
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:12,940
they still scared me towards the end
when all of a sudden l a Miami started

468
00:29:12,941 --> 00:29:15,130
coming back and then it was just like,

469
00:29:15,131 --> 00:29:20,080
it was 33 to 17 with six minutes
left and Miami stopped him again.

470
00:29:20,081 --> 00:29:24,870
I'm like, they are two drives in to
two point conversions. Touchdown.

471
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,220
Two point convergence away
from tying this fucking game.

472
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:32,350
Only Lsu could make me this nervous
after being up like 33 to 10 or some shit

473
00:29:32,351 --> 00:29:36,970
like that. Um, but they held
on they want and all of that.

474
00:29:36,971 --> 00:29:38,530
So I am excited.
Uh,

475
00:29:38,531 --> 00:29:43,470
I know it's the first week of the season
before all you negative concept there

476
00:29:43,471 --> 00:29:44,890
are going to be fucking,
you know,

477
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:50,050
you know, a little baby. My
baby was all over overrated

478
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,530
much.
You know,

479
00:29:51,531 --> 00:29:55,160
like that's some sort of like that
people just hate people being excited.

480
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:56,700
Yeah.

481
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,480
Oh, well what are you happy
about? Something? How can I
fucking shit all over this?

482
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,433
MMM.

483
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:04,121
Anyways,
let's,

484
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:09,010
let's do some ad reads
here on Labor Day to you.

485
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:13,450
Oh, just in time for fucking football
season, I now remember people,

486
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,760
you gotta gamble responsibly.

487
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:21,790
What I love about these guys is these
guys to not hide behind the fact that they

488
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:24,970
are a gambling site. Like some of
those other ones way back in the day,

489
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,570
like this is a, this is a
game of skill. All right.

490
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,320
My bookie
bookie,

491
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,870
they're proud,
you know,

492
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,850
bike like a fucking fat actress going up,

493
00:30:39,851 --> 00:30:44,410
I know I look good, right? Same
thing. They're being brave right now.

494
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,930
Um, my bookie, you know, ever
since I started this podcast,

495
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:53,010
people have been asking me for advice.
I don't know why.

496
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,760
Asked me what team to bet on. The truth
is, I don't know who's going to win,

497
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,690
but if you think you know, you gotta
check, you got to check out my bookie.

498
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:05,470
I could've done that way. But at the
truth is, I don't know who's going to win,

499
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,940
but if you think, you know,
you got to check out my book,
he crushed it. Remember?

500
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:11,500
Yeah,

501
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,950
who you're betting on is just as
important as who you're betting with.

502
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,850
That's why I always tell people to bet
with my bookie, I didn't know I did that.

Ah,

553
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,010
I went to London and I went to Paris,

554
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:31,520
France,
and I showed my tramp stamp underpants.

555
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:34,370
And A, I took a couple
of pictures, you know,

556
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:38,570
with my wife in our beautiful
daughter in front of the loove

557
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,870
front of the Eiffel Tower,

558
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:49,290
uh, my favorite cafe, the MAG, um,

560
00:34:52,881 --> 00:34:53,870
I forgot what street it's on.

561
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:59,110
And then I took one of me smoking a cigar
with my dad when we were in London and

562
00:34:59,361 --> 00:35:03,320
I just had all of those framed.
And that's great because you know,

563
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,950
you take all these great pictures, they
stay on your phone and then, you know,

564
00:35:06,951 --> 00:35:09,740
they ended up in some hard drive
and then you break up with somebody.

565

You forget the fucking hard drive. Make

leastly. Sorry, I fucked up.

624
00:38:56,951 --> 00:39:00,460
The rest of that read my head
was actually, I've already
made the Burger patties.

625
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:04,990
Okay. Now next thing I'm going
to do in my cup to the tomatoes,

626
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:08,530
the lettuce have all the pickles
have everything ready to fucking go.

627
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,230
And this year,
for the first time ever,

628
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,940
I am going to do a practice burger just
to make sure my temperature is right,

629
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:19,960
to know how long. So for all the people
who want it, medium rare, medium, well,

630
00:39:19,961 --> 00:39:24,160
well done, all of that fucking shit.
I made my patty small this year.

631
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,200
I made him Finn.
All right.

632
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:31,180
Better than Mcdonald's or old school
Mcdonald's. Not Quite. Wendy's. All right.

633
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:35,140
Right in the fucking wheel house.
Cause I used to work,

634
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:39,430
I used to work in a uh,
this place called the sable cafe

635
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,780
in um, and Cary, North Carolina.

636
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:49,370
I worked there, I swear
to God, 31 years ago.

637
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:54,770
I worked there for nine months and
unfortunately the restaurant was gradually

638
00:39:54,771 --> 00:39:55,700
going out of business.

639
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:59,090
I was a busboy and then I became
the bus boy and dishwasher.

640
00:39:59,091 --> 00:40:02,660
And then at one point I swear
to God I was the grill chef,

641
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:06,890
the bus boy and the dishwasher.
As I took on these extra jobs,

642
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,910
they would give me like a 50 cent
raise and I was so bad with math,

643
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:15,880
it never dawned on me like, hey,
minimal wage is 350 an hour and, and,

644
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:19,480
and the dishwasher was getting paid 350
an hour and I was getting paid three 50

645
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:20,180
an hour.

646
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:25,180
So you paying two people $7 an hour to
do these two jobs and now I'm doing both

647
00:40:25,341 --> 00:40:29,510
jobs. That other person doesn't have
a job and I'm only making $4 an hour.

648
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:31,510
Yeah.

649
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:35,110
Then I became the grill chefs and I think
I was making four 75 an hour or five

650
00:40:35,111 --> 00:40:39,790
bucks an hour to do three fucking
jobs. And I would be out there and, uh,

651
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:40,390
I would be,

652
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:44,680
I was glassed in on a mesquite grill with
the chef hat and underneath my apron I

653
00:40:44,681 --> 00:40:49,630
had the bow tie fucking, um, busboy
outfit. It was literally like, you know,

654
00:40:49,631 --> 00:40:53,920
when Peter Brady had two dates
in one night, right. And, um,

655
00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:00,080
I fucking wood duck down when I
saw a table almost done eating.

656
00:41:00,081 --> 00:41:02,810
And I would run out there,
busted table, run back,

657
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,410
throw out the dishes in the
dishwasher and then run,

658
00:41:06,411 --> 00:41:11,030
fuck it back out without washing my hands.
It's just food.

659
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,530
But you still,
you know,

660
00:41:12,531 --> 00:41:15,350
I'm just handling your food and then
I would continue fucking cooking.

661
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,113
MMM.

662
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,970
And that, that's when I
learned that little trick.
You know, where you, you know,

663
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,780
I learned it this way. You
put you, if you put your, uh,

664
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,840
you just touch your thumb to your index
finger and then touch the fleshy part of

665
00:41:31,421 --> 00:41:32,320
your,
uh,

666
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:37,250
of your hand that connects to your thumb
and you press on that, that's rare.

667
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,790
Then you just move it
to your middle finger.

668
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:44,300
That's like medium rare
than the ring fingers. Well,

669
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:49,040
and then the fucking pinkies well done.
Now that's fucking works.

670
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:53,810
Provided you do the in, and I'll put it
all depends on how thick the patty is,

671
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,850
an how high your fucking heaters.

672
00:41:56,330 --> 00:42:00,140
So you gotta balance all of that out so
you can use that because that actually

673
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:04,700
fucking works unless you heats up too
high and your meats too thick and then you

674
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:08,180
think it's well done and all you did
was chatty the outside and inside,

675
00:42:08,181 --> 00:42:10,790
it's a fucking Friday the 13th.

676
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:16,060
So I'm going to do that and have myself
a tasty fucking burger before anybody

677
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:20,420
even arrived.
I'm going to have my timer.

678
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,150
I'm going to adjust my
fucking heat and I'm going to,

679
00:42:23,151 --> 00:42:26,840
I'm going to be ready full fucking
Freddy. You know what I mean? That's,

680
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:31,340
that's my deal here. Okay. That's how I'm
doing it and I'm going simple this year.

681
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:36,080
Burgers and dogs. Fuck
you, but you don't like it.

682
00:42:36,081 --> 00:42:40,040
Get the fuck out this country.
I'm not smoking anything.

683
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:43,370
I'm not fucking,
I'm not doing any of this bullshit.

684
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:47,090
Burgers and dogs.
We got potato chips.

685
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:51,620

condiments, lettuce, tomato,

mustard. All right,

687
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:01,930
now fucking Asian infused fucking
this or Italian influenced that.

688
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:08,600
Oh, Billy ballgame. I'm going the
fucking, I'm going old school.

689
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,250
We got cheese. What kind of cheese you
want? You want the white or the yellow?

690

We don't have any margin.
We have butter

691

you tell me otherwise.

692
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,810

butcher box pork and ATC a festival.
That's right.

721
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,040
The all things comedy festival is um,

722
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:20,010
is uh, is coming back to Phoenix. It's
coming back to Phoenix in October.

723
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,580
Hey, and by the way, and I will
be there doing a live podcast.

724
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:28,520
This is a pre fucking promo.
Okay. I don't have any dates.

725
00:45:28,521 --> 00:45:31,320
Shit. I'm just letting you
know. Keep your October open.

726
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:35,820
It's October 20 something
I believe. Um, anyways,

727
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:37,500
Shit's probably already on sale.
I don't even know.

728
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,240
Speaking of other things
that I need to promote,

729
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:42,340
I did a movie last year
called the front row.

730
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:46,810
All right.
And um,

731
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:50,770
the trailer starring Hugh Jackman,

732
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,090
the trailer who's already
getting Oscar Oscar buzz,

733
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:59,740
he's getting Oscar buzz old freckles. All
right. And I actually made the trailer,

734
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:00,970
um,

735
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:05,380
you realize how much I'm moving up in
the world that I'm actually in the movie

736
00:46:05,381 --> 00:46:09,850
trailer. Now, I'm not saying that
if you drop a piece of popcorn,

737
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:13,690
you look down and kick it under the seat
in front of you that you won't miss me

738
00:46:13,691 --> 00:46:14,440
in the trailer.

739
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:19,440
I'm just saying that I am in it for a
second with one of the best actors of

740
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:26,140
today. Who is getting Oscar
Buzz Repeat Oscar buzz.

741
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:29,800
Um, this weekend I'm going to be in, um,

742
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:34,420
some casino north of,
uh,

743
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,090
the hell's in Sacramento.

744
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:43,210
And then the next day on going to the
Toronto Film Festival for the Premiere of

745
00:46:43,211 --> 00:46:48,040
the Front runner starring Hugh
Jackman who's getting Oscar buzz.

746
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:51,940
Okay. And then, um,

747
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,460
in the movies directed by the
Great Jason Raymond, by the way,

748
00:46:57,461 --> 00:47:00,700
if you want to fucking win an Oscar,
okay.

749
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,780
It's starting to become
work with all freckles here.

750
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:11,050
All right?
We had to Oscar winners last year,

751
00:47:11,051 --> 00:47:13,450
two or three from,
fromF is for family.

752
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:18,640
Fucking Sam Rockwell wanted,

753
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,710
Alison Janney won it.

754
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:27,200
I think Laura dern guy like a golden
globe. I don't watch award shows. Okay.

755
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:32,410
I don't have time. I'm busy focusing on
things that don't matter like sports.

756
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,630
Um,
and now we'll look what happens.

757
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:39,250
I have about seven lines in this movie
and all of a sudden, not coincidentally,

758
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:44,460
Hugh Jackman is now nominated or when
I was getting Oscar buzz I should say.

759
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,820
Okay,
and why is that?

760
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,110
Because he's unbelievably talented
because he puts the work in because he's a

761
00:47:53,111 --> 00:47:57,550
pro. Maybe, maybe, but I think

762
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:00,430
more so

763
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:06,850
is that he had half a scene with
me. I think that's what it is. See,

764
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:11,851
once I go in the scene and they see what
I look like and where my acting is deck

765
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:16,480
at, right? I'm going to set
hack and act at the same time.

766
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:21,340
Then whatever you're doing as the other
actor is just going to be so fucking

767
00:48:21,341 --> 00:48:25,270
elevated, then all of a sudden you're, you
know, you're going to be in the running.

768
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:30,160
Okay. And that's what I bring
to Hollywood. All right,

769
00:48:30,161 --> 00:48:34,420
put your box everybody and the all
things comedy festival or by the way,

770
00:48:34,421 --> 00:48:38,920
congratulations to Jason Reitman and Hugh
Jackman for getting all this great and

771
00:48:38,921 --> 00:48:40,750
everybody else sits in the fucking movie,
you know,

772
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:43,450
forgetting all this awesome reviews,

773
00:48:43,451 --> 00:48:47,800
which is a very hard thing to do this
day in age with all the cans out there in

774
00:48:47,801 --> 00:48:51,940
the Internet. It's really difficult to
try to get some sort of positive feedback.

775
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:56,620
Um, and I'm, I'm, I'm just happy
just to be a small part of it.

776
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:59,800
You know what I mean? I'm like, Bill
Walton when he joined the Celtics. Okay,

777
00:48:59,801 --> 00:49:01,930
my feet are fucked up.
I'm just happy, you know,

778
00:49:01,931 --> 00:49:04,600
every once in awhile throw it to
me and I'll get a couple of points.

779
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,630
The crowd would go nuts because I
am on the scoring sheet that that's,

780
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:11,260
that's where I'm at. Butcher your box
pork at the all things comedy festival.

781
00:49:11,261 --> 00:49:15,820
Hey Bill, huge fan. Just
writing into, thank you for
the butcher block. Block plug.

782
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:19,900
I'll listen to this. This dude tried the
pork shop that I've been raving about.

783
00:49:19,901 --> 00:49:23,920
The heritage bread. Fucking pork. Okay.

784
00:49:23,921 --> 00:49:25,570
You talk about the pork chops,

785
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:27,940
you talked about the port
trucks and how great they were.

786
00:49:27,941 --> 00:49:31,990
So I had to get my hands on them.
My wife, who is an amazing cook,

787
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:35,350
seasoned these chops so well
I have to share it with you.

788
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,650
She put extra virgin olive oil
on them and salt and pepper.

789
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:42,790
Then let them rest for like 45 minutes.
Look at that.

790
00:49:42,791 --> 00:49:45,490
I mean that's about as standard
of rub as you could possibly get.

791
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:49,510
That's all you have to do.
About a half a teaspoon per chop.

792
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:54,520
Then she just cooked them in
the oven for like 25 minutes.

793
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:59,260
You said the over cook them in the
over for like 20 to 25 minutes.

794
00:49:59,261 --> 00:50:01,150
I'm assuming that meant of it bill.

795
00:50:01,151 --> 00:50:05,860
It was the best goddamn pork chop
I ever had. I fucking told you.

796
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:12,130
He goes, when you get a cheat
day, uh, try that recipe. Uh,

797
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,370
thanks again. Can't wait to see you
in Phoenix in October. So I guess the,

798
00:50:15,371 --> 00:50:20,350
the tickets are already on sale.
Um, yeah guys, I'm telling you,

799
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:25,300
man, who fucking knew that there was
a pure bred fucking pig out there,

800
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:30,920
which bloodlines can be traced
back to the original white people,

801
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:35,360
the Oh gee whities over there
in Europe. Um, I'm telling you,

802
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,470
I did mind differently. I took
out a black skillet and, uh,

803
00:50:40,471 --> 00:50:44,900
I got that heat going, right?
And I, I, I forgot what I, I,

804
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,660
I don't even know what I put on the
fucking thing. I probably didn't know.

805
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,670
And me German,
Irish guy that I am,

806
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:54,410
I seared both sides and then I finished
it in the oven and then I brought it out

807
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:58,760
and I did a, like a rosemary,
uh, butter bath. Ugh.

808
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:05,570
I mean, I didn't even need a fucking
side who's every bite I took?

809
00:51:05,571 --> 00:51:09,730
I was just punching the
fucking table. It was, it's,

810
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,790
it's that fucking good. All right.
If you're a kind of war there,

811
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:15,290
you gotta get the fucking heritage bread,
pork.

812
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:17,990
They're not even paying me for this.
This is how fucking good at is all right.

813
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:19,070
Urban mayor,

814
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,930
although that's a real slick way to get
some fucking a advertising in for free.

815
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:28,910
Be Somebody that fucking writes
in with their own experience. Uh,

816
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:32,990
urban Myer or Mayer.
How would spelled is that John Mayer?

817
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:37,000
But it's urban Meyer.
Is it John Meyer? Hey,

818
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:38,613
Billy Beluga whale.

819
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:43,030
What are your thoughts about
urban Meyer and the Osu scandal?

820
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,370
Do you think he should have
been fired? Uh, you know,

821
00:51:45,371 --> 00:51:48,910
I stopped falling that he gets fired
over that. What the fuck was this?

822
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:50,110
Is this jerseys again?

823
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:55,600
Urban mayor fired reason let we go.
Bump,

824
00:51:55,601 --> 00:52:00,360
bump, bump bomb. Boto
why is urban Meyer, uh,

825
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:05,090
he suspended. It doesn't
say, oh, he's not fired.

826
00:52:05,091 --> 00:52:05,924
He suspended.

827
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:10,260
He's gonna say Jason Law head would have
been fucking tweeting all in capitals

828
00:52:10,261 --> 00:52:14,550
at the whole fucking world. Maybe he
was. Why is urban Meyer's suspended?

829
00:52:14,551 --> 00:52:16,350
Here's the short and the long answer.

830
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,000
I'll state suspended urban Meyer,
uh,

831
00:52:21,001 --> 00:52:24,900
for the first three games
of Ohio state's 2018 season.

832
00:52:24,901 --> 00:52:27,330
Who the fuck did he play in fuckhead you?

833
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:30,240
Is that this is the non
suspension suspension.

834
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:33,840
He's misses the Buckeye season
opener against Oregon state.

835
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:38,280
A likely blow out win for weeks
two and three against Rutgers.

836
00:52:38,281 --> 00:52:43,281
Another likely blow out when and Tcu a
tougher game and a trip to Texas tec use

837
00:52:43,711 --> 00:52:48,480
kind of fell off while we happened
to tacy. You come up from, um,

838
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:53,160
mayor can coach during the week before
sitting out the game itself off offensive

839
00:52:53,161 --> 00:52:56,760
coordinator. Ryan Day is acting head
coach while Meijer is out. Yeah.

840
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:59,370
And he has a headset on the whole game.
Ci.

841
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,730
Who the fuck you think he's talking to?
Uh,

842
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,700
the short reason for the
head coaches suspension, uh,

843
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:09,120
school commission investigation decided
he mishandled domestic abuse allegations

844
00:53:09,121 --> 00:53:13,860
against his former receiver's coach Zach
Smith. Oh, this is a little more serious,

845
00:53:13,861 --> 00:53:15,540
but they didn't think,
is it bill?

846
00:53:15,541 --> 00:53:18,330
Is it a little more serious than fucking
players selling their own jerseys?

847
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:23,130
But they didn't think mayors conduct
was egregious enough to merit firing.

848
00:53:23,131 --> 00:53:25,860
One of the most successful
coaches in college history.

849
00:53:25,861 --> 00:53:29,130
Subtext a was only one broad.
All right,

850
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:33,390
we got a national championship with
this guy. A below is the longer reason.

851
00:53:33,391 --> 00:53:35,020
A recap to the details smiths.

852
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:39,960
Now ex wife Courtney Smith has repeatedly
accused him of domestic violence going

853
00:53:39,961 --> 00:53:44,730
back to 2009.
So how does this fall on on urban Meyer?

854
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:46,740
He supposed to be a fucking cop.
Two,

855
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:52,410
2009 Zach Smith,
then a staffer on Meyer at Florida,

856
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:56,370
went to a party at Meyer's house.
Smith came home with a woman,

857
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,480
coworker who had been drinking and
planned to have her stay on Smith's couch

858
00:54:00,481 --> 00:54:03,210
according to investigation. All right.
It sounds like a standard party.

859
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:08,490
They said Courtney Smith strenuously
objected and drove the woman to her home

860
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:10,740
that began a disagreement.

861
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:16,020
Courtney's called nine one one and alleged
that Zack picked her up and threw her

862
00:54:16,021 --> 00:54:17,070
against the wall.

863
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:21,570
Police arrested Zach for Acra aggravated
battery and later dropped the charge.

864
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:26,640
Meyer says Zack and Courtney met with
them at his Florida office and told him

865
00:54:26,641 --> 00:54:31,200
Zach's arrest was based on false
information. Courtney gave to the police.

866
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:33,241
Yeah.
In other words,

867
00:54:33,241 --> 00:54:36,930
she told the fucking truth and then when
they fucking sobered up or calm down,

868
00:54:36,931 --> 00:54:38,820
they were like,
this could cost us a lot of money.

869
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:41,340
Don't do it again and
we'll say that I lied.

870
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,070
Courtney denies that she
attended that meeting.

871
00:54:44,071 --> 00:54:49,071
And Zach also recalled a to Osu as
investigators that she wasn't there.

872
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:55,980
Okay. So he sounds like he's lying,
uh, to the investigative team.

873
00:54:55,981 --> 00:54:58,650
Courtney Smith denied
recanted her allegations.

874
00:54:58,651 --> 00:55:03,030
She has never walked back any
allegations in public interviews either.

875
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:04,543
All right.

876
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:08,910
No charges were ultimately filed
against Zach for the 2009 incident.

877
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,130
Um, yeah cause they were working for
a big university when Meyer, well,

878
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,760
how does this go on urban Meyer?

879
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:20,540
Mayor Meyer hired him at Ohio state in
2011 a university background check didn't

880
00:55:21,211 --> 00:55:22,600
turn up and arrest my,

881
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:25,890
I didn't tell anyone else at Ohio state
about it because he told investment

882
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:29,040
charges weren't filed and he didn't
think Zach had actually committed any

883
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:32,540
domestic violence between
October and November, 2050. And,

884
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:36,990
and what's the show that
he even saw this shit? Um,

885
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,150
in October and November,

886
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:43,050
2015 police twice went to court on the
home to investigate abuse allegations

887
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:45,190
against Zach to this one is
deals with, it's like, well,

888
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,320
you just fucking break up already.
Um,

889
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:52,430
that year Courtney texted with
Mayor's wife Shelly about Zach.

890
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:55,640
Shelly expressed sympathy and fear
for Courtney and in our own message.

891
00:55:55,641 --> 00:55:58,010
And Courtney has said,
Shelley told her,

892
00:55:58,330 --> 00:56:02,450
she informed the head coach about
Courtney's allegations. Yeah,

893
00:56:02,451 --> 00:56:07,070
but she could have been
lying. You know, both mayor

894
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:13,270
Meyer maintain to Osu investigators that
Shelly never did inform urban about the

895
00:56:13,271 --> 00:56:16,570
text messages. But Meyer has
acknowledged both in a public statement,

896
00:56:16,571 --> 00:56:21,220
early August and two investigators that
he did know of an allegation in 2015

897
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:24,060
I don't

898
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:27,810
understand it. So what? So he knows
about it. So call the fucking cops

899
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,900
like I don't understand
like why this is on

900
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:38,390
the football fucking program.
They are,

901
00:56:38,391 --> 00:56:41,930
they are not the cops. They are
not judges. They are not juries.

902
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:46,100
This whole fucking thing now where like
the judge and the jury and all of that

903
00:56:46,101 --> 00:56:49,820
shit is now on social media and all
of this shit. It's fucking, I don't,

904
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:53,450
I don't get this.
It's like if he fucking did something,

905
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,560
call the cops.
The cops go there,

906
00:56:56,561 --> 00:56:59,140
they fucking arrest him and
he fucking goes to jail.

907
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:05,520
I don't understand how the cops go there.
I recanted it. No, you didn't. All right,

908
00:57:05,521 --> 00:57:07,170
we dropped the fucking charges,

909
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:10,710
but then the cops dropped the charges,

910
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:15,180
but then the school is supposed to go.
No, but you're still fucking guilty.

911
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:18,833
I don't know.

912
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:25,130
I mean, unless he was there
and saw him doing that shit,

913
00:57:25,131 --> 00:57:28,460
what the fuck is he supposed to do?
This is why you have cops.

914
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:32,480
This is why the cops don't
coach a football team. Um,

915
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:38,990
I dunno. I have no idea. I don't,
I don't get that. I get that. Um,

916
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,460
if the university fired that guy,

917
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:46,660
you know,
I don't get why urban

918
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:52,430
mayor Meyer,
why that guy gets dragged into this shit.

919
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:57,960
I mean, if he was beating the shit out of
her at, at a fucking football practice,

920
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,970
and I guess urban was there going,
hey, settle down, settle down.

921
00:58:03,971 --> 00:58:06,760
Nothing to see here. And I guess
he implicated himself. Bye Bye.

922
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:11,910
That, I mean, I don't, you know, I mean

923
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:14,950
the t visa,
these are fucking adults here.

924
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:19,810
That guy knows he's not supposed to be
beaten up his fucking wife. He's an adult,

925
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:22,930
so he should pay the fucking price.
I don't get why this guy has to now.

926
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:26,920
You know what I mean? When some gold
digging whore, fucking, uh, you know,

927
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:31,390
take some guy's house. Uh, does she
go to jail? Does she lose her job?

928
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:34,420
Does her friend that knew she was a
gold digging hoard is she then lose her

929
00:58:34,421 --> 00:58:39,360
fucking position in the fucking world?
I, I don't get it. It's just, it's just,

930
00:58:39,361 --> 00:58:41,670
it's just like, it's a fucking
one side of the street here.

931
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:47,630
If a guy does something to a
woman that he shouldn't be doing,

932
00:58:47,631 --> 00:58:50,420
not only is he going to get punished now
everybody around them is going to get

933
00:58:50,421 --> 00:58:53,960
fucking punished. But if a woman does
something, do a guy, eh, it's all right.

934
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:58,340
Everything's fucking fine. It's
fucking bullshit. That's what I say.

935
00:58:58,370 --> 00:58:59,690
I think it's fucking bullshit.

936
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:03,170
If they are doing this on both sides of
the fucking fence, if you could sum up,

937
00:59:03,171 --> 00:59:06,740
prove that this guy actually
fucking knew this shit. Granted,

938
00:59:06,741 --> 00:59:09,410
I'm just going off for one website here.
All right.

939
00:59:09,470 --> 00:59:12,740
From what I read on the Internet,
which doesn't mean shit. Now,

940
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,350
what do you guys ask me these fucking
questions? All right. Dancing. Hey Bill.

941
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:18,380
I'm a 16 year old kid from Minnesota,
Minnesota,

942
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:21,410
and I'm starting my junior
year in high school week.

943
00:59:21,411 --> 00:59:24,530
I'm not a loser and I'm not the coolest
kid either. I'm right. Yeah. Here you go.

944
00:59:24,531 --> 00:59:25,730
You're in the middle.
That's where I was.

945
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:28,880
I feel like I'm being held
back by my inability to dance.

946
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,590
What do you go to fame? High School.
It's not that I don't have rhythm.

947
00:59:33,591 --> 00:59:34,700
I play three instruments.

948
00:59:34,701 --> 00:59:37,940
My Band leader told me to dance
like I was playing an instruments.

949
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:42,230
The problem is I never know what to do
with my hands and I can't exactly be

950
00:59:42,231 --> 00:59:46,580
playing air sacks at dances this year.
I really don't care that much.

951
00:59:46,581 --> 00:59:51,070
It's just that I know I can dance,
but I haven't figured out moves yet all.

952
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:55,400
Then start dancing there, buddy.
Go on the fucking Internet.

953
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:56,600
I'll go on the Internet right now.

954
00:59:56,601 --> 01:00:01,601
Find your fucking video and then practice
by yourself and do it in the mirror

955
01:00:01,881 --> 01:00:06,380
like the chicks do, right?
All right. You Tube, you tube.

956
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:10,550
You can dance to. All right. Search.

957
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:11,880
Yeah.

958
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:16,880
Basic dance moves to not look stupid.

959
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,910
I just felt stupid with an e at
the end. What the F was to be. Eat,

960
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:25,600
how to dance with confidence.
Not Look like a Dork.

961
01:00:25,601 --> 01:00:29,020
And I gotta tell you this
Guy Club dance moves for men.

962
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:31,870
How to not look stiff and
awkward. Bam. There you go.

963
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:34,290
There we go.

964
01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:39,290
A three minute video after this fucking
stupid Goddamn guy tells me about grape

965
01:00:39,771 --> 01:00:43,470
nuts standing on a fucking mountain.
Somehow we just started running naked.

966
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,470
How to dance for men.

967
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:52,770
It's an Asian kid with the cool hat. You
know he's going to be good. There you go.

968
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:56,370
Bam. The name of this video
is club dance moves for men.

969
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,220
How to not look stiff and awkward
for beginner. All right dude,

970
01:00:59,221 --> 01:01:03,900
I found that in two fucking sec. Second.
All right. There you go. There you go.

971
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:04,763
You're in.

972
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:09,540
So just fucking do that for awhile
till it's second God damn nature.

973
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:13,140
Put a little stank on your face and Eh,
you know,

974
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:18,180
pump up fucking couple drinks and
yourself, not on a, you're under age. Uh,

975
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:23,710
you'll be fine. You'll be
fine. Just do it. Learn how to,

976
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:28,410
how did you learn how to get
good at saxophone? Did you
sit there going, you know,

977
01:01:28,411 --> 01:01:31,200
I know I can play saxophone, but you
never did it. Just go out and do it.

978
01:01:31,201 --> 01:01:35,790
You'll be fine. All right.
Solo, fucking POW. Dear bill,

979
01:01:35,791 --> 01:01:40,050
this old house, I'm a home owner
like yourself and like yourself.

980
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:44,010
I looked into solar power.
Hey too. Not from nothing.

981
01:01:44,011 --> 01:01:46,620
I want to be a candy or do you
have you paid off your house?

982
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,470
Cause if you haven't paid off your
house, you're not a homeowner. All right.

983
01:01:49,471 --> 01:01:53,530
What you own is the debt on the house.
Okay. I hate when people go, oh you,

984
01:01:53,531 --> 01:01:56,820
you ran home. I am now.
You're dumb. You don't know.

985
01:01:56,821 --> 01:01:59,970
You don't own it until they give it to
you that they'd fucking goddamn piece of

986
01:01:59,971 --> 01:02:03,240
paper. Sorry. And like yourself.

987
01:02:03,241 --> 01:02:05,190
I looked into solar power bill.

988
01:02:05,191 --> 01:02:09,090
When I tell you I spent over 200 hours
reading up on solar and talking to

989
01:02:09,091 --> 01:02:10,860
different installers.
I'm telling you the truth.

990
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:13,890
I had zero luck finding
anything that made sense. Yeah,

991
01:02:13,891 --> 01:02:15,870
I think there's a lot of taxes and shit.

992
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:20,030
There's a lot of oil and coal kind
of jockeying against shit. Um,

993
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,410
the more research I did,
the more discouraged I got.

994
01:02:22,411 --> 01:02:25,680
I went in thinking there was no way I
wouldn't come out with some type of solar

995
01:02:25,681 --> 01:02:28,830
panel subsidizing the energy I use.
Yeah.

996
01:02:28,831 --> 01:02:30,570
Now they do this thing
with the electric company.

997
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:31,950
They used to buy back your power.

998
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:36,300
Now they just claim the shit that you
don't even use. Um, I hate to be cynical,

999
01:02:36,301 --> 01:02:39,360
but I feel like solar is useless
until the technology gets better.

1000
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:42,600
I don't know if you've ever
followed through, but I was
hoping to get an update.

1001
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:46,140
Um, I don't think it's
useless. I understand. Um,

1002
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:50,460
anything that is going to help us
slow down fucking global warming

1003
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:56,170
is going to be an asset if you can't
afford to do it. I understand. Um,

1004
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:59,050
I have not done it yet.
Um,

1005
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,240
I keep telling my wife I want
to do and she's this like,

1006
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:05,860
this is going to be loud and it's just
like, you know, I would love to do it.

1007
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:10,060
Um, I have some Spanish style,
not are on all the whole roof.

1008
01:03:10,061 --> 01:03:13,120
My roof is flat and then this
little lip of Spanish tiles,

1009
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:18,040
but like a Tesla is allegedly
coming out with those,

1010
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:22,690
those Spanish tiles that
are also solar powered. Um,

1011
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:26,410
I mean, that fucking guy is like
actually addressing what's going on.

1012
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:30,850
And I wish there was a way that he could
fucking hire coal miners to fucking

1013
01:03:30,851 --> 01:03:35,170
work in the solar industry so they didn't
have to take away 30% of our beautiful

1014
01:03:35,171 --> 01:03:40,171
public parks to continue
using this fucking form of
energy that is fucking with

1015
01:03:40,781 --> 01:03:43,930
the planet. That, but for
some reason you're not allowed
to bring it up if you do.

1016
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,340
You're crying snowflake.

1017
01:03:46,970 --> 01:03:47,803
MMM,

1018
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,770
I dunno. It's, it's

1019
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:52,323
okay.

1020
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,910
I have no idea. And I have not read up
as nearly as much as you have a, I have,

1021
01:03:57,911 --> 01:04:01,220
I have not even overheard as much
as you've probably read on it. Um,

1022
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:05,300
I'll read up on it. I should do
it. I would love to do it. Um,

1023
01:04:08,290 --> 01:04:10,420
you know, but I just, every time
I fucking go to do something,

1024
01:04:10,570 --> 01:04:11,680
I'm fucking something in my house.

1025
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,040
I only tell you guys what I'm
fucking dealing with right now.

1026
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:18,680
I don't even want to fucking fill you.
What on fucking deal with that here.

1027
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:20,290
Have you ever heard a roof?
Rats.

1028
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:21,720
Yeah.

1029
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:24,840
Roof rats.
Uh,

1030
01:04:24,841 --> 01:04:28,770
evidently somehow some we have a crawl
space between our roof and you know,

1031
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:33,150
you can't stand up, but it was enough that
these fucking mice got up there and I,

1032
01:04:33,151 --> 01:04:35,370
we have an exterminator come up there.
You know,

1033
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:36,930
God knows what they did in the walls.

1034
01:04:36,931 --> 01:04:40,980
Thank God they didn't chew through
any fucking wires. And uh, you know,

1035
01:04:40,981 --> 01:04:44,340
so then I got to go up there and you know,
get rid of the dead mice.

1036
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:52,440
That's my life. Okay.
Sobriety. Hey Billy Bama set.

1037
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:53,380
Okay.

1038
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:56,470
I'm a 27 year old male and I just wanted
to truly say thank you for helping me

1039
01:04:56,830 --> 01:04:59,620
onto the wagon of sobriety.
Forget the past few months,

1040
01:04:59,621 --> 01:05:02,950
every as you started listening to your
podcast and have heard you bitch and moan

1041
01:05:02,951 --> 01:05:06,700
the whole time about being
sober from drinking. This
made me think to myself, hey,

1042
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,340
if this can, this, this
can can do it. So can I.

1043
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:12,790
It's been a few weeks now and I've been
clean from drugs and alcohol and I've

1044
01:05:12,791 --> 01:05:16,720
never felt better. Yeah, it was
fucking amazing. None living a clean,

1045
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:20,680
I mean at night it sucks that
that's when you get squirrely,

1046
01:05:20,681 --> 01:05:24,820
but if you just fucking pushed through
it and you wake up in the morning stone

1047
01:05:24,821 --> 01:05:27,940
sober, it's like you feel like
you've compared to, you know,

1048
01:05:27,941 --> 01:05:31,840
being hung over and shit. And I never
even fucked with drugs other than alcohol,

1049
01:05:31,841 --> 01:05:34,370
which is a drug in all fairness.
Um,

1050
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:37,000
you feel like an eight year
old when you wake up. He says,

1051
01:05:37,001 --> 01:05:40,170
I don't have friends because they're
dead beat drug addict, losers.

1052
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:41,650
Everyday at my job I lose.

1053
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:46,460
I literally listened to eight hours
of the podcasts a day. Um, see, see,

1054
01:05:46,461 --> 01:05:50,170
you're learning how to take your addictive
personality and Admin pointing it at

1055
01:05:50,171 --> 01:05:53,380
shit that's more positive. Hopefully
this positive is more pod positive.

1056
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:57,100
So in a sense, you're my only
friend, so thanks for that as well.

1057
01:05:57,310 --> 01:06:00,220
Thanks for helping me through these
trying times and I really look forward to

1058
01:06:00,221 --> 01:06:04,300
maybe seeing your set at one of your
Chicago shows in November. Hey, you know,

1059
01:06:04,301 --> 01:06:07,660
I was hanging out Friday night with a
buddy of mine who's been sober for nine

1060
01:06:07,661 --> 01:06:11,410
months and he just wanted to do it
for a month, but just after a month,

1061
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:12,820
all this shit that
you've been putting off,

1062
01:06:12,821 --> 01:06:14,590
all of a sudden he started
getting shit done. He said,

1063
01:06:14,591 --> 01:06:17,650
I'm going to go two months and
now he's just staying sober.

1064
01:06:17,651 --> 01:06:22,651
He was saying just out of superstition
that I don't want to go back to that and

1065
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,480
um,
that's a great thing.

1066
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:30,280
So I'm going to try to go September
without drinking today. I have,

1067
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:30,761
I have,

1068
01:06:30,761 --> 01:06:35,761
my big cheat thing is I have a
glass bottle of grape Phanta,

1069
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:39,730
um, that I am going to have, um,

1070
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:43,150
with my burger and then I'm right
back on the wagon, but a pretty,

1071
01:06:43,151 --> 01:06:44,010
but I'm going to be eating,

1072
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:46,053
you know,

1073
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:49,500
eating healthy the rest day. I hate that.
No Jane, when people say I'm eating,

1074
01:06:49,501 --> 01:06:50,650
I've been eating clean.

1075
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:54,053
Yeah.

1076
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:57,700
I like, I, I just, I don't
like that now. You know,

1077
01:06:57,701 --> 01:07:00,490
just clean eating and eating clean.
Okay.

1078
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:02,440
It's like you don't even know
what the fuck you're reading.

1079
01:07:02,441 --> 01:07:05,950
I go to these farmer's markets and you
have no idea where this shit came from.

1080
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,860
There's nobody down there like I've heard,

1081
01:07:08,861 --> 01:07:11,770
like the FDA basically
polices like 3% of the food.

1082
01:07:11,771 --> 01:07:16,470
You have no idea where the fuck it
came from. You have no fucking idea.

1083
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,380
You have no idea what it's been
sprayed with and all of that shit.

1084
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:21,960
But it says organic and it
gets in your fucking head. Ooh,

1085
01:07:21,961 --> 01:07:25,650
I'm leaving fucking clean. You have no
fucking idea unless you grew it yourself.

1086
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:29,870
Um, dilemma. Um, all right,

1087
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:31,610
dear Billy Brown belt,

1088
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:35,770
would you rather be forced to eat protein
bars every meal for the rest of your

1089
01:07:35,771 --> 01:07:38,950
life or eat one meal every four days?

1090
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,230
MMM.
Can I survive?

1091
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:47,750
Can I survive eating one
meal every four days?

1092
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:53,020
I don't know if you could survive
doing that bad. That's a good one.

1093
01:07:54,410 --> 01:07:55,940
No, I'd rather you want
me to let me four days.

1094
01:07:55,941 --> 01:07:57,800
I think it'd be more healthy
than those protein bars.

1095
01:07:57,950 --> 01:07:59,510
Cause you don't know what the
fuck's in those things either.

1096
01:07:59,511 --> 01:08:02,930
You mean you flip that thing over like a
Django. Anyone thinks fucking overrated,

1097
01:08:02,931 --> 01:08:03,800
GNC,

1098
01:08:05,030 --> 01:08:09,170
all those powdered fucking
chemicals like that Maca powder.

1099
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,570
Every time I put that in there and go,
what the fuck is this shit?

1100
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:13,793
You know,

1101
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:18,320
the plant protein powder and all that
at Cisco, we'll go eat a fucking plant.

1102
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:23,990
Um, anyways, number two, all
right. Now the dilemma, um,

1103
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:28,770
I wouldn't want to be Billy Clif
bar for the rest of my fucking life

1104
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:34,110
cause once every four
days I could actually, uh,

1105
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:40,480
I could actually have something
that I liked, you know,

1106
01:08:41,170 --> 01:08:44,350
chicken and dumplings, some shit
like that. Something really fancy.

1107
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:48,040
Maybe there'll be like having a death
row fucking meal every four days.

1108
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:53,350
Yeah, that would be
tremendous. Um, as long as you,

1109
01:08:53,351 --> 01:08:55,720
I could do that in a healthy
way. Yeah, I would do that.

1110
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:59,800
You get used to that quick. Um,
number two, you're going to die,

1111
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:05,030
but you can save your life if
you succeed at one of two things,

1112
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:08,000
which do you have more
confidence in doing successfully?

1113
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:12,440
Having one year to study and get a perfect
score on the sats? Yeah. Fuck that.

1114
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:16,070
Or come in first place
in a game of monopoly.

1115
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:20,370
I have one year to come in first
place in a game of monopoly.

1116
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:25,830
How many games can I play?
Um,

1117
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:27,720
is it a monopoly tournament?

1118
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:30,330
My playing with a bunch of old ladies
that have been playing since the fucking

1119
01:09:30,331 --> 01:09:33,360
depression and they're going
to kick my ass. All right.

1120
01:09:33,361 --> 01:09:37,140
Having one year to study and get a perfect
score on the sats. You know what, Dude,

1121
01:09:37,141 --> 01:09:39,030
I would love to try to do that

1122
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:44,960
and it would take me way more than a year
with the math.

1123
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:49,520
Um, all I know is that
I took a college, uh,

1124
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:54,290
sat prep course and I still got,

1125
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,360
I got a three something combined.

1126
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:02,470
I'm not even fucking lying to you guys.
Like I, that sounds like a joke, but I,

1127
01:10:02,471 --> 01:10:05,530
I mean you, they'll give you like to be
an employee just to sign the paper. Yeah,

1128
01:10:05,531 --> 01:10:06,364
I know.

1129
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:07,753
I know.

1130
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:14,450
I forget what I got. I got, did I get
a four, 10 or a three 90? It was bad.

1131
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:17,120
And I remember getting
laughs at my sat score.

1132
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:19,703
Yeah.

1133
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:22,580
That's how, you know,
that's how I always did.

1134
01:10:22,581 --> 01:10:27,140
I was fucking made fun of myself and
I, and I got laughs. So I actually,

1135
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:32,360
I remember I didn't give a shit. I
never gave a shit. I always kind of,

1136
01:10:32,370 --> 01:10:34,600
I always kind of had this feeling and
I was going to do all right in life.

1137
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:41,530
You know, I had an overall
positive outlook despite
everything that I was doing.

1138
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,600
You don't have two years of a language.
Yeah.

1139
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:50,350
Y'All is fucking stupid shit. You
know what I mean? That's not a,

1140
01:10:50,351 --> 01:10:55,270
life is not about those things. All
right? I'm not saying don't try,

1141
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:57,910
don't fucking try to do well
on the thing and all that shit.

1142
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:01,000
I'm not fucking saying that.
Well, what are you saying, bill?

1143
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:05,650
I'm just saying that there's, there's
a million ways to skin a cat. Okay.

1144
01:11:06,010 --> 01:11:10,600
How the fuck did that come about?
Huh? I gotta look that one up.

1145
01:11:12,410 --> 01:11:14,990
It's more than one to skin a cat,
right?

1146
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:17,973
Yeah.

1147
01:11:18,550 --> 01:11:21,100
There's more than one
way to skin a cat origin.

1148
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:22,513
Okay.

1149
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:27,760
An early appearance is in way down east.
Fuck Jesus Christ.

1150
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:32,570
Well, what, what? Okay. Etymology of the
phrase, this more than one, more than one,

1151
01:11:32,571 --> 01:11:35,930
which you know, so many times when you
look these up, it's just not satisfying.

1152
01:11:38,350 --> 01:11:39,183
MMM.

1153
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:41,313
Yeah.

1154
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:45,220
So there's actually only two ways to
skin a cat while it's alive or while it's

1155
01:11:45,221 --> 01:11:49,060
dead. Well, I mean,

1156
01:11:49,061 --> 01:11:52,180
you could also start at the head.
You could start at the back.

1157
01:11:52,570 --> 01:11:55,390
Didn't want to say the ass.
There are two ways. One,

1158
01:11:56,450 --> 01:12:00,920
one of them is you skin a cat
because you are a bad person.

1159
01:12:00,921 --> 01:12:03,860
The other is you don't skin a cat.
You are a nice,

1160
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:07,940
or the cat never existed.
The third one,

1161
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:12,710
weight is both you skin a cat and
at the same time you don't scan it.

1162
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:14,000
Yeah.

1163
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,230
Okay.
This is just people writing.

1164
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:19,490
I find your use of boiled down
in this context disturbing.

1165
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:23,330
You knew this would, this would bring
out all the fucking animal lovers. Right?

1166
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:28,190
Let's see if there's any comments from
the fucking Peta people, PT people, Peta,

1167
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:29,960
Peta people.
There's more than one way to skin.

1168
01:12:29,961 --> 01:12:34,220
A cat is not referring to the removal
of flesh from our feline friends,

1169
01:12:34,221 --> 01:12:38,720
but rather a phrase that originated
from the Mississippi River region that

1170
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:42,500
pertains to the preparation of a catfish.

1171
01:12:43,490 --> 01:12:45,240
Oh,

1172
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:49,870
oh,

1173
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:54,790
well, maybe that's what it is. I have
no idea. I don't fucking know. Anyways,

1174
01:12:55,810 --> 01:13:00,730
that's the podcast.
Happy Labor Day to y'all.

1175
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,780
Happy Labor Day to you. Woo. Woo.

1176
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:07,630
I'm fucking check in on you this Thursday

1177
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:10,400
day.
Hey,

1178
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:14,210
go fuck yourselves and enjoy your day.
Uh,

1179
01:13:15,130 --> 01:13:17,620
fuck it.
Um.
