00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.579
 
okay I wanted to tell you about the

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589
okay I wanted to tell you about the
 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.840
okay I wanted to tell you about the
number 2084 it arises at the end of a

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850
number 2084 it arises at the end of a
 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.980
number 2084 it arises at the end of a
little story this particular one came

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990
little story this particular one came
 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.980
little story this particular one came
about on a chess board for this is a

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990
about on a chess board for this is a
 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.870
about on a chess board for this is a
really big chess board this is an

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880
really big chess board this is an
 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.210
really big chess board this is an
infinite board and so I'm gonna number

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220
infinite board and so I'm gonna number
 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.189
infinite board and so I'm gonna number
the squares so I'll start off I'll pick

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199
the squares so I'll start off I'll pick
 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.340
the squares so I'll start off I'll pick
any square and number at one and now we

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350
any square and number at one and now we
 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.370
any square and number at one and now we
work in a spiral around it and we number

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380
work in a spiral around it and we number
 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.620
work in a spiral around it and we number
them it's called a square spiral when we

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630
them it's called a square spiral when we
 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.150
them it's called a square spiral when we
row around and around around till we

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160
row around and around around till we
 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.580
row around and around around till we
filled up the whole board now what we do

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590
filled up the whole board now what we do
 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.819
filled up the whole board now what we do
is we take a knight an ordinary chess

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829
is we take a knight an ordinary chess
 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.790
is we take a knight an ordinary chess
night and we start him off at square

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800
night and we start him off at square
 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.560
night and we start him off at square
number one and now we look at all the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570
number one and now we look at all the
 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.720
number one and now we look at all the
squares that he can jump to the knight

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730
squares that he can jump to the knight
 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.910
squares that he can jump to the knight
could move from 1 to 12

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920
could move from 1 to 12
 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.600
could move from 1 to 12
or from 1 to 18 the rule is we always go

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610
or from 1 to 18 the rule is we always go
 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.000
or from 1 to 18 the rule is we always go
to the smallest square and we can't

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010
to the smallest square and we can't
 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.430
to the smallest square and we can't
repeat a square we have to always go to

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440
repeat a square we have to always go to
 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.279
repeat a square we have to always go to
a new square so from 1 it looks like to

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289
a new square so from 1 it looks like to
 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.130
a new square so from 1 it looks like to
me like we could get to 10 there are

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140
me like we could get to 10 there are
 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.340
me like we could get to 10 there are
eight squares and 10 is the smallest so

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
eight squares and 10 is the smallest so
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.289
eight squares and 10 is the smallest so
we're going to get a sequence which is

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299
we're going to get a sequence which is
 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.170
we're going to get a sequence which is
the sequence of the squares where the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180
the sequence of the squares where the
 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.350
the sequence of the squares where the
night goes to sum starts off at 1 his

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360
night goes to sum starts off at 1 his
 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.719
night goes to sum starts off at 1 his
first move is to the smallest number

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729
first move is to the smallest number
 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.300
first move is to the smallest number
that it can go to there they've hasn't

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310
that it can go to there they've hasn't
 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.880
that it can go to there they've hasn't
already been to so it can go to 10 from

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890
already been to so it can go to 10 from
 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.719
already been to so it can go to 10 from
10 ah it can move back to 3 so 10 goes

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729
10 ah it can move back to 3 so 10 goes
 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.539
10 ah it can move back to 3 so 10 goes
to 3 so the third term in the sequence

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549
to 3 so the third term in the sequence
 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.850
to 3 so the third term in the sequence
is 3 then from 3 we could go to 6 6 is

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860
is 3 then from 3 we could go to 6 6 is
 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.789
is 3 then from 3 we could go to 6 6 is
obviously the next number and then 9 4

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799
obviously the next number and then 9 4
 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.190
obviously the next number and then 9 4
so that's the sequence we do that

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200
so that's the sequence we do that
 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.770
so that's the sequence we do that
forever it would be nice if we could do

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780
forever it would be nice if we could do
 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.109
forever it would be nice if we could do
it forever but something strange happens

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119
it forever but something strange happens
 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.240
it forever but something strange happens
after we've been going on for a long

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250
after we've been going on for a long
 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.639
after we've been going on for a long
time it gets trapped in fact after 2016

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649
time it gets trapped in fact after 2016
 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.840
time it gets trapped in fact after 2016
steps it must it gets stuck it cannot

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850
steps it must it gets stuck it cannot
 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.450
steps it must it gets stuck it cannot
move every square every one of the eight

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460
move every square every one of the eight
 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.399
move every square every one of the eight
squares around it that it could move to

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409
squares around it that it could move to
 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.010
squares around it that it could move to
it's already been 2 so it died the

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020
it's already been 2 so it died the
 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.910
it's already been 2 so it died the
sequence dies at that point after 2016

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920
sequence dies at that point after 2016
 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.999
sequence dies at that point after 2016
steps and the last number that it

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009
steps and the last number that it
 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.210
steps and the last number that it
reaches is 2084 and I have in my note

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220
reaches is 2084 and I have in my note
 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.330
reaches is 2084 and I have in my note
here a picture of the spiral so you can

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340
here a picture of the spiral so you can
 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.860
here a picture of the spiral so you can
see it starts off here and the colors it

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870
see it starts off here and the colors it
 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.680
see it starts off here and the colors it
gets lighter and lighter as it starts

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690
gets lighter and lighter as it starts
 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.300
gets lighter and lighter as it starts
off fairly dark and then we have blue

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310
off fairly dark and then we have blue
 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.070
off fairly dark and then we have blue
and green and yellow around there are

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080
and green and yellow around there are
 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.070
and green and yellow around there are
very strange long lines of points where

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080
very strange long lines of points where
 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.520
very strange long lines of points where
it moves in a straight line this night

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530
it moves in a straight line this night
 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.200
it moves in a straight line this night
moving two and one two and one and so on

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210
moving two and one two and one and so on
 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.900
moving two and one two and one and so on
but eventually it gets to this red dot

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910
but eventually it gets to this red dot
 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.510
but eventually it gets to this red dot
and there it gets stuck all of the eight

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520
and there it gets stuck all of the eight
 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.000
and there it gets stuck all of the eight
squares it could possibly move to it's

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010
squares it could possibly move to it's
 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.010
squares it could possibly move to it's
already visited it's deliciously

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020
already visited it's deliciously
 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.080
already visited it's deliciously
arbitrary isn't an unexpected that it

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090
arbitrary isn't an unexpected that it
 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.970
arbitrary isn't an unexpected that it
could it you would have thought some

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980
could it you would have thought some
 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.430
could it you would have thought some
pattern or system had emerged where oh

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440
pattern or system had emerged where oh
 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.850
pattern or system had emerged where oh
it's gonna go forever now yeah it's

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860
it's gonna go forever now yeah it's
 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.410
it's gonna go forever now yeah it's
wonderful yeah this surprises me I think

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420
wonderful yeah this surprises me I think
 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.620
wonderful yeah this surprises me I think
it's wonderful it's it's yeah it's a

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630
it's wonderful it's it's yeah it's a
 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.780
it's wonderful it's it's yeah it's a
strange sequence the missing numbers

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790
strange sequence the missing numbers
 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.820
strange sequence the missing numbers
that that's another sequence so if we

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830
that that's another sequence so if we
 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.800
that that's another sequence so if we
look at the ones it doesn't visit there

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810
look at the ones it doesn't visit there
 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.120
look at the ones it doesn't visit there
are infinitely many that's an infinite

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130
are infinitely many that's an infinite
 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.160
are infinitely many that's an infinite
sequence and the smallest one it doesn't

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170
sequence and the smallest one it doesn't
 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.220
sequence and the smallest one it doesn't
get to is 961 you can do it without the

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230
get to is 961 you can do it without the
 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.530
get to is 961 you can do it without the
chess pieces you can do it with a castle

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540
chess pieces you can do it with a castle
 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.160
chess pieces you can do it with a castle
a rook you could do it on a chess board

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170
a rook you could do it on a chess board
 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.120
a rook you could do it on a chess board
of a different shape you could do it on

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130
of a different shape you could do it on
 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.720
of a different shape you could do it on
the kind of chess board that you get if

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730
the kind of chess board that you get if
 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.750
the kind of chess board that you get if
you just just one quadrant once one

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760
you just just one quadrant once one
 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.870
you just just one quadrant once one
quarter of the infinite board so let's

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880
quarter of the infinite board so let's
 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.910
quarter of the infinite board so let's
pretend we have our chess board and we

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920
pretend we have our chess board and we
 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.100
pretend we have our chess board and we
number the squares just as we did in the

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110
number the squares just as we did in the
 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.050
number the squares just as we did in the
spiral here we're gonna number them in

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060
spiral here we're gonna number them in
 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.130
spiral here we're gonna number them in
along diagonals more precisely along

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140
along diagonals more precisely along
 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.420
along diagonals more precisely along
anti-diagonal

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430
anti-diagonal
 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.490
anti-diagonal
two three and so on

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500
 
 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.830
 
you play the same game one and what's

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840
you play the same game one and what's
 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.900
you play the same game one and what's
the smallest square it can move to well

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910
the smallest square it can move to well
 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.610
the smallest square it can move to well
it can only move to eight or nine so it

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620
it can only move to eight or nine so it
 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.460
it can only move to eight or nine so it
has to go to the smaller of them so the

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470
has to go to the smaller of them so the
 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.460
has to go to the smaller of them so the
sequence goes one eight and now from

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470
sequence goes one eight and now from
 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.890
sequence goes one eight and now from
eight we could move to some big numbers

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900
eight we could move to some big numbers
 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.690
eight we could move to some big numbers
here but the smallest number is
