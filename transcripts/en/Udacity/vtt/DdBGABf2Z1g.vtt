00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.166
Welcome back. Up to this point, we've really only been working with one

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:08.910
variable. Analyzing the mean and the standard deviation, and seeing where a

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.786
sample mean falls on this distribution. And if that's typical, or not so

00:00:13.786 --> 00:00:19.379
typical. But now we're going to focus on two variables. With two variables, we

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:23.615
have a different design. This means we need to change how we collect our data,

00:00:23.615 --> 00:00:28.953
how we visualize our data. However, our analysis is going to be pretty similar,

00:00:28.953 --> 00:00:33.454
and you'll see later. Now that we're starting to discuss two variables instead

00:00:33.454 --> 00:00:36.846
of just one, let's start by thinking about two variables that might be related

00:00:36.846 --> 00:00:42.660
to each other. For example height and weight. People who are taller usually

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.052
weigh more. Or maybe time spent studying and your grade. May be the more time

00:00:48.052 --> 00:00:52.231
you spent studying the better your grade will be. Heres the weird one. The

00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:56.889
outdoor temperature and angle injuries. I read this article the other day, that

00:00:56.889 --> 00:01:00.610
said that the warmer weather causes the people to wear more flip flops and

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.486
sandals that make your ankles more prone to injuries. Do you have any other

00:01:06.486 --> 00:01:10.620
ideas? Post about it in the forums, and maybe include some information that you

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.370
found that shows this relationship.
