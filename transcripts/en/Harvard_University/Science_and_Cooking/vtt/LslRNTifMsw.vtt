MICHAEL BRENNER: OK,
so welcome to I think

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.802
this is the eighth lecture, although I'm
starting to lose count in this year's

00:00:22.802 --> 00:00:24.260
science and cooking lecture series.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.510
And we're really honored to have
with us Martin Breslin, who's

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.290
the chef for HUDS for Harvard.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.040
And we also have Alex and Luiz.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.150
And we're really honored
to have them with us.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.200
We've been doing this at
Harvard for many years,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.376
and we finally get to have
Harvard's chefs talk in this series,

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:44.834
and so I guess I'd just like
to start by clapping for them.

00:00:44.834 --> 00:00:47.680
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.130
And actually what they're going to
illustrate for us today is really

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.750
one of the most fascinating
parts of cooking,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.510
I think, which is the
science of texture-- how

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.520
it is that you actually thicken sauces
and what is the science behind that.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.400
So now just introduce
the science of this,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.770
I wanted to start by showing you the lab
that we're doing actually right now--

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.190
or starting on Thursday in the Harvard
College-- are we doing it right now?

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.440
We're doing it right now, the lab we're
doing right now in the Harvard College

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.620
class that goes along with this lecture
that the chefs are about to give us.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.480
And this is a sort of funny lab.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.537
It's called macaroni and cheese.

00:01:26.537 --> 00:01:28.745
It's that we have the
students-- and it's in the lab.

00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:30.704
It's in one of the labs over there.

00:01:30.704 --> 00:01:33.120
In one of the science labs,
they make macaroni and cheese.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.860
And what we ask them
to do is a bit strange,

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.510
which is that we ask them to make
four different varieties of macaroni

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.010
and cheese.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.760
You see we ask them to make it
with all of these different things,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.290
and then we ask them
to measure what we call

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.470
the viscosity, which is
the scientific term that

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.280
basically goes with thickeners.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.230
When you say a sauce is
thickening, a scientist

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.960
would say, well, it's more viscous.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.310
And we ask them to
measure the viscosity.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.550
And in order to demonstrate that
this viscosity-- this is actually

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.650
how thick it feels in
your mouth, but it also

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.870
has culinary significance
in different ways,

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.495
and the method that we use for them
to measure the viscosity is-- well,

00:02:10.495 --> 00:02:15.050
I was going to call it brilliant, but
that's probably overstating it-- this.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.330
What we do is we tell them to
take a cup full of macaroni

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.000
and then to pour the sauce
on top of it and to basically

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.200
measure how quickly the sauce covers
the macaroni, which is of course,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.940
measuring how easily it flows.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.990
Now, in this room in past years
when we've discussed viscosity,

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.970
we've even brought with us
scientific pieces of equipment

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.840
that are very fancy that go
under the name of rheometers

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.780
that basically measure the
viscous properties of liquids.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.300
And they're very esoteric, and they're
things that Pia, and I, and Dave like,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.634
but that most people don't like.

00:02:48.634 --> 00:02:49.883
And it's really less relevant.

00:02:49.883 --> 00:02:51.420
This is really the key experiment.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.120
Actually this picture was taken
from last year's HarvardX class.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.820
If you took the HarvardX class,
you also got to do this lab.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.330
Here are some pictures
from the HarvardX class.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.780
But what I want to do at the
moment is to ask the question which

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.260
I think will underlie
this entire lecture, which

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.010
is why is it that some of these sauces
spread so much more easily than others?

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.430
That is, what is it about the way
that they're made that makes them

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.220
something viscous and others not?

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.560
And if you want to think about the
least viscous thing that I can imagine,

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.250
it's basically water.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.750
So water is the least viscous thing.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.124
And you could imagine if you
took water and you poured it

00:03:27.124 --> 00:03:29.230
down this column of
macaroni, what would happen?

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.660
It would just go right
to the bottom, right?

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.060
It would go very quickly
and go right to the bottom.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.000
And this whole art of thickening
sauces that we're about to see

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.720
is really about making that not happen
and is somehow making it fall slowly.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.780
So what is going on?

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.772
So what is viscosity?

00:03:43.772 --> 00:03:44.730
So I already said this.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.230
That's a thickness of the liquid,
a liquid's resistance to flow.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.500
On the other side of
the scale for viscous,

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.070
water has the lowest viscosity.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.360
Honey, of course, has
a very high viscosity.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.210
It basically falls very slowly.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.440
But even another cooking
material that also has

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.690
a high viscosity, which you
may not think of this way,

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.050
is dough, because after all
if you take a ball of dough,

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.540
and you put it on the table, and we
waited until the end of the lecture,

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.210
it would've spread out and flattened
even more slowly than honey would.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.650
And so what is going on?

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.930
So what is the molecular origin of this?

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.570
These two pictures actually
we got from Nathan Myhrvold,

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.770
who has put together some of
the videos for the HarvardX

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.520
version of the class,
who had what I think

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.680
is a brilliant analogy of what's going
on, and I'm going to tell it you.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.770
And when you watch
these guys, if you want

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.990
a scientific analogy in the back
of your head, I recommend this one.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.495
So what Nathan said is imagine
you're going to the subway.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.830
And imagine you go during
a time on the weekend.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.240
There aren't many people there.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.790
You go from the place where you
give your ticket to the train,

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.100
and you just walk very quickly,
and there's no problem.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.391
We all could walk very quickly.

00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:54.380
There's no problem to get to the train.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.412
So that's not viscous
because we move very quickly.

00:04:57.412 --> 00:04:59.120
So on the other hand,
imagine a situation

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.789
which is like this, where the
subway car is full of people.

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:05.080
There are lots of people there.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.130
Then it's very slow.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.190
You could still flow.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.090
We could be moving.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.881
But you know when you're driving--
do any of you have this problem?

00:05:10.881 --> 00:05:13.470
You're driving down the road,
and the idiot in front of you

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.939
isn't going fast enough.

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:16.730
Maybe it's just me.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.870
I'm the one behind you that's honking.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.660
You're always like well why is this?

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.110
Don't know how to drive?

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.330
Maybe it's just me who does this.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.860
And in reality, what's happening
is that the poor person

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.460
has this set of people in front
of them, and they're blocking it.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.437
And that's viscosity.

00:05:33.437 --> 00:05:35.270
So the message is when
these guys are making

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.978
sauces that are thick,
what they're doing

00:05:36.978 --> 00:05:40.070
is they're adding stuff
to impede movement.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.169
They're making the packing fraction big.

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:43.460
That's what we're going to say.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.479
You're just putting stuff in there
to make it so that it doesn't move.

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.770
So then of course you know--
and also from this example

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.110
you also know-- I don't know if
you've ever experienced this.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.651
Certainly you've experienced it
while driving, is if you pack

00:05:54.651 --> 00:05:57.215
enough people in the roadway, you stop.

00:05:57.215 --> 00:05:58.450
Has anyone noticed that?

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.020
Does anybody know-- OK,
here's a question for you.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.100
This is going to sound like a crazy
question, and we didn't bring them.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.080
Does anybody have some M&amp;M's?

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.330
No M&amp;M's.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.860
No M&amp;M's.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.080
So suppose you took a jar of
M&amp;M's, and you just shook it.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.150
The M&amp;M's stop.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.420
They're not flowing.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.457
Does anyone know what fraction
of the jar is filled with M&amp;M's.

00:06:20.457 --> 00:06:22.540
This actually is good for
the kids in the audience

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.414
is there are any kids,
or even the grown ups.

00:06:24.414 --> 00:06:28.237
If you want to help your child
win an M&amp;M candy counting contest,

00:06:28.237 --> 00:06:29.570
this is number you need to know.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.580
The question is what fraction
of the jar is filled with M&amp;M's.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.290
Does anybody know?

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.210
Is it 50%.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.439
There's air in the jar.

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:38.730
I don't if you've noticed this.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.355
So it turns out there's a magic number.

00:06:40.355 --> 00:06:42.190
It's about 65%.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.550
That about the fraction.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.620
So basically if you ever get the
volume fraction of the stuff up to 65%,

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.070
it stops.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.930
If it's like 30%, it doesn't matter.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:51.750
It'll flow easily.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.760
You might as well not
put in anything at all.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.486
So there's this magic
range at about 50%, 60%,

00:06:56.486 --> 00:06:57.860
and that's where you want to get.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.270
And these guys and all of these
sauces they're going to make,

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.186
what you're going to see
is what they're doing

00:07:02.186 --> 00:07:04.560
is they're getting the fraction
up to round that range.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.600
So this is a movie of molecules
flowing over each other.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.600
So see they don't run into each
other, so the viscosity is actually--

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.940
there's no problem here.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.950
But on the other hand, if you
do the simplest kind of a sauce

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.060
that you can imagine-- is
a starch thickened sauce.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.480
And we'll see a starch
thickened sauce now.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.007
If you put starch
granules into a liquid,

00:07:26.007 --> 00:07:27.590
there's this weird thing that happens.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.560
You can put them at a pretty
low concentration-- a low volume

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.250
fraction is what we will say
because there's a lot of free space

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.500
here for these things to move.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.574
If you imagine these as
people in the subway car,

00:07:37.574 --> 00:07:40.740
they're not running into each other,
but then the point is when you heat it,

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:41.690
they swell.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:45.650
And not only do they
swell, they excrete stuff.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.102
They swell and they excrete stuff.

00:07:47.102 --> 00:07:49.060
And then what happens is
they end up like this.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.299
And if you imagine that this
is people in the subway car,

00:07:52.299 --> 00:07:54.090
then you see now it
doesn't move so easily,

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:58.185
and that is basically crux of
what it means to thicken a sauce.

00:07:58.185 --> 00:08:00.750
And I have a little movie of
this courtesy of HarvardX.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.730
And they also can stick to each other.

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.180
Not only do they grow,
they stick to each other.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.120
And now if they stick to each other,
they even become bigger people.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.425
So if you imagine the
analogy in the subway car,

00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:14.550
imagine that there are
groups of people that decide

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.177
to join hands and pummel through.

00:08:17.177 --> 00:08:20.010
Then you're going to get mad if
you're a poor person walking through

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.176
because then you're making
it harder to get through,

00:08:22.176 --> 00:08:25.810
and that's exactly what happens when
you make sauces as we're seeing.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.269
And so this brings up-- which
is the equation of this week.

00:08:28.269 --> 00:08:30.851
Now, what are you supposed to
do for the equation of the week?

00:08:30.851 --> 00:08:32.159
You're supposed to clap.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:35.059
So anyway, this is the equation,
and it's a very simple equation.

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:37.720
And this captures the whole
idea of thickening sauces,

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.740
which is it's the volume fraction.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.752
For some reason, we call it phi, Greek
letters just make it sound complicated.

00:08:43.752 --> 00:08:46.710
But it's just the number of particles
times the volume of each particle

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.470
divided by the total volume.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:52.720
And basically the game is when
that number gets to be a 50%, 60%,

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.290
you're good.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.990
You've thickened your sauce.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:59.750
So now I have one more thing to say--
I do have one more thing to say.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:00.520
Sorry.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.936
But I think this is important
for what you're going to do,

00:09:02.936 --> 00:09:05.530
and I just want to-- so you
know when you add flour--

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:07.680
has anyone ever thickened gravy?

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.040
How much flour do you add?

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:09.540
A lot?

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.340
A little?

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:11.000
A little?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.400
Because it swells, right?

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.983
That's why you don't have to add
very much, because it swells.

00:09:14.983 --> 00:09:17.840
So has anyone ever made
something more viscous

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.300
by adding xanthan gum or
some modernist thickener.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.884
Do you know how much you need?

00:09:23.884 --> 00:09:24.550
AUDIENCE: Teeny.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.091
MICHAEL BRENNER: Teeny, teeny, teeny.

00:09:26.091 --> 00:09:28.940
Do you know how much of
the Jello boxes is gelatin?

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.794
AUDIENCE: It's less than two grams.

00:09:30.794 --> 00:09:33.460
MICHAEL BRENNER: Yeah it's very,
very-- most of that Jello box--

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.510
do you know what the main
ingredient is in the Jello box?

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:36.030
AUDIENCE: Sugar.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:36.500
MICHAEL BRENNER: Sugar.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.100
It's sugar.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.090
It's not-- it's Jello.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:39.410
So this is amazing
actually, because if you

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.950
think of this in terms
of volume fraction,

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.210
this is totally weird, because you
add this little bit of this stuff

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:44.670
into this big amount of liquid.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:49.030
And it comes out, and if we go back
to the subway cars, how does it work?

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:55.450
So the answer is what happens is that
these special molecules are polymers.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:59.190
And there's not very much
polymer, but the polymer basically

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:03.360
forms a path in space, which
creates a lot of volume.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.406
And so it actually
takes up a lot of volume

00:10:05.406 --> 00:10:07.030
even though it's just a little polymer.

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:11.330
And the same way that the starch
granule expands and it takes up

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.774
much more volume than it had originally,
the polymer sort of sweeps it

00:10:14.774 --> 00:10:16.190
out and takes up that much volume.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.260
And that's why
modernistic thickeners are

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.190
able to work and make
thick milkshake feeling

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.210
things with a little bit of additive.

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:27.665
So with that, I guess I would like to
introduce Martin, and Alex, and Luiz,

00:10:27.665 --> 00:10:29.540
who will tell us how
the this is really done.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:30.390
MARTIN BRESLIN: Excellent.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:31.181
Thank you, Michael.

00:10:31.181 --> 00:10:35.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.930
Chef Luiz Da Costa, he's in
charge of our commissary,

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.830
where all the soup and
sauces are produced,

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:45.110
so viscosity is very
important when we're producing

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.350
large quantities of soups and sauces.

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:51.630
And Chef Alex takes care
of Mather House students.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:58.820
So we work for Harvard and primarily
support the undergraduate program.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.362
So the history of
thickening, of thickeners

00:11:02.362 --> 00:11:04.320
was very interesting when
I was looking at this

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.530
from a food historical perspective.

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:13.730
So the word sauce is a French word, and
it means to make our food appetizing.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.060
Sounds good.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.320
So go back 2000 years ago.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:23.440
The first real recorded recipes
were from the Roman Empire,

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.850
and it was Apicius, if I'm
pronouncing that correct.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.640
But in one of his
recipes, he actually said

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.620
"recipes for a particular flavorsome
sauce is noted that no one at the table

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.810
will know what the are eating."

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.860
The sauces we usually thicken with
wheat flour are crumbled pastry.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.290
Honey was often added.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:46.010
And the reason was the Romans often used
sauces to conceal doubtful freshness.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:47.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.022
So in truth, really
the French were right.

00:11:50.022 --> 00:11:51.480
It does make the food taste better.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.800
It can make really
bad food taste better.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.880
So we've got to ask ourselves--
so that's actually Pompeii,

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.797
and they're the ovens in Pompeii.

00:12:00.797 --> 00:12:03.130
And it's pretty cool, because
if you've ever been there,

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.320
they're all communal kitchens,
which is pretty amazing,

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.190
and bakeries, and very
much a retail concept.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:13.040
Very few people cooked at home.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.940
So why do we thicken?

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.372
Would anyone like to give some
suggestions to why we thicken our food?

00:12:23.068 --> 00:12:24.000
AUDIENCE: Mouth feel.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.166
MICHAEL BRENNER: Mouth feel.

00:12:25.166 --> 00:12:29.010
So mouth feel is the number one
reason why we thicken our food.

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:34.850
And that's important, because
if you're tasting a clear broth,

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:38.170
you're going to get a very different
experience if you even just thicken

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:39.630
that broth and do nothing else.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.650
Another one, of course, is cling.

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:48.350
So when you're putting your sauce on
food, you want it to cling to the food.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.100
You don't want it to run off the food.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.980
Could imagine a steak au
poivre that wasn't thickened?

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:58.500
So cling is very important,
keeping sauces on the plate.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.050
And of course, then we
have particle suspension--

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:04.020
holds solids of prevents
sticking or floating,

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.300
and stabilize emulsions when you're
talking about salad dressings

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.560
and so on.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.320
So they're the real main-- there
are, I'm sure, more reasons,

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:16.440
but that's the most important
reasons why we thicken our food.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:21.710
The thickening process--
dispersion, hydration, and setting.

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:23.550
So when we're adding
a thickening agent, we

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:27.390
want to make sure it's evenly
distributed throughout the liquid.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.640
We could use heat, cold,
acid, or other liquids

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.700
depending on what you're
using to thicken the food.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.640
Then hydration-- it's going to
absorb water or another liquid,

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.260
and it will swell.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.400
That's how it thickens.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.220
The thickening agent will make it
thick-- molecular mesh that traps

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:49.910
water, and Michael could definitely
explain that much better than I will.

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.990
And setting, that's the
effect of temperature.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:56.940
If you're using gelatin, of course
it's going to set when you chill it.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:05.340
Now, we're going to start by showing
you some thickening agents in work.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:08.010
So the first one I'm
going to use is blood.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.730
So if you're familiar with
coq au vin, traditionally it

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:12.650
was thickened with blood.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:16.330
There's quite a few dishes in
the French culinary repertoire

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:17.702
that were thickened with blood.

00:14:17.702 --> 00:14:19.410
And believe it or not,
you can buy blood.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.340
So when you're adding blood--
and I'll show you [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:30.470
as well-- with blood you add vinegar,
and we had a great discussion

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.150
earlier about what really that does.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:36.310
So you add a little bit
of vinegar to the blood,

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.240
and it does stop it from coagulation.

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:44.970
Just a drop.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:47.640
And another important feature
when you're using blood,

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.620
you want to temper it.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.140
So tempering it is just you don't want
to shock it going into a hot sauce.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:59.005
I'm just going to take a little bit
of the sauce and temper it here.

00:15:02.942 --> 00:15:04.650
I might just add a
little bit more blood.

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:05.413
Why not?

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:17.900
And many cultures today still
use-- you might tell from my accent

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:22.090
that I come from across the pond,
and we use blood sausage all the time

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:22.750
for breakfast.

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:28.080
So blood is still a part
of dining in Ireland.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:33.350
So what you want to do is, like
you did on monte au beurre,

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.930
I just gently fold in the blood.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:46.145
Does it look gross?

00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:49.310
Now do you notice what's happening?

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:50.610
The color is changing, right?

00:15:53.936 --> 00:15:55.310
And I can see it thickening here.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.810
I can give it a little bit more heat.

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:16.270
So I will show you-- I'm just
heating it a tiny bit more.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:18.310
You don't want it to
go over 180 degrees,

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:20.520
or you will have scrambled blood.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:26.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:35.030
So it actually gives to this
dish a very rich, complex,

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:43.490
sometimes it can be a little
metallic-- do you see the color?

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:46.840
And that's pretty thick.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:52.140
And it's very rich, and coq au vin
is a very rich dish when you eat it.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.780
It's a nice winter dish.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:17:00.530
And that is coq au vin
thickened with blood.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.514
And we can finish it with some parsley.

00:17:02.514 --> 00:17:09.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.450
That's beautiful.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:11.839
Look at the shine on that sauce.

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:13.030
It's really nice.

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:18.660
So the next thickener was used
also in classic French cuisine,

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.119
and it's called a liaison.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:26.940
And a liaison is basically two
things coming together, right?

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:37.270
And we have egg yolks and cream.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:38.590
Now egg yolks are the same.

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:41.140
They go over 180 degrees,
you're going to have scrambled,

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:44.020
and it's sauce with a
really lumpy texture.

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:58.140
So you're familiar with
a sauce called a veloute.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.630
So veloute-- no?

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:04.260
So veloute is a velvet sauce, and
it gets its name from a liaison.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.790
And a lot of restaurants that
say they serve a veloute really

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.650
it's not a veloute.

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:14.760
It's very difficult to get
that texture without-- where's

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.069
the cream-- without using a liaison.

00:18:17.069 --> 00:18:19.360
And what makes this difficult
to do when you're cooking

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.970
is that it can only be done last minute.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:26.700
That means when the sauce is ready
to be served you put the liaison on

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.110
and it goes out.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:29.340
You can't reheat it.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.820
It's going to turn into scrambled eggs.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.830
And it gives a very,
very unique texture.

00:18:42.296 --> 00:18:43.322
ALEX: Right here, chef.

00:18:43.322 --> 00:18:44.530
MARTIN BRESLIN: Thanks, Alex.

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:46.613
So yet again, I'm going
to just temper the liaison

00:18:46.613 --> 00:18:51.130
a little bit with some
of the-- this is just

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:56.854
chicken stock with a very
small roux, not a full roux.

00:18:56.854 --> 00:18:57.770
That would thicken it.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:10.140
Now it should take on
a velvety appearance.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:14.710
If you look at velvet clothing,
this is exactly what this will do.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:20.300
And it makes it for a very different
mouth feel, and it's very rich.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.487
Quite delicious, too.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.430
I can feel that sauce is thickening.

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:33.410
And if you can see, we
don't have scrambled eggs.

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:35.700
That's a good thing.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:39.490
And that is coq au vin and a veloute.

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:42.030
And I'm going to pass you
down to Alex, and Alex

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.650
is going to show you
two more thickening--

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:47.450
and Alex is going to demonstrate
arrowroot and cornstarch

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:48.510
as a thickening agent.

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.100
ALEX: Hello, everyone.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:20:01.050
I'm going to talk about two more
starches, arrowroot and cornstarch.

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:07.700
And I'm going to make two simple
sauces that we all can do.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:13.900
The first sauce I'm going to make
is simple sweet and sour sauce.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.290
And I'm going to use cornstarch.

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:20.910
Cornstarch is a starch from corn.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:27.110
And it has a strong flavor.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:30.100
It leaves and opaque color.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:38.860
It's not the perfect starch to
use for a clear finishing product.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:43.360
But for a lot of Asian
dishes, the cornstarch

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:55.070
is good for hot, cold, sweet, savory
dishes, and it's pretty universal.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:21:03.410
The cons to using cornstarch is that
it doesn't recover from being frozen,

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:07.680
and if you use too much,
the flavor is strong.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.010
But the positive side of
cornstarch, it's gluten free,

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:16.300
and with all the allergens
going on in the world today,

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.510
this is a good alternative.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.450
So, simple.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:32.100
We add all the
ingredients-- a cup of soy,

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:46.850
three tablespoons of sugar,
a cup rice wine vinegar,

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:48.725
and about half a cup of ketchup.

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:59.350
So to use cornstarch as a thickener,
you have to make what's called a slurry,

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:08.790
and a slurry is basically equal parts
flour and water to a thick liquefied

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:11.460
paste.

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:16.440
And the reason why you make a slurry
is that, if you add the cornstarch

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:21.130
straight to the sauce, you
would have clumps and lumps,

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:24.600
little pillows of cornstarch
that won't blend properly.

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:32.107
So I'll whisk just to make sure
everything is incorporated,

00:22:32.107 --> 00:22:33.190
and I'll start the slurry.

00:22:43.838 --> 00:22:45.977
MARTIN BRESLIN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:45.977 --> 00:22:47.185
ALEX: All right, that's fast.

00:22:47.185 --> 00:22:48.310
MARTIN BRESLIN: You got it?

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:10.660
So you mix the water and the corn
start together, you have your slurry.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:17.860
And when the sauce is up to a boil is
the perfect time to add the slurry.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:21.080
And the sauce definitely
needs to be boiling.

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.660
It needs to be above ball 180 degrees.

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.080
And the slurry needs to
start with cold water.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.780
You can't stop with hot water
because it will definitely

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:35.820
do something different to the
thickening where it will prematurely

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:41.960
thicken the slurry, but not thicken the
sauce, and you'll have a broken sauce.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:45.440
Put this here.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.247
And then I'll just add the--

00:23:47.247 --> 00:23:48.580
MARTIN BRESLIN: Pineapple juice.

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:49.496
ALEX: Pineapple juice.

00:24:00.433 --> 00:24:03.331
MARTIN BRESLIN: It
smells good from here.

00:24:03.331 --> 00:24:05.090
MICHAEL BRENNER: What
did you just add in?

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:06.260
ALEX: Just a little pineapple juice.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.176
MICHAEL BRENNER: Oh,
that was pineapple juice.

00:24:08.176 --> 00:24:10.500
See, I'm counting volume fraction.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.000
No, no.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.220
You guys are watching him cook,
and I'm counting volume fractions.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.700
How much water did you put in there?

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:17.300
In the slurry?

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:17.990
It was 50/50?

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:19.170
ALEX: It was about a half a cup.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:20.795
MICHAEL BRENNER: A half a cup of water?

00:24:20.795 --> 00:24:25.170
And there's much more
than a cup of the sauce.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:26.960
This is a couple cups
of sauce, isn't it?

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.960
MARTIN BRESLIN: It is a
couple of cups of sauce.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.222
ALEX: In actuality, I'm probably
not going to need all of the slurry.

00:24:32.222 --> 00:24:33.930
MICHAEL BRENNER: So
it's going to expand.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:35.230
ALEX: And again--

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.230
MICHAEL BRENNER: You see what I mean?

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:41.770
ALEX: You want to add slowly, stir.

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:43.520
And as you can see,
the color has changed.

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:53.990
MARTIN BRESLIN: That's pretty thick.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:55.020
ALEX: Yeah, it's thick.

00:24:57.895 --> 00:24:59.311
MICHAEL BRENNER: Did you see that?

00:25:02.737 --> 00:25:05.070
I know you've thickened sauces
before, but it's amazing.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.080
You just put in a little of that
stuff and it got that much thicker.

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:14.570
ALEX: So here I'm going to
make a blueberry compote, which

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:21.570
would basically be a dessert sauce
or could be used as a pie filling.

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:26.556
And I'm going to thicken
this sauce with arrowroot.

00:25:26.556 --> 00:25:31.010
And the reason why I'm using
arrowroot, because arrowroot has,

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:32.520
one, a neutral flavor.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:37.885
When you're using fruit, it's best to
have a neutral flavor, something that's

00:25:37.885 --> 00:25:40.310
not going to overpower the fruit.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:47.760
So I have some frozen
blueberries, some orange juice.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:52.340
And just like the cornstarch, I'm going
to make a slurry with the arrowroot.

00:25:56.044 --> 00:25:58.370
Let's go up.

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:04.540
So arrowroot is a plant
from the Caribbean,

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:11.550
and it has a very strong holding
power-- four times as much as flour.

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:20.810
And it's a very good food choice
for, like I said, a fruit dish,

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:23.940
and it's also gluten free.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.610
But here it is again, the slurry.

00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:29.160
About the same consistency.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:36.249
The blueberries are coming to a
boil, and I'm going to slowly add.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:52.900
The reason why I slowly add is
because, as the sauce thickens,

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.840
sometimes the stages
take longer or shorter,

00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:03.824
and I just don't want to go over or go
less, so I'm just going to add slow.

00:27:03.824 --> 00:27:06.770
And as you can see, it's
really thickening up.

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:10.060
Depending on what you're going
to use it for-- right now,

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:16.090
if I was going to nappe this sauce over
a pastry or a cake, I would stop here.

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:20.882
If I was going to use this as a pie
filling, I would go a little bit more.

00:27:20.882 --> 00:27:24.415
And then I'll go one more as
if we're going to fill this--

00:27:32.642 --> 00:27:33.850
MARTIN BRESLIN: Thanks, Alex.

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:39.410
ALEX: That concludes the
cornstarch and arrowroot.

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:41.147
I'm going to pass it to Luiz.

00:27:41.147 --> 00:27:43.647
MARTIN BRESLIN: Luiz is going
to demonstrate-- thanks, Alex.

00:27:43.647 --> 00:27:48.220
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:51.461
Luiz is going to demonstrate
a roux as a thickening agent.

00:27:51.461 --> 00:27:54.210
And while he's doing that, you're
going to taste what he's making,

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:57.040
and that's New England clam
chowder that served here

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.420
for the undergraduate
students every Friday.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.275
So we have a sampling coming out.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.190
Luiz added butter, right?

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:13.040
LUIZ DE COSTA: Add in
first the vegetables.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.430
Add in celery, and then I'm
going to add onions to it.

00:28:19.652 --> 00:28:20.860
Let it cook for a little bit.

00:28:53.222 --> 00:28:55.680
MARTIN BRESLIN: So Luiz, how
many gallons of chowder to you

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.360
make every Thursday for Friday?

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.409
LUIZ DE COSTA: Average
around about 100 gallons.

00:29:02.409 --> 00:29:04.200
MARTIN BRESLIN: Soo
100 gallons of chowder?

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.380
That's quite a lot of chowder.

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:06.450
LUIZ DE COSTA: It's quite
a lot of chowder, yes.

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:08.283
MARTIN BRESLIN: Think
you need a bigger pot.

00:29:08.283 --> 00:29:10.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.967
LUIZ DE COSTA: So basically,
I'm just adding the vegetables.

00:29:13.967 --> 00:29:15.300
Now I'm going to add the butter.

00:29:37.879 --> 00:29:39.545
MARTIN BRESLIN: Do you need bacon, Luiz?

00:29:39.545 --> 00:29:42.259
LUIZ DE COSTA: Yeah, I need the bacon.

00:29:42.259 --> 00:29:43.300
And I'm adding the bacon.

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:50.155
Just add the flour.

00:29:53.478 --> 00:29:55.050
So you can see it's--

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.170
MARTIN BRESLIN: What Luiz is
doing, he's making a white roux,

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:07.977
and that's an even amount
of flour and butter.

00:30:07.977 --> 00:30:10.810
So there's a white roux, a blond
roux, and then there's a dark roux.

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:17.380
And the dark roux is used if you're
making an etouffee down in Louisiana,

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:20.551
nice dark.

00:30:20.551 --> 00:30:22.610
LUIZ DE COSTA: I'm adding the cream.

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:23.350
MARTIN BRESLIN: There's more chowder.

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:24.620
Christa has it right here.

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:28.795
LUIZ DE COSTA: I'll add the bay
leaves, a little bit of thyme.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:39.223
Just stir in things to get a
thick and beautiful nice color.

00:30:39.223 --> 00:30:40.306
Going to add the potatoes.

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:49.420
And the last is the clams.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:09.773
Salt and pepper for flavor,
and the clam chowder is done.

00:31:09.773 --> 00:31:10.856
MARTIN BRESLIN: Excellent.

00:31:10.856 --> 00:31:16.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:21.805
MARTIN BRESLIN: So the next one we're
going to show you is xanthan gum,

00:31:21.805 --> 00:31:28.400
and xanthan gum is in a lot of
foods that you eat because it

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:34.610
is a stabilizer and a thickener.

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:39.120
So do you ever make tuna salad,
and you go to the tuna salad

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.960
maybe two hours later, and
there's kind of milk coming off

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:42.900
the tuna salad, right?

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:46.280
The mayonnaise has turned milky.

00:31:46.280 --> 00:32:21.590
So we've got some white tuna meat,
some blanched celery, some mayonnaise,

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:39.700
some lemon juice, little bit of salt and
pepper, and that's tuna salad, right?

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.960
But that tuna salad is not
going to stay like that.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:46.540
If you were making that
for tomorrow, you're

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.669
going to have-- it'll break down a bit.

00:32:48.669 --> 00:32:49.960
The mayonnaise will break down.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:53.410
The water from the tuna
will start coming out

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:57.220
because it's in cans
full of water or pouches.

00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:01.900
And xanthan gum-- it doesn't take a lot.

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:04.550
A little bit of xanthan
gum will keep that.

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:15.070
it doesn't interfere with
the tasted of the product,

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:19.035
but this will still
look like this tomorrow.

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:24.550
MICHAEL BRENNER: So that's it?

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:25.310
That's all it takes.

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:26.090
MARTIN BRESLIN: That's all it takes.

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:28.550
Xanthan gum is used
in a cold application.

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:32.600
Xanthan gum can be used
to think dressings, oils.

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.230
So you've got to think
of cold for xanthan gum.

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:37.850
MICHAEL BRENNER: So does
anybody know what it's doing?

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:39.990
There wasn't very much xanthan gum.

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:42.056
MARTIN BRESLIN: It doesn't need, yeah.

00:33:42.056 --> 00:33:44.430
MICHAEL BRENNER: Presumably
the xanthan gum is a polymer.

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:48.050
And presumably, as such, it's
making a gel in the water

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:51.240
and thus trapping the water
and not letting it out.

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:54.672
What's amazing is that such a small
amount-- you barely put any in.

00:33:54.672 --> 00:33:56.880
MARTIN BRESLIN: Just a little
sprinkle, little pinch.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.380
MICHAEL BRENNER: Does anybody
know where xanthan gum comes from?

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:00.580
This is like the quiz night.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:01.010
AUDIENCE: Bacteria.

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:02.093
MICHAEL BRENNER: Bacteria.

00:34:02.093 --> 00:34:03.240
MARTIN BRESLIN: Yep.

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.310
So one more.

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:07.940
And I'm going to show you an emulsion.

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:11.610
And I'm going to just do
this so you can actually

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:21.135
see what-- that's just some
shallots, some Dijon mustard-- I

00:34:21.135 --> 00:34:30.562
should be over here-- and vinegar.

00:34:30.562 --> 00:34:32.770
We'd normally do three to
one or something like that.

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:39.840
Now you can see that this is separated.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.840
It's really not doing
a whole lot, but just

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:57.200
by putting an emulsion blender in,
and a little bit of salt and pepper,

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.650
and you've got a nice dressing.

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:04.540
It's rice wine vinegar,
Dijon, and olive oil.

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:10.030
But that could be any vinegar you
like, and you could go to a milder oil,

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:11.135
like a canola oil.

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:19.844
But that has the consistency
of a thick sauce.

00:35:19.844 --> 00:35:21.260
MICHAEL BRENNER: Will it separate?

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:22.593
MARTIN BRESLIN: It does tend to.

00:35:22.593 --> 00:35:26.010
When you make it, you do
need to-- it won't fully

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:30.129
separate like an Italian dressing,
but just before you use it,

00:35:30.129 --> 00:35:31.545
you can just blend it or whisk it.

00:35:33.104 --> 00:35:36.270
MICHAEL BRENNER: Does anybody know why
before I put it under the microscope?

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:37.264
AUDIENCE: Because of the mustard.

00:35:37.264 --> 00:35:38.014
AUDIENCE: Mustard.

00:35:38.014 --> 00:35:39.472
MICHAEL BRENNER: Does anybody know?

00:35:39.472 --> 00:35:40.970
The mustard is important for this.

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:41.886
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:41.886 --> 00:35:42.940
AUDIENCE: Oil suspension.

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:44.898
MICHAEL BRENNER: You're
getting of us, but does

00:35:44.898 --> 00:35:46.940
anybody know what we're going to see?

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:49.230
Let's see if this works.

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:54.070
I shouldn't-- isn't that amazing?

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:55.610
They're droplets.

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:59.210
So what Martin has done-- and
I think this is really amazing.

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:00.171
So sorry.

00:36:00.171 --> 00:36:01.170
You've seen this before.

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:02.670
Probably you've done this yourself.

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:03.669
But you saw what he did.

00:36:03.669 --> 00:36:05.340
He poured in some oil.

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:06.780
He poured in some vinegar.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.339
he put in a little bit of mustard.

00:36:08.339 --> 00:36:11.380
There is the oil separated from the
vinegar, and then he just blended it.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:13.780
And look at all the
little droplets he made.

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:15.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.730
Thanks, guys.
