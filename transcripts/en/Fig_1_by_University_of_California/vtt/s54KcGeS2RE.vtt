00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.609
before Dr. Seuss, Ted Geisel had a very
successful career as an advertising

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.610
artist. As much as the children's books
are beloved worldwide

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.890
I think a lot of his earlier work has
not been as widely exposed or seen

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.670
In this case are some of

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.500
the new material Mrs. Geisel. I think
quite fascinating

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.750
that Dr. Seuss kept a folder of what
he considered his failures

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.170
some of which I think he just had as

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.270
little personal doodles this is
something that he called California's

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.170
for most "Nata-Luba-Crema" which was
enjoy a nice

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.610
swim while we service your car and
finalize your loved ones.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.940
a combination natatorium

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.520
lubritorium crematorium and here is

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.180
a wonderful set of drawings that are
playing cards sized

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.110
through the alphabet sometimes a female
name

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.070
and a male name for the same letter
never published

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.970
but just what was he thinking of what's
he going to do a deck of

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.250
alphabet cards? One of the
responsibilities

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.189
of units like mine Special
Collections and Archives

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.770
is preserving the legacy of

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.900
works like this making them available
for scholars

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.390
and the students i think thats part a
the public service the University

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.500
provides to preserve the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.159
materials to preserve the legacy of the
writers and artists who created them

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.350
and continue to make them available to

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.220
not just in the UC community but to the
public

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.470
