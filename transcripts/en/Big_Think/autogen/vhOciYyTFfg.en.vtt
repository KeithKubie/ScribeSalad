neighborhoods again this is a bias

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690
neighborhoods again this is a bias
 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.500
neighborhoods again this is a bias
toward familiarity and I think it's very

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510
toward familiarity and I think it's very
 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.000
toward familiarity and I think it's very
important to think about familiarity

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010
important to think about familiarity
 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.040
