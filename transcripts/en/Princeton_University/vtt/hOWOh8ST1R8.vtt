JULIA PEIPERL: When
I got to Princeton,

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.420
I didn't know that
I wanted to do

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.000
theater design at all, because
I was interested in everything.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.920
This is the set for
"Annie &amp; Rose," which

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.290
is a current music
theater thesis

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.010
that I designed the set for.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.040
It was a nice way to ease
my way into set design,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.370
because this was very inventive.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.730
Like what can we use this for?

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.580
And well, we don't
want to have a table,

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.220
so let's make it so that you
put a plank over two chairs,

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.610
and that becomes a table.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.890
So it was really fun for me.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.450
I really like that
kind of set design

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.930
where everything transforms.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.800
And it's been fun to
get to work on that.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.720
The nice thing about
Princeton is that there's

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.310
all these tiers of theater.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.100
There's the thesis
department theater,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.270
which is what I'm doing now.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.310
And there's student theater.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.180
I got the opportunity to do a
thesis show last year, which

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.990
was "Hero," which was this
crazy, high-flying aerial dance

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.490
piece.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.910
And all of a sudden,
I was working

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.500
with a professional set designer
and a professional music

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.000
director.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.260
And I feel comfortable
working in that community.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.170
And it has helped me to build
up a skill set in that way.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.510
So I took last semester a class
called advanced theater design.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.510
And this class
really does throw you

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.750
right into the process
of designing a show.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.610
So the big difference
between the shows

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.090
I've designed this
year, "Elektra,"

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.220
which I costume designed,
and "Annie &amp; Rose," which

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.330
I set designed, and "Hero"
last year, for these shows,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.050
I was made to do the
work that goes behind it.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.780
All of this research, and all of
this planning, and all of these

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.740
sketches, and trying
stuff, and throwing it out

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.830
and meeting with the director.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.210
And it was a really
full process.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.370
And there were three
of us in the class.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.700
We got guidance every
step of the way.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.360
I came to Princeton for
a liberal arts education,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.110
which I'm getting.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.490
But at the same
time, I'm getting

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.070
to do real design in a real
context with real background.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.230
So having these certificates,
I think, is giving me

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.340
the best of both worlds.
