[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:11.750
Hi there.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.041
My name is Ibrahim Elbouchikhi.

00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:15.286
I'm a product manager on
the Google Play Store.

00:00:15.286 --> 00:00:17.910
And today I want to talk to you
about what's new in Google Play

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.650
app discovery.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.980
Be together, not the same.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.760
This is the Android campaign
that's going on right now.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.170
It signifies the diversity
of the ecosystem-- the fact

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.880
that our users stem from so
many different countries,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.930
speak different languages,
have different interests,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.200
use different
devices, et cetera.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.790
And this particular diversity
makes it both a challenge

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.690
and an opportunity for us
to build a great discovery

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.715
experience.

00:00:45.715 --> 00:00:48.110
So I'm going to tell you
a bit more about it today.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.610
But first, I want to
quantify this diversity.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.030
We have over a billion users.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.320
They come from over 190
countries, speak 63 languages,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.685
and issue over 400 million
unique search terms each month.

00:01:02.685 --> 00:01:03.810
Now think about that again.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.070
These are 400
million search terms.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.530
Different interests, different
queries, different needs,

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.780
different questions.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.220
The user coming to
the Play Store to find

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.555
apps that they could satisfy.

00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:18.930
So that's really exciting to
us, and that just signifies,

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.490
again, the diversity
of the ecosystem.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.830
With an ecosystem this
diverse, how do you

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.460
enable organic discovery?

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.490
We think of it in three buckets.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.410
First is enabling
discovery through search.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.490
Search is one of the
key ways that users

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.210
discover apps on Google Play.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.500
Second is personalizing
the browse experience.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.020
And finally, it's about
enabling exploration,

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.350
which is slightly different
than personalization,

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.880
as I'll get into later.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.250
So let's talk about search.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.410
Traditionally, search
is a ranking problem.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.150
It's about getting
the most relevant app

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.250
at the top of the list.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.540
And over the past year, we've
invested significant resources

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.400
in making sure that
Google Play Store

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.040
search is incredibly relevant.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.120
But we also took a step back
and thought about new ways

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.610
to serve results on Google Play.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.979
And so we came up with
this new experience,

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.280
where results, the
organic results,

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.170
are clustered around
topics and concepts that

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.700
are easily relatable to users.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.450
And this does two things.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.890
First, it helps users
narrow their intent faster.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.730
They can easily browse,
scroll up and down,

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.610
and see which of
those subconcepts

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.530
are actually relevant
to their query.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.480
Second, it helps
users understand

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.070
the range of options
and a range of apps that

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.847
are available on Google Play.

00:02:38.847 --> 00:02:40.430
This experience,
obviously, only works

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.510
well for queries that
are very broad-- areas

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.680
that you can actually break
down into subconcepts.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.060
So look for us to
continue to invest in this

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.624
and roll it out further.

00:02:50.624 --> 00:02:52.040
From our experiments,
we have seen

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.090
that this experience drives
a greater total number

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.790
of installs from
more unique apps,

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.270
and very importantly, by
more unique developers.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.230
All really, really good
things for our ecosystem.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.610
So let's talk about
personalizing the store.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.060
One of the insights we've
had is that there's really

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.350
no average user when you
have an ecosystem like ours.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.010
We have over a billion users,
and they issue 400 million

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.510
search terms each month.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.380
You really don't have a
prototypical user or interest

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.950
you can design for.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.550
And in fact, if you build
a product for the average,

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.140
you will most likely end up
with a suboptimal experience.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.540
So we invested a
lot in making sure

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.380
that the Play Store is
relevant and highly personal

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.690
to our users.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.854
We think of it as
one user, one store.

00:03:39.854 --> 00:03:41.270
And so if you're
a user interested

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.170
in hiking and fitness, you
may see this Play Store.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.360
If you're someone who's
interested in learning

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.550
new languages and photography,
you may see this one.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.300
And most importantly,
we've learned

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.070
that personalization really
drives an increase in installs,

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.960
and in fact doubles the
likelihood that a user will

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.040
install an app.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.177
This is intuitive.

00:04:02.177 --> 00:04:04.010
If you see something
that's relevant to you,

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.670
you're more likely
to install it.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.600
But the magnitude
of the improvement

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.780
is what's really
interesting here.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.620
So as you build your
apps, your experiences,

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.570
I recommend looking
at personalization

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.800
as a way to drive an increase
in growth, just like we did here

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.290
on the Play Store.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.380
Finally, let's touch on
enabling exploration.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.780
Exploration is different
than personalization.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.730
Exploration tries to be
a bit more tangential.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.080
If you've installed a
number of apps of this type,

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.499
I'm going to give you a few apps
that are slightly different.

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:37.290
And that's what we're
trying to grow and do

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.550
more of on the Play Store--
broaden users' interests

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.400
and help them explore more.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.820
Over the past year, we've
launched e-developer pages.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.080
These are home pages for
developers on the Play Store.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.950
And what this does is, if a
user is browsing a developer's

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.240
app details page, they
will see a collection,

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.490
a rich collection, that
when they click on,

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.120
they go to this home page.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.890
In here, they see a featured
app by the developer.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.850
Then they see all of their apps.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.170
They can then navigate
to one of those apps,

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.090
discover a similar
app, and so on.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.650
This continuous cycle of
discovery and browsing

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.110
and pivots is really
healthy for the product

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.160
and enables exploration we
wanted to invest in more.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.590
Next is Google Play for
Families, which we also

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.730
launched this year.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.490
Families are an important
segment for Google Play,

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.690
and offering them a
discovery experience

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.520
that helps them find apps is
really, really important to us.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.100
One of the neat experiences we
built is this character picker.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.310
For example, if your kids are
obsessed with Superman or Dora,

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.364
you can easily come
here and see the icon

00:05:41.364 --> 00:05:43.030
for that particular
character-- probably

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.857
the same way they're
dressed-- and find

00:05:44.857 --> 00:05:46.690
apps and games and books
and movies that are

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.930
relevant to them very easily.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.510
This is a really fun discovery
experience for parents.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.940
Finally, look for
us to invest more

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.920
in context-based discovery.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.150
Whether time-based
or location-based,

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.600
we'll look to aggregate
apps based on that context

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.910
and serve them up to users
just at the right time

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.550
or the right place.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.500
Whether it's living
in New York or Mumbai

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.290
or whether it's the
weekend or the evening,

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.890
we'll start serving up more
of these apps to our users.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:20.930
It's another way, again, to
drive exploration of the store.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.940
Thank you so much for
listening, and stay

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.620
tuned to the Google Developer
channel for more content.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.295
Thank you.
