00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:03.029
Careful, viewer! My spoiler sense is tingling!

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.540
Since 2002, we've had six movies, two reboots, and three Spider-Men

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:26.078
Now just when audiences might be getting a little sick of the franchise, Marvel swoops in to deliver a crowd-pleasing comedy

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.529
That's gonna keep Spider-Man in theaters until the fuckin Sun burns out of the sky.

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.769
Spider-Man Homecoming

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.349
Tobey Maguire couldn't keep it up, Andrew Garfield couldn't get it started

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:44.409
But Tom Holland hits the ground swinging in a great reboot that just assumes you're all caught up on the MCU.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.600
Pretty sure this guy's a war criminal now.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.109
but whatever. Complete with a glossed over origin story an

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.890
Actor who doesn't have premature old face and a villain who doesn't already have some forced personal connection to Peter- Pan Liz's dad

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.340
All right two out of three ain't bad

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.000
Witness a brand new take on spider-man. He's a millennial now who can't stay off his phone

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.229
Constantly blogs watches himself on YouTube and has zero patience for anything

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:31.030
He's got all of the usual spider skills plus a powerful new one never facing consequences for his actions

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.790
Whether he's getting away with ditching detention

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.089
Hey where you going? Get back here quitting on his team?

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.050
You can't just quit on a stroll up and be welcome back welcome back Peter

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.780
mostly imprisoning people

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.435
Shinsuke ours is bad. It's my car, dumbass

00:01:46.435 --> 00:01:48.900
Wrecking a car wrecking a store

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.960
Wrecking a fairy or wrecking his girlfriend's entire life

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.769
You can be sure this web slinger will get off with no more than a stern talking-to

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.379
You're a good kid and you're a smart kid so just try to keep your head straight. Okay. Okay, don't get out here

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.880
Well the older I get the more I relate to Jay Jonah Jameson. These are matters for the entire city

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.479
You've seen him as Batman and Birdman

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:24.129
Now prepare for Michael Keaton's third winged creature role as the vulture. He's a blue-collar guy who gets shafted by Stark Industries

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:32.680
And instead of filing a lawsuit against a billionaire clearly in the wrong. He'll build a giant bird mech jetpack, huh?

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.140
You will be bored stiff when Vulture fights spider-man in bland CGI slugfests

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.839
But genuinely scared when he's just being Michael Keaton

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.970
Are you scared? I'l bet you're glad that your old pal spider-man showed up in the elevator though

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.780
Sorry Uncle Ben and Richard Parker

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.769
There's a new absentee dad in town Tony Stark Iron Man is back as the drunk rich stepfather

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.309
You'd expect him to be who will build you a killer robot suit?

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.759
Activating instant kill send you into battle at 15

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.399
Then literally phone in his parents aid until you screw up enough to get his attention. Okay. It's not working out

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.180
I'm gonna need the suit back really Tony

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.109
You just fought your best friend over keeping tabs on superheroes

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:18.159
And you just let your pet superhero run a muck is anyone paying attention to the timeline any more?

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:25.430
This is approaching x-men levels of Sloppy she sends Bishop back in time. No just his consciousness that's all into his younger self

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.110
Wow

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:35.240
So enjoy another super smash hit who's success was far from guaranteed with two competing studios spotting for control

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.089
Six different screenwriters and a director with just two low-budget indies to his name dang

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.290
It's like Sony finally cracked the code on how to make the spider verse happen let Marvel do the work

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.480
Starring: Tom Netherlands

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.480
drunkle Stark

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.400
only winners do drugs

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.080
Chef

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.420
The disembodied voice of Jennifer Connelly

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.860
"you can call me Karen if you would like"

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:59.900
Marisa To-may

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.470
vulture or the unexpected virtue of casting Michael Keaton

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.820
technically in the movie

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.810
...And Wonder Woman?

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.810
The Perks of Being a Wallcrawler

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.010
Bold move putting a set piece in an elevator shaft spider-man can't catch a break with that

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.200
"I like bread"

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.200
"beetlejuice beetlejuice beetlejuice!"

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.200
"Darkness falls across the land the midnight hour is close at hand!"

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.779
"I'm David pumpkins. Any questions?"
