00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.290
You've done amazing work.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.110
Really, you should be proud
of all the hard work and

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.350
effort you put into learning Ember.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.350
You've worked with Ember CLI,
Ember's file structure,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.810
the handlebars templating language,
components and

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.900
templates, consuming services, and
handling user engagement with actions.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.630
You now have a solid foundation to
continue learning more about Ember.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.030
Yep, there's still more to it, but

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.720
the Ember docs are full
of helpful information.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.250
I hope the app we created is your
first of many Ember apps to come.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.290
As you're working on your next Ember
project, make sure to share with me, and

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.940
the other students in the forum.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.200
I can't wait to see what you create.
