MANO MARKS: Hi.

00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.470
I'm Mano Marks.

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.810
Welcome to another Google
Maps Developer Relations

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.260
Screencast. In today's tutorial,
I'm going to be

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.092
discussing the MarkerClusterer
utility library.

00:00:11.092 --> 00:00:13.350
If you have a lot of markers,
your map can look cluttered

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.830
and be difficult to use.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.410
For instance, try picking out
the right marker to click from

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.450
this group of markers.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.385
Lots of markers can also slow
down your application.

00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:25.510
The more markers you have, the
more the browser has to work

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.530
to render those markers,
especially in older browsers.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.250
MarkerClusterer solves both
these problems. In its

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.370
simplest form, MarkerClusterer
replaces geographically

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.080
clustered icons with a single
icon that tells you how many

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.190
markers are in the group.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.890
Let's take a look
at this example.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.820
As you can see, there are blue
markers with numbers on them

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.120
to indicate how many
markers are

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.340
represented by this cluster.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.980
As you click on one of those
icons, the map zooms into the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.035
group of markers and
splits them out.

00:00:55.035 --> 00:00:57.440
If the markers become
sufficiently spread apart,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.170
they will appear as individual
markers.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.500
In this case, you can see that
some of the markers appear as

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.080
you get closer, and some of
them group themselves into

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.070
other clusters.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.370
MarkerClusterer is customizable,
too.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.500
In this sample, we have
customized the icons, the text

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.900
color, and the size based
on the number of markers

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.700
represented by the cluster.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.900
Let's take a look at the basic
code to get you started.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.460
Go to the Google Maps API loader
and the MarkerClusterer

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.210
code and add in some JSON
that allows you to

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.870
build markers later.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.221
Next, create the map.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.880
Then create a bunch of markers
by iterating over the JSON

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.200
that you loaded earlier.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.770
Don't set them on
the map, though.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.350
Just put them into an array.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.180
Finally, we push the array into
a MarkerClusterer object.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.040
Now let's take a look
at the results.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.770
As you can see, this
is the first sample

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:52.620
that I showed you.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.010
We just rebuilt it.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.470
So all you have to do, create
the markers, and

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.780
add them to an array.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.150
Then add the array to a
MarkerClusterer, and it will

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.590
handle all the clustering
for you.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.889
OK, so your next step is to go
over to the utility library

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.610
documentation and check out the
MarkerClusterer library.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.760
You can click on this
link, and it'll

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.760
take you right there.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.150
And there's lots of great
information in there, samples

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.360
you can use.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.530
And then just start building
your own clustered

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.230
applications.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.070
You can also check out this
article on our documentation

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.990
that gives more complete
description of how to do

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.610
clustering and different
techniques for dealing with

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.640
too many markers.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.300
So I look forward to seeing
the work that you did.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.220
Thanks for listening.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.470
Bye.
