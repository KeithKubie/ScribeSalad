00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.050
A classic Hollywood trope is the idea of a
poster with the photo of a given criminal

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.040
along with very large print text that would
say something like “Wanted- Dead or Alive”.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.750
But did these actually ever exist and could
you actually kill someone legally when such

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.339
a poster was issued by the authorities?

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:58.600
To answer the first question- yes, there are
many known instances of such “Dead or Alive”

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.610
posters being put up by the state and other
entities, but that doesn’t actually tell

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.799
the whole story.

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.200
Just because a poster stated something like
“Dead or Alive” it did not grant any individual

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.860
the right to kill the person without legal
consequences.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.850
For example, consider the infamous murder
of Jesse James at the hands of his outlaw

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.390
buddies Charley and Robert Ford.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.790
Missouri governor Thomas Crittenden negotiated
with various rail companies to offer a $5,000

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.159
($131,000 today) reward each for the capture
of Jesse James or his brother Frank.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.920
The subsequent posters noted “Wanted Dead
or Alive Jesse or Frank James”.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.840
Ultimately the Ford brothers arranged with
the governor in secret to bring their buddy

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.069
Jesse in.

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:45.729
Deal struck, on the morning of April 3, 1882,
the brothers had breakfast with James.

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.970
After eating, the trio walked into the living
room.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.860
When James turned his back on the brothers,
reportedly to clean a dusty photo, Robert

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.940
Ford shot him in the back of the head.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.380
Unfortunately for Charley and Robert, when
they went to collect the reward, they instead

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.690
found themselves promptly arrested for murder
and soon after were sentenced to hang.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.129
You see, James was unarmed at the time of
his death, and just as importantly was not

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:10.330
in any way resisting arrest or attempting
to flee.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.930
He seemingly didn’t even know the Ford brothers
were there to arrest him that day.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.540
To get away with killing such a person you
were attempting to collect a bounty on the

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.930
person needed to be resisting in some way,
particularly in a way that threatened your

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:23.930
own life.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.790
Thus, you could only kill them if it was self
defense, which wouldn’t have been any different

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.040
than if someone attacked you outside of any
bounty scenario, with one caveat.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.040
For quite some time in U.S. history it was
legal to use deadly force against a fleeing

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.390
felon, even if your own life wasn’t immediately
threatened.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.300
The logic behind this was seemingly that chasing
down a fleeing person could be dangerous in

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.450
unforeseen ways.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.689
It also incentivized criminals to not try
to flee in the first place upon discovery.

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:56.370
Granted, if no one was around to witness,
whose to say the dangerous criminal you killed

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.799
didn’t actively threaten your life in an
imminent way to cause you to defend yourself?

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.319
And given that bringing such a criminal in
across long distances used to be an extremely

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.400
dangerous affair in many cases, anecdotally
it seems like it wasn’t uncommon to simply

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.859
rid the world of the alleged criminal first
and then lie about what happened after.

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.049
A body is so much safer to transport and people
were quick to believe a dangerous criminal

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.049
would fight tooth and nail to escape because,
after all, in many cases they probably did

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.430
if they knew being brought in was going to
likely result in a hanging.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.430
They really had nothing to lose.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.470
On that note, Teddy Roosevelt was once thanked
by boat thief Michael Finnigan for not killing

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.750
him in this sort of scenario, despite the
extreme risk to Roosevelt at the time.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.639
In a nutshell a couple guys stole a boat from
Roosevelt in the dead of winter.

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.349
Rather than let it go, Roosevelt dropped everything
and built a new boat, tracked them down and

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:44.519
captured the thieves.

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.379
The whole affair ended up being a few hundred
mile trek, which had to be partially on foot

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.310
because ice made the river unnavigable at
a certain point.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.269
Near the end, Roosevelt had to stay awake
40 hours straight to guard the prisoners as

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.340
they walked and rested.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.730
You see, he was escorting them alone at that
point and it was so bitterly cold that he

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.940
worried the criminals would get frost bite
if he bound them in any way, so he didn’t.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.799
In the end, Roosevelt didn’t even press
charges against one of the men, noting he

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.999
didn’t “have enough sense to do anything
good or bad.”

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:16.500
As for the aforementioned Finnigan, while
he did find himself behind bars, he thanked

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.650
Roosevelt for not killing him as most lawmen
would have done in the same set of circumstances.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.990
You can learn much more about this fascinating
saga on one of our favorite series of our

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.330
BrainFood Show podcast titled The Bull Moose.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.580
Though perhaps a better title for that series
would have been: In Which Teddy Roosevelt

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.639
Makes Men Everywhere Feel a Little Less Manly.

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.389
In any event, going back to the Ford brothers,
they did end up getting off as the governor

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:45.120
went ahead and pardoned them, something that
was met with mixed reaction by the general

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.120
public.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.870
The speed at which the trial and pardon happened
had some accusing the governor of actually

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.389
knowing before hand that James would be killed
and that the pardon had likewise all been

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:55.590
pre-planned.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.860
Although this seems to strain credibility
because if Robert Ford had known it would

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.000
be illegal to kill James in the way he did,
he could have killed him in the exact same

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.720
way and just made up a story that James had
tried to attack him or flee.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.610
No one would have been the wiser in that case
and there would have been no need to trust

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.310
the governor to grant a pardon.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.990
Whatever the case, going back to the Wanted
Dead or Alive posters, there are a few more

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.260
caveats to consider as well.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.840
First, while depictions in movies and games
often show clear photographs, in reality many

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.610
historical examples were simple sketches,
and often even got the descriptions of the

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.690
person wrong.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.050
Further, in the vast majority of cases, it
was lawmen themselves who would take it upon

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.400
themselves to go hunt down the criminal and
collect the reward, not someone in the general

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.400
public.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.870
Naturally, while finding criminals was sort
of their job anyway, criminals that had bounties

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.580
on their heads tended to get much higher priority
and a lot more effort.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.310
A caveat to that was that it was occasionally
the case that a member of the general public

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.979
would be deputized specifically to go capture
someone.

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.159
This brings us around to who pays.

00:05:55.159 --> 00:06:00.030
In most cases, as you might have guessed from
our former mentioned instance of Missouri

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.759
Governor Thomas Crittenden getting railroad
companies to put up the reward money, this

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:07.960
usually wasn’t actually the state itself,
but rather private companies or individuals

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.440
who had particular interest in seeing someone
brought to justice and wanted to incentivize

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.879
law enforcement to actually do something about
it.

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:18.331
It was also these private entities that were
more likely to have something like “Dead

00:06:18.331 --> 00:06:20.949
or Alive” put in the poster if they were
involved.

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:25.069
The legality of killing the person wasn’t
really relevant here- only what the stipulations

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:26.260
were for getting the reward.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.370
And if the company or person just wanted the
alleged criminal out of the way, regardless

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.409
of how it happened, they might state that
they were happy to pay even if the person

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:35.409
was killed.

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:39.360
This would incentivize more people to try
to capture the person as the risk would be

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.500
less than if it was required that the person
be brought in alive no matter what.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.280
If the wanted poster and reward were coming
from the state alone, it was far more likely

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.340
that the poster would say something more benign,
and more likely that a bounty would only be

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.030
paid if the person was brought in alive and
in some cases even requiring the person be

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.030
convicted.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.409
Again, all of this had more to do with the
stipulations surrounding how one could get

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:05.450
paid, rather than the legality of anything
suggested in the poster.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:09.199
It should also be noted that if a private
citizen aided a lawmen in tracking down or

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:13.569
bringing in alleged criminals, from accounts
we reviewed it would seem not uncommon at

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:17.720
all for the lawmen to go ahead and make sure
they themselves got the lion’s share of

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.420
the reward, in a few instances even when the
lawmen did little but recover the body after

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.539
the private citizen had done their part.

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:28.110
For example, in the aforementioned case of
the Ford brothers who killed Jesse James,

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.610
for all their trouble, they ended up only
getting a small percentage of the bounty,

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:36.340
with the rest going to Marshal Henry H. Craig
and Sheriff James Timberlake.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:43.909
But to sum up- yes Wanted Dead or Alive posters
were indeed a thing, though this did not technically

00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:48.759
allow people to legally kill someone if they
found them, as is often portrayed in movies.

00:07:48.759 --> 00:08:25.020
Doing so flagrantly might just see the killer
wind up on their own Wanted poster.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:09:31.420
England’s history, bail was not in the form
of money, but rather in the form of a person

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:36.550
who would stand trial and potentially be sentenced
in your place if you skipped town.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:40.760
As you might imagine from this, bounties on
those who’d skipped town were most definitely

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:45.500
a thing going back at least as far as the
13th century in England as those who had pledged

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.950
themselves as bail, but had the person skip
town, were highly incentivized to get the

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.370
person back.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:55.399
Using money, rather than a person, as bail
finally changed in the 17th century thanks

00:09:55.399 --> 00:09:56.810
to the Habeas Corpus Act.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.802
While you’ll often read that these 13th
century instances were the first known instances

00:09:58.802 --> 00:10:00.550
of bounty hunters, this isn’t correct at
all.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:04.850
It seems more likely that this has been going
on since as long as civilized humans have

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:05.920
been humaning.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.990
As for one example drastically predating 13th
century England, at some unknown point in

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:16.120
the history of Pompeii (definitely preceding
79AD for obvious reasons), someone wrote on

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.560
a wall: “A copper pot went missing from
my shop.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.730
Anyone who returns it to me will be given
65 bronze coins.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:25.570
20 more will be given for information leading
to the capture of the thief.”

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:30.860
Moving over to China in the 3rd century BC,
Emperor Qin Shi Huang is known to have used

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.260
bounties for various purposes.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:39.630
If you’re wondering if Wanted Dead or Alive
posters are still a thing, not really.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:44.000
While Wanted posters are still around, and
the FBI, for example, currently uses over

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.650
5,000 digital billboards at various times
for this purpose, the Dead or Alive variety

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:51.720
went the way of the Dodo around the early
20th century.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.420
That said, we did find one instance occurring
in 2018.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:59.560
In this case, in California an unnamed homeowner
who was robbed put up Wanted Dead or Alive

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.260
posters with the image of the person who had
robbed him.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.550
As you might imagine, local law enforcement
did not take kindly to this, though the person

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:11.040
in question refused to stop posting the Dead
or Alive bounty, citing freedom of speech.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.590
The police did not do anything about it, and
they eventually captured the theif.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:18.399
However, they did note that had something
happened to the thief as a result of the posters,

00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:38.810
there very likely would have been legal ramifications
for the homeowner.
