RECONSTRUCTING THE BRAIN IN A DISH

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.800
EMERGENCE OF NEUROINFLAMMATION
FROM RETROTRANSPOSONS

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.080
In this work we took advantage
of a rare disorder

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.040
like Aicardi-Goutieres to really
explore the fundamental mechanism

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.520
that happens in your brain.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.440
Clinically
you can see the manifestation

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.360
pre-birth by ultrasound.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.480
You can detect that their brains
are not developing well.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.400
They have microcephalic brains.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.000
Overall, it's a very severe
neurological disorder.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.560
DESIGNING THE STUDY AND
CHOOSING TARGETS FOR INVESTIGATION

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.280
There are a couple of things that
we knew about Aicardi-Goutieres.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.040
One is the fact that it behaves
like an autoimmune response

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.760
in the absence
of any obvious infection.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.360
Second is the nature
of the genetic mutations

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.520
in genes such as TREX1.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.160
And finally, the complete absence
of an animal model,

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.600
they don't show
the neurological abnormalities

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.120
that we see in those patients.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.960
STUDY TARGETS:
TREX1 AND LINE1 ELEMENTS

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.000
TREX1 stands for three
prime repair exonuclease 1.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.000
Exonuclease in general,
they degrade RNA or DNA,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.480
so the body
can defend against a virus.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.760
So TREX1 basically
its function is to degrade DNA,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.720
single-stranded DNA.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.880
If you look at TREX1
inside the cells,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.280
we see an upregulation
of repetitive regions of the genome,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.560
including retrotransposons
such as line retrotransposons.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.000
Line 1 elements
are repetitive sequences

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.040
that are able to move from one
region of the genome into another

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.040
by a mechanism
called retrotransposition,

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.000
and the way that they do that
is by using reverse transcriptase.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.960
As far as we know, Line 1 elements
are active during early development

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.800
and also in the brain.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.920
CHOOSING A METHODOLOGY:
STEM CELLS

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.640
With the absence
of a good animal model,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.560
the only way to study this condition
in a human background

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.160
is to take advantage
of human pluripotent stem cells.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.960
So we use IPSCs,
induced pluripotent stem cells,

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.080
and embryonic stem cells.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.040
And you create specific mutations
and use these cells

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.320
to differentiate
specific cell lines.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.800
Using these cell lines

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.360
we are able
to create a different model,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.000
an organoid, that recapitulates

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.520
the process that we have
in our brain development.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.120
MODEL FUNCTION AND OBSERVED EFFECTS

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.200
So when we engineered the cells

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.240
we confirmed
that the mutation is there

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.640
but there was no TREX1 protein
inside those cells.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.640
In a healthy cell
you always have your DNA,

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.400
in the nucleus,
where it's supposed to be.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.400
And so what we saw
is that outside of the nucleus

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.800
to an extreme amount,
single-stranded DNA existing.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.760
And a lot of the DNA was actually
the Line 1 retrotransposon element.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.520
They behaved like normal cells

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.680
with the TREX1 protein
being expressed.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.840
The big surprise came
when we pushed or instructed

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.280
these neuro progenitor cells
to become neurons,

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.040
and we see a dramatic effect.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.360
By a large proportion, the AGS
patient cells were just dying.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.920
We knew then that it was
a problem of cell-death.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.280
The TREX1 mutant cells
virtually cannot make neurons.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.400
That strong dramatic phenotype
prompted us to make astrocytes.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.600
And when we compare the amount
of Line retrotransposons

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.880
we realized that there were way more

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.520
in the cytoplasm
compared to controls.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.640
What we see is that these cells
look like immunoreactive.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.880
They feel like they were attacked
by a virus or something, we think.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.600
They basically sense
retrotransposons as the enemy

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.360
and they trigger
this interferon response.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.600
The astrocyte signals,
they were toxic.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.160
So AGS patients have
intrinsic toxicity

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.600
within the neuron itself,

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.440
and extrinsic toxicity
from the astrocytes.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.760
So they're getting hit twice.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.800
EFFECTS ON ORGANOIDS

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.480
In the 3D system
the effects are even more dramatic.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.400
The main thing we saw
on the AGS side

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.280
is that they were dying
as fast as they were growing.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.720
And as a consequence
we have cerebral organoids

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.560
that looks like microcephalic.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.960
They're smaller in size
and the amount of cell death

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.640
that we see in those neurons

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.480
is elevated
compared to the control cells.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.120
THERAPEUTIC OPPORTUNITIES:

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.360
REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION
AND ENDOGENOUS CELL TOXICITY

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.920
Once we have these dramatic effects

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.920
we thought about a potential
therapeutic intervention.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.480
So there are actually
reverse transcriptase drugs.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.560
So we tried these same drugs.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.280
When you added these retrovirals,

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.720
there was much less single-stranded
DNA in the cytocell,

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.560
and then we saw
that they were much healthier.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.120
So they didn't have the toxicity.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.000
They didn't have the
interferon response in astrocytes.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.920
We completely rescued
the cell death.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.120
Virtually they become
indistinguishable from the controls.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.880
In the brain organoids it works
as nice as in the 2D system.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.440
The retroviral drugs could actually
make these brain organoids

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.400
thrive as much
as in the control cells.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.680
THERAPEUTIC OPPORTUNITIES:
CONTROLLING INTERFERON RESPONSE

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.560
Essentially
astrocytes are secreting interferons

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.440
that are killing neurons.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.920
If you could block this pathway

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.840
you could prevent
the extrinsic cell death.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.400
To do that we actually use a drug

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.760
that can block the
interferon receptor,

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.960
and by doing that,
we could see the same effects.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.720
We rescue the amount
of neuronal death

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.120
that we see in the mutant cells

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.280
to a level that's comparable
to the control cells.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.640
CONCLUSIONS
AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.880
The conclusions of our work
is that we could actually

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.880
nail down the exact mechanism

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.200
both at the molecular
and the cellular level

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.560
of what's going on
during the neurodevelopment

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.040
of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.080
So we are definitely excited
with the idea that one can design

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.360
a clinical trial
to treat Aicardi-Goutieres.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.600
But it's also possible
that this mechanism

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.760
is more fundamental than we think,

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:42.000
and it might actually be working
or contributing to other diseases

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:48.400
such as autism, aging,
or neurodegenerative disorders

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.720
where Line elements are
highly expressed in their brains.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.400
So it might be
more common that we think.
