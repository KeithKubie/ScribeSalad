00:00:15.037 --> 00:00:17.677
You've probably heard of the Boston Tea Party,

00:00:17.677 --> 00:00:19.466
something about a bunch of angry colonists

00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.058
dressed as Native Americans

00:00:21.058 --> 00:00:23.148
throwing chests of tea into the water.

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:24.842
But the story is far more complicated,

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:26.207
filled with imperial intrigue,

00:00:26.207 --> 00:00:27.480
corporate crisis,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.190
smuggling,

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.752
and the grassroots origins of the American Revolution.

00:00:31.752 --> 00:00:34.669
The first thing you need to know about tea in the 1700's

00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:36.742
is that it was really, really popular.

00:00:36.742 --> 00:00:38.759
In England, each man, woman, and child

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:42.032
consumed almost 300 cups of this stuff every year.

00:00:42.032 --> 00:00:44.661
And, since the English colonized America,

00:00:44.661 --> 00:00:47.411
Americans were crazy about tea too.

00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:48.803
By the 1760's, they were drinking

00:00:48.803 --> 00:00:51.289
over a million pounds of tea every year.

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.375
So, when Britain wanted to increase taxes

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:54.534
on tea in America,

00:00:54.534 --> 00:00:55.726
people were not happy,

00:00:55.726 --> 00:00:58.088
mostly because they had no say in tax decisions

00:00:58.088 --> 00:00:59.547
made in London.

00:00:59.547 --> 00:01:00.610
Remember that famous phrase,

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.628
"No taxation without representation"?

00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:04.600
The American colonists had long believed

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.566
that they were not subject to taxes imposed by legislature

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.684
in which they lacked representation.

00:01:09.684 --> 00:01:11.352
In fact, rather than paying the taxes,

00:01:11.352 --> 00:01:13.695
they simply dodged the tax collectors.

00:01:13.695 --> 00:01:16.775
Since the east coast of America is hundreds of miles long

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:18.595
and British enforcement was lax,

00:01:18.595 --> 00:01:20.779
about 3/4 of the tea Americans were drinking

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:23.198
was smuggled in, usually from Holland.

00:01:23.198 --> 00:01:24.826
But the British insisted that Parliament

00:01:24.826 --> 00:01:27.120
did have the authority to tax the colonists,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.161
especially after Britain went deeply into debt

00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:31.421
fighting the French in the Seven Years' War.

00:01:31.421 --> 00:01:32.375
To close the budget gap,

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:33.792
London looked to Americans,

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:37.964
and in 1767 imposed new taxes on a variety of imports,

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:40.513
including the American's beloved tea.

00:01:40.513 --> 00:01:42.223
America's response: no thanks!

00:01:42.223 --> 00:01:44.219
They boycotted the importation of tea from Britain,

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:45.972
and instead, brewed their own.

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:48.521
After a new bunch of British customs commissioners

00:01:48.521 --> 00:01:51.210
cried to London for troops to help with tax enforcement,

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.416
things got so heated

00:01:52.416 --> 00:01:54.674
that the Red Coats fired on a mob in Boston,

00:01:54.674 --> 00:01:55.957
killing several people,

00:01:55.957 --> 00:01:58.408
in what was soon called the Boston Massacre.

00:01:58.408 --> 00:02:00.651
Out of the terms of the 1773 Tea Act,

00:02:00.651 --> 00:02:02.905
Parliament cooked up a new strategy.

00:02:02.905 --> 00:02:05.241
Now the East India Company would sell the surplus tea

00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:08.776
directly through hand-picked consignees in America.

00:02:08.776 --> 00:02:10.238
This would lower the price to consumers,

00:02:10.238 --> 00:02:12.855
making British tea competitive with the smuggled variety

00:02:12.855 --> 00:02:14.783
while retaining some of the taxes.

00:02:14.783 --> 00:02:16.365
But the colonists saw through the British ploy

00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:18.272
and cried, "Monopoly!"

00:02:18.272 --> 00:02:21.664
Now it's a cold and rainy December 16, 1773.

00:02:21.664 --> 00:02:23.757
About 5,000 Bostonians are crowded

00:02:23.757 --> 00:02:25.426
into the Old South Meeting House,

00:02:25.426 --> 00:02:27.262
waiting to hear whether new shipments of tea

00:02:27.262 --> 00:02:28.736
that have arrived down the harbor

00:02:28.736 --> 00:02:30.431
will be unloaded for sale.

00:02:30.431 --> 00:02:32.099
When the captain of one of those ships reported

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.344
that he could not leave with his cargo on board,

00:02:34.344 --> 00:02:35.821
Sam Adams rose to shout,

00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:38.899
"This meeting can do no more to save the country!"

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:41.566
Cries of "Boston Harbor a teapot tonight!"

00:02:41.566 --> 00:02:42.916
rang out from the crowd,

00:02:42.916 --> 00:02:43.892
and about 50 men,

00:02:43.892 --> 00:02:45.989
some apparently dressed as Native Americans,

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.818
marched down to Griffin's Wharf,

00:02:47.818 --> 00:02:49.485
stormed aboard three ships,

00:02:49.485 --> 00:02:52.690
and threw 340 tea chests overboard.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.537
An infuriated British government responsded

00:02:54.537 --> 00:02:57.461
with the so-called Coercive Acts of 1774,

00:02:57.461 --> 00:02:59.423
which, among other things,

00:02:59.423 --> 00:03:02.155
closed the port of Boston until the locals compensated

00:03:02.155 --> 00:03:04.102
the East India Company for the tea.

00:03:04.102 --> 00:03:05.093
That never happened.

00:03:05.093 --> 00:03:06.686
Representatives of the colonies

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:08.310
gathered at Philadelphia to consider

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.666
how best to respond to continued British oppression.

00:03:11.666 --> 00:03:14.830
This first Continental Congress supported destruction of the tea,

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.248
pledged to support a continued boycott,

00:03:17.248 --> 00:03:20.023
and went home in late October 1774

00:03:20.023 --> 00:03:22.274
even more united in their determination

00:03:22.274 --> 00:03:24.389
to protect their rights and liberties.

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.814
The Boston Tea Party began a chain reaction

00:03:26.814 --> 00:03:28.210
that led with little pause

00:03:28.225 --> 00:03:29.696
to the Declaration of Independence

00:03:29.696 --> 00:03:30.995
and a bloody rebellion,

00:03:30.995 --> 00:03:33.762
after which the new nation was free to drink its tea,

00:03:33.762 --> 00:03:35.958
more or less, in peace.
