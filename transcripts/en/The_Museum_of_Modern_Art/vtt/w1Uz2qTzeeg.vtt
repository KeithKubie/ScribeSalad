00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:05.166
We've been friends
since the first semester.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.333
And from the first semester,

00:00:09.125 --> 00:00:11.416
you're bombarded with Gehry

00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:14.625
and you start to get into
the internet and Art Daily.

00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:18.000
And you see a ton of things
that are really colorful

00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.541
with interesting
or whimsical shapes.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.083
But in some way,

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.166
I think we were always curious

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.166
and wanted to look for
other kinds of architecture.

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:31.666
And we became interested
in other types of architects.

00:00:33.916 --> 00:00:37.625
I think that if there's a building
and the outside of it

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:40.875
doesn't catch your eye
when you pass it on the street,

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:46.000
then, you go in and discover
there's another universe inside

00:00:46.708 --> 00:00:48.083
I think this is an important

00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:52.416
concept when it comes to
what we want

00:00:52.583 --> 00:00:55.916
or try to accomplish
each time we design a building.

00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:01.500
So, this site...

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:06.000
a site with lots of strength
like this patio

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.708
with its walls
that are 4.8 meters high

00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:13.916
and in such a cool color,
well, not cool, but...

00:01:14.083 --> 00:01:15.416
- Neutral.
- Really neutral and gray.

00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:17.833
It was impossible to ignore

00:01:18.416 --> 00:01:22.000
and it was really important
for us to adapt

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:28.791
the irregular shape
of this patio and its walls.

00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958
To use the walls as a structure.

00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.541
For this process,
the concrete was poured in molds,

00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:40.625
and the holes remained
completely hollow

00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:43.125
and that's something we,
don't see often in Mexico.

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:47.750
For me, this really
caught my attention...

00:01:48.791 --> 00:01:52.458
how this sort of “scar”
has been made in the wall.

00:01:52.791 --> 00:01:55.500
Andrés said,
“We have to use these holes.”

00:01:56.166 --> 00:02:00.791
So, in order to make a cover
using the holes...

00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958
the easiest way was with threads.

00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:11.041
It's only a little taut.

00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:20.958
We had the idea of mist
from the beginning,

00:02:21.125 --> 00:02:23.125
even before
we started with the ropes,

00:02:23.291 --> 00:02:27.000
when we started to think about
creating a refreshing atmosphere.

00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:29.541
We decided to use the gallery

00:02:29.708 --> 00:02:32.000
that no one uses
to create the mist there

00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:35.291
and make the experience more dense,
an atmosphere.

00:02:35.458 --> 00:02:38.250
Did you take the nozzles out?

00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:41.208
Good, good, good.
I hope it works.

00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:45.625
How things work 
is important.

00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:47.541
You can see how they're made.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.333
I think there were three models

00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:53.208
in two weeks before making
the final model.

00:02:53.375 --> 00:02:55.666
Making a model
helps you realize how complicated

00:02:55.833 --> 00:02:57.791
or easy it will be
when you actually build it.

00:03:01.666 --> 00:03:03.875
How do you make an embankment
that will hold,

00:03:04.041 --> 00:03:06.833
but is also fixed to the ground
and also holds sand

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.125
and well, you have to do it.

00:03:09.583 --> 00:03:13.541
You have to try, like weaving,
and say, we're going to weave.

00:03:13.708 --> 00:03:15.291
And there were a thousand problems.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.875
We have a bit –
a piece of wood inside the hole.

00:03:24.416 --> 00:03:27.875
I don't know how,
but we will remove it.

00:03:31.083 --> 00:03:33.458
We have the opportunity now

00:03:33.625 --> 00:03:38.166
to build the installation
with our own hands.

00:03:38.416 --> 00:03:40.000
We're having fun.

00:03:41.833 --> 00:03:43.666
I would love it
if everything in life were like this,

00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:46.708
if you were always involved
in all of the processes,

00:03:47.416 --> 00:03:50.916
and well,
it never stops being a game.

00:03:51.083 --> 00:03:53.000
Truly, for us, architecture
is always a game.

00:03:58.416 --> 00:04:01.333
We want to show you the simplicity
of how things are made,

00:04:02.583 --> 00:04:04.083
so you have no doubts.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.375
Actually, architecture should
give you answers

00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:10.041
about how to live in the world.
