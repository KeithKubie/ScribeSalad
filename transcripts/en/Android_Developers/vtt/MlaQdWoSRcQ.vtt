SPEAKER: In this
video, we're going

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.320
to take a look at the basic
elements of subscriptions

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.600
within Google Play
to better understand

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.060
how subscriptions work.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.390
First, of course, there
is your app as well as

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.160
your app servers.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.640
Then there is the Google Play
Store on Android and Google

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.190
Play server APIs.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.490
The right column is built
by you, the developer.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.640
The left column
represents Google Play.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.740
These columns can
also be separated

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.330
by those elements on Android
and those elements on servers

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.940
so both you and Google have an
Android element and a server

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:38.440
element.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.640
Now you know your app interacts
directly with your servers.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.850
But what about how
you, the developer,

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.370
interact with Google Play?

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.310
On the Android level, this is
done through the Google Play

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.430
Billing Library.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.500
On the cloud level,
communication

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.521
is done through the Google Play
Developer API and Google Cloud

00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:03.020
Pub/Sub.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.650
And those are the basic elements
of subscriptions on Play.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.390
All of these components
work together

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.060
to allow you to have
subscriptions within your app.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.120
