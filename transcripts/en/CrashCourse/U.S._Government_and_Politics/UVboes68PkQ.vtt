This episode of Crash Course
is brought to you by Squarespace.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.160
Hi I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government
and Politics and today we're going to cross the

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.900
streams of the legislative and executive
branches and talk about delegation.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.300
I thought we weren't supposed to cross
the streams Stan?!

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.540
Ooh, that's Ghostbusting. Sorry about that.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.680
We're far away from the text of the Constitution here, deep in the realm of informal powers.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.760
But basically, delegation explains why the
President is so powerful, even

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.560
though the Consitution and its framers were terrified of creating a Presidentzilla. (Squeaky dinosaur noise)

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:39.580
[Theme Music]

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.460
So, what exactly is delegation?

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.140
First of all, to clear up some confusion, it's not the same as being a delegate, which in Political Science has two meanings.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.840
That sounds like we're making it more confusing Stan.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.658
First off, a delegate is a representative at
something like a caucus, or in Congress.

00:00:52.658 --> 00:00:57.738
Usually, in the US, when we talk about delegates it's in the context of political conventions and choosing Presidential candidates.

00:00:57.742 --> 00:01:00.800
Political scientists also talk about the delegate role that a representative can have.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.240
If a representative is acting like a delegate she does what her constituents want,

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.220
acting in their interests as much as she can.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.720
The other role that a representative can
have is that of a trustee.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.807
When a representative behaves like a trustee, he acts in what he believes are

00:01:11.807 --> 00:01:13.427
the best interests of the community as a whole.

00:01:13.427 --> 00:01:17.360
In general, the Senate was designed to act more like trustees and the House to be more like delegates.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.622
But neither of those is the delegation we're talking about.

00:01:19.622 --> 00:01:24.802
Congressional delegation happens when Congress gives, or delegates, a power to the Executive branch through legislation.

00:01:24.802 --> 00:01:28.762
Whenever Congress sets up an agency or program, it decides how much discretion to give

00:01:28.762 --> 00:01:32.620
the agency's personnel in doing whatever job Congress created the agency to do.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.414
The greater the discretion, the more power Congress delegates.

00:01:35.414 --> 00:01:37.174
This is how delegation works in general.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.600
The amount of discretion that Congress can give an agency varies a lot.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.698
Sometimes the laws that Congress writes have very specific instructions

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.360
on what the agency can do and how it can do it, severely limiting the agency's discretion.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.320
A good example of Congress limiting an agency's discretion is the Tax Code, which is about 26 hundred

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.618
pages long, without even including all the very
detailed rules and regulations that the IRS has to follow.

00:01:55.618 --> 00:02:00.138
Even with thousands of pages of rules, sometimes
the IRS acts beyond its discretion, as it did when

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.460
it investigated the tax exempt status of 501C4 groups
linked to the Tea Party. Remember that scandal?

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.844
Other times, Congress grants broad discretion to agencies.

00:02:07.844 --> 00:02:11.020
We'll learn more about this when we talk about bureauracracies in future episodes.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.867
But as you might imagine, agencies will try to take all the power they can get.

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:18.040
OSHA Regulations are a good example of an agency having broad discretion over its rules.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.500
One thing to remember is that even when Congress does delegate powers to the Executive branch,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.100
which can look like trouble for the whole separation of powers thing,

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.526
these delegated powers can still be check by the Courts,

00:02:26.526 --> 00:02:29.041
which can review laws and bureaucratic rules and regulations.

00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:35.240
The most memorable time that this happened was when the Court overturned the legislative veto in the famous INS versus CHADHA case.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.440
What?! You've never heard of
INS versus CHADHA? Well, look it up!

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.340
So that's what delegation is. Fair enough.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.680
But it doesn't explain why Congress delegates powers to the Executive branch.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.060
For this, I think we need a little help from the Thought Bubble.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.400
There are three reasons that Congress delegates power to the Executive branch.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.042
Practical reasons, historical reasons and political reasons.

00:02:52.042 --> 00:02:55.260
To start with the practical reasons, Congress delegates power because it has to.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.720
Today's government, whether you like it or not, does a lot of things,

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.960
and it would be pretty much impossible for Congress to administer all the programs that it creates.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.519
Imagine your local Congressman taking the time to inspect meat like the USDA does.

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.993
You could also make a constitutional argument that Congress should delegate power

00:03:08.993 --> 00:03:11.661
since execution of laws is the job of the Executive branch.

00:03:11.661 --> 00:03:13.640
There's another practical reason for delegating.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.320
Writing detailed legislation is really hard, and since Congressmen are not usually experts

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.251
in the policies they create, it's often better to let the people who will be implementing the rules

00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:23.040
have more say in what the rules will be.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.060
Congress also delegates for historical reasons.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.620
In fact, until the 20th Century, any governing that the National Government did do was done by Congress,

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.956
and you'll remember that was the age of dual federalism, so most of the governing was done by the states.

00:03:33.956 --> 00:03:36.948
When Congress did delegate power, it sought to keep it away from the President.

00:03:36.948 --> 00:03:40.480
For example, the Interstate Commerce Commission, which was established to regulate railroads,

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.740
was set up as an independent regulatory commission.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.840
Things started to change in the progressive era
when the national government began to

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.760
actually regulate things, like the aforementioned
meat. Thanks Upton Sinclair!

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.000
But the size and reach of the federal government really exploded with the New Deal.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.700
Now, one story of the New Deal is that FDR took the initiative and expanded executive power by creating all sorts of new agencies.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.960
Sending us down the path to the large scale government we know and love, or hate.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.131
But that's not the whole story.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.320
The problems facing the US overwhelmed Congress, so they delegated power to the Executive branch

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.600
and the federal government grew into something approaching what we know it as today.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.420
The key thing to remember is that the New Deal was primarily a legislative program of laws that

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.860
created new agencies and programs, not just a series of executive orders. Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.200
The political reasons for delegation may sound cynical, and I guess they are,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.980
but they reflect the political reality that getting blamed for a bad outcome can cost you an election.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.640
Often Congress grants broad discretion in a law so that they can avoid responsibility

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.840
and/or blame the Executive branch if it goes sour.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.900
You saw this in the debate over Obamacare,

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.680
if you're being generous you'd call it a debate, you could call it a playground slap fight.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.166
So this is a good place to stop because it leads us into the next topic, bureauracracy,

00:04:41.166 --> 00:04:43.006
that we're going to take up in the next few episodes.

00:04:43.006 --> 00:04:45.346
But before we end, let me point out two important things.

00:04:45.346 --> 00:04:50.082
The first is that Congressionally delegated power is always contingent on time, place and national mood.

00:04:50.082 --> 00:04:53.780
Congress has the power to rescind, amend or claim oversight over the powers it delegates.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.240
Although, as we'll see, it's hard to control bureauracracies.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.480
Congress can do it if they want to and they can also draft laws more carefully to set strong limits.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.140
Who is in office at the time the law is written often can have a big effect on the degree of power Congress delegates.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.080
As a general rule, when there's unified government
with one party controlling both Congress and the

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.878
White House, Congress will delegate more power to the Executive. Because he's their bro, or she's their bro.

00:05:13.878 --> 00:05:15.880
Historical context can matter too.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.060
After September 11th Congress delegated a lot of authority to the Executive branch to protect Americans from terrorism.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.460
And when the country is at war Congress tends to delegate to the Executive branch too.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.660
The second important thing to remember about delegation is that

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.100
overall it represents a shift of power from the Legislative to the Executive branch.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.460
Why this has happened is complicated, and whether it's a good thing or a bad thing

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.191
is an important and interesting discussion that you should have in your classes and with your friends.

00:05:37.191 --> 00:05:39.400
And with your grandma, and with
your grandma's friends.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.160
But that it has happened is a fact that you, and your grandma, and your grandma's friend need to recognise.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.820
Thanks for watching, I'll see you next week.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.716
