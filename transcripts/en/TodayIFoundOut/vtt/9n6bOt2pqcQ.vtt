00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220
Hello, I'm Simon Whistler, you're watching TodayIFoundOut and in the video today...

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.640
On the Far Side

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.099
For 15 years, Gary Larson took millions of
readers over to the “Far Side.”

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.760
Using anamorphic animals, chubby teenagers,
universal emotions, a simple drawing style

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.869
and a really bizarre, morbid sense of humor,
The Far Side became one of the most successful

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.269
– and praised – comic strips of all time.

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.599
But like many cartoonists, Larson has remained
rather elusive.

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.090
In 1995 (about 11 months before the creator
of Calvin and Hobbes did the same), he abruptly

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.000
ended the comic strip – perhaps even a bit
prematurely according to many of his fans.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.390
So, how did Larson get to the “Far Side?”

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.130
And what was with his fascination with making
aliens look stupid?

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:50.090
Larson was born in 1950 – in the midst of
the baby boomer generation – in a blue-collar

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.010
neighborhood of Tacoma, Washington.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.820
His father was a car mechanic, someone who
didn’t mind getting a bit dirty, which was

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.150
a trait he passed on to his two sons.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.780
Larson has often reminisced about how he and
his brother would wade in the nearby Puget

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.060
Sound looking for critters like octopi and
salamanders, several of which would end up

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.250
in his later comics.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.040
As he explained to the New York Times in 1998,
this love of wildlife has continued throughout

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.040
his life.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.610
He originally was even a biology major at
Washington State University before deciding

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.540
that he wasn’t into all that schooling.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.820
“I didn’t want to go to school for more
than four years, and I didn’t know what

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.000
you did with a bachelor’s in biology,”
Larson told the Times, ”so I switched over

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.440
and got my degree in communications.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.490
I regret it now.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.659
It was one of the most idiotic things I ever
did.”

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.550
Throughout his adult life, he was a keeper
of exotic pets including tarantulas, African

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.300
bullfrogs, Bermuda pythons, Mexican king snakes,
and carnivorous South American ornate horned

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.300
frogs.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.370
Also, through high school and college, he
got really into jazz, both listening and playing.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.070
And he was pretty talented, especially on
the guitar and banjo.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.090
All of this is to say that being a cartoonist
was not originally part of Larson’s career

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.960
plan- he was never even terribly good at drawing.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.069
Unlike many cartoonists of his era, Larson
says that he more or less fell into it.

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.140
In the mid-1970s, his jazz career was slowing
getting better and better until he was passed

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.660
over for a gig he thought he was going to
get with an established band.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.970
Upset, loathing his job at a music store (establishments
which are, as he put it, “graveyards of

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.250
musicians”), and in need of money, Larson
began to draw animals, poorly.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.380
While at the aforementioned day job at a music
shop in 1976, he drew one-panel cartoons featuring

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.790
animals making pithy, weird jokes.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.660
Then, Larson sent them into local Seattle
magazine Pacific Search and, much to his surprise,

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.560
they purchased six of them for $90 (about
$400 today).

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.450
He thought this was the easiest money he had
ever made, so he kept doing it.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.840
Soon after, a small weekly Tacoma publication
called the Sumner News Review purchased his

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.040
cartoons – which he had now named Nature’s
Way due to the fact that it was mostly about

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.760
animals – for $3 a pop.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.989
Looking at Nature’s Way today, one can spot
many similarities to Far Side (which was still

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:05.989
a few years away).

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.319
The comic humanized animals, making them talk,
banter, and act like we do.

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.790
As for the humans, they were often chubby,
goofy-looking and not particularly bright.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.880
In other words, it seems rather clear that
Larson has always held animals in a higher

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.250
regard than his fellow humans.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.620
After a brief hiatus from publication, around
1978 or 1979, the Seattle Times gave Nature’s

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.480
Way a weekly space next to the “Junior Jumble”
puzzle, with Larson now earning five times

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.120
as much per week- a whopping $15 per comic
(about $50 today).

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.940
While a paid cartoonist, $15 per week isn’t
enough to live off of so Larson went to work

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.920
as an animal cruelty investigator for the
Seattle Humane Society.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.900
According to a story he told Salon, on the
way to the interview for the job, Larson accidentally

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.140
hit a dog with his car…

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.790
To him, that was signal that perhaps this
line of work wasn’t meant to be for him.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.520
(He also said that the dog ended up being
okay.)

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.170
So, on the side, he kept making his comics.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.629
Trying to gain a second revenue stream, he
drove to San Francisco in an attempt to sell

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.990
Nature’s Way to the San Francisco Chronicle.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.090
Admittedly, it was a stab in the dark.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.409
He sat for hours in the reception area and
later called in twice a day to see if anyone

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:17.709
had looked over his work.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.780
The most he got in response at this stage
was a bit of sympathy from the receptionist.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.180
It was set-up to be a disappointment, but
much to his astonishment, when the paper did

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.169
finally get back to him, it turned out the
editors not only loved his comic, but instead

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.259
of running it weekly, they wanted it daily.

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:36.970
On top of that, they weren’t just going
to run it in one newspaper, but were going

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.169
to syndicate it to start across 30 newspapers!

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.839
Their only request was that Larson switch
the name from Nature’s Way to one they had

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:46.849
come up with- The Far Side.

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.939
As to that name change, Larson stated, “They
could have called it Revenge of the Zucchini

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:52.680
People for all I cared.”

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.830
The point was that between the switch to daily
and being syndicated, he could now make a

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.069
living doing the comic full time.

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:02.669
This was a fortunate turn of events as that
very same week the Seattle Times sent him

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.499
a letter noting they were canceling Nature’s
Way citing that they were getting too many

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:08.629
complaints that the comic was weird and offensive.

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:11.569
If he hadn’t just gotten the deal with Chronicle,
he later told Rolling Stone Magazine, that

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:15.470
“I’m certain I would have bagged it all.”

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.900
As noted, the San Francisco Chronicle put
the comic in 30 newspapers nearly immediately

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.860
and quickly audiences took to the weird, morbid
humor.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.879
Well, at least, some did.

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:29.289
Through the comic’s decade and a half run,
newspapers across the country got an assortment

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.619
of complaint letters about the comic, mostly
with people stating that they found the cartoon

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:35.409
disturbing or offensive.

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:40.039
Some said that Larson needed “psychotherapy”
while others just wanted their “Annie”

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:41.039
back.

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.340
In the early days, the San Francisco Chronicle
editors, unlike the Seattle Times‘, simply

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.340
didn’t care.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.479
They thought the comic was the work of genius.

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.120
But as for the steady stream of complaints,
this always took Larson by surprise with him

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.789
telling the Associated Press in 2003, “You
start off thinking that everyone in the world

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:58.360
has the same sense of humor as your six friends.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.930
I was surprised at just how upset some people
could be.”

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.729
Among the massive fan base that The Far Side
would eventually develop, interestingly scientists

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:10.009
and academics were among the first to take
to the comic, despite Larson’s frequent

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:11.389
jabs at this very same group.

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:15.210
For example, perhaps the most famous Far Side
comic shows an image of a chubby boy with

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.309
glasses and holding books attempting to enter
the “Midvale School for the Gifted.”

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:22.990
He’s trying to push the door open while
it’s clearly marked pull.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.919
Or the one where a group of scientists are
trying to figure out an equation only to be

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:28.749
interrupted by the ice cream truck.

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:32.669
Or this classic where the scientist realizes
the glass he’s holding is lemonade and not

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:34.949
a culture of amoebic dysentery.

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:39.930
Next to him another scientist is casually
sipping a glass of what he thinks is lemonade.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.649
The strip also had a tangible impact on the
world of paleontology.

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:49.360
In an 1982 comic, a group of cavemen are in
lecture hall being shown a slide of a dinosaur.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.240
The caveman instructor is pointing to the
spiky tail of a Stegosaurus while saying,

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.669
“Now this end is called the thagomizer…after
the late Thag Simmons.”

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:00.050
As it turned out, in real life, no one had
actually given that part of the Stegosaurus’

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.210
tail a name.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.740
Despite Larson’s fudging of the facts (in
actuality, dinosaurs and humans missed each

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:10.080
other by more than 140 million years), paleontologists
adopted “thagomizer” as the official name

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.490
of the spikes on a Stegosaurus.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.650
A decade and a half and over 4,000 comics
later, with a new premise for each cartoon

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:21.689
(as opposed to normal comic strips, which
could extend a premise for weeks and use repeating

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:24.979
characters to further simplify things) and
Larson was burnt out.

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:29.490
In 1994, he announced his retirement citing
that he wanted to avoid “the Graveyard of

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:30.839
Mediocre Cartoons.”

00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:35.809
The final strip was published on January 1,
1995 and it was different than any other Far

00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:36.809
Side.

00:07:36.809 --> 00:07:37.809
It was two panels.

00:07:37.809 --> 00:07:41.379
At the peak of his comic’s run, it appeared
in over 2,000 newspapers and, all told, Larson

00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:46.959
has sold over 50 million Far Side books; that’s
not to mention the annual desk calendar version

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:51.009
that Larson describes as tantamount to “printing
money” every year.

00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:54.849
Today, Larson lives a quiet life in Washington
state, constantly maintaining that he wants

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:56.569
to remain out of the spotlight.

00:07:56.569 --> 00:08:00.469
Among a few other projects, he’s gone back
to jazz and can be sometimes seen performing

00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:03.249
in clubs with his band, and even the occasional
wedding.

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:07.279
While it’s been more than two decades since
Larson retired from drawing cows, snakes,

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:10.949
and chubby kids, the comic still resonates.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.600
Where else could you find out the real reason
dinosaurs went extinct?
