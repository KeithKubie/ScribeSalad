00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.604
If you were to borrow money
for different amounts of time,

00:00:03.604 --> 00:00:05.270
you could imagine the
person lending you

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.780
the money might charge you
a different annual interest

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.840
rate depending on the
perceived risk of having

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.310
the money out there for
that amount of time.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.430
And the same thing is true
when people lend money

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.120
to the federal government.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.672
So when you think about US
treasuries, and US treasuries

00:00:19.672 --> 00:00:20.880
that have different maturity.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.050
And maturity just means when is
the government going to pay you

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.430
back, you could imagine that
there are different interest

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.970
rates, or there's
different yields

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.390
to maturity on that debt.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.371
So if we were to plot
it-- so let's say that,

00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:33.870
and I'm just going
to simplify here.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.370
Let's say that
there's some treasury

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.709
debt that's maturing
in one month.

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:39.250
And if you look at
the price that you

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.900
would have to pay for that
debt versus the amount of money

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.190
that the treasury is going
to pay you when it matures,

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.070
you see that the yield there
is, let's say it is 1%.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.770
Let's say for treasuries
that are maturing

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.210
in three months
the yield is 1.5%.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.140
Let's say the treasuries
that are maturing in,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.340
I'll just pick some
maturity dates here,

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.530
let's say in one
year the yield is 3%.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.050
Let's do a couple more.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.620
Let's say in 10 years-- you're
essentially lending money

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.370
to the treasury for 10 years
now-- the annual interest

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.900
rate on that, let's
say it's, I don't know,

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.520
let's say it's 3.5%.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.410
And let's throw
one more up here.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.820
Let's say if you were to lend
money to the US government

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.150
for 30 years the yield is
running at, let's say it's 4%.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.760
So here we have different
yields for different maturities.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.870
And if we essentially
plot this on a graph,

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.164
we get ourselves a yield curve.

00:01:43.164 --> 00:01:44.830
And it's usually
called The Yield Curve.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.550
When people talk
about The Yield Curve

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.610
they're talking about the
plot for the US Treasury

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.276
in dollars, US Treasury
bills and bonds.

00:01:52.276 --> 00:01:53.650
You can have a
yield curve really

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.880
for any debt instrument, for
any corporate bonds, or even

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.870
government securities
or corporate securities

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.945
of other countries.

00:02:00.945 --> 00:02:03.070
But in general, when they
talk but The Yield Curve,

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.390
they're talking
about US treasuries.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.580
So let me draw a yield
curve right over here.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.030
So on this axis I
will put maturity.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.627
Let me scroll down a
little bit, so maturity.

00:02:15.627 --> 00:02:17.460
And we have a bunch of
different maturities.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.750
We have one month.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.550
Let's squeeze it, one month.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.099
We have three months.

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.640
And this will be
completely to scale.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.140
Then we have one year,
actually one and three month,

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.140
let's just put one month
right at the beginning.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.320
So one month then three months
is a little bit further out.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.970
One year would be right
over here one a year.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.890
Five years would be like there.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.530
I don't have five years,
let's do a 10 years.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.190
So I'll extend my line over.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.436
So one year, maybe 10 years
is over here, 10 years.

00:02:48.436 --> 00:02:49.560
And then you have 30 years.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.760
And I'll just draw 30
years as far as I can.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.730
It's not completely to
scale, but it's my best shot.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.010
And then we plot the yield for
those different maturities.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.919
So in one month,
you have a 1% yield.

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:01.460
So let me do up the
percentages here.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.980
So this is 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.350
So on one month maturity
the yield is 1%.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.730
On three month maturity
the yield is and 1/2%.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.810
So maybe it'll be
like right over there.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.130
On one year maturity
the yield is 3%.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.690
So you plot one
year, this is 3%.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.160
Let me write it, this
is 3% right over here.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.920
This is 1.5% right over there.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.660
And the first one right
over there was 1%.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.290
And then at 10 years
it's 3 and 1/2%.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.110
So 3 and 1/2% is
right over here.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.240
And we want that to be 10 years.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.010
So I'm just plotting that point.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.310
And then that 30 years, it's 4%.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.490
So 4% is what we
get at 30 years.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.200
And if we connect the
dots and draw a curve

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.425
we are giving ourselves
The Yield Curve.

00:03:57.396 --> 00:03:59.020
I don't want to make
it look like-- let

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.070
me see how well I can draw it.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.980
You have a curve that might
look something like that.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.480
Just by looking at
this yield curve,

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.757
you see that when you lend money
to the treasury for a longer

00:04:09.757 --> 00:04:12.340
period of time, you're going to
get a higher interest than you

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.460
would for a shorter
period of time.
