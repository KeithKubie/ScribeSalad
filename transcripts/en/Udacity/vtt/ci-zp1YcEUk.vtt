00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.300
For our product line review
we've had tons of features or

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.530
lot's of people who are building
really amazing products.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.070
Everything about my language is
talking about like how do I make it so

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.330
the user feels like they're kicking ass.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.330
because a lot of people like
who are great building stuff,

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.510
they're like they talk about features
like look what we have, look what

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.740
we're doing, look why this is awesome,
this is going to be really cool.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.380
And it needs to be complete opposite,

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.050
where it needs to be like look we use
this, this is what's going to kick ass.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.400
And so it's all about the language and
the features.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.222
Like I can say you get 1,000 entries,
unlimited forms,

00:00:29.222 --> 00:00:30.770
you get payment integration.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.340
But that's just listing the features.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.440
What I need to say is look, you don't
have to worry about data collection

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.380
anymore, everyone in your department is
going to have this installed on there.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.318
You get to make money off of this.

00:00:40.318 --> 00:00:44.265
Monetize like a couple of seconds,
instead of having to wait for paying

00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:47.100
like thousands of dollars for someone to
build a custom Ecommerce site for you.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.010
Beta test certain issues.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.576
User management like all that stuff has
to be turned around when you're talking

00:00:51.576 --> 00:00:52.275
about this feature.

00:00:52.275 --> 00:00:56.740
So that took us a while to understand
like okay, the motivations on why people

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.395
want to be on certain plans and
making sure it got communicated.

00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:03.563
You being on here, the reason
you're on here is because of this,

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:04.899
because it's all for you.

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.971
And that took a real sort of empathy
in terms of describing and sort

00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:13.430
of a knack for copy that's a flipside
of how people think about things.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.570
Because like entrepreneurs are really
good about talking about sells and

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.420
pitching their company and
all that stuff, but

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.180
a lot of times they don't realize like
the pitch you need to give is the pitch

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.750
that allows people to talk
about you to someone else.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.610
It's like I use this and it's my secret
weapon, I'm sharing it with you now.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.440
And I'm now, like your most interesting
person at the dinner able or

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.480
you gave this tip that makes you
look like the really awesome guy.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.510
And so a lot of people just don't
even craft copy in a way that

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.680
can be disseminated that easily.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.770
A lot of times they'll just use
weird slogans and taglines,

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:43.870
short phrases and stuff.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.094
And I was like I can't
repeat that to someone and

00:01:46.094 --> 00:01:49.220
have it make any coherent sense on
why you should use this service.
