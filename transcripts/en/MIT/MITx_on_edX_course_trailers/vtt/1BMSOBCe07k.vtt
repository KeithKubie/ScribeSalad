00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
[PIANO]

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.250
Data is transforming business,
social interactions, and the

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.420
future of our society.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.170
Analytics is at the heart of
the companies of our times,

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.020
like Google, Amazon, and IBM.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.910
In this course, you will learn
how to use analytics and data

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.900
to give an edge to your
career and your life.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.390
Together, we'll explore a wide
variety of inspiring examples,

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.910
like the meaning of
intelligence, what predicts

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.140
happiness, and how
data is changing

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.540
the future of medicine.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.600
I'm Dimitris Bertisimas.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.890
And I've been a professor
at MIT since 1988.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.380
My career has focused
around analytics.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.330
And I believe analytics
can positively

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.520
influence the world.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.220
And I'm Allison O'Hair.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.060
I received my Ph.D.
from MIT in 2013.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.880
Together, in 15.071x, the
Analytics Edge, we'll dive

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.670
into some of the most exciting
examples and techniques in

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.470
this field.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.130
In February 2011, the world
watched in awe as a computer

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.710
beat the best human players
at Jeopardy, a game that

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.530
showcases human intelligence.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.680
You will learn how this
remarkable feat was

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.400
accomplished and why the same
computer is now being used to

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.780
design cancer treatments.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.530
We'll discuss the story of
Moneyball and how the Oakland

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.610
A's surprised the world by
taking a very small budget and

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.270
creating a championship
baseball team.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.790
We will also feature how the
online dating site eHarmony is

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.730
using data and optimization to
predict compatibility and to

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.710
find, , among millions of
people, a perfect match.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.980
The only prerequisites for
this class are basic

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.520
mathematics and an excitement
about learning analytics.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.730
In each lecture and homework
assignment, we'll start with a

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.200
story and a real data set and
then teach you the method that

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.920
was used in that application.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.830
You will learn specific methods,
work with data, and

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.610
see how analytics provided
an edge to real

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.150
people and real companies.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.620
Join our whole team here at
MIT to learn the analytics

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.170
edge that you can give to your
career and your life.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.318
