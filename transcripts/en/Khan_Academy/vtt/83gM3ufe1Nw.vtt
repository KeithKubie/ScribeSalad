00:00:00.258 --> 00:00:01.384
- [Voiceover] We're told the graph of y

00:00:01.384 --> 00:00:04.008
equals two to the x is
shown below, alright.

00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:05.377
Which of the following is the graph

00:00:05.377 --> 00:00:09.358
of y equals two to the
negative x minus five?

00:00:09.358 --> 00:00:10.577
So there's two changes here.

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:13.271
Instead of two to the x, we
have two to the negative x

00:00:13.271 --> 00:00:14.431
and then, we're not leaving that alone,

00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:15.906
we, then, subtract five.

00:00:15.906 --> 00:00:17.636
So let's take 'em step by step.

00:00:17.636 --> 00:00:19.911
So let's first think about what y

00:00:19.911 --> 00:00:22.929
equals two to the negative
x would look like.

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.670
Well, any input we now put into an x,

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.306
we're now going to take the negative of.

00:00:27.306 --> 00:00:31.091
So if I input a two, it's
like taking the opposite

00:00:31.091 --> 00:00:35.572
of the two and then, inputting
that into two to the x.

00:00:35.572 --> 00:00:37.339
And so, what we're essentially going to do

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:41.506
is flip this graph over the y-axis.

00:00:41.506 --> 00:00:44.885
So, here we have the point two comma four.

00:00:44.885 --> 00:00:46.544
Over here, we're going to have the point

00:00:46.544 --> 00:00:49.620
negative two comma four.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.303
When x is zero, they're going
to give us the same value.

00:00:52.303 --> 00:00:54.555
So they're both going to
have the same y-intercept.

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:57.263
And so are graph is going to look like,

00:00:57.263 --> 00:01:01.327
our graph is going to
look something like, this.

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:02.406
They're going to be mirror images

00:01:02.406 --> 00:01:04.820
flipped around the y-axis.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.820
So, it's going to look like that.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.440
That is the graph of y is
equal to two to the negative x.

00:01:15.687 --> 00:01:16.886
And then we have to worry about

00:01:16.886 --> 00:01:19.127
the subtracting five from it.

00:01:19.127 --> 00:01:20.868
Well, that's, you're subtracting five

00:01:20.868 --> 00:01:23.097
from your final y-value
so that's going to work.

00:01:23.097 --> 00:01:25.779
You're subtracting five
to get your y-value now,

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:27.578
where your y-value is
going to be five lower,

00:01:27.578 --> 00:01:28.867
is I guess the best way to say it,

00:01:28.867 --> 00:01:31.699
so this is going to shift
the graph down by five.

00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:33.267
So instead of having
the y-intercept there,

00:01:33.267 --> 00:01:34.561
it's going to be five lower.

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:38.908
One, two, one, each hash mark is two

00:01:38.908 --> 00:01:41.961
so this is one, two, three, four, five,

00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:43.319
is going to be right over there.

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.417
So shift down by five, two, four, five.

00:01:47.417 --> 00:01:48.381
It's going to look like that.

00:01:48.381 --> 00:01:50.343
And the asymptote,
instead of the asymptote,

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:54.243
going towards y equals zero, the asymptote

00:01:54.243 --> 00:01:58.341
is going to be at y is
equal to negative five.

00:01:58.341 --> 00:02:02.497
So the asymptote is going to
be y equals negative five.

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:07.497
So it should look something like,

00:02:08.362 --> 00:02:13.214
something like what I
am drawing right now.

00:02:13.214 --> 00:02:17.324
Something like, something like that.

00:02:17.324 --> 00:02:18.984
So now we can look at which choices.

00:02:18.984 --> 00:02:21.457
So this should be the graph of y

00:02:21.457 --> 00:02:24.579
equals two to the negative x minus five.

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:27.122
So let's see which of
these choices depict that.

00:02:28.267 --> 00:02:31.588
So this first choice
actually seems to be spot-on.

00:02:31.588 --> 00:02:33.364
It's exactly what we drew.

00:02:33.364 --> 00:02:35.697
Well, we can look at the
other ones, just in case.

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:39.006
Well, this is, this looks like,
what did they do over here?

00:02:39.006 --> 00:02:40.863
Looks like they, instead of flipping over

00:02:40.863 --> 00:02:44.717
the y-axis, they took the,
they flipped over the x-axis

00:02:44.717 --> 00:02:47.004
and then they shifted
down, so that's not right.

00:02:47.004 --> 00:02:48.316
Here it looks like they got what we got

00:02:48.316 --> 00:02:50.835
but they flipped it over the x-axis.

00:02:50.835 --> 00:02:53.296
And this looks like they
flipped it over the y-axis

00:02:53.296 --> 00:02:54.922
but then they shifted,
instead of shifting down

00:02:54.922 --> 00:02:57.301
by five, it looks like they
shifted to the left by five.

00:02:57.301 --> 00:02:58.962
So we should feel pretty good especially

00:02:58.962 --> 00:03:00.208
'cause we essentially drew this

00:03:00.208 --> 00:03:02.877
before even looking at the choice.
