Enough killing going on.

We have all the evidence we need
that we need to do more.

00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:11.978 line:0%
Doing nothing is unacceptable.

 Senator Cory Booker has fought

00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:17.350 line:0%
 to keep guns
 off the streets of Newark,

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:21.020
 and battled Congress to pass
 common-sense gun reform.

00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:22.922
 We'd figure out
 how to get rid of guns

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:25.958
 over international pancakes.

00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:29.695

Something on this plate

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.702
Bacon/guns.
- Right.

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:38.905 size:88% position:56%
- Americans love bacon/guns,

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:43.276 align:end position:100%
but too many Americans die
because of bacon/guns.

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.480 align:end position:100%
So how do we stop dumb people
from eating bacon?

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:52.251 align:start position:0%
- Well, first of all,
you are ridiculously condemning

00:00:52.284 --> 00:00:54.854 size:81% position:41%
when you call people dumb,

00:00:54.887 --> 00:00:56.322 align:start position:0%
and you insult
their intelligence.

00:00:56.355 --> 00:00:57.957
- All right, Dad.
- I don't wanna take away

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.393
their bacon or their guns.
- You're a democrat, right?

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:01.828
- I am a democrat.
- A liberal?

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:04.464 align:start position:0%
- I am a guy that is--
can be considered liberal

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:05.898
in my views.
- Okay, so am I.

00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:07.533
So between you and me...
- Yes, between you and me.

- When are we getting rid
of the Second Amendment?

00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:10.603 align:start position:0%
- Well, we're not gonna get rid
of the Second Amendment.

00:01:10.636 --> 00:01:12.071 align:start position:0%
It's something
that we don't wanna do.

00:01:12.104 --> 00:01:13.639
- Because you can't do it?
- No.

00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:15.875
In order to make people safe,
we don't need to throw out

00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:17.376 align:start position:0%
one of our
constitutional amendments.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.245 align:end position:100%
- Yeah, but--
I mean, come on.

00:01:19.278 --> 00:01:20.546 align:end position:100%
How many constitutional
amendments do we have?

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.081 align:start position:0%
- Well, we've thrown out some
in the past,

00:01:22.114 --> 00:01:23.316
which I'm really happy we did.

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:24.684 align:end position:100%
- Yeah, you gotta update
these things,

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:26.486 align:end position:100%
and this is maybe
the second oldest one.

You think I'm walking around
here with an iPhone 2?

- That's the fear tactics
that often people

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:31.357 align:start position:0%
want you to believe.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.792 size:84% position:42%
That somebody's gonna try
to get rid of all the guns.

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:34.794 align:start position:0%
That somebody's coming after
their guns.

00:01:34.827 --> 00:01:36.362
That is not a necessary thing.

- More bacon/guns, please.

 Booker,
 like many other democrats,

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:42.735 line:0%

 Last June, in response to
 the Pulse nightclub shooting,

00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:48.107 line:0%
 senators filibustered
 to expand background checks

and prevent gun sales to people
 on the terrorist watch list,

00:01:51.477 --> 00:01:53.980 line:0%
 while House democrats staged
 a sit in,

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:55.515 line:0%
 which resulted in...

 Insisting these liberal elites

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:08.094
 are coming for your guns.

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:10.329 align:start position:0%
- The tactic has been
not only are we going

00:02:10.362 --> 00:02:12.265 align:start position:0%
to not pass
background check laws

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:13.766
or close the terrorist loophole,

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.635 align:start position:0%
but we're also gonna
take those agencies

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:18.471 align:start position:0%
that could be helping us,
the CDC, ATF,

00:02:18.504 --> 00:02:19.972
and we're gonna cripple them.
