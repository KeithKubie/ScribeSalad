okay good afternoon who knows who said

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:04.540
okay good afternoon who knows who said
 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:11.490
okay good afternoon who knows who said
this so I felt it was appropriate no you

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:11.500
this so I felt it was appropriate no you
 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.720
this so I felt it was appropriate no you
got to go only because I told you well

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730
got to go only because I told you well
 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.040
got to go only because I told you well
that's good I felt it was appropriate

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050
that's good I felt it was appropriate
 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.160
that's good I felt it was appropriate
that that should be extra credit on your

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170
that that should be extra credit on your
 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.769
that that should be extra credit on your
next exam who thinks that's fair

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779
next exam who thinks that's fair
 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.960
next exam who thinks that's fair
of course it's phase just go to Google

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970
of course it's phase just go to Google
 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.240
of course it's phase just go to Google
and you look it up alright so this is

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250
and you look it up alright so this is
 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.849
and you look it up alright so this is
this is actually said by satchel page

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859
this is actually said by satchel page
 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.429
this is actually said by satchel page
and he was of course referring to

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439
and he was of course referring to
 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:33.750
and he was of course referring to
something else but it's really the case

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760
something else but it's really the case
 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.069
something else but it's really the case
of what happens when a cell was invaded

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079
of what happens when a cell was invaded
 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.110
of what happens when a cell was invaded
by a virus cells have all these

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120
by a virus cells have all these
 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.540
by a virus cells have all these
wonderful intrinsic mechanisms that they

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550
wonderful intrinsic mechanisms that they
 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.919
wonderful intrinsic mechanisms that they
used to fight off various bacteria and

00:00:45.919 --> 00:00:45.929
used to fight off various bacteria and
 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:48.899
used to fight off various bacteria and
fungi and viruses and yet all of these

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:48.909
fungi and viruses and yet all of these
 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:51.419
fungi and viruses and yet all of these
organisms strive there really work hard

00:00:51.419 --> 00:00:51.429
organisms strive there really work hard
 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:53.939
organisms strive there really work hard
at it to get beyond those defenses and

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949
at it to get beyond those defenses and
 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:55.079
at it to get beyond those defenses and
that's what we're going to talk about

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089
that's what we're going to talk about
 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.069
that's what we're going to talk about
today in a lot of contexts covering a

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079
today in a lot of contexts covering a
 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.750
today in a lot of contexts covering a
lot of ground and some things that you

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760
lot of ground and some things that you
 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.759
lot of ground and some things that you
know and hopefully a few things that you

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769
know and hopefully a few things that you
 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:03.959
know and hopefully a few things that you
don't know so that there's some new

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969
don't know so that there's some new
 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:04.710
don't know so that there's some new
material here

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720
material here
 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.910
material here
so the question of course is what does

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920
so the question of course is what does
 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.150
so the question of course is what does
one do to the other and the host as we

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160
one do to the other and the host as we
 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.660
one do to the other and the host as we
have said is there in principle to avoid

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670
have said is there in principle to avoid
 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.090
have said is there in principle to avoid
being infected after all infection is

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100
being infected after all infection is
 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.240
being infected after all infection is
not something that you really want on

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250
not something that you really want on
 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.430
not something that you really want on
the other hand sometimes there are

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440
the other hand sometimes there are
 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.110
the other hand sometimes there are
benefits from being infected believe it

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120
benefits from being infected believe it
 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.030
benefits from being infected believe it
or not but the viruses and other

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040
or not but the viruses and other
 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.530
or not but the viruses and other
organisms really want to get through

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540
organisms really want to get through
 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.080
organisms really want to get through
that and their main objective is to

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090
that and their main objective is to
 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.780
that and their main objective is to
replicate so it's a battle whoops of

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790
replicate so it's a battle whoops of
 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.890
replicate so it's a battle whoops of
evolutionary strategies that have

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900
evolutionary strategies that have
 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.200
evolutionary strategies that have
evolved between hosts and various

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210
evolved between hosts and various
 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.730
evolved between hosts and various
organisms as you look from the most

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740
organisms as you look from the most
 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.010
organisms as you look from the most
primitive organisms like worms all the

primitive organisms like worms all the
 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.460
primitive organisms like worms all the
way up to humans if we are the most

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470
way up to humans if we are the most
 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.520
way up to humans if we are the most
evolved we find that there are different

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530
evolved we find that there are different
 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.320
evolved we find that there are different
ways of dealing with pathogens and so we

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330
ways of dealing with pathogens and so we
 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.750
ways of dealing with pathogens and so we
have primitive innate immune responses

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760
have primitive innate immune responses
 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.870
have primitive innate immune responses

response for the virus the goal is to
 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:39.089
response for the virus the goal is to
survive to reproduce and then just to

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099
survive to reproduce and then just to
 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.020
survive to reproduce and then just to
get the hell out of there

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030
get the hell out of there
 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.690
get the hell out of there
and go find somebody else to infect all

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700
and go find somebody else to infect all
 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.530
and go find somebody else to infect all
right so that's where we are how do you

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540
right so that's where we are how do you
 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.470
right so that's where we are how do you
do this well a great way of doing it is

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480
do this well a great way of doing it is
 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.949
do this well a great way of doing it is
to overwhelm the host but as it turns

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959
to overwhelm the host but as it turns
 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.770
to overwhelm the host but as it turns
out that's not easy and for the most

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780
out that's not easy and for the most
 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.429
out that's not easy and for the most
part it's only infections infections

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.439
part it's only infections infections
 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.949
part it's only infections infections
only occur relatively low multiplicities

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959
only occur relatively low multiplicities
 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.660
only occur relatively low multiplicities
of infection so you don't get infected

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670
of infection so you don't get infected
 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.030
of infection so you don't get infected
with thousands and millions of particles

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040
with thousands and millions of particles
 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.539
with thousands and millions of particles
unless somebody sneezes directly on you

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549

viruses seek to enter parentally and
that's any other way than the gut and

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:15.939
that's any other way than the gut and
 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:17.670
that's any other way than the gut and
the reason for that is the guts really a

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680
the reason for that is the guts really a
 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.129
the reason for that is the guts really a
nasty place to be you've got to go

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139
nasty place to be you've got to go
 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.689
nasty place to be you've got to go
through the stomach you've got to go

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:21.699
through the stomach you've got to go
 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:24.270
through the stomach you've got to go
through a very acidic environment you go

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280
through a very acidic environment you go
 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.089
through a very acidic environment you go
into the small intestine and it's full

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099
into the small intestine and it's full
 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.819
into the small intestine and it's full
of other microorganisms it's full of

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829
of other microorganisms it's full of
 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.360
of other microorganisms it's full of
some wonderful immune cells that

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370
some wonderful immune cells that
 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.430
some wonderful immune cells that
recognize pathogens and take things out

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440
recognize pathogens and take things out
 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.520
recognize pathogens and take things out
it's coated with mucus and so it's a

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530
it's coated with mucus and so it's a
 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.170
it's coated with mucus and so it's a
tough way to start it's much easier to

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180
tough way to start it's much easier to
 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.180
tough way to start it's much easier to
enter through the bloodstream through

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190
enter through the bloodstream through
 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.719
enter through the bloodstream through
the lungs and the first thing that these

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:45.729
the lungs and the first thing that these
 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:49.430
the lungs and the first thing that these
viruses want to do is to disarm the host

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440
viruses want to do is to disarm the host
 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.039
viruses want to do is to disarm the host
well you saw this slide two days ago two

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049
well you saw this slide two days ago two
 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.289
well you saw this slide two days ago two
lectures ago recently

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299
 
 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.360
 
and what I want to emphasize is the

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370
and what I want to emphasize is the
 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.949
and what I want to emphasize is the
course of virus growth during an acute

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959
course of virus growth during an acute
 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.839
course of virus growth during an acute
infection and how the host plays a role

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849
infection and how the host plays a role
 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.869
infection and how the host plays a role
in this so we have the virus entering

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879
in this so we have the virus entering
 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.960
in this so we have the virus entering
the host and that's the establishment of

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970
the host and that's the establishment of
 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.749
the host and that's the establishment of
infection getting in finding a cell in

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:19.759
infection getting in finding a cell in
 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.600
infection getting in finding a cell in
which you can replicate that immediately

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610

the cells when they respond and they get
 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.870
the cells when they respond and they get
cells to produce various cytokines and

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880
cells to produce various cytokines and
 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.830

they cause mobilization of macrophages

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840
they cause mobilization of macrophages
 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.930
they cause mobilization of macrophages
and they eat up all the virus and you

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940
and they eat up all the virus and you
 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.020
and they eat up all the virus and you
survive but not always and sometimes

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030
survive but not always and sometimes
 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.659
survive but not always and sometimes
what happens is the virus continues to

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669
what happens is the virus continues to
 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:51.370
what happens is the virus continues to
replicate and sometimes it replicates in

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380

these cells that are attacking infected
cells so we get the induction of the

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440
cells so we get the induction of the
 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.680

usually see the adaptive response in

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099
usually see the adaptive response in
 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:13.450
usually see the adaptive response in
terms of the outcome until symptoms have

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460
terms of the outcome until symptoms have
 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.820
terms of the outcome until symptoms have
developed so all this while you're not

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830
developed so all this while you're not
 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:23.350
developed so all this while you're not
sick but you're going to be and the

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360
sick but you're going to be and the
 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.640
sick but you're going to be and the
question then becomes when do you treat

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650
question then becomes when do you treat
 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.379
question then becomes when do you treat
a viral infection and the answer is of

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389
a viral infection and the answer is of
 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:28.390
a viral infection and the answer is of

things go crazy anyways we have this

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479
things go crazy anyways we have this
 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.800
things go crazy anyways we have this
adaptive response and that usually goes

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810
adaptive response and that usually goes
 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.990
adaptive response and that usually goes
towards clearing the virus except in

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000
towards clearing the virus except in
 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.909
towards clearing the virus except in
some exceptional cases and we'll talk

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919
some exceptional cases and we'll talk
 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.460
some exceptional cases and we'll talk
about those next week or maybe it's the

about those next week or maybe it's the
 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.350
about those next week or maybe it's the
week after and then you're left with

is these cells don't do their job they

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610
is these cells don't do their job they
 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.230
is these cells don't do their job they
don't lyse infected cells they can alter

okay and when you have an amplified
 

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.680
okay and when you have an amplified
signal you have the opportunity to

so the viral molecules are in the gray

00:57:54.019 --> 00:57:54.029
so the viral molecules are in the gray
 

00:57:54.029 --> 00:57:57.589
so the viral molecules are in the gray
and what it does is it blocks the
