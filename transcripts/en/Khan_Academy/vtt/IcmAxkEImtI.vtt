00:00:00.322 --> 00:00:04.681
- [Instructor] Joey used
0.432 pounds of cheese

00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:06.603
to make mac-and-cheese for dinner,

00:00:06.603 --> 00:00:11.467
and we could also call this
432/1,000 pounds of cheese

00:00:11.467 --> 00:00:13.314
to make mac-and-cheese for dinner.

00:00:13.314 --> 00:00:14.949
Round the amount of cheese

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:16.644
to the nearest tenth.

00:00:16.644 --> 00:00:18.076
So the amount of cheese once again

00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:19.326
is 0.432 pounds

00:00:22.684 --> 00:00:25.219
and just remember the places here.

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:28.029
This is 4/10,

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.293
so that's the tenths place.

00:00:30.293 --> 00:00:33.204
This is the hundredths place,

00:00:33.204 --> 00:00:35.171
and that's an S there,

00:00:35.171 --> 00:00:37.004
so tenths, hundredths,

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.499
and this right over here is thousandths,

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:42.897
thousandths place.

00:00:42.897 --> 00:00:46.089
So we wanna round to the nearest tenth.

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:47.569
So we're gonna round to the nearest tenth.

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:49.545
We go one place to the right.

00:00:49.545 --> 00:00:51.048
If it's five or larger,

00:00:51.048 --> 00:00:52.464
we round up.

00:00:52.464 --> 00:00:53.676
This would become a five.

00:00:53.676 --> 00:00:56.085
If it's less than five,

00:00:56.085 --> 00:00:57.183
well, if it's less than five,

00:00:57.183 --> 00:00:58.704
which is the case here,

00:00:58.704 --> 00:01:02.943
we're gonna round down to just 4/10 even.

00:01:02.943 --> 00:01:06.102
So because three is less than five,

00:01:06.102 --> 00:01:08.352
we are going to round down,

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.706
and we're going to get 0.400,

00:01:15.314 --> 00:01:18.069
or we could write that as 0.4,

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:21.938
or we could write that as 4/10 of a pound.

00:01:21.938 --> 00:01:23.688
Let's do another one.

00:01:24.678 --> 00:01:28.845
Eliza's pet snail traveled
2.197 meters in one day.

00:01:30.265 --> 00:01:33.594
Round the distance to
the nearest hundredth.

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:35.409
So pause this video and
see if you can do that.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.799
Round the distance to
the nearest hundredth.

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:39.966
So it's 2.197.

00:01:43.535 --> 00:01:46.968
This is the hundredths
place right over here,

00:01:46.968 --> 00:01:50.533
and so if we're gonna round
to the nearest hundredth,

00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:52.994
we're gonna go one place to the right.

00:01:52.994 --> 00:01:54.809
If this one place to the right

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:56.652
is five or greater,

00:01:56.652 --> 00:01:58.005
we're gonna round up,

00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:00.360
and seven is five or greater,

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.777
so we are going to round up .

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.387
Now this is interesting

00:02:06.387 --> 00:02:09.063
'cause if you round a nine up,

00:02:09.063 --> 00:02:10.416
you get to 10,

00:02:10.416 --> 00:02:12.639
but you can't put a
whole 10 right over here.

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:13.614
So one way to think about it

00:02:13.614 --> 00:02:15.465
is you have a 19 here,

00:02:15.465 --> 00:02:16.424
and so if you round up,

00:02:16.424 --> 00:02:19.224
you're gonna go to a 20,

00:02:19.224 --> 00:02:20.272
or another way to think about it.

00:02:20.272 --> 00:02:21.608
If you round the nine up,

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:23.608
you're gonna go to the next tenth.

00:02:23.608 --> 00:02:26.191
So this is going to be 2 point,

00:02:27.145 --> 00:02:30.760
you could view this as 19/100

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.228
or 19/100 and 7/1,000,

00:02:34.228 --> 00:02:35.573
and so now we're gonna round up

00:02:35.573 --> 00:02:37.130
to 20/100,

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.963
so 2.20.

00:02:39.197 --> 00:02:41.281
We're rounding to the nearest hundredth,

00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:42.843
which you could write as 2.2,

00:02:42.843 --> 00:02:43.676
but to make it clear

00:02:43.676 --> 00:02:45.762
that you're rounding to
the nearest hundredth,

00:02:45.762 --> 00:02:48.485
you're gonna write 2.20,

00:02:48.485 --> 00:02:49.826
and later in your life,

00:02:49.826 --> 00:02:50.949
this actually might matter

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:54.366
to actually show what you're rounding to.

00:02:55.322 --> 00:02:57.822
Let's do another example here.

00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:04.936
Cassandra spends 6.75
hours each day at school.

00:03:04.936 --> 00:03:08.001
Round the amount of time
to the nearest hour.

00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:09.418
Alright, so 6.75,

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.929
so you might be a little confused,

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:14.619
and actually, I encourage
you to pause the video again

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:16.297
and try to solve it on your own.

00:03:16.297 --> 00:03:17.255
So you might be a little confused

00:03:17.255 --> 00:03:19.658
'cause they're not saying
round it to the nearest tenth

00:03:19.658 --> 00:03:22.408
or hundredth or one or 10 or 100.

00:03:23.762 --> 00:03:25.792
They're saying to the nearest hour,

00:03:25.792 --> 00:03:27.065
but in this case,

00:03:27.065 --> 00:03:29.315
the hour is the ones place.

00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:32.400
So if we're gonna round
to the nearest hour,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.497
this is another way of saying

00:03:33.497 --> 00:03:35.352
round to the nearest one.

00:03:35.352 --> 00:03:36.985
So we're gonna round to the nearest one.

00:03:36.985 --> 00:03:38.193
We go one place to the right.

00:03:38.193 --> 00:03:40.271
We go to look at the tenths place.

00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:41.583
If it's five or larger,

00:03:41.583 --> 00:03:42.936
we round up.

00:03:42.936 --> 00:03:45.193
Well, seven is five or larger,

00:03:45.193 --> 00:03:47.860
so we round up to the next hour,

00:03:49.815 --> 00:03:51.910
which is going to be seven,

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.367
so seven hours.

00:03:53.367 --> 00:03:55.034
If this was 6.49999,

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:02.290
once again, if we're
rounding to the nearest hour,

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.304
we go one place to the right.

00:04:03.304 --> 00:04:05.314
It doesn't matter that we
have all these nines here.

00:04:05.314 --> 00:04:08.216
We'd say, hey, look,
four is less than five.

00:04:08.216 --> 00:04:11.160
Therefore, we should round down,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.077
round down,

00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:15.095
and you would round down to the next hour.

00:04:15.095 --> 00:04:18.565
Well, the next hour that's below 6.499999,

00:04:18.565 --> 00:04:20.293
nine, nine, nine, nine,

00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:21.858
is six hours,

00:04:21.858 --> 00:04:24.244
but in this case, we had a
seven in the tenths place,

00:04:24.244 --> 00:04:26.964
which is definitely greater
than or equal to five,

00:04:26.964 --> 00:04:28.899
and so we'd round up to the next hour,

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:30.649
which is seven hours.
