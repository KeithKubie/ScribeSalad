00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.460
 Deaths from overdose in the United States increased by 2.2 times more than in 2002 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.160
 To 2015 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.500
 But what is the most dangerous drug in the world? 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.500
 If we refer to the most lethal substances, scientists use the so-called 

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:18.640
 "LDL" or LD50, which measures the required amount of the substance 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.520
 To kill half of the organs tested 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.060
 For example, 30 g of coffee kills a person weighing 70 kg, while 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.800
 This amount is much lower to reach 0.00175 cm of terrestrial Typhoon. 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.520
 Using this method, the most lethal substances on Earth are 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.329
 Botulinum toxin, or botox 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.950
 In the case of oral ingestion, the dose that is required to kill a person weighing 70 kg is 0.00000007 g. 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.640
 However, the "most dangerous" does not always mean "the deadliest". 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.200
 A group of experts in the UK decided to find out the most common "hazard" caused by this recreational property 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.859
 Using 16 variables including the types of social, psychological and physical harm. 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.130
 For example, this medicine may cause physical damage but is non lethal, and can cause it to become 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.730
 Continue entirely, in addition to being more likely to lose relationships or lack 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.360
 Mental performance, these are all forms of "damage". 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.390
 Through these criteria it was concluded that the most dangerous drug on the individual is heroin 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.000
 Heroin can be taken by injection, inhalation, or smoking in addition to it reaches the brain quickly 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.720
 When injected into the bloodstream. 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.430
 When used, it is related to the quasi-opioid receptors, which in turn create a wave of pleasurable sensations. 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.130
 In addition, this substance causes addiction accompanied by severe withdrawal symptoms that begin in a matter of hours 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.540
 From substance abuse, these symptoms include insomnia, colds, muscle and bone pain, nausea and vomiting. 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.890
 The receptors present in the brain stem are also affected, affecting important physiological processes 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.080
 Such as breathing and blood pressure. 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.790
 Excessive doses therefore slow the breathing process or stop it altogether, leading to an accumulation 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.790
 CO2 gas in the blood and eventually cause death. 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.100
 Since it is difficult for heroin users to know the strength of the dose is because it is not specified 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.720
 Which increases the chances of overdose. 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.140
 In addition, this drug can be mixed with other compounds such as fentanyl, making the drug more 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.140
 Risk. 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.959
 Both fentanyl and heroin are similar because they are opioids, but the strength of fentanyl is 50-100 times stronger than heroin, 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.710
 Lipid which means it penetrates fat in the brain more easily. 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.489
 With regard to the amount of harm he will inflict is more dangerous than heroin. 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.750
 It was initially used as a pain reliever but because of its addiction, 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.489
 It was used for late cases. 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.680
 Since its emergence as a recreational drug, the number of cases has increased 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.850
 Users of doses of 7 x more than 2012 to 2014 in the United States, and this article is still widely used 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.159
 Worldwide. 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.480
 But there is a more dangerous anesthetic than that! 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.989
 Although cocaine and methamphetamine are at the forefront of harmful substances on the individual but they still come 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.099
 Heroin, finding the most dangerous drug involves studying 20 different types of drugs, 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.939
 In addition to knowing the damage caused by this drug to others. 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:03:00.209
 This includes psychological and physical harm, crime and family and community disintegration 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.760
 And economic costs - and eventually it became clear that the most dangerous drug in the world is ... 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.760
 Alcohol. 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.560
 To make sure that this is not just a phenomenon in the UK, a European group has established the same process 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.790
 With a greater focus on damage to the individual and less on economic damage. 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.079
 Even with the different weights in two groups of alcohol the result was very similar. 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.610
 The use of alcohol on a large scale increases its severity. 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.620
 Most people in the world consume (61.7%) a lot of drink with an average of 17 liters 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.800
 Of the pure alcohol used by the individual in general. 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.069
 The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that worldwide deaths of 3.3 million people have been reported 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:43.329
 Dangerous consumption of alcohol in 2012 which means that alcohol kills one person every 10 seconds. 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.640
 But experts did not recommend banning alcohol. 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.739
 But in all cases the war on drugs has failed, and the countries that have been spared 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.260
 Follow strict policies and implement non-criminalization, harm reduction, and awareness-raising 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.560
 Have seen a marked decline in drug abuse. 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.529
