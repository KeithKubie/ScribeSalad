Speaker 2:          00:28          Hello, I'm Jad and I am Robert. This is radio lab and today our topic is tinkering I guess tinkering with nature. Yeah. Or life. Yes. But Don as we know it, no cause before the break we heard about some kids doing something that they call yes. Directed evolution by sticking wintergreen into a place where wintergreen has never been before, which definitely qualifies as life, not as we know. But now it's getting to the true grit of this cause. Those kids are looking at life in a, in a fairly different way than most of us do. Yes. It's very interesting that the people who are creating these living systems are engineers. This is Lee silver from Princeton University. I mean they, they really look at a living system as no different than a computational, uh, electronic device. And you, your hunches there. Right. My hunters, they're wrong. I don't know quite why by hunches, they're right. But, um, most of the world doesn't believe that

Speaker 3:          01:26          include me because I find it very hard to imagine that that a life [inaudible] animal leaves it for a span of years and then dies. You know, it's like when they die and the spirit kind of goes out. It's hard for me to believe that that is

Speaker 2:          01:41          just a chemical machine or several from parts. Really. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:46          Okay. I mean, I guess I can understand that, but let me introduce you to a guy now who's whole, uh, admittedly young career is based on the idea that life is a machine, that it's made of parts, parts that he can build and sell. Okay. So I'm, I'm Brian Banes. Brian, we met actually just down the street from those MIT kids. He is 31. That's right. Just 31. And he runs his own biotech company. I'm one of the founders of code on devices here. We make custom synthetic genes from scratch and he's doing pretty well. The industry is gray, sickly doubling every two years. At this point. I mean, just to give you a sense of what Brian does, you with me? Yup. Just take your example. Those MIT kids, let's say I'm one of those kids or someone else who's heard about them and don't want to take my stinky bacteria and make it smell better, or maybe I want to make it glow.

Speaker 3:          02:34          All I have to do is call Brian. Sure. Because he'll sell me a simple gene like that for about 1500 bucks. I just have to go online. Look up the chemical recipes for dark. Yes. Here it is. 1200 letters, t, G, Z, Cesar, letters of DNA, g, a t and a c of for fundamental building blocks of DNA. The next, just list out those A's, g's and t's and C's. Yeah, just type them into an email. Generally they're not typing it themselves. Imagine trying to type in 2000 letters by hand without making a mistake and that would take too long. All right. Just copy and paste them into an email. Send them to Brian g. When we get that in house, we, um, we're going to take that into our factor.

Speaker 4:          03:15          Sorry. Brian then plugs the string of letters into this machine, which is about the size of a desktop computer. We have a synthesis system where it literally has a bunch of little A's in a jar and a bunch of gs in a jar and, and t's and C's. Now mind you, these chemicals are in Irt. They are store bought $100 a bottle. The machine, they're all connected to reads all the letters that Brian plugs in and when it's using a machine, eh, squirts out some a TV [inaudible] warts out some t test, we can add an a or a g or a t or a c to a growing strand of DNA. And so we literally adding one base at a time, C, c. So what starts as one letter pieces then grows to 50 then grows to maybe 500 then grows to be 5,000 and at a certain point, all of these inert chemicals hold hands.

Speaker 3:          04:15          And that's literally how you make DNA chemically. That is how you go from dust to something that is not exactly alive, but if I take this little speck of DNA and stick it into my cell, amazingly, it will start to glow or smell better or whatever it is that I wanted to do. It will do it. It's almost as if the cell is a computer and this little bit of DNA is a software program. That's the way synthetic biologists think about it. Hmm. And what synthetic biologists are hoping for us as Lees, that the, the software, quote unquote, we'll get standardized. It will come down in price. So that one day installing new features into organisms will be just as easy as when you install new software on your home PC, put a word processor or you put a spreadsheet program user-friendly. That's kind of the logic.

Speaker 3:          05:04          Yeah, but that's not the, that's that we're talking about life here. Life isn't like, you know, a game of Legos. What if it is, I mean I know it's weird to think it's wrong in other words to describe it, but what if it's not wrong? Just imagine you can start to look at things in a completely new way. You can look at that creature over there and say, that creature right there has a talent that I really like and that went over there. The second one, it also does something cool. Maybe if I take talent one and talent to stick them together, put them into a third creature. Then I've got a little factory. They can do really cool stuff. Free eight living things that have very important functional values. As an example, in our earlier conversation with Lee silver, he brought up a guy named George Church, George Church as a scientist at Harvard medical school. He's thought to be absolutely brilliant by everybody that knows him. We actually haven't have a picture of George on emoney and he showed us, Oh, is that him? That's him. He typically, he doesn't click a radical. Let me see. Let me see what his face looks like. This guy, then he's wearing an army shirt of some kind. He's got a nice bushy beard and a spit curl. It would be Santa Claus played by Clark Gable.

Speaker 3:          06:10          Well, we had to visit him. Hi, how are you? And George is unusual as scientists go. I'm George Church professors genetics at Harvard Medical School for the last 20 years. He's been going further and further and further in terms of synthesizing life. Okay, I'll slide. You do what I'll do. I'll slide. He he's, he's stuffing some kind of big black rod up my nose. That would be the mic. Now the kind of creatures, the George Church engineers are the same kind of those MIT kids use eco lie by taking these little tiny Nikolai and you know, adding a few genes from other organisms and tweaking the internal chemistry. He has gotten the Nikolai to suck in sugar, which is what they normally like to eat. Poop out all kinds of things. Most notably drum roll please. Diesel for real. Oh yeah. Some mean the company I co founded has produced hydrocarbons status.

Speaker 3:          07:06          Just a fancy way of saying among other things, diesel, three different kinds to run in three types of engines, cars, trucks and planes. I was curious to see how it all work. So he took me to a room at the back of his lab where he's perfecting the process and he pointed to a small container. So here's an example where we might grow, grow up a large batch of of cells in a, in a fermentor. So this big vet right here, which is, I dunno what's the size of a couple of liters? Pretty small. It's about the size of a coke bottle. And right now he can only make a few drops. So there are some scale issues to solve. But I asked him, you were to close your eyes and you know, where does he imagine this stuff going project forward into the future and he painted. Describe it for me. What would it look like? An amazing picture of huge bodies of water. Giant pawns or lakes of gas.

Speaker 5:          07:59          I mean just imagine we could take a boat, paddle around and be beautiful birds chirping except under the [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          08:06          Trillions of bacteria would be busily eating plant life, burping out diesel fuel, which then float to the surface as this kind of gassy foam. And you can skim it off, skimming off through into a pipe. There you have it.

Speaker 5:          08:23          I mean this could be the oil refinery of the future. No more pumping in out of the ground and fighting wars. I get that. That's old. Now we're talking microbes, man. Mike Rowe.

Speaker 3:          08:33          And this could be just the beginning. I mean according to Lisa silver, people are hoping that this kind of bioengineering can produce all kinds of stuff. You know, a drug that cures malaria. Something that makes plastic, I mean anything. Well I they would be good. Yeah, there is part of it that makes it look me a little uneasy. Why and and well I wanna introduce you to another bioengineer. He's often called the leader

Speaker 2:          08:56          of the pack, like the rat pack. Sort of like the rat pack. His name is Craig venter and like the rat pack folks. He's very talented. He's very ambitious. He's very driven. He's also working on a bug for fuel. He also thinks that the earth is in trouble. We're messing our nests, something terrible. And when we were at the 92nd street y in New York, he said to them right out loud, bio engineer creating new life is our last hope. It's probably our one major chance of having our species survive on this planet. I mean this is the engineering of the rest of this century and that's a little, I mean stand aside young man, I'll rescue now with my magical scientific ability and my natural engineering skills. Kids Save the world. I stand aside and throw them a parade. Well except that you don't realize just how ambitious these these guys are.

Speaker 2:          09:46          What's wrong with ambition? Nothing really. But what you don't know is just how bold this guy is. He not only wants to mix and match traits that already exist in, in, in life to make new forms of life. He wants to do original design. He wants to think of things that life has never done before. Things that are in his head that are entirely new. He even dreams of life life form from, from scratch, from scratch, completely like 4.1 billion years ago. Kind of like in Genesis. It'd probably take a little longer, but, uh, I think there will be new life for forms. You think it will be possible in your lifetime that someone will go into a store by dust, figure out what it is that they have to do with that desk so that what they make will be unmistakably alive, not alive than alive. Yes. Yes. But using the knowledge that we have from studying this 4 billion years of evolution, we don't want to write about what, what if I told you that I thought no, I don't know why. Just, no, I think you reviewed my grant.

Speaker 2:          10:56          No, but there's a, there's a candidness to scientists that that puzzles me a little bit. Isn't there something that you think, and this would be really close to it, creating life that just might be out of our grasp. It might be forever and mysterious and, and yet you guys like, I mean, is there anything in the way of, of engineering life, is there anything that you think is not doable? Do you think it's never going to happen, that you'll meet, create a conscious life form from scratch or it will never happen that you will create a morally or you know, a sense of a creature with moral sense of right and wrong or, I don't know. I think you think that everything is possible. Everything. I think you're right.

Speaker 6:          11:47          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          11:47          okay. I get that cracking people like it might have a little bit of a, of an attitude about they can accomplish, but is that your problem than he did he, it's his attitude. No, no, no, no. It's, it's a sense of life I think is wrong here. I really appreciate because of Darwin and Darwinian evolution, but it takes 100 million, 200 million a billion years for creatures to figure out how to live in the neighborhood of life, how to know what would fit in, how you know if you're going to sustain, you got to learn how to live harmoniously with the rest of nature. It takes awhile, but here come these engineers over some weekend thing. I have a new idea, maybe the lead oil or audible, and then you stick it into the world and you've just stuck something into a rich fabric of life and you have no idea of all the different consequences that could follow from that decision.

Speaker 2:          12:34          Oh look, look at what happens right now with antibiotics. That scientist Nigel Golden, whom he heard from, you know, before 50 years ago, we declared war on microbes. We, we fed antibiotics to cattle, to kids when they had virus infections. We put so much antibiotics into our bodies and into our food that the bacteria we were trying to kill figured out a way to avoid our medicines and now they're stronger than ever. Not Smart. We didn't know they were things that we didn't really understand that we didn't know, that we didn't understand, and we're paying the place for that. Now. I am frightened that these people have so much ambition and so much certainty in them that frankly, they don't fear what biologists don't know about life. It's a really a Frankenstein story that is there so much hubris in this. And as Steve Strogatz will tell you, biologists and peck scientists in general know veer.

Speaker 2:          13:24          We now know how much we don't know about life. If biology really is about collective behavior, the interaction of billions of molecules, billions of species that has network of, of life. We barely understand. You know, we keep being surprised about life. On the one hand we can tinker in this engineering way like the MIT students do or like venter is doing. But on the other hand, the best biologists are still mystified that we only have about the same number of genes as a worm. We're really still missing 99% of the picture, literally. So it's a scary time today to start playing Dr Frankenstein, given how ignorant we are. Do you know that at Stony Brook University where your mom worked for all those years, there was a scientist, maybe a few doors down from your mom who who made from scratch using good dust particles? We've talked about the polio virus, which the whole world has been working to eliminate. Polio made a new polio virus. Why? I don't know. There was a lot of controversy about it, but there is a guy could perhaps in the cave somewhere in Afghanistan who wants to make a polio virus and who will use it against this [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          14:32          Yeah, yeah, you're right. You're right. You are right that there is, there are some bad things that can happen. Very bad. So the question is then what? Like what do you do in the face of that risk? How do you proceed? Do you say to these guys, stop. Would you have these guys stop doing what they're doing? Stop doing their experiments. Asking questions, being

Speaker 2:          14:52          curious. Oh, that'd be ridiculous to tell the science not to do science. So what then I, I don't know. I mean I don't, I don't know exactly. Do I want them to, to not do experiments? No,

Speaker 7:          15:07          I'm not saying don't I, so I'm not going to be a troglodyte and say we shouldn't play with these. And Steve Strogatz agrees. I think it's great to play with them, but I'm scared too. I don't know. I'm confused about it because we have to play. That's how we make all science, you know, they speak of Homo ludens human beings as the player that we, we are what we are because we like to play with nature, with ideas, with language. This is how we learn things. So we're gonna play, but we have to be very careful about how we play. And we don't want to fall into the idea that we know more than we, we do.

Speaker 8:          15:43          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          15:43          we have a vast ocean to discover it before us.

Speaker 8:          16:11          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          16:11          okay, well I guess that's all the time we have. Um, anything that you heard this hour that you want to hear again, more information.
