tablets we moved to watches cars and TVs
 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.609
tablets we moved to watches cars and TVs
and we went into virtual reality

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
and we went into virtual reality
 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.490
and we went into virtual reality
headsets and the concept behind it is

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500
headsets and the concept behind it is
 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.980

their audiences on so when we think
 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.249
their audiences on so when we think
about this platform how do we distribute

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259
about this platform how do we distribute
 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.710
about this platform how do we distribute
content well Google play's the

it's consistent for your audiences and
one developer console where you can push

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259
one developer console where you can push
 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.440

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.460
make sure that different people have
exactly what they need so when we think

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470
exactly what they need so when we think
 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.410
exactly what they need so when we think
about how we discuss this with our

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420
about how we discuss this with our
 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.490
about how we discuss this with our
developers

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500
developers
 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.020
developers
we tell developers you can create one

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030
we tell developers you can create one
 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.750
we tell developers you can create one
app for both experiences that will vary

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760
app for both experiences that will vary
 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.730
app for both experiences that will vary
for our users who have different needs

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740
for our users who have different needs
 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.560
for our users who have different needs
and different ways that they can get

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570
and different ways that they can get
 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.840
and different ways that they can get
content into living room so when we

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850
content into living room so when we
 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.000
content into living room so when we
think about Android TV we have a deeper

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010
think about Android TV we have a deeper

control native elements to navigate and
 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.730
control native elements to navigate and
content is searchable in a TV UI

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740
content is searchable in a TV UI
 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.780

similarly when we think about chromecast

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790
similarly when we think about chromecast
 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.360
similarly when we think about chromecast
you take your existing app you take a

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370
you take your existing app you take a
 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.490
you take your existing app you take a
simpler interface and you easily push

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500
simpler interface and you easily push
 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.680
simpler interface and you easily push
that content onto the big screen it's

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690
that content onto the big screen it's
 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.490
that content onto the big screen it's
available both on iOS and Android so

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500
available both on iOS and Android so
 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.570
available both on iOS and Android so
when we think about that livings from

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580
when we think about that livings from
 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.730
when we think about that livings from
strategies you have an Android app you

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740
strategies you have an Android app you
 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.710
strategies you have an Android app you
can turn that Android app into a TV app

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720
can turn that Android app into a TV app
 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.710
can turn that Android app into a TV app
you can supplement that Android app into

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720
you can supplement that Android app into
 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.380
you can supplement that Android app into
a cast-enabled app this is something for

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390
a cast-enabled app this is something for
 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.270
