00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.280
I have a love-hate relationship with karaoke,
if I'm not in a costume at a crappy bar; it's

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.190
tough to get me in there, but when I do, some
people ruin it by trying to sing well, and

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.430
some people make it awesome by caterwauling
their way through Meatloaf's discography!

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.220
Some people are better singers than others,
but it's no different than some being better

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.940
runners, ball players, guitarists, or good
writers. According to William Vennard's 1967

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.880
book, "Singing: The Mechanism and the Technic,"
singing is not a "natural" skill, but an art.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.469
Singing is very mechanical, there's much to
be said about the shape of the skull, the

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.960
resonance of the space in the nasal cavity,
and how much air can be pushed out of the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.950
chest, but let's come back to that, since
we're talking not just about singing, but

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.079
singing WELL and mechanics will only get a
person so far; they also need to hear the

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.250
music and understand it.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.539
What musicians call pitch, scientists call
frequency. Sound frequency is a measure of

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:12.899
the wave oscillations per second, measured
in Hertz. Having good pitch requires the ears

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.759
to pick up a precise frequency, the brain
to recognize the minute differences in hertz,

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.259
and direct the vocal chords to reproduce them.
From there, the brain has to hear what's coming

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.039
out and tweak it it ever so slightly and constantly.
It sounds difficult, but to be honest, it

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:34.179
just takes practice to match a pitch. Musicians
nail that down through practice, but in a

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:39.609
study by the University of Montreal, about
one-fifth of nonmusicians couldn't control

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:45.069
their vocal muscles well, and 35 percent couldn't
match their voice to a note. But both musicians

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:50.880
and nonmusicians were able to listen to and
match a pitch using a slide instrument. Only

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.529
five percent couldn't hear the difference
in pitch. When the physique is taken out,

00:01:55.529 --> 00:02:00.289
it would seem 95 percent of people's brains
get pitch.

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:08.209
A study in PlosONE took functional MRI scans
of brain activity and compared musical processing

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.709
to analyzing visual information: you'd need
memory, context, pattern recognition… And

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.260
when it comes to music, it uses the speech
center, but other parts of the brain light

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.930
up too looking for "contour… pitch encoding
and production." More research is needed to

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.159
find how these connections can influence musical
ability, But again, it's possible with practice!

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:35.629
According to the founder of New York Vocal
Coaching, Justin Stoney, "training our voice

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.680
is similar to going to the gym and training
any other muscle."

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.709
So, to get back to mechanical things, and
break some little hearts, YES some musicality

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.640
is inborn. Human song vocalization is a big
part of our culturosocial development. Groups

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.209
of humans sing together to bond, worship,
celebrate, and just for fun. This means social

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.849
groups that valued singing may have looked
for musical characteristics in their mates.

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.799
This is supported by a study in the Journal
of Medical Genetics which linked mutations

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:10.599
on chromosomes 4q22 and 8q13-21 to musical
ability. Further studies have found these

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:16.379
genes can influence perception, memory and
even participation in music. Funnily enough,

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.359
8q13 has also been linked to dyslexia!

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:24.159
Mechanically speaking, a singer is like a
piano or guitar, the same piano strings on

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.889
a different instrument would sound different,
because of the manufacturing, stress, humidity

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:34.879
and such. Every instrument, and every person,
is also different. Women and men have sex

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.670
differences in their voiceboxes, and people
of different genetic backgrounds tend have

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.359
different sized nasal cavities. There are
people whose skulls, chest cavities and physiological

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.780
structures are more beneficial to their singing
abilities! And on top of that, as reported

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.090
by Medical News Daily, being raised in an
encouraging or musical environment will affect

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.879
your confidence, inherent skill level interest
and ultimately, abilities. Not unlike any

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.569
other sports or physical activities. Maybe
that's why we see so many singers from churches

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.409
become singers in the music biz?

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:09.159
What do you think? Why are some people better
singers? Practice or Providence?

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:13.609
Also, for the opposite of singing… check
out this great sounding video explaining what

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:36.409
the heck is vocal fryyyyyy
