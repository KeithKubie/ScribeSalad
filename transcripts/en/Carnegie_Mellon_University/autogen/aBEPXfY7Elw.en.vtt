gonna be talking about scientific

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:43.140
gonna be talking about scientific
 

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.890
gonna be talking about scientific
approach to science education and you

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:45.900
approach to science education and you
 

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:49.370
approach to science education and you
know this is motivated by the and has

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:49.380
know this is motivated by the and has
 

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:53.000
know this is motivated by the and has
the goal really to have all students

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:53.010
the goal really to have all students

into to be able to to think about and
 

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:02.810
into to be able to to think about and
use science more like scientists do and

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:02.820
use science more like scientists do and
 

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.410
use science more like scientists do and
I think you know you have all kinds of

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:05.420
I think you know you have all kinds of
 

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:10.100
I think you know you have all kinds of
economic and basically societal reasons

why we need to achieve that now before I

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:17.100
why we need to achieve that now before I
 

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:22.310
why we need to achieve that now before I
get into you know the details of the of

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320
get into you know the details of the of
 

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.400
get into you know the details of the of
the scientific approach to that I want

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:25.410
the scientific approach to that I want
 

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.830
the scientific approach to that I want
to just kind of whet your appetite with

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:27.840
to just kind of whet your appetite with
 

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.260
to just kind of whet your appetite with
some data you know and show you an

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:30.270
some data you know and show you an
 

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:33.950
some data you know and show you an
example here so this is looking at an

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:33.960
example here so this is looking at an
 

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.810
example here so this is looking at an
experiment measuring the amount of

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:35.820
experiment measuring the amount of
 

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.000
experiment measuring the amount of
learning that actually takes place in

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:38.010
learning that actually takes place in
 

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.370
learning that actually takes place in
class and so it's a comparison between

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:40.380
class and so it's a comparison between
 

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:47.500
class and so it's a comparison between
two you know real normal large classes

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:47.510
 

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.300
250 student sections teaching physics

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:50.310
250 student sections teaching physics
 

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:54.050
250 student sections teaching physics
and where they're covering an identical

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:54.060
and where they're covering an identical
 

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.350
and where they're covering an identical
set of learning objectives

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360
set of learning objectives
 

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.299
set of learning objectives
gives in an identical amount of class

00:11:57.299 --> 00:11:57.309
gives in an identical amount of class
 

00:11:57.309 --> 00:11:59.669
gives in an identical amount of class
time and then both groups have the same

00:11:59.669 --> 00:11:59.679
time and then both groups have the same
 

00:11:59.679 --> 00:12:02.509
time and then both groups have the same
test right at the end of this and

00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519
test right at the end of this and
 

00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:06.780
test right at the end of this and
comparison with the results between two

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:06.790
comparison with the results between two
 

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:10.189
comparison with the results between two
different instructors one of these was a

00:12:10.189 --> 00:12:10.199
different instructors one of these was a
 

00:12:10.199 --> 00:12:14.789
different instructors one of these was a
very experienced professor teaching this

00:12:14.789 --> 00:12:14.799
very experienced professor teaching this
 

00:12:14.799 --> 00:12:17.489
very experienced professor teaching this
many times these two high student

00:12:17.489 --> 00:12:17.499
many times these two high student
 

00:12:17.499 --> 00:12:19.979
many times these two high student
ratings but used to face a traditional

00:12:19.979 --> 00:12:19.989
ratings but used to face a traditional
 

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:22.259

who had a PhD in physics but a newly

00:12:26.549 --> 00:12:26.559
who had a PhD in physics but a newly
 

00:12:26.559 --> 00:12:28.949
who had a PhD in physics but a newly
minted PhD so little experience in

00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959
minted PhD so little experience in
 

00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:31.169
minted PhD so little experience in
teaching but had been trained in the

00:12:31.169 --> 00:12:31.179
teaching but had been trained in the
 

00:12:31.179 --> 00:12:33.090
teaching but had been trained in the
principles of effective teaching that

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:33.100

so what was the outcome between the two

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:38.980
so what was the outcome between the two
 

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:42.329
so what was the outcome between the two
groups well it's it's this histogram

00:12:42.329 --> 00:12:42.339
groups well it's it's this histogram
 

00:12:42.339 --> 00:12:46.199
groups well it's it's this histogram
here so the this is the score the

00:12:46.199 --> 00:12:46.209
here so the this is the score the
 

00:12:46.209 --> 00:12:48.449
here so the this is the score the
histogram of numbers students versus the

histogram of numbers students versus the
 

00:12:48.459 --> 00:12:51.449
histogram of numbers students versus the
score on this common exam and so the red

00:12:51.449 --> 00:12:51.459
score on this common exam and so the red
 

00:12:51.459 --> 00:12:54.859

where I should point out random guessing
 

00:13:00.399 --> 00:13:02.309
where I should point out random guessing
gives you three on this so you can see

00:13:02.309 --> 00:13:02.319
gives you three on this so you can see
 

00:13:02.319 --> 00:13:04.409
gives you three on this so you can see
how much learning was accomplished in

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:04.419
how much learning was accomplished in
 

00:13:04.419 --> 00:13:08.210
how much learning was accomplished in
that class versus the one using these

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:08.220
that class versus the one using these

research-based methods in the in white
and so no this is a starting point to

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:15.730
and so no this is a starting point to
 

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.419
and so no this is a starting point to
convince you maybe this is worth paying

00:13:18.419 --> 00:13:18.429
convince you maybe this is worth paying
 

00:13:18.429 --> 00:13:19.559
convince you maybe this is worth paying
attention to

00:13:19.559 --> 00:13:19.569
attention to
 

00:13:19.569 --> 00:13:21.780
attention to
obviously something's very different

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:21.790
obviously something's very different
 

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.019
obviously something's very different

00:13:24.019 --> 00:13:24.029
happening between these two cases and
 

00:13:24.029 --> 00:13:26.789
happening between these two cases and
we'll come back to some details on this

00:13:26.789 --> 00:13:26.799
we'll come back to some details on this
 

00:13:26.799 --> 00:13:30.150
we'll come back to some details on this
but but all this really comes about

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160
but but all this really comes about
 

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.359
but but all this really comes about
because of late starting with the worker

00:13:33.359 --> 00:13:33.369
because of late starting with the worker
 

00:13:33.369 --> 00:13:36.629

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:02.280
involved here now you know first
hypothesis was you know you know that

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:02.290
hypothesis was you know you know that
 

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.960
hypothesis was you know you know that
occurs to me and lots of people have

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:04.970
occurs to me and lots of people have
 

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:07.240
occurs to me and lots of people have
seen this as well maybe the human brain

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:07.250
seen this as well maybe the human brain
 

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:09.610
seen this as well maybe the human brain
it just needs sort of to go through sort

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:09.620
it just needs sort of to go through sort
 

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.310
it just needs sort of to go through sort
of like a 17-year caterpillar stage

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320
of like a 17-year caterpillar stage
 

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.460
of like a 17-year caterpillar stage
before it can blossom into a physicist

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:15.470
before it can blossom into a physicist
 

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.950
before it can blossom into a physicist
butterfly but I took a little more

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:17.960
butterfly but I took a little more
 

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.170
butterfly but I took a little more
scholarly approach to seeing if that was

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:20.180
scholarly approach to seeing if that was
 

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.110
scholarly approach to seeing if that was
really true and so I dug into research

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120
really true and so I dug into research
 

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.230
really true and so I dug into research
on how people learn learning some of

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240
on how people learn learning some of
 

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.170
on how people learn learning some of
herb Simon's work and how they learn

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:29.180
herb Simon's work and how they learn
 

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:32.440
herb Simon's work and how they learn
physics and from that I came to see that

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:32.450
physics and from that I came to see that
 

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.550
physics and from that I came to see that
in fact

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:34.560
in fact
 

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.270
in fact
the this wasn't a puzzle at all if you

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280
the this wasn't a puzzle at all if you
 

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.890
the this wasn't a puzzle at all if you
look at the research a completely

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:39.900
look at the research a completely
 

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:43.160
look at the research a completely
explain why this was happening and it

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:43.170
explain why this was happening and it
 

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.170
explain why this was happening and it
gave me a completely different way to

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:45.180
gave me a completely different way to
 

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:47.450
gave me a completely different way to
think about learning and it showed how

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.460
think about learning and it showed how
 

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.600
think about learning and it showed how
we can really do much better and how we

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:50.610
we can really do much better and how we
 

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:53.360
we can really do much better and how we
teach our classes particularly college

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:53.370
teach our classes particularly college
 

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.510
teach our classes particularly college
science classes and so you know that's

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:56.520
science classes and so you know that's
 

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.330
science classes and so you know that's
what I'm going to tell you about

00:18:58.330 --> 00:18:58.340
what I'm going to tell you about
 

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.950
what I'm going to tell you about
starting with sort of the the highest

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960
starting with sort of the the highest
 

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.920
starting with sort of the the highest
level picture of this at really the

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:03.930
level picture of this at really the
 

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:07.340
level picture of this at really the
whole paradigm on on learning of complex

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:07.350
whole paradigm on on learning of complex
 

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.050
whole paradigm on on learning of complex
tasks with the research is really

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:09.060
tasks with the research is really
 

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.630
tasks with the research is really
telling us maybe we have to think about

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:11.640
telling us maybe we have to think about
 

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.450
telling us maybe we have to think about
in a new way and then the the old way

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:14.460
in a new way and then the the old way
 

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.490
in a new way and then the the old way
and it's really the way I used to think

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:16.500
and it's really the way I used to think
 

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.920
and it's really the way I used to think
about and unfortunately still reflected

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:18.930
about and unfortunately still reflected
 

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.800
about and unfortunately still reflected
in most of the current teaching is that

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:21.810
in most of the current teaching is that
 

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:24.290
in most of the current teaching is that
you know we have coming into our

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:24.300
you know we have coming into our
 

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.150
you know we have coming into our
classrooms these brains and they have

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160
classrooms these brains and they have
 

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:30.350
classrooms these brains and they have
variations in them we immerse them in

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.360
variations in them we immerse them in
 

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.320
variations in them we immerse them in
knowledge in our teaching and it soaks

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:33.330
knowledge in our teaching and it soaks
 

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.350
knowledge in our teaching and it soaks
into variable amounts depending on how

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360
into variable amounts depending on how
 

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:40.460
into variable amounts depending on how
that brain started but what the research

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:40.470
that brain started but what the research
 

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.500
that brain started but what the research
is tying is the new paradigm is really

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:42.510
is tying is the new paradigm is really
 

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:44.690
is tying is the new paradigm is really
that these brains come into our

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:44.700
that these brains come into our
 

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.420
that these brains come into our
classrooms not being all that different

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:47.430
classrooms not being all that different
 

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:52.550
classrooms not being all that different
and really they transform actually

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:52.560
and really they transform actually
 

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.810
and really they transform actually
change through suitable exercise and to

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:56.820
change through suitable exercise and to
 

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.060
change through suitable exercise and to
the extent their brains are doing

00:19:59.060 --> 00:19:59.070
the extent their brains are doing
 

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:00.820
the extent their brains are doing
they're going the same kind of exercise

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:00.830
they're going the same kind of exercise
 

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:03.860
they're going the same kind of exercise
they can all change in much the same way

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:03.870
they can all change in much the same way
 

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.420
they can all change in much the same way
and that's really what learning is about

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:07.430
and that's really what learning is about
 

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:11.240
and that's really what learning is about
so next I want to sort of dig down a

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:11.250
so next I want to sort of dig down a
 

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:13.550
so next I want to sort of dig down a
little more deeply into this is you know

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:13.560
little more deeply into this is you know
 

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.350
little more deeply into this is you know
I talked about learning what is it that

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360
I talked about learning what is it that
 

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.960
I talked about learning what is it that
we really want students to learn when I

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:17.970
we really want students to learn when I
 

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:20.390
we really want students to learn when I
say I want them to think you know more

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400
say I want them to think you know more
 

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.880
say I want them to think you know more
like a scientist does you know an

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:22.890
like a scientist does you know an
 

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:24.470
like a scientist does you know an
obvious they're not gonna become expert

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480
obvious they're not gonna become expert
 

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.760
obvious they're not gonna become expert
scientists about move in that direction

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:25.770
scientists about move in that direction
 

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.340
scientists about move in that direction
of thinking more like a scientist what

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:28.350
of thinking more like a scientist what
 

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:31.160
of thinking more like a scientist what
does that really mean okay and then what

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:31.170
does that really mean okay and then what
 

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:32.870
does that really mean okay and then what
do we know about how its learned and

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880
do we know about how its learned and
 

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.060
do we know about how its learned and
then look at some data from classrooms

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:35.070
then look at some data from classrooms
 

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:41.570
then look at some data from classrooms
testing these ideas so the first is you

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:41.580
testing these ideas so the first is you
 

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.400
testing these ideas so the first is you
know what does it mean to think like a

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:43.410
know what does it mean to think like a
 

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:44.750
know what does it mean to think like a
scientist or what does it mean to

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760
scientist or what does it mean to
 

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.310
scientist or what does it mean to
actually to think like an

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:47.320
actually to think like an
 

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.950
actually to think like an
expert in any field and this is where

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:49.960
expert in any field and this is where
 

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.780
expert in any field and this is where
herm Simon did much of the pioneering

herm Simon did much of the pioneering
 

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:54.270
herm Simon did much of the pioneering
work but cognitive psychologist over the

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:54.280
work but cognitive psychologist over the
 

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.820
work but cognitive psychologist over the
years have advanced this a long ways and

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:56.830
years have advanced this a long ways and
 

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.660
years have advanced this a long ways and
they've learned a great deal about the

00:20:59.660 --> 00:20:59.670
they've learned a great deal about the
 

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:02.280
they've learned a great deal about the
characteristics the nature of expertise

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:02.290
characteristics the nature of expertise
 

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:06.150
characteristics the nature of expertise
and how that expertise is acquired and

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:06.160
and how that expertise is acquired and
 

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.280
and how that expertise is acquired and
it turns out they found it's quite

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:08.290
it turns out they found it's quite
 

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:10.800
it turns out they found it's quite
consistent over many many different

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:10.810
consistent over many many different
 

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:12.180
consistent over many many different
human endeavors

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:12.190
human endeavors
 

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:15.840
human endeavors
so expertise or expert competence has

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:15.850
so expertise or expert competence has
 

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:19.700
so expertise or expert competence has
three basic components or universally

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:19.710
three basic components or universally

three basic components or universally
the first one everybody could guess

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:22.210
the first one everybody could guess

they have a particular organizational
 

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:46.520
they have a particular organizational
framework by which they you know

coach or a teacher on what they're doing

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:29.950
coach or a teacher on what they're doing
 

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:31.650
coach or a teacher on what they're doing
right what they're doing wrong how to

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:31.660
right what they're doing wrong how to
 

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.950
right what they're doing wrong how to
get better and so you know these are the

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960
get better and so you know these are the
 

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:38.040
get better and so you know these are the
basic components and the evidence is

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:38.050
basic components and the evidence is
 

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:40.380
basic components and the evidence is
that okay you just do this keep getting

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:40.390
that okay you just do this keep getting
 

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:42.810
that okay you just do this keep getting
better and better seeing working do more

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:42.820
better and better seeing working do more
 

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:46.530
better and better seeing working do more
and more difficult but possible problems

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:46.540
and more difficult but possible problems
 

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:50.549
and more difficult but possible problems
and after about 10,000 hours most people

00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559
and after about 10,000 hours most people
 

00:25:50.559 --> 00:25:53.010
and after about 10,000 hours most people
and most subject is what the research

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:53.020
and most subject is what the research
 

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.840
and most subject is what the research
would suggest can read sort of a

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:54.850
would suggest can read sort of a
 

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:58.890
would suggest can read sort of a
world-class level of expertise but in

00:25:58.890 --> 00:25:58.900
world-class level of expertise but in
 

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.140
world-class level of expertise but in
the process and I want to emphasize this

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:01.150
the process and I want to emphasize this
 

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:02.490
the process and I want to emphasize this
because it's important for thinking

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:02.500
because it's important for thinking
 

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.440
because it's important for thinking
about teaching they have quite a

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:04.450
about teaching they have quite a
 

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:06.210
about teaching they have quite a
different brain than what they started

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:06.220
different brain than what they started
 

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:11.220
different brain than what they started
out as so what's the how does the

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:11.230
out as so what's the how does the
 

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:13.530
out as so what's the how does the
teacher come into this well I think the

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:13.540
teacher come into this well I think the
 

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:15.720
teacher come into this well I think the
best way to think about this isn't an

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:15.730
best way to think about this isn't an
 

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:18.750
best way to think about this isn't an
effective teacher is really so like a

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:18.760
effective teacher is really so like a
 

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.960
effective teacher is really so like a
coach but in a cognitive sense and so

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:21.970
coach but in a cognitive sense and so
 

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:25.140
coach but in a cognitive sense and so
what the what a effective teacher really

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:25.150
what the what a effective teacher really
 

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:28.680
what the what a effective teacher really
has to do is first really think

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:28.690
has to do is first really think
 

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:31.169
has to do is first really think
carefully about what makes up expertise

00:26:31.169 --> 00:26:31.179
carefully about what makes up expertise
 

00:26:31.179 --> 00:26:34.320
carefully about what makes up expertise
in this subject and then what's a good

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:34.330
in this subject and then what's a good
 

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:37.440
in this subject and then what's a good
practice activity that we'll have that's

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:37.450
practice activity that we'll have that's
 

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:39.870
practice activity that we'll have that's
appropriate for the learner and have

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:39.880
appropriate for the learner and have
 

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.750
appropriate for the learner and have
them quite explicitly practicing that

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:42.760
them quite explicitly practicing that
 

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:46.230
them quite explicitly practicing that
kind of expertise and then the teacher

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240
kind of expertise and then the teacher
 

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.570
kind of expertise and then the teacher
has to give them good good feedback

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:48.580
has to give them good good feedback
 

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:51.899
has to give them good good feedback
and good means both specific you know

00:26:51.899 --> 00:26:51.909
and good means both specific you know
 

00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:53.580
and good means both specific you know
here's what you're doing right here's

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:53.590
here's what you're doing right here's
 

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:55.200
here's what you're doing right here's
how great you need to get better and

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:55.210
how great you need to get better and
 

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:57.960
how great you need to get better and

they should put an enormous amount of

00:27:29.789 --> 00:27:29.799
they should put an enormous amount of
 

00:27:29.799 --> 00:27:32.820
they should put an enormous amount of
work into mastering this subject that's

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:32.830
work into mastering this subject that's
 

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:34.980
work into mastering this subject that's
the job of the teacher to show them why

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:34.990
the job of the teacher to show them why
 

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:38.000

on this I I you know my last review
 

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:11.850
on this I I you know my last review
about a year ago I turned up about a

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:11.860
about a year ago I turned up about a
 

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:15.030
about a year ago I turned up about a
thousand research studies on this when

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:15.040

you you give this test to the students

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:06.820
you you give this test to the students
 

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:08.940
you you give this test to the students
at the beginning of the semester and

at the beginning of the semester and
 

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:10.470
at the beginning of the semester and
then you give it to them at the end

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480
then you give it to them at the end
 

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.539
then you give it to them at the end
after they've completed the course

00:31:12.539 --> 00:31:12.549
after they've completed the course
 

00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:13.430

are just the the special faculty who you

00:33:59.980 --> 00:33:59.990
are just the the special faculty who you
 

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:02.230
are just the the special faculty who you
know had some special abilities and they

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.240
know had some special abilities and they
 

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:05.050
know had some special abilities and they
took to use these techniques in this

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:05.060
took to use these techniques in this
 

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:08.320
took to use these techniques in this
study they had a whole bunch of sections

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:08.330
study they had a whole bunch of sections
 

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:10.330
study they had a whole bunch of sections
and a whole bunch of faculty included

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:10.340
and a whole bunch of faculty included
 

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:12.700
and a whole bunch of faculty included
much of the department and they

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:12.710
much of the department and they
 

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:16.300
much of the department and they
basically just changed how all of them

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:16.310
basically just changed how all of them
 

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:18.910

I say so started out that collected data

00:34:25.450 --> 00:34:25.460
I say so started out that collected data
 

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.700
I say so started out that collected data
on this conceptual mastery over a number

00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:27.710
on this conceptual mastery over a number
 

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:30.850
on this conceptual mastery over a number
of years and this was a different task

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:30.860
of years and this was a different task
 

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.070
of years and this was a different task
but the average faculty member was

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:33.080
but the average faculty member was
 

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.660
but the average faculty member was
getting a bit under point three which

00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:34.670
getting a bit under point three which
 

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:37.270
getting a bit under point three which
again is quite good for a traditional

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:37.280
again is quite good for a traditional
 

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.830
again is quite good for a traditional

lecture approaches as they were using
 

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.380
lecture approaches as they were using
and then they switch to a different

but what this was was you know all the

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:46.910
but what this was was you know all the

students instead of listening to
 

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.760
students instead of listening to
lectures all the students had a set of

lectures all the students had a set of
 

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:56.230
lectures all the students had a set of
of carefully developed by the physics

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240

set of tasks problems that they worked
 

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:05.920
set of tasks problems that they worked
on in small groups and and the faculty

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:05.930
on in small groups and and the faculty
 

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:09.190
on in small groups and and the faculty
were then facilitators as of them

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200
were then facilitators as of them
 

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:13.300
were then facilitators as of them
working together on this and so what

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:13.310
working together on this and so what
 

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:15.220
working together on this and so what
kind of results did they get after all

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:15.230
kind of results did they get after all
 

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:17.830
kind of results did they get after all
the faculty switched to that well so

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:17.840
the faculty switched to that well so
 

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:20.560
the faculty switched to that well so
here's here's the results the learning

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:20.570
here's here's the results the learning
 

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:23.620
here's here's the results the learning
gains now are up here just a factor to

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:23.630
gains now are up here just a factor to
 

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:27.970
gains now are up here just a factor to
be above their previous average and

be above their previous average and
 

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:29.680
be above their previous average and
there's a couple of things also they're

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:29.690
there's a couple of things also they're
 

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:32.020
there's a couple of things also they're
quite striking about this in fact all

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:32.030
quite striking about this in fact all
 

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:34.390
quite striking about this in fact all
the faculty are now the same you see

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400
the faculty are now the same you see
 

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.730
the faculty are now the same you see
variations here but in fact you know

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:36.740
variations here but in fact you know
 

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:38.520

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:51.930
here they're all teaching with
essentially equal effectiveness and this

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:51.940
essentially equal effectiveness and this
 

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:54.870
essentially equal effectiveness and this
again sort of really emphasize the point

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880
again sort of really emphasize the point
 

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.760
again sort of really emphasize the point
that it's really the mental activities

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:56.770
that it's really the mental activities
 

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:59.370
that it's really the mental activities
of the students that affect the learning

00:35:59.370 --> 00:35:59.380
of the students that affect the learning
 

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:01.320
of the students that affect the learning
and because the students in this

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:01.330
and because the students in this
 

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:03.630
and because the students in this
structure are doing much the same kind

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:03.640
structure are doing much the same kind
 

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.280
structure are doing much the same kind
of mental processing they're also

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:05.290
of mental processing they're also
 

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:08.640
of mental processing they're also
achieving much the same learning and it

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:08.650
achieving much the same learning and it
 

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:11.190
achieving much the same learning and it
shows that basically every faculty

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200
shows that basically every faculty
 

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.550
shows that basically every faculty
member can now be highly effective using

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560
member can now be highly effective using
 

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:17.580
member can now be highly effective using
the right teaching practices but it you

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:17.590
the right teaching practices but it you
 

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:20.040
the right teaching practices but it you
know it's this data so it's so really

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:20.050
know it's this data so it's so really
 

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:23.460
know it's this data so it's so really
striking to see you know how much better

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:23.470
striking to see you know how much better
 

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:26.580
striking to see you know how much better
a given faculty can make depending on

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:26.590
a given faculty can make depending on
 

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:29.100
a given faculty can make depending on
what teaching practices they use and I

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:29.110
what teaching practices they use and I
 

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:32.520
what teaching practices they use and I
look at at this particular one here okay

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:32.530
look at at this particular one here okay
 

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:34.950
look at at this particular one here okay
so they were getting down here a little

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960
so they were getting down here a little
 

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.930
so they were getting down here a little
below point one and now they're up at

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:36.940
below point one and now they're up at
 

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:40.350
below point one and now they're up at
point six so so that teach that remember

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:40.360
point six so so that teach that remember
 

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:43.890
point six so so that teach that remember
they just changed their teaching methods

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:43.900
they just changed their teaching methods
 

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:46.170
they just changed their teaching methods
and their students learn to factor six

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:46.180
and their students learn to factor six
 

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:50.040
and their students learn to factor six
more so that's really compelling to me

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:50.050
more so that's really compelling to me
 

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:52.560
more so that's really compelling to me
and I always wonder how university

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:52.570
and I always wonder how university
 

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:54.900
and I always wonder how university
administrators can look at that and say

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:54.910
administrators can look at that and say
 

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:57.450
administrators can look at that and say
well gosh it's okay if our faculty are

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:57.460
well gosh it's okay if our faculty are
 

00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:59.880
well gosh it's okay if our faculty are
using the methods like this you know

00:36:59.880 --> 00:36:59.890
using the methods like this you know
 

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:02.390
using the methods like this you know
it's not our job to make them change so

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400
it's not our job to make them change so
 

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:06.440
it's not our job to make them change so
not to put you on the spot or anything

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:06.450
not to put you on the spot or anything
 

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:10.500
not to put you on the spot or anything
okay those are here's a you know those

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:10.510
okay those are here's a you know those
 

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:14.520
okay those are here's a you know those
are measures of learning and you know

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:14.530
are measures of learning and you know
 

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:16.770
are measures of learning and you know
particular kind of expert learning you

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:16.780
particular kind of expert learning you
 

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:19.590
particular kind of expert learning you
can also look at things like failures

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:19.600
can also look at things like failures
 

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.440
can also look at things like failures
and and dropout rates and here's work

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:22.450
and and dropout rates and here's work
 

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:26.090
and and dropout rates and here's work

and this again involves a number of

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:34.090
and this again involves a number of
 

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:35.580
and this again involves a number of
instructors I think there are five

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:35.590
instructors I think there are five
 

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:37.950

students have clickers they to answer

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:17.840
students have clickers they to answer
 

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.600
students have clickers they to answer
them individually then they have to talk

them individually then they have to talk
 

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:22.240
them individually then they have to talk
in small groups about the question what

in small groups about the question what
 

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:25.080
in small groups about the question what
the answer is and why and three answer

again using clickers and so Beth had

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:28.760
again using clickers and so Beth had

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:00.860
much learning really takes place in the
 

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:03.850
much learning really takes place in the
classroom and how dependent is that on

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:03.860
classroom and how dependent is that on
 

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:05.440
classroom and how dependent is that on
what method

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:05.450
what method
 

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:07.930
what method
of teaching are used in the classroom so

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:07.940
of teaching are used in the classroom so
 

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:10.569
of teaching are used in the classroom so
this study was was quite specifically

00:40:10.569 --> 00:40:10.579
this study was was quite specifically
 

00:40:10.579 --> 00:40:13.530
this study was was quite specifically
designed to focus only on that classroom

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:13.540
designed to focus only on that classroom
 

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:18.069
designed to focus only on that classroom
learning and so it basically then took

00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079
learning and so it basically then took
 

00:40:18.079 --> 00:40:20.800
learning and so it basically then took
there's a giant course that had multiple

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:20.810
there's a giant course that had multiple
 

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:23.400
there's a giant course that had multiple
250 student sections this was the

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:23.410
250 student sections this was the
 

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:25.780
250 student sections this was the
introductory physics for engineering

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:25.790
introductory physics for engineering
 

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:29.440
introductory physics for engineering
students and so now you know this was in

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:29.450
students and so now you know this was in
 

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:32.859
students and so now you know this was in
a great big lecture hall here so just to

00:40:32.859 --> 00:40:32.869
a great big lecture hall here so just to
 

00:40:32.869 --> 00:40:35.020
a great big lecture hall here so just to
show you this isn't just class small

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:35.030
show you this isn't just class small
 

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:38.200
show you this isn't just class small
class kind of things you can do and the

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:38.210
class kind of things you can do and the
 

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:41.230
class kind of things you can do and the
comparison that I mentioned before the

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:41.240
comparison that I mentioned before the
 

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.450
comparison that I mentioned before the
control group was this experienced

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:43.460
control group was this experienced
 

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:46.300
control group was this experienced
faculty member and the experimental

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:46.310
faculty member and the experimental
 

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:49.359
faculty member and the experimental
group was this postdoc trained to use

00:40:49.359 --> 00:40:49.369
group was this postdoc trained to use
 

00:40:49.369 --> 00:40:52.089
group was this postdoc trained to use
these principles and approaches I've

00:40:52.089 --> 00:40:52.099
these principles and approaches I've
 

00:40:52.099 --> 00:40:55.690
these principles and approaches I've
been talking about and said beginning

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:55.700
been talking about and said beginning
 

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:58.390
been talking about and said beginning
had exactly the same set of learning

00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400
had exactly the same set of learning
 

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.760
had exactly the same set of learning
objectives they'd agreed on to be

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:00.770
objectives they'd agreed on to be
 

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:02.589
objectives they'd agreed on to be
covered in the same amount of class time

00:41:02.589 --> 00:41:02.599
covered in the same amount of class time
 

00:41:02.599 --> 00:41:04.450
covered in the same amount of class time
that was also something people haven't

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:04.460
that was also something people haven't
 

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:05.980
that was also something people haven't
been too careful in studying these

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:05.990
been too careful in studying these
 

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:07.839
been too careful in studying these
things and there's a worry you won't be

00:41:07.839 --> 00:41:07.849
things and there's a worry you won't be
 

00:41:07.849 --> 00:41:09.550
things and there's a worry you won't be
able to cover as much material so we

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:09.560
able to cover as much material so we
 

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.740
able to cover as much material so we
made sure they're gonna cover exactly

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:11.750
made sure they're gonna cover exactly
 

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:15.160
made sure they're gonna cover exactly
the same stuff testing on this exam they

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:15.170
the same stuff testing on this exam they
 

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:18.579
the same stuff testing on this exam they
jointly develop and that was given so

00:41:18.579 --> 00:41:18.589
jointly develop and that was given so
 

00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:21.130
jointly develop and that was given so
they this was to be covered in one week

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:21.140
they this was to be covered in one week
 

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:24.069
they this was to be covered in one week
of class periods carefully chosen so

00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079
of class periods carefully chosen so
 

00:41:24.079 --> 00:41:27.309
of class periods carefully chosen so
right after they finished an exam and

00:41:27.309 --> 00:41:27.319
right after they finished an exam and
 

00:41:27.319 --> 00:41:29.620
right after they finished an exam and
and a homework assignment and so we

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:29.630
and a homework assignment and so we
 

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:31.510
and a homework assignment and so we
could be quite confident they weren't

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520
could be quite confident they weren't
 

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.849
could be quite confident they weren't
going to be studying anything outside of

00:41:33.849 --> 00:41:33.859
going to be studying anything outside of
 

00:41:33.859 --> 00:41:35.859
going to be studying anything outside of
class for a while and then right at the

00:41:35.859 --> 00:41:35.869
class for a while and then right at the
 

00:41:35.869 --> 00:41:37.870
class for a while and then right at the
end of the last class given this test

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:37.880
end of the last class given this test
 

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:41.380
end of the last class given this test
okay and so you've already seen the

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:41.390
okay and so you've already seen the
 

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:43.809
okay and so you've already seen the
results but I want to say so what was

00:41:43.809 --> 00:41:43.819
results but I want to say so what was
 

00:41:43.819 --> 00:41:45.940
results but I want to say so what was
what were the principles that this

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:45.950
what were the principles that this
 

00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:48.160
what were the principles that this
postdoc was designing these class

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:48.170
postdoc was designing these class
 

00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:50.950
postdoc was designing these class
activities around well first I'd say

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960
activities around well first I'd say
 

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.670
activities around well first I'd say
there was no pre-prepared lecture

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:54.680
there was no pre-prepared lecture
 

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.329
there was no pre-prepared lecture
material so nothing in which that the

00:41:57.329 --> 00:41:57.339
material so nothing in which that the
 

00:41:57.339 --> 00:41:59.650
material so nothing in which that the
they were prepared to go in and start

00:41:59.650 --> 00:41:59.660
they were prepared to go in and start
 

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:01.920
they were prepared to go in and start
talking to the students there were

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:01.930
talking to the students there were
 

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:05.710
talking to the students there were
pre-prepared lecture tasks and you know

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:05.720
pre-prepared lecture tasks and you know
 

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.010
pre-prepared lecture tasks and you know
for the students to start working on and

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:08.020
for the students to start working on and
 

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:11.020
for the students to start working on and
these built into these tasks were first

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:11.030
these built into these tasks were first
 

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:13.809
these built into these tasks were first
thinking about picking examples and

00:42:13.809 --> 00:42:13.819
thinking about picking examples and
 

00:42:13.819 --> 00:42:16.300
thinking about picking examples and
problems and presentation to motivate

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:16.310
problems and presentation to motivate
 

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:17.990
problems and presentation to motivate
the students to want to learn this

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000
the students to want to learn this
 

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.270
the students to want to learn this
there's lots of research on best ways to

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:20.280
there's lots of research on best ways to
 

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.599
there's lots of research on best ways to
do that

00:42:22.599 --> 00:42:22.609
do that
 

00:42:22.609 --> 00:42:26.089
do that
you know directly looked at what we knew

00:42:26.089 --> 00:42:26.099
you know directly looked at what we knew
 

00:42:26.099 --> 00:42:27.829
you know directly looked at what we knew
about how students thought about this

00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839
about how students thought about this
 

00:42:27.839 --> 00:42:31.550
about how students thought about this
this topic and so yeah tailor and

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:31.560
this topic and so yeah tailor and
 

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.940
this topic and so yeah tailor and
connect up with that confusions they

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:34.950
connect up with that confusions they
 

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:37.819
connect up with that confusions they
might have apply what's known well known

00:42:37.819 --> 00:42:37.829
might have apply what's known well known
 

00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:40.730
might have apply what's known well known
about how the mind works and learning

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:40.740
about how the mind works and learning
 

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.620
about how the mind works and learning
and processing information I'll say a

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:42.630
and processing information I'll say a
 

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:44.180
and processing information I'll say a
little more about that in a minute and

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:44.190
little more about that in a minute and
 

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:46.910
little more about that in a minute and
then finally you know think of the right

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:46.920
then finally you know think of the right
 

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.920
then finally you know think of the right
kinds of questions and problems to have

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:48.930
kinds of questions and problems to have
 

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:52.069
kinds of questions and problems to have
students work on in class and in this

00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079
students work on in class and in this
 

00:42:52.079 --> 00:42:54.079
students work on in class and in this
case they used a mixture above these

00:42:54.079 --> 00:42:54.089
case they used a mixture above these
 

00:42:54.089 --> 00:42:56.150
case they used a mixture above these
type of I talked about before clicker

00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160
type of I talked about before clicker
 

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.069
type of I talked about before clicker
questions that the students answer with

00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079
questions that the students answer with
 

00:42:58.079 --> 00:43:00.079
questions that the students answer with
clickers and talk amongst themselves and

00:43:00.079 --> 00:43:00.089
clickers and talk amongst themselves and
 

00:43:00.089 --> 00:43:02.359
clickers and talk amongst themselves and
some little worksheet activities where

00:43:02.359 --> 00:43:02.369
some little worksheet activities where
 

00:43:02.369 --> 00:43:04.579
some little worksheet activities where
again they work in small groups working

00:43:04.579 --> 00:43:04.589
again they work in small groups working
 

00:43:04.589 --> 00:43:06.500
again they work in small groups working
a front for chief they'd have to write

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:06.510
a front for chief they'd have to write
 

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:10.460
a front for chief they'd have to write
some things out solving stuff and then

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:10.470
some things out solving stuff and then
 

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:14.240
some things out solving stuff and then
this you know focus on making a of

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:14.250
this you know focus on making a of
 

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:16.460
this you know focus on making a of
feedback and the the idea being you know

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:16.470
feedback and the the idea being you know
 

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:18.650
feedback and the the idea being you know
the students get some feedback from

00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:18.660
the students get some feedback from
 

00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:20.180
the students get some feedback from
talking to each other

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:20.190
talking to each other
 

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:23.210
talking to each other
that really helps but he they also to

00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:23.220
that really helps but he they also to
 

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:26.120
that really helps but he they also to
enhance the feedback the instructors

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:26.130
enhance the feedback the instructors
 

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:29.059
enhance the feedback the instructors
busy you know wandering around listening

00:43:29.059 --> 00:43:29.069
busy you know wandering around listening
 

00:43:29.069 --> 00:43:30.980
busy you know wandering around listening
in on those conversations and therefore

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:30.990
in on those conversations and therefore
 

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:33.770
in on those conversations and therefore
getting up even in a 250 student class

00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:33.780
getting up even in a 250 student class
 

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:36.170
getting up even in a 250 student class
you just sampled the groups on the aisle

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:36.180
you just sampled the groups on the aisle
 

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:39.079
you just sampled the groups on the aisle
you're gonna they're quite an accurate

00:43:39.079 --> 00:43:39.089
you're gonna they're quite an accurate
 

00:43:39.089 --> 00:43:41.420
you're gonna they're quite an accurate
view of what things they're confused by

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:41.430
view of what things they're confused by
 

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:43.339
view of what things they're confused by
what they understand and so on and

00:43:43.339 --> 00:43:43.349
what they understand and so on and
 

00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:45.559
what they understand and so on and
therefore you're much better poised to

00:43:45.559 --> 00:43:45.569
therefore you're much better poised to
 

00:43:45.569 --> 00:43:47.900
therefore you're much better poised to
give them effective feedback after

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:47.910
give them effective feedback after
 

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:51.050
give them effective feedback after
they've worked on something so so you

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:51.060
they've worked on something so so you
 

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.089
they've worked on something so so you
know building these tasks with those

00:43:53.089 --> 00:43:53.099
know building these tasks with those
 

00:43:53.099 --> 00:43:56.270
know building these tasks with those
ideas in mind and executing them are

00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:56.280
ideas in mind and executing them are
 

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.870
ideas in mind and executing them are
what gives this kind of differences in

00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880
what gives this kind of differences in
 

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:01.880
what gives this kind of differences in
learning that takes place in the

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:01.890
learning that takes place in the
 

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:04.579
learning that takes place in the
classroom one of the things I like to

00:44:04.579 --> 00:44:04.589
classroom one of the things I like to
 

00:44:04.589 --> 00:44:07.700
classroom one of the things I like to
particularly this shows particularly

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:07.710
particularly this shows particularly
 

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:11.720
particularly this shows particularly
well and I emphasize we it has been seen

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:11.730
well and I emphasize we it has been seen
 

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:15.170
well and I emphasize we it has been seen
in other research but is how this

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:15.180
in other research but is how this
 

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:17.059
in other research but is how this
addresses the question that lots of

00:44:17.059 --> 00:44:17.069
addresses the question that lots of
 

00:44:17.069 --> 00:44:20.870
addresses the question that lots of
people have of know does this kind of

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:20.880
people have of know does this kind of
 

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.359
people have of know does this kind of
teaching just work for the you know the

00:44:23.359 --> 00:44:23.369
teaching just work for the you know the
 

00:44:23.369 --> 00:44:26.030
teaching just work for the you know the
struggling students or does it work for

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.040
struggling students or does it work for
 

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.370
struggling students or does it work for
the the top students as well or vice

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:28.380
the the top students as well or vice
 

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:30.740
the the top students as well or vice
versa and you know this is

00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:30.750
versa and you know this is
 

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:33.500
versa and you know this is
clear that this entire distribution has

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:33.510
clear that this entire distribution has
 

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:36.950
clear that this entire distribution has
moved up dramatically and so this really

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960
moved up dramatically and so this really
 

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.610
moved up dramatically and so this really
makes the case that you know this type

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:40.620
makes the case that you know this type
 

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:43.010
makes the case that you know this type
of teaching is more effective for every

00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:43.020
of teaching is more effective for every
 

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:46.990
of teaching is more effective for every
student who has a human brain which is

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:47.000
student who has a human brain which is
 

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.290
student who has a human brain which is
usually the vast majority and that's

00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:51.300
usually the vast majority and that's
 

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:52.730
usually the vast majority and that's
what the research would say we're not

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:52.740
what the research would say we're not
 

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:54.620
what the research would say we're not
talking about principles that come out

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:54.630
talking about principles that come out
 

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:56.120
talking about principles that come out
of just struggling students we're

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:56.130
of just struggling students we're
 

00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:57.530
of just struggling students we're
talking about principles of how the

00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:57.540
talking about principles of how the
 

00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:00.590
talking about principles of how the
brain learns and why this is effective

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:00.600
brain learns and why this is effective
 

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:03.410
brain learns and why this is effective
I'll just also mentioned for you know a

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:03.420
I'll just also mentioned for you know a
 

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:06.320
I'll just also mentioned for you know a
selling point for faculty not too

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:06.330
selling point for faculty not too
 

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:08.180
selling point for faculty not too
surprising if you think about it we

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:08.190
surprising if you think about it we
 

00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:10.190
surprising if you think about it we
measured engagement in these glasses to

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:10.200
measured engagement in these glasses to
 

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.800
measured engagement in these glasses to
the engagement was dramatically higher

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:12.810
the engagement was dramatically higher
 

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:18.500
the engagement was dramatically higher
in the interactive class okay so I'm

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:18.510
in the interactive class okay so I'm
 

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:22.970
in the interactive class okay so I'm
just gonna wrap up here with finish with

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:22.980
just gonna wrap up here with finish with
 

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:29.120
just gonna wrap up here with finish with
want to give sort of a takeaway to

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:29.130
want to give sort of a takeaway to
 

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:31.910
want to give sort of a takeaway to
faculty who may be not so familiar with

00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920
faculty who may be not so familiar with
 

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:36.080
faculty who may be not so familiar with
these things and and so on some three

00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:36.090
these things and and so on some three
 

00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:39.260
these things and and so on some three
cases that you can mock out and use in

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:39.270
cases that you can mock out and use in
 

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:41.690
cases that you can mock out and use in
your courses tomorrow okay now if you've

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:41.700
your courses tomorrow okay now if you've
 

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.060
your courses tomorrow okay now if you've
been using all this stuff yeah you

00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:44.070
been using all this stuff yeah you
 

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:45.800
been using all this stuff yeah you
probably already have this but I'm

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:45.810
probably already have this but I'm
 

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:48.470
probably already have this but I'm
hoping that some of you you know won't

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480
hoping that some of you you know won't
 

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.630
hoping that some of you you know won't
just walk out and say gee that data is

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640
just walk out and say gee that data is
 

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.190
just walk out and say gee that data is
pretty compelling but of course I don't

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200
pretty compelling but of course I don't
 

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:54.290
pretty compelling but of course I don't
know what to do here's some things you

00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:54.300
know what to do here's some things you
 

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:57.170
know what to do here's some things you
could do okay so I'm gonna give three

00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:57.180
could do okay so I'm gonna give three
 

00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:59.840
could do okay so I'm gonna give three
particular straightforward examples that

00:45:59.840 --> 00:45:59.850
particular straightforward examples that
 

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:02.900
particular straightforward examples that
really embody these basic principles so

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:02.910
really embody these basic principles so
 

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:05.930
really embody these basic principles so
the first is thinking about the homework

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:05.940
the first is thinking about the homework
 

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:09.010
the first is thinking about the homework
and exam problems that you give and and

00:46:09.010 --> 00:46:09.020
and exam problems that you give and and
 

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:11.890
and exam problems that you give and and
what they're doing in terms of giving

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:11.900
what they're doing in terms of giving
 

00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:14.930
what they're doing in terms of giving
practice and assessment of expert

00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:14.940
practice and assessment of expert
 

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:19.100
practice and assessment of expert
thinking okay so right sort of go back

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:19.110
thinking okay so right sort of go back
 

00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:20.840
thinking okay so right sort of go back
and think about here is that here's a

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:20.850
and think about here is that here's a
 

00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:25.600
and think about here is that here's a
sad of some basic really Universal

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:25.610
sad of some basic really Universal
 

00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:28.750
sad of some basic really Universal

model development and use having these

00:47:08.359 --> 00:47:08.369
model development and use having these
 

00:47:08.369 --> 00:47:10.579
model development and use having these

refine and and adopt these into new
 

00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:17.120
refine and and adopt these into new
situations and then finally every field

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:17.130
situations and then finally every field
 

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:19.930
situations and then finally every field
has a particular set of specialized

has a particular set of specialized
 

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:22.640
has a particular set of specialized
representations which experts then you

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:22.650
representations which experts then you
 

00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:25.640
representations which experts then you
move between them and it's a great help

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:25.650
move between them and it's a great help
 

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:27.650
move between them and it's a great help
to understanding and solving problems

00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:27.660
to understanding and solving problems
 

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:30.370
to understanding and solving problems
okay so just that's just a reminder of

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:30.380
okay so just that's just a reminder of
 

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:34.370
okay so just that's just a reminder of
key components of expertise and now I'm

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:34.380
key components of expertise and now I'm
 

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:36.440
key components of expertise and now I'm
going to look at the typical homework

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:36.450
going to look at the typical homework
 

00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:39.319
going to look at the typical homework
problem that it's you know any textbook

00:47:39.319 --> 00:47:39.329
problem that it's you know any textbook
 

00:47:39.329 --> 00:47:41.690
problem that it's you know any textbook
the back of it you know chapter homework

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:41.700
the back of it you know chapter homework
 

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:45.230
the back of it you know chapter homework
problems first they will always provide

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.240
problems first they will always provide
 

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:48.710
problems first they will always provide
all the information needed and only the

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720
all the information needed and only the
 

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:51.020
all the information needed and only the
information needed to solve the problem

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:51.030
information needed to solve the problem
 

00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:53.740
information needed to solve the problem
and if there's approximation

00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:53.750
and if there's approximation
 

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:56.329
and if there's approximation
simplifications you neglect friction or

00:47:56.329 --> 00:47:56.339
simplifications you neglect friction or
 

00:47:56.339 --> 00:47:58.069
simplifications you neglect friction or
air resistance and so on

00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079
air resistance and so on
 

00:47:58.079 --> 00:48:01.040
air resistance and so on
they clearly say that and then you know

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:01.050
they clearly say that and then you know
 

00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:03.200
they clearly say that and then you know
exams all say that so you think about

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:03.210
exams all say that so you think about
 

00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:06.109
exams all say that so you think about
that well okay so that just write down

00:48:06.109 --> 00:48:06.119
that well okay so that just write down
 

00:48:06.119 --> 00:48:08.450
that well okay so that just write down
any opportunity for students to ever

00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:08.460
any opportunity for students to ever
 

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:11.000
any opportunity for students to ever
learn about or you to assess them on

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:11.010
learn about or you to assess them on
 

00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:16.180
learn about or you to assess them on
those particular components of expertise

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:16.190
 

00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:18.470
you know typically they're just supposed

00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480
you know typically they're just supposed
 

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.020
you know typically they're just supposed
to get any answer there's not any

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:20.030
to get any answer there's not any
 

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:23.270
to get any answer there's not any
question requiring justify why that

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280
question requiring justify why that
 

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:24.740
question requiring justify why that
answers reasonable or come up with

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:24.750
answers reasonable or come up with
 

00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:26.990
answers reasonable or come up with
criteria for by that answers reasonable

00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000
criteria for by that answers reasonable
 

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.160
criteria for by that answers reasonable
so that one goes away only calling you

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:31.170

00:48:31.170 --> 00:48:32.660
so that one goes away only calling you
know usually only cover one

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:32.670

and finally the the nature the problems

00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119
and finally the the nature the problems
 

00:48:39.119 --> 00:48:42.069
and finally the the nature the problems
are very often such that a student can

00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079
are very often such that a student can
 

00:48:42.079 --> 00:48:46.010
are very often such that a student can
can really just memorize the procedure

00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:46.020
can really just memorize the procedure
 

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:48.530
can really just memorize the procedure
without any understanding the underlying

00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:48.540
without any understanding the underlying
 

00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:51.800
without any understanding the underlying
model and concepts but because

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:51.810
model and concepts but because
 

00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:55.010
model and concepts but because
they you know they memorize a procedure

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:55.020
they you know they memorize a procedure
 

00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:57.410
they you know they memorize a procedure
and they know this applies to Chapter

00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:57.420
and they know this applies to Chapter
 

00:48:57.420 --> 00:48:59.930
and they know this applies to Chapter
five problems and you immediately just

00:48:59.930 --> 00:48:59.940
five problems and you immediately just
 

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:02.480
five problems and you immediately just
give them Chapter five problems and on

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:02.490
give them Chapter five problems and on
 

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:04.340
give them Chapter five problems and on
the exam all they test them on Chapter

00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:04.350
the exam all they test them on Chapter
 

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:06.110
the exam all they test them on Chapter
five problems you know they can

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:06.120
five problems you know they can
 

00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:08.060
five problems you know they can
recognize these surface features and

00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:08.070
recognize these surface features and
 

00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:10.850
recognize these surface features and
just apply those procedures kind of

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:10.860
just apply those procedures kind of
 

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:13.640
just apply those procedures kind of
mindlessly but quite effectively they do

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:13.650
mindlessly but quite effectively they do
 

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:16.720
mindlessly but quite effectively they do
well in the home on the exams and so on

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:16.730

if they're given a new context they're
 

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:26.330
if they're given a new context they're
completely hopeless at doing anything

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:26.340
completely hopeless at doing anything

different components of expertise so the

00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:33.060
different components of expertise so the
 

00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:35.510
different components of expertise so the
message to you is go back and think

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520
message to you is go back and think
 

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.730
message to you is go back and think
about the homework and exam problems

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:37.740
about the homework and exam problems
 

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:40.160
about the homework and exam problems
you're giving and by the way think about

00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:40.170
you're giving and by the way think about
 

00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:42.260
you're giving and by the way think about
the homework problems first before

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:42.270
the homework problems first before
 

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:44.150
the homework problems first before
putting all these things on the exam

00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160
putting all these things on the exam
 

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.500
putting all these things on the exam
when students have never seen them

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:45.510

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:48.920
when students have never seen them
before okay but of of okay how do you

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:48.930
before okay but of of okay how do you
 

00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:51.470
before okay but of of okay how do you
how do you design better problems that

00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:51.480
how do you design better problems that
 

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:54.860
how do you design better problems that
really embody these elements of

00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:54.870
really embody these elements of
 

00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:56.900
really embody these elements of
expertise because that's going to help

00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:56.910
expertise because that's going to help
 

00:49:56.910 --> 00:50:01.340
expertise because that's going to help
students learn better next thing is is

00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:01.350
students learn better next thing is is
 

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:04.610
students learn better next thing is is
just paying attention to how the memory

00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:04.620
just paying attention to how the memory
 

00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:09.880
just paying attention to how the memory
works in the brain so very quickly the

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:09.890
works in the brain so very quickly the
 

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:13.940
works in the brain so very quickly the
slightly simplified version memory can

00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:13.950
slightly simplified version memory can
 

00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:15.650
slightly simplified version memory can
be thought of as as having two

00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:15.660
be thought of as as having two
 

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:18.230
be thought of as as having two
components there's the the long-term

00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240
components there's the the long-term
 

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:20.090
components there's the the long-term
memory which is what most of us think

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:20.100
memory which is what most of us think
 

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:22.160
memory which is what most of us think
about is memory it has this enormous

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:22.170
about is memory it has this enormous
 

00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:24.830
about is memory it has this enormous
capacity and obviously and you know

00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:24.840
capacity and obviously and you know
 

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:29.090
capacity and obviously and you know
retains things for years decades but

00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:29.100
retains things for years decades but
 

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:31.760
retains things for years decades but
then there's the short-term working

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:31.770
then there's the short-term working
 

00:50:31.770 --> 00:50:34.460
then there's the short-term working
memory this is the sort of way the mind

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:34.470
memory this is the sort of way the mind
 

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:37.130
memory this is the sort of way the mind
works for remembering and processing

00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:37.140
works for remembering and processing
 

00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:39.970
works for remembering and processing
things on short timescales

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:39.980
things on short timescales
 

00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:42.860
things on short timescales
namely things like in a in a classroom

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:42.870
namely things like in a in a classroom
 

00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:46.940
namely things like in a in a classroom
situation and that short-term memory is

cartoon it has a very limited capacity

00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520
cartoon it has a very limited capacity
 

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:56.560
cartoon it has a very limited capacity
and in fact the the research shows it's

00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:56.570
and in fact the the research shows it's
 

00:50:56.570 --> 00:51:00.700
and in fact the the research shows it's
the typical human brain can basically

the typical human brain can basically
 

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:03.950
the typical human brain can basically
remember and process something like five

00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960
remember and process something like five
 

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:04.790
remember and process something like five
to seven

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:04.800

distinct new items where a new item is

00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:08.820
distinct new items where a new item is
 

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:11.270
distinct new items where a new item is
something that's not in long-term memory

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280
something that's not in long-term memory
 

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:16.970
something that's not in long-term memory
and it's also important to realize that

00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:16.980
and it's also important to realize that
 

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:21.440
and it's also important to realize that
that this is not just a memory it's kind

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:21.450
that this is not just a memory it's kind
 

00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:24.050
that this is not just a memory it's kind
of like a CPU that it does it it's if

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:24.060
of like a CPU that it does it it's if
 

00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:26.720
of like a CPU that it does it it's if
you give it more on new items to keep

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:26.730
you give it more on new items to keep
 

00:51:26.730 --> 00:51:28.910
you give it more on new items to keep
track of it bogs down its whole

00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:28.920
track of it bogs down its whole
 

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:30.920
track of it bogs down its whole
processing and so it can't really

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:30.930
processing and so it can't really
 

00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:33.110
processing and so it can't really
process and learn those things as well

00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:33.120
process and learn those things as well
 

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:36.980
process and learn those things as well
and so you know if you think about and

00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:36.990
and so you know if you think about and
 

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:39.620
and so you know if you think about and
if you ever sit onion on a on a lecture

00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:39.630
if you ever sit onion on a on a lecture
 

00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:42.860
if you ever sit onion on a on a lecture
outside your discipline you realize that

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:42.870
outside your discipline you realize that
 

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:45.290
outside your discipline you realize that
this is a tiny number of new things

00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:45.300
this is a tiny number of new things
 

00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:48.170
this is a tiny number of new things
compared to what's presented in a in a

00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:48.180
compared to what's presented in a in a
 

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:51.770
compared to what's presented in a in a
normal science lecture and so anything

00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:51.780
normal science lecture and so anything
 

00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:55.100
normal science lecture and so anything
you can do to reduce these demands on on

00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:55.110
you can do to reduce these demands on on
 

00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:57.500
you can do to reduce these demands on on
working memory will actually help

00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:57.510
working memory will actually help
 

00:51:57.510 --> 00:52:00.440
working memory will actually help
students learn and so you know when you

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:00.450
students learn and so you know when you
 

00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:02.930
students learn and so you know when you
think about that common you know

00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:02.940
think about that common you know
 

00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:05.660
think about that common you know
technical term that you always use it

00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:05.670
technical term that you always use it
 

00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:07.460
technical term that you always use it
makes it easier to talk about you really

00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:07.470
makes it easier to talk about you really
 

00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:09.740
makes it easier to talk about you really
need to be thinking about though is that

00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:09.750
need to be thinking about though is that
 

00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:12.260
need to be thinking about though is that
really you know one-sixth of what I want

00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:12.270
really you know one-sixth of what I want
 

00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:14.090
really you know one-sixth of what I want
students to get from today's class

00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:14.100
students to get from today's class
 

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:17.300

because if it isn't you better leave it

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:17.310
because if it isn't you better leave it
 

00:52:17.310 --> 00:52:19.460

limitations and therefore it doesn't

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:23.490
limitations and therefore it doesn't
 

00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:27.440
limitations and therefore it doesn't
have such significance and so you know

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:27.450
have such significance and so you know
 

00:52:27.450 --> 00:52:29.870
have such significance and so you know
it's also true for that interesting

00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:29.880
it's also true for that interesting
 

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:33.110
it's also true for that interesting
little you know side tidbit or detail

00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:33.120
little you know side tidbit or detail
 

00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:35.210

anything that requires cognitive

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:35.220
anything that requires cognitive
 

00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:38.510
anything that requires cognitive
processing has a real cost in what the

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:38.520
processing has a real cost in what the
 

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:40.820
processing has a real cost in what the
students can learn and so you need to

00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:40.830
students can learn and so you need to
 

00:52:40.830 --> 00:52:43.250
students can learn and so you need to
take that into account the other thing

00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:43.260
take that into account the other thing
 

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:45.500
take that into account the other thing
you can do in this regard that helps a

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:45.510
you can do in this regard that helps a
 

00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:49.850
you can do in this regard that helps a
lot there's many others but if you are

00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:49.860
lot there's many others but if you are
 

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:52.850
lot there's many others but if you are
much more explicit than it's usually

00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:52.860
much more explicit than it's usually
 

00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:56.560

okay so first it's not that important

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:11.510
okay so first it's not that important

that they can actually answer it in fact
 

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:14.740
that they can actually answer it in fact
it might be good if they couldn't

00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:14.750
it might be good if they couldn't
 

00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:16.720
it might be good if they couldn't
there's some reason to believe but it

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:16.730
there's some reason to believe but it
 

00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:17.980
there's some reason to believe but it
just has to be something they can get

00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:17.990
just has to be something they can get
 

00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:20.440
just has to be something they can get
seriously engaged with and if that

00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:20.450
seriously engaged with and if that
 

00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:23.200
seriously engaged with and if that
happens first it gives them a chance to

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:23.210
happens first it gives them a chance to
 

00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:25.839
happens first it gives them a chance to

do you know kind of frees up working
memory they can get from each other some

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:37.730
memory they can get from each other some
 

00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:39.789

immediate feedback you know for the

00:54:39.789 --> 00:54:39.799
immediate feedback you know for the
 

00:54:39.799 --> 00:54:42.549
immediate feedback you know for the
students who have completely lost what

they couldn't remember what mitosis is

00:54:46.359 --> 00:54:46.369
they couldn't remember what mitosis is
 

00:54:46.369 --> 00:54:48.160

now they have an opportunist student

00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:48.170
now they have an opportunist student
 

00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:49.750
now they have an opportunist student
next to them can tell them and then

00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760
next to them can tell them and then
 

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:51.940
next to them can tell them and then
suddenly they think and start to make

00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:51.950
suddenly they think and start to make
 

00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:55.359
suddenly they think and start to make
sense so that's a immediate benefit and

00:54:55.359 --> 00:54:55.369
sense so that's a immediate benefit and
 

00:54:55.369 --> 00:54:58.059
sense so that's a immediate benefit and
you know they're now talking arguing to

00:54:58.059 --> 00:54:58.069
you know they're now talking arguing to
 

00:54:58.069 --> 00:55:00.609
you know they're now talking arguing to
the reasons their brains are processing

00:55:00.609 --> 00:55:00.619
the reasons their brains are processing
 

00:55:00.619 --> 00:55:04.960
the reasons their brains are processing
more but it also turns out that people

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:04.970
more but it also turns out that people
 

00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:08.559
more but it also turns out that people
learn vastly more if they've been primed

00:55:08.559 --> 00:55:08.569
learn vastly more if they've been primed
 

00:55:08.569 --> 00:55:10.960
learn vastly more if they've been primed
to learn so if they've been struggling

00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:10.970
to learn so if they've been struggling
 

00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:13.599
to learn so if they've been struggling
with a question you know and a problem

00:55:13.599 --> 00:55:13.609
with a question you know and a problem
 

00:55:13.609 --> 00:55:15.220
with a question you know and a problem
and then you're going to explain how to

00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:15.230
and then you're going to explain how to
 

00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:18.010
and then you're going to explain how to
do it they learn enormous ly more than

00:55:18.010 --> 00:55:18.020
do it they learn enormous ly more than
 

00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:20.020
do it they learn enormous ly more than
if you give them the explanation before

00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:20.030
if you give them the explanation before
 

00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:21.609
if you give them the explanation before
they ever know what the question or

00:55:21.609 --> 00:55:21.619
they ever know what the question or
 

00:55:21.619 --> 00:55:25.599
they ever know what the question or
problem is there's but finally and the

00:55:25.599 --> 00:55:25.609
problem is there's but finally and the
 

00:55:25.609 --> 00:55:29.109
problem is there's but finally and the
one I want to emphasize the most is that

00:55:29.109 --> 00:55:29.119
one I want to emphasize the most is that
 

00:55:29.119 --> 00:55:31.269
one I want to emphasize the most is that
you get to listen in on those

00:55:31.269 --> 00:55:31.279
you get to listen in on those
 

00:55:31.279 --> 00:55:34.569
you get to listen in on those
conversations and so you'll get so much

00:55:34.569 --> 00:55:34.579
conversations and so you'll get so much
 

00:55:34.579 --> 00:55:37.569
conversations and so you'll get so much
better idea about what they understand

00:55:37.569 --> 00:55:37.579
better idea about what they understand
 

00:55:37.579 --> 00:55:39.460
better idea about what they understand
and therefore what you should follow up

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:39.470
and therefore what you should follow up
 

00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:41.980
and therefore what you should follow up
and talk about than you ever could if

00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:41.990
and talk about than you ever could if
 

00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:44.410
and talk about than you ever could if
you just continued through your lecture

00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:44.420
you just continued through your lecture
 

00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:47.380
you just continued through your lecture
so so you know there's really it's a

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:47.390
so so you know there's really it's a
 

00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:49.269
so so you know there's really it's a
very simple thing to do as a starting

00:55:49.269 --> 00:55:49.279
very simple thing to do as a starting
 

00:55:49.279 --> 00:55:51.069
very simple thing to do as a starting
point and you get a large immediate

00:55:51.069 --> 00:55:51.079
point and you get a large immediate
 

00:55:51.079 --> 00:55:54.609
point and you get a large immediate
penetrates okay so with that I'll just

00:55:54.609 --> 00:55:54.619
penetrates okay so with that I'll just
 

00:55:54.619 --> 00:55:58.059

end here we have a bunch of time for

00:55:58.059 --> 00:55:58.069
end here we have a bunch of time for
 

00:55:58.069 --> 00:56:00.220
end here we have a bunch of time for
questions and discussion and you know

00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:00.230
questions and discussion and you know
 

00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:02.769
questions and discussion and you know
just give you this this vision which I

00:56:02.769 --> 00:56:02.779
just give you this this vision which I
 

00:56:02.779 --> 00:56:05.730
just give you this this vision which I
think the Simon initiative was really a

00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:05.740
think the Simon initiative was really a
 

00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:09.220
think the Simon initiative was really a
perfect match for really thinking about

00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:09.230
perfect match for really thinking about
 

00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:12.730
perfect match for really thinking about
science and engineering teaching and

00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:12.740
science and engineering teaching and
 

00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:14.829
science and engineering teaching and
learning as a science as a research

00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:14.839
learning as a science as a research
 

00:56:14.839 --> 00:56:17.319
learning as a science as a research
discipline and it needs to be you know a

00:56:17.319 --> 00:56:17.329
discipline and it needs to be you know a
 

00:56:17.329 --> 00:56:20.200
discipline and it needs to be you know a
lot you know to make this more like

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:20.210
lot you know to make this more like
 

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:23.589
lot you know to make this more like
astronomy instead of astrology which is

00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:23.599
astronomy instead of astrology which is
 

00:56:23.599 --> 00:56:25.900

well unfortunately much of our teaching

00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:25.910
well unfortunately much of our teaching
 

00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:29.739
well unfortunately much of our teaching
practices have developed and so I'll

00:56:29.739 --> 00:56:29.749
practices have developed and so I'll
 

00:56:29.749 --> 00:56:31.599
practices have developed and so I'll
make sure that slides are available and

00:56:31.599 --> 00:56:31.609
make sure that slides are available and
 

00:56:31.609 --> 00:56:34.289
make sure that slides are available and
here are a bunch of references on

00:56:34.289 --> 00:56:34.299
here are a bunch of references on
 

00:56:34.299 --> 00:56:36.759
here are a bunch of references on
implementation things and learning more

00:56:36.759 --> 00:56:36.769
implementation things and learning more
 

00:56:36.769 --> 00:56:44.339
implementation things and learning more
about this subject so thank you
