for a few seconds before we talk about

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620
for a few seconds before we talk about
 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:27.710

I've seen it in art museums when it's
 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.100
I've seen it in art museums when it's
been on view and there are so many

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110
been on view and there are so many
 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.650
been on view and there are so many
subtleties but one of the assumptions

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660
subtleties but one of the assumptions
 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.389
subtleties but one of the assumptions
that I made not as an art historian but

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
that I made not as an art historian but
 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.790
that I made not as an art historian but
just a viewer of art is that what I was

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800
just a viewer of art is that what I was
 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.950
just a viewer of art is that what I was
looking at on the plate was a piece of

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960
looking at on the plate was a piece of
 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.889
looking at on the plate was a piece of
meat like a piece of ham with an eye in

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899
meat like a piece of ham with an eye in
 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.139
meat like a piece of ham with an eye in
the center and when I first showed at

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149
the center and when I first showed at
 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.700
the center and when I first showed at
one of my classes I said okay who's

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710
one of my classes I said okay who's
 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.770
one of my classes I said okay who's
gonna tell me what they say and someone

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780
gonna tell me what they say and someone
 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.450
gonna tell me what they say and someone
raised his hand and said that's a big

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460
raised his hand and said that's a big
 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.329
raised his hand and said that's a big
old pancake on the plate and I would

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339
old pancake on the plate and I would
 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:57.560
old pancake on the plate and I would
have never considered that it was a

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570
have never considered that it was a
 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.799

it was a pancake and I was so sure that
it was a piece of meat while it might

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170
it was a piece of meat while it might
 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.750
