DAVID PETERSON: Thank
you guys for coming.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.740
My voice usually
doesn't sound like this.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.390
I am really, really sick.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.785
So don't touch me at all.

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:15.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.035
I will infect all of you
with something just awful.

00:00:20.035 --> 00:00:20.660
But it is nice.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.909
I should take advantage of it.

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:25.910
It's very rarely that
I can sing Johnny Cash.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.207
"Because you're mine,
I walk the line."

00:00:30.207 --> 00:00:32.040
Yeah, won't be able to
do that in two weeks.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.640
Anyway, so what
are we doing here.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.140
All right, that's me as
a freshman in college

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.270
at UC Berkeley.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.380
I'm very grateful--
oh thank you.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.520
So there are some Bears
here at this place

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.740
that was founded by
people from Stanford.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.240
That's nice to know.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.990
But that was me.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.500
That was me probably
before classes even

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.420
started when I was a freshman
in college where my search

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.569
engine of choice was,
of course, Alta Vista.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:06.940
I remember when people
first told me about Google,

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.360
and I said why would I ever
use a different search engine?

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.485
Alta Vista is perfect.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.740
It looks like you
guys won that battle.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.240
It's funny.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.960
You should go to
altavista.com now.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.510
It's not the same thing.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.780
Anyway, but I started
creating languages

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.180
when I was a
freshman in college.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.890
I came to college with
the express intention

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.240
of being an English
major in order

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.810
to teach English at
the high school level.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.630
And I eventually did
finish out that major,

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.230
but in addition when I got
there I became fascinated

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.930
with language, and I was
really just blown away

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.640
by how many languages you
could take at Berkeley.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.430
So I took Arabic
my first semester

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.430
because I didn't want to
just really go nuts yet.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.472
It was my first semester.

00:01:53.472 --> 00:01:54.471
I wanted to get my feet.

00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:55.890
But then my second
semester I took

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.400
the second semester of Arabic.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.140
I took the first
semester of Russian.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.650
I took the first
semester of Esperanto,

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.770
which was a student run
class that was pretty cool.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.830
In addition to, I guess
an English major class

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.780
would have been 19th
century literature.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.480
And my first
linguistics class, which

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.630
was just a very basic
introduction to linguistics,

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.130
which I took us a
favor to my mother.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.320
She said I would really,
really like linguistics.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.660
I didn't think I would because
I was always interested

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.020
in learning languages not
in studying them abstractly.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.742
And so my first reaction was why
would you ever do linguistics?

00:02:29.742 --> 00:02:31.200
You don't even
learn the languages.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.510
It seems pointless.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.941
But first of all, it
came along really easily,

00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:36.940
and it was a lot of fun.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.630
It's so much different from
reading novels and writing

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.290
long essays about them.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.230
So it was all of that stuff
that kind of contributed

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.240
to me creating my very
first language in college,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.300
which was terrible.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.841
It was so terrible
I'm not even going

00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:53.840
to show you an example of
it, but just to give you

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.030
an idea of it's terrible-ness,
the name the language was

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.560
Megdavi.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.755
My name is David.

00:02:59.755 --> 00:03:01.505
My girlfriend at the
time was named Megan.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.366
You can fill in the
rest of the blanks.

00:03:06.366 --> 00:03:08.740
Anyway, eventually I found
other language creators online

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.040
because, like most
language creators,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.640
I thought I was the very
first person to do it,

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.639
or, in my case, I thought
I was the first person

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:14.380
to do it for fun.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.100
I'd heard of Esperanto
and its competitors.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.433
I'd never heard of somebody
creating a language for fun,

00:03:18.433 --> 00:03:20.306
despite having heard of Tolkien.

00:03:20.306 --> 00:03:21.680
Had no idea he
created languages.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.860
And being a fan of Star
Trek The Next Generation,

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.720
had no idea Klingon
was a language.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.410
That's just the
way it went for us.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.467
But anyway I went
about with it, and I

00:03:29.467 --> 00:03:32.050
started creating languages, and
I eventually got better at it.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.390
This was, I think, my biggest
and best known language

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.750
before I started creating
languages for television shows.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.600
It's a language called
Kamikawi, and you

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.700
can see this sentence here,
"Oku ke--" what is that?

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.740
Oh boy, my eyes are terrible.
"Oku ke mata ie leya oala

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.605
okuka," which means I never
saw the talking rocking again.

00:03:49.605 --> 00:03:50.980
So if you ever
wanted to know how

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.720
to say that that's
how you do it.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.410
Anyway, I kept on with
linguistics of course,

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.462
and so I really started to learn
more and more about languages.

00:04:01.462 --> 00:04:03.420
These were three of the
most influential people

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.461
in my linguistics career.

00:04:04.461 --> 00:04:06.130
One on the left
there is somebody

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.600
you might be able to recognize.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.558
That's John McWhorter,
and he's kind of famous.

00:04:09.558 --> 00:04:11.100
He's been on the
"Colbert Report,"

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.390
so that means he's famous.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.750
He taught a class on
Pidgin and Creole languages

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.427
which just totally blew my mind.

00:04:18.427 --> 00:04:20.760
And then when I went to
graduate school at UC San Diego,

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.385
the middle fellow is
Farrell Ackermann,

00:04:22.385 --> 00:04:25.190
and he just completely
blew my mind again

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.220
once I realized
that you don't have

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.510
to analyze a language in terms
of morphemes for those of you

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.640
who are linguists in here.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.440
You don't.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.340
It's a theoretical construct,
and it's a bad one.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.080
I'm just going to
say that on YouTube.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.670
Don't do morphemes.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.602
It's just a mistake.

00:04:41.602 --> 00:04:43.060
It'll lead you down
the wrong path,

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.840
and it leads to bad
created languages.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.340
But anyway, so Farrell.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.840
The next person I
have never match.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.140
That's Joan Bybee,
but I read her book

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.710
"The Evolution of
Grammar," which

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.752
was my third big huge revelation
for language that completely

00:04:56.752 --> 00:04:59.210
blew my mind, and that kind of
took me to where I am today.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.140
I wanted to meet her.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.240
I was in Albuquerque once--
she's at New Mexico--

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.480
and I sent her an email saying,
hey, I'm a language creator.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.730
I worked on "Game of Thrones."

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.455
I'm a really, really,
really big fan.

00:05:10.455 --> 00:05:11.955
I was wondering if
I could meet you,

00:05:11.955 --> 00:05:13.330
and she said,
well, I'm not going

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.540
to be on campus
while you're here,

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.944
but it's nice to know you.

00:05:18.944 --> 00:05:19.610
And that was it.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.220
But that's all right, because
she is an absolute genius,

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.320
so she can do
whatever she wants.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.040
Anyway, so they
really kind of shaped

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.600
my linguistic understanding,
my formal understanding

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.120
of language.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.120
And then some of these
folks-- these are just

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.380
some of the people who
really influenced me

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.390
as a language creator.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.111
Oh by the way, I was
a freshman in 2000,

00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:40.360
so I guess I've been doing
this for like 14 years now,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.540
almost 15.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.750
But these are some of
the language creators

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.694
I knew who, when
I finally got out

00:05:46.694 --> 00:05:49.110
of my phase of thinking I was
the only person who did this

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.290
and was therefor
the best at it--

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.924
once I started seeing
some of the work

00:05:52.924 --> 00:05:55.090
that some of these people
had done, I was like, wow,

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.580
I am really terrible and
I've got a lot to learn,

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.530
and I learned a
whole lot from them.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.220
You might know a
few of those names.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.230
Like John Quijada's
language was profiled

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:08.610
in a story in "The New Yorker,"
because his language was taken

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:14.090
up by what turned out to
be Russian terrorists.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.310
It's absolutely true.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.640
It's a fascinating story.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.920
Sally Caves wrote an episode
of "Star Trek The Next

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.440
Generation."

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.650
She wrote the episode
"Hollow Pursuits" that

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.132
introduces the
character Barclay,

00:06:24.132 --> 00:06:25.590
and she's had a
language she's been

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:26.714
working on her entire life.

00:06:26.714 --> 00:06:28.550
Anyway, these are really
outstanding people

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.480
that took me over
the hump and helped

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.370
me realize that I
had a lot to learn.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.590
And I've done a fair bit.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.320
Anyway so the reason
people probably

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.830
know me is because of my
work on "Game of Thrones."

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:41.760
That's my kitty.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.970
She has such a lovely face.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.360
She's a nice kitty.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.480
Very nice kitty.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.820
She meows very loudly.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.940
Anyway, so I started
working on "Game of Thrones"

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.400
as a show based on these books
written by George RR Martin.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.600
The first language I
created for it was Dothraki.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.700
I wanted to create High
Valerian and a variant of I

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.310
call Low Valerian.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.730
And there's a new
language coming

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.420
that I can't say anything about.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.920
But anyway, what I
thought I would do today

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.840
is teach you
something about what

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.930
it's like to create a language.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.610
I was insanely proud of this.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.640
Look at that chalkboard.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.732
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:22.732 --> 00:07:23.440
That's hilarious.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.485
And of course I used Comic Sans.

00:07:25.485 --> 00:07:26.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:27.800
Why wouldn't you?

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.910
Anyway, I thought what I
would do is, since the book

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.840
that I did, "Living
Language Dothraki"

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.540
just came out, I
thought I would go over

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.880
some steps about creating
a language using Dothraki

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.414
as a model, which is different
from when you're sitting down

00:07:45.414 --> 00:07:47.330
and creating a brand new
language just totally

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.639
on your own, and you'll see
why, but it's kind of a way in.

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:53.180
So if you're creating your first
language, what might you do?

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.410
Well, the very first thing that
a language needs is a purpose.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.680
And this is insanely
important, and I

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.720
think that it does not get
enough credit, because you

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.030
can sit down to create a
language for any reason.

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:07.930
But you need to know
what that reason is,

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.330
and if you don't,
you're undoubtedly

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.130
going to have a
language that tries

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:13.730
to fulfill a bunch
of different goals.

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.080
For example, maybe you do
some things in the language

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.304
just because you like it.

00:08:17.304 --> 00:08:18.970
Then you do other
things in the language

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:20.719
because you think
that's the way languages

00:08:20.719 --> 00:08:22.110
work even if you don't like it.

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:23.596
And then maybe you
do other things

00:08:23.596 --> 00:08:25.470
because, well, I want
it to be easy to learn.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.640
Then you do other things just
because you think they're neat.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.264
And so it ends up
being a language that

00:08:29.264 --> 00:08:31.290
serves a whole bunch
of different masters

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:35.484
and ends up being a disaster,
kind of like my first language.

00:08:35.484 --> 00:08:36.150
Don't Google it.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:36.669
Well, Google it.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:38.960
I wrote an essay about how
my first language was so bad

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.240
and why.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.830
So if you Google Megdavi,
you should find it.

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:47.030
But anyway, with
Dothraki I guess

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:50.590
I always ask this question when
I'm working for any show, which

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:54.470
is basically are the speakers
of this language approximately

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:55.276
humanoid?

00:08:55.276 --> 00:08:56.900
So with the Dothraki,
of course they're

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.025
supposed to just be humans.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.950
But like with other shows I work
on, for example, "Defiance."

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.520
They're a bunch of aliens, but
they're really, really kind

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.389
of human-y aliens.

00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:10.180
Same with some of the
other shows I worked,

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.360
like "Star-Crossed."

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.530
They're human in the
most important ways.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:19.110
For example, they have
to get together in order

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.060
to produce children,
and they have

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.060
some sort of vested
interest in rearing them.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.972
They have the same
kind of speech organs.

00:09:26.972 --> 00:09:27.680
Things like that.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.530
It's like if those
are all true, it's

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:31.029
like, yeah, they're
basically human.

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:33.280
So anyway, if the speakers
are basically humanoid,

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:37.120
then they deserve a language
that is basically human.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.560
And the things the kind of make
our languages human are not,

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.460
for example, you
sit down and say

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.430
I'm going to throw in a language
and it's going to have nothing

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:45.180
but clicks in it.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.281
Or it's going to have
20 different pronouns.

00:09:48.281 --> 00:09:50.030
No, that's not the way
our languages work.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:53.850
Our languages are basically
evolved steadily over time,

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:56.210
and they're kind of like the
least common denominator.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.670
I mean you can do really
interesting things in English

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.670
if you want, but if nobody
else understands you,

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:03.130
then it's not-- that
little facet you've created

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:04.920
isn't going to pass on.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.107
Kind of like how I pronounced
both with an L. I always have.

00:10:09.107 --> 00:10:10.940
I don't think that's
something that's really

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.566
going to-- anybody else do that?

00:10:13.566 --> 00:10:14.190
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:15.023
DAVID PETERSON: Yay.

00:10:15.023 --> 00:10:16.280
Right on.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.340
There's two of us.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.260
Pretty soon you'll be doing it.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.800
Or even if you won't,
your children will be.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.636
We'll get to them, and then
we'll spell it B, O, L, T,

00:10:26.636 --> 00:10:28.010
H-- the way it
should be spelled.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.400
So yeah, when you sit
down to create a language,

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.180
if they're human, the
language should be human.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:41.160
But of course, I discovered
working for television series,

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.210
there are other factors
that come into play.

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:49.500
So for example, when I did my
Dothraki proposal-- and the way

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.345
it worked it was a
competitive process,

00:10:51.345 --> 00:10:53.220
so there were like 30
other language creators

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.890
that were competing
for that job.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:11:00.240
And so what I ended up doing--
because the application was

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.710
interesting in
that it didn't put

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.640
a cap on the amount of
material you could present,

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.650
which meant that
it was a Cold War.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.300
I decided I'm going
to do two things.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.800
One, I'm going to overwhelm the
producers with more material

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.008
and than they could possibly
sift through, and I did.

00:11:13.008 --> 00:11:15.400
By the time I gave them
my final proposal--

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.150
I had like a month and
a half to do this--

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:20.670
I had over 300
pages of material.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.470
I though I'm going
to make it look

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:26.226
as complex and
linguistic-y as possible,

00:11:26.226 --> 00:11:27.850
so they'll just look
at it and go whoa.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.140
That's huge and enormous.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.380
I can't even comprehend that.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.150
Then what I'll do
is I'll give them

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:37.710
one page of material that's
called Dothraki fun facts,

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:40.490
and it'll just have some of
these things about the language

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:44.130
that are totally-- the things
that people don't really

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:46.710
know a lot about language
want to hear about language.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.920
So this is one of
those factoids that I

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.250
put on this one page thing.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.060
So did you know
the Dothraki have

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.060
four different words for carry,
three different words for push,

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.893
three different words
for pull, and at least

00:11:56.893 --> 00:12:01.180
eight different words for horse,
but no word which means please.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.300
It's like whatever.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:03.675
It's true.

00:12:03.675 --> 00:12:06.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.690
It's not necessarily
that interesting,

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.450
but I thought it
would be something

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:12.420
that they would
really latch onto.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.420
So at this time I had
seen an early version

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.210
of the pilot, which
was very different.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:20.470
And then what happened later
on when I was doing translation

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:22.890
and I saw there was a
new version of pilot,

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:26.360
suddenly there was this new
scene that was added where

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.350
Emelia Clark turns to Iain Glen
and says what's the Dothraki

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:31.450
word for thank you?

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:34.940
And then Jorah turns to
her and says in Dothraki

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:38.180
there is no work for thank you.

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.330
As it happened, there was.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:41.816
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:41.816 --> 00:12:43.190
This is just a
little screen shot

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:44.955
of an early version
of the dictionary--

00:12:44.955 --> 00:12:47.780
the English to Dothraki side
of the dictionary that I had--

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:51.725
and I've highlighted there the
Dothraki word for thank you.

00:12:51.725 --> 00:12:53.350
And then of course
the next thing I did

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:57.070
was just hit the Delete button,
because of course when you're

00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.630
working for a television show,
you have masters above you.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.420
You're not exactly
the one who calls

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.670
all the shots in the language.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.360
So now Dothraki absolutely
has no word for thank you.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.190
That word sannacho
doesn't exist.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:09.600
It does not exist in a language.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.710
It's gone.

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:12.590
All right, next.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.090
So once you've got
your purpose down

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:15.870
and you know exactly why
you're creating this language,

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.240
the next thing you do is
create the sound system,

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.860
basically how you say stuff.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.780
So the boring version is this.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:26.540
This the phonology of Dothraki,
and the linguists in the room

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.300
will see that and know
kind of what it is.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.700
Phonologies kind of arrange
themselves in this way,

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.380
but that was the endpoint.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.360
So what I had to start to do
was-- usually it's up to you

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.370
to decide how you want
it to be pronounced,

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.300
but what I had to do was there
were a whole bunch of words

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.822
in the books that
were already existing.

00:13:43.822 --> 00:13:45.780
And one of the goals not
only for the producers

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.405
but also for myself-- because I
know how big George RR Martin's

00:13:48.405 --> 00:13:51.100
fan base is, even before
"Game of Thrones."

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.880
I know it's enormous,
but before it was big.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.052
I wanted to basically
take everything

00:13:58.052 --> 00:13:59.510
that was in the
books and make sure

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:01.510
that it was still
grammatical and worked

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.520
when I'd finished the language.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.820
I thought it would have been a
really unfortunate thing if I

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.830
saw it was in the books
and say, yeah, yeah.

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:10.329
I get what you're
trying to do here.

00:14:10.329 --> 00:14:11.640
Now here's the real Dothraki.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.440
No, no, no.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.410
That's just silly.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.960
So I started off
kind of like this.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.147
Here's some words
that are in the books.

00:14:18.147 --> 00:14:19.730
And depending on how
you analyze this,

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.660
whether you analyze these
things as consonant clusters,

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:24.860
or single consonants,
or digraphs--

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:26.820
I analyze them as digraphs.

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.660
These actually all have
the same structure.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.710
They're all consonant
vowel consonant.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:32.870
So K, H is khuh.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.890
S, H is shuh.

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.930
And then what's
spelled J I ended up

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.080
doing as an affricate juh.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.300
Seemed to make sense.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.820
So they all have that structure.

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:47.254
What that means is that if there
are words that have that shape,

00:14:47.254 --> 00:14:49.420
they're going to be more
words that have that shape.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.236
So then that was kind
of like the place

00:14:51.236 --> 00:14:52.860
where I first started,
so it's like OK.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.068
We've got this shape, so
let's create some more words

00:14:55.068 --> 00:14:57.860
that of that same shape
using the same phonology.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.840
So those are words
that I created

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.905
that weren't in the books that
still have the same CVC shape.

00:15:03.905 --> 00:15:05.530
And then of course
there are more words

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:08.071
in the books that have a whole
bunch of different structures,

00:15:08.071 --> 00:15:10.220
and so I did the same
process to figure out

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:14.390
what the phonotactics would have
to be to accommodate everything

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.070
that was in the books, and then
what further I could with that.

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:20.730
I ended up with the structure
the kind of looks like this.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.680
It doesn't quite work,
but I was having problems

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:29.200
because if you do
parentheses C parentheses,

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.140
it really wants to turn it
into the copyright symbol.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:36.969
But the idea is that
you have your consonant

00:15:36.969 --> 00:15:38.510
and then you have
a very small number

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:40.829
of consonants that can
follow it, a vowel,

00:15:40.829 --> 00:15:42.870
and the vowel is the only
things that's required.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.070
You can actually have
several vowels in a row.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.150
And then a syllable can end
with a single consonant,

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:50.990
or a word can end with two,
but a word internal syllable

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:52.420
can't end with two constants.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.080
It's pretty simple.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.519
It makes sense.

00:15:57.519 --> 00:15:59.310
Kind of-- no, it's not
like Turkish at all.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:00.970
Never mind.

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:02.050
No it's not.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:03.800
And then it was up to
me to kind of figure

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.650
out the intonational
patterns, which was fun.

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:10.320
Next though is you get to the
larger part of the grammar.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:15.120
Obviously this can be an
entire book or series of talks,

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.810
but I'm just going to
try to do it quickly.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.650
Especially for those non
linguists in the room.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.940
Grammar exists
basically whenever

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.550
you have two words that
come next to one another

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:28.550
and there's a meaning.

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.060
Then there is grammar.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.880
So for example,
this, that's a kitty.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.460
That's the word for cat.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.140
And this is what a
phone looks like.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:37.681
We all recognize
that that's a phone.

00:16:37.681 --> 00:16:39.150
That's a modern phone.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:43.780
So the question is this,
what is a cat phone?

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.320
Feel free to shout out.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.494
What would a cat phone be?

00:16:46.494 --> 00:16:47.916
AUDIENCE: Phone
shaped like a cat.

00:16:47.916 --> 00:16:48.610
DAVID PETERSON: There you go.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.220
Phone shaped like
a cat, basically.

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.160
Or like a phone
that was made out

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.773
of a cat in a really
scary taxidermy way.

00:16:54.773 --> 00:16:58.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.920
It's like, how do we know that?

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:00.940
We know that as
English speakers.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.030
That's intuitive to us.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:04.778
We have this idea that the
first part modifies the second

00:17:04.778 --> 00:17:06.069
even though they're both nouns.

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:09.369
But notice that I didn't present
you that term in a neutral way.

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:12.300
I actually said
this, "CAT phone."

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:16.010
I didn't say "cat phone?"

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:19.200
So there's a difference
between, for example,

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.099
listing those two words next to
each other saying I have a cat,

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:26.140
I have a phone, and I have
a board game, where you just

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.640
have this kind of
neutral intonation

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.660
and saying a "cat phone."

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.820
That too is grammar.

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:34.780
So in other words, everything
that comes into that pairing

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.850
is something that you
have to determine.

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:39.080
That's also why, by the
way, in English a cat phone

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.770
is different from the phone cat.

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:42.779
What do you think a
phone cat would be?

00:17:42.779 --> 00:17:45.100
AUDIENCE: Cat that
operates the phone.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.852
DAVID PETERSON:
Yeah, I think so.

00:17:46.852 --> 00:17:48.310
Like if you're
working at a company

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:51.460
and you had a cat that
answered your phones for you.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.710
That would be the phone cat.

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:53.872
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:53.872 --> 00:17:55.330
Yeah, as opposed
to the kitchen cat

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:56.621
which makes your meals for you.

00:17:56.621 --> 00:17:59.990
This sounds like a
wonderful place to work.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.961
That'd be awesome.

00:18:00.961 --> 00:18:02.960
And then of course, there
would be the boss cat,

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.100
wears the little tie.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.150
I need those memos.

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:08.320
Also my wet food.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:14.990
Anyway, with Dothraki
if you're a typologist,

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:17.730
this is how Dothraki
types basically.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.660
So the word order is
subject verb object.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.260
And then you'll notice if
you-- and then also determiners

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:24.270
proceed nouns.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.340
So if you subscribe to
the determiner theory

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.340
that determiners are
heads and phrases,

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.792
then you'll notice that heads
all line up on the left,

00:18:32.792 --> 00:18:34.250
so this is a head
initial language,

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:35.770
a strongly head
initial language,

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:37.770
and you'll see comes
before the object.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.000
So strongly head initial.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.930
But again, this
wasn't something that

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:44.170
was completely up
to me to decide.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.820
And by the way, this concept
that basically whenever

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.920
two words come together,
come next to each other,

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:49.480
it means something.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.050
That's a really hard concept
for a lot of non language people

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:54.570
to grasp, because when
I'm working with writers

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.320
on various shows,
they'll often say, well,

00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:00.460
I'll just create some made
a term for whatever this is.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.820
I'm like no, don't do that.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.080
Look, it's a made up language.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.010
I don't care.

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:05.750
And I'm like, no.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:08.322
You just broke the entire
grammar of the language.

00:19:08.322 --> 00:19:09.280
Don't you realize that?

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.060
And they go, no.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.575
I really don't care.

00:19:11.575 --> 00:19:13.970
Anyway, I mean other
shows. "Game of Thrones"

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:16.030
is actually outstanding.

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.430
And they let me
really kind of control

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:20.730
it, which is just wonderful.

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:21.650
I love them for it.

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:26.900
But anyway, so
when I was creating

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.540
the grammar of Dothraki, I
actually had constraints.

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.630
The big overall
constraint that I

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.340
was going to use
George RR Martin's

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.485
text as the primary document.

00:19:35.485 --> 00:19:37.860
And there are places where
words come next to one another

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:38.651
and mean something.

00:19:38.651 --> 00:19:41.430
So this is how I
basically determined it.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.440
This a direct quote
from the book.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.235
You have the crones
chanting "'Rakh Rakh!

00:19:47.235 --> 00:19:48.900
Rakh haj!' they proclaimed.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.970
A boy, a boy, strong
boy," where that's

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:53.020
supposed to be the translation.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:57.340
Obviously you see there are
three words that are repeated

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.630
and one word that is new.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.900
So then this pretty
much-- I mean

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.880
you could try to do some
sort of other funky analysis,

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.370
but this is the simplest one.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.440
This is the most
obvious analysis.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.400
And so if you have that,
then it's like all right.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.090
If that's supposed
to be a strong boy,

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:15.610
you see the adjective
coming after the noun.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:17.471
So this was, I think,
the first example

00:20:17.471 --> 00:20:18.720
I ever looked at in the books.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.335
And i thought, well,
that's pretty cool.

00:20:21.335 --> 00:20:23.710
George RR Martin always says,
oh, I'm not a language guy.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:24.543
I don't do anything.

00:20:24.543 --> 00:20:25.830
But this is interesting.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:26.880
This is interesting.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.840
It's not English.

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.065
You expect the reverse order.

00:20:30.065 --> 00:20:31.440
And furthermore,
also notice what

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.051
I didn't highlight--
the words "a" there.

00:20:35.051 --> 00:20:37.050
Usually if somebody really
doesn't know anything

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:38.674
about language, they
just do all right,

00:20:38.674 --> 00:20:41.250
let's do English and one word
for every single word here.

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:44.060
But no, you see that
there's no articles here.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:44.870
That's interesting.

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:46.315
That's really,
really interesting.

00:20:46.315 --> 00:20:48.523
So anyway, then the next
question becomes, all right,

00:20:48.523 --> 00:20:50.341
if this is the order
that we see for this,

00:20:50.341 --> 00:20:51.340
how well does it cohere?

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.930
It actually coheres
very, very well.

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:58.430
So this is an epithet
that the Dothraki

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:01.080
use for Viserys,
"The Cart King."

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:04.130
And we know that khal is
basically the work for king.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:05.130
It's the word for chief.

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:05.965
We know that.

00:21:05.965 --> 00:21:07.310
That was given to us.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:09.340
So then the other
word has to be cart,

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:12.270
and so we see an interesting
noun noun juxtaposition

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:14.950
where obviously one is a
modifier, one is the head,

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:16.620
and the modifier
comes afterwards.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.460
So that is incredible.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.570
We also have this one, which
is another epithet for Viserys,

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:23.040
"The Sorefoot King."

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.000
And so we see khal there
again coming first,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.230
and so we determine
that this is probably

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:30.570
the order of these two things.

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:33.040
If we're following,
so rhae is probably

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.810
foot and mhar is probably sore.

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:38.210
And I did end up determining,
by the way, those H's, I

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:39.180
thought, well, it's pronounced.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.740
I wanted to make
sure that everything

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.698
that was in the books--
it was like, all right,

00:21:42.698 --> 00:21:45.170
let's treat that like
the letter of the law.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:49.400
So that's how Dothraki ended
up with H's coming M's and N's.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.290
I really sorry for
the actors about that.

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:52.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.480
Especially, the
worst word is this.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.710
So one of the words he
created was R, H, A, E, S, H,

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:01.280
rhaesh, which means land.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:05.530
And so then I decided, well, how
would we do the word for world

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:06.660
if we needed.

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:10.560
I said well how about
a collective suffix

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.450
on the word for land which
means a collection of land, so

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:16.590
the word for world
is rhaesheser,

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:19.450
but if you put that into
the accusative, which

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:21.770
is to make it the
object of a verb,

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:24.820
it adds an S suffix on the end.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:26.210
And if you think
about the phrase

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:28.340
"the stallion who
mounts the world,"

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:31.060
the world is of course
in the accusative there,

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:35.580
so it's vezh fin saja.

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.686
And then the word for the
world in the accusative

00:22:38.686 --> 00:22:44.270
becomes rahaesheseres, which
is just an awful, awful word.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:45.790
I felt so sorry
for the actors that

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:47.457
had to pronounce that
awful, awful word.

00:22:47.457 --> 00:22:49.540
If I could take that one
back, I'd say no, no, no.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.740
I'll just create a
different word for world.

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.800
I thought the etymology
was kind of cool,

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.785
but that is just a
mess to pronounce.

00:22:55.785 --> 00:22:56.660
All right, moving on.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:01.510
So this was the-- I guess
there were two full sentences,

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.292
but this was the longest one--
"Khalakka dothrae mr'anha."

00:23:04.292 --> 00:23:06.250
The was the longest one
in the book-- "a prince

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:09.670
rides inside me." so if
you have khal means king,

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:12.210
it's pretty obvious that
that's going to be prince.

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:15.590
So you see some evidence
there of derivation.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:17.700
And we have Dothraki.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.859
Of course, they're
the riders, so it's

00:23:19.859 --> 00:23:21.400
like this is probably
rides, and that

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.080
would mean that this
would be "inside me."

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.996
And usually the part
that gets kind of shunted

00:23:24.996 --> 00:23:27.750
off is the adposition,
so I figured

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:31.520
this was adposition
followed by pronoun,

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.240
and that's how we did that.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:36.070
There's another sentence,
"the prince is riding."

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:38.300
They say the prince is
riding, "Khalakka dothrae!"

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:40.997
So that made this
pretty abundantly clear.

00:23:40.997 --> 00:23:43.330
Again, you could probably
analyze it in a different way,

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:46.440
but this seemed like the easiest
and most obvious way to do it,

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:51.050
and so I thought I should
stick with it for the fans.

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:53.540
Anyway, so then
of course you see

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.410
all these words
occur in the books.

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:57.370
So it's evidence of
a couple of things.

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:59.230
First, Dothraki
is going suffix-y.

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:03.450
And second there's going to be
things like verb conjugation.

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:07.140
And so I thought it was pretty
uncontroversial to then have

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.140
conjugated verbs.

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:11.650
I had them agree with the
nouns in person and number

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:15.680
and also had these
suffixes for derivation.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.415
The names turned out
to be pretty simple.

00:24:18.415 --> 00:24:20.540
There are only two female
names in the entire book.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:21.480
They're on the right.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:26.690
The others are male names,
and you can see the pattern.

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:28.590
It's pretty obvious
what's going on there.

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:32.140
So that was kind of got for me.

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.990
But then beyond that, once
I'd figured everything out,

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:37.250
everything else
was up to me to do.

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:39.240
So like with the
pronouns, for example,

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.070
that's the one that we got.

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.290
Everything else I
was just creating.

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:46.790
Again, that pronoun
comes from there.

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:48.770
Though if I had to
do it over, I would

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:50.610
have made that pronoun
non-nominative.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:52.940
I was going to,
but then I forgot.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:55.285
I did that a lot.

00:24:55.285 --> 00:24:57.660
But I think probably the most
controversial thing-- well,

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:58.285
I don't know if
it's controversial.

00:24:58.285 --> 00:25:00.350
The most controversial
I did with Dothraki

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:05.910
was add noun case to the nouns,
because I love noun case.

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:09.380
And it wasn't going
to have articles,

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:12.915
which I am a big fan of, because
I hate articles in any context.

00:25:12.915 --> 00:25:13.790
I hate creating them.

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:15.737
I hate learning languages
that have articles.

00:25:15.737 --> 00:25:17.570
Articles never work the
same in one language

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:18.610
as they do in the
other no matter

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:19.818
how closely they are related.

00:25:19.818 --> 00:25:21.470
I hate them.

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:25.417
Anyway, so these are the
old noun cases of Dothraki

00:25:25.417 --> 00:25:26.750
where there's just five of them.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:28.700
I thought they were
there were pretty easy.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.380
And for those, again,
non-language people, this

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:32.410
is how noun case works.

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:33.800
All right, this is English.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.540
We say, "I saw him."

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.459
You don't say, "Me saw he."

00:25:37.459 --> 00:25:38.500
That's what noun case is.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:39.680
That's all noun case is.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.170
You change the form
of the noun or pronoun

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:46.186
depending on what role
it plays in the sentence.

00:25:46.186 --> 00:25:48.060
And you don't do it for
any other reason then

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:50.800
that's the way it's
just supposed to work.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.680
No English speaker
would ever say that,

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:57.354
unless they were trying to
imitate caveman language maybe.

00:25:57.354 --> 00:25:59.770
So in Dothraki, for example,
the exact translation of that

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:04.699
is "Anha tih mae," and then the
other one is to "Me tih anna."

00:26:04.699 --> 00:26:06.990
So you can see there's the
same kind of change going on

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:08.560
with the pronouns.

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.750
But with a greater
variety of cases

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.620
than just basically
nominative and non-nominative,

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:17.400
you can do other things
with it that kind of

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.500
economize the language.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.660
So in English, we have
to use a lot of articles

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.280
and prepositions to do things.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:27.570
So here's the usual nominative,
"Kemis rikha," "The dried fig

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:28.620
is foul."

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.840
And that second word is
the entire verb "is foul."

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.840
So that's what our
word looks like when

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.670
it's just a subject
of the sentence.

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:41.307
Now here's it doing something
else, "Anha dothrak kemisaan,"

00:26:41.307 --> 00:26:42.390
"I ride to the dried fig."

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:44.090
I use the same
word over and over

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:46.470
again so that you'll be
able to recognize it.

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:50.260
And "Anha dothrak kemisoon," "I
ride away from the dried fig."

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:52.840
That's the canonical
usage for those two cases.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:54.482
So you just add the
suffix on there,

00:26:54.482 --> 00:26:55.940
and that's what
that means, and you

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.710
have to have a bunch
of other words.

00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:59.890
It makes it a little
more economical.

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:02.257
But you can also do other
things with these cases,

00:27:02.257 --> 00:27:03.840
and that's what makes
them really fun.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:08.140
So for example, "lenta kemisoon"
is "the stem of the dried fig,"

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:12.140
and use that specific case,
the away from case, in order

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:15.850
to talk about things that
are inalienably possessed.

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:19.160
So my hand, "qora m'anhoon."

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.880
It's the hand from me.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.290
And then use the other
case to talk about things

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:24.960
that you don't
possess intuitively.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.160
Like this is the
dried fig's steed,

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:31.470
"sajo kemisi," because he owns
a horse that he gets around on.

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:32.860
All right?

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.830
And then you can do
other fun things with it.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:38.730
So this is kemis is just
a regular object. "Anha

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:41.670
risse kemis," "I sliced
the dried fig in half."

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:42.960
I sliced it in two.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.520
But you also do,
"Anha risse kemisaan,"

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.739
"I cut into the dried fig."

00:27:46.739 --> 00:27:48.530
So maybe you didn't go
all the way through.

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:50.830
You just gave it a little
slice, gave it a sniff,

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:52.060
and realized, oh, it's a fig.

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:53.860
I'm going toss this aside.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:55.730
I'm not eating that.

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:57.240
Then we have a
separate sentence.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.910
"Anha nivak" means I frowned.

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:05.440
You can use cases along with
verbs to create new verbs.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:09.500
So "Anha nivak kemisaan" is "I
disapprove of the dried fig.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.570
It's like I frowned
towards the dried fig,

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:14.195
and now that's the
word for disapprove.

00:28:14.195 --> 00:28:16.930
And that's just how it works.

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:18.440
Let's see another one.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.890
"Anha lekhi kemis," "I
tasted the dried fig."

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:25.470
And now, "Anha lekhi kemisoon,"
"I tried a little bit of it."

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.609
So you tried from the dried fig.

00:28:27.609 --> 00:28:28.900
You didn't eat the whole thing.

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.490
You tried a little bit of
it, and again turned it aside

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:34.140
because that's what you're
supposed to do with fig.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:35.641
Really not appropriate
for eating.

00:28:35.641 --> 00:28:36.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:39.790
"Anha nithak," this is a word
that just means "I'm in pain."

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:44.097
So I guess as a verb
it would be "I hurt."

00:28:44.097 --> 00:28:45.680
I guess would be the
best way to do it

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.100
in English. "Anha
nithak," "I hurt,"

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.210
because that's a verb there.

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.210
But you could also say
something like this,

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:53.590
"Anha nithak kemisoon,"
and it's really hard

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:54.960
to translate this into English.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.890
But if you imagine
that, for example, you

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:02.570
had a dried fig attached
to you right here,

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:04.070
and it was just a
part of your body.

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:07.250
It was just growing out of
you, and it had sensation.

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:09.640
And you could say just
the way you could say,

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.630
oh, my foot hurts
or my hand hurts,

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:14.920
you could also say
my dried fig hurts.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.860
That's what this sentence
means, "My dried fig hurts."

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.100
The dried fig that is
literally growing out of me

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.870
hurts, and it's such
a bummer that I'm

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:24.222
a person that has a dried
fig growing out of me.

00:29:24.222 --> 00:29:27.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:29.469
And then this is-- I don't know.

00:29:29.469 --> 00:29:31.010
I thought you'd just
might want to be

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:33.389
able to know how to say this,
"Yer zheanae ven kemis,"

00:29:33.389 --> 00:29:34.930
"you're as beautiful
as a dried fig."

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:35.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.950
I just thought this would
be something useful for you,

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:38.974
because look at those.

00:29:38.974 --> 00:29:39.474
Just--

00:29:39.474 --> 00:29:41.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:43.590
Yeah, there they are.

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:45.415
I Alta Vista'd that on Google.

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:50.900
The next bit.

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.580
So it's like, yeah, grammar
is bigger than that.

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:54.163
You have a whole
talk, but we're going

00:29:54.163 --> 00:29:56.320
to stop there and
move onto the lexicon.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.330
So the lexicon is
your entire vast array

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:01.950
of words that exist
in your language.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:06.700
And so remember how I showed you
the little bit of the Dothraki

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:07.200
fun facts.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.200
So one of the things I
said on there is Dothraki

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.730
has eight words for horse.

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:13.120
I knew that the non language
people would love this

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.400
because they love
hearing, oh, Eskimos

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:19.510
have got 100 words for snow,
and they just love those things.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.960
And so I threw that in there,
and then it became a thing.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.501
And now it's like
everybody's saying,

00:30:23.501 --> 00:30:25.370
oh, Dothraki has a
million words for horse.

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:26.979
It does, but so does English.

00:30:26.979 --> 00:30:27.520
Look at that.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:32.072
You can probably think of more.

00:30:32.072 --> 00:30:33.530
So then the question
is, well, what

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:36.790
does this say about the
culture of we English speakers.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:42.110
We're obviously a very horse-ish
people, all just horse focused,

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:43.576
because you could
just keep going.

00:30:43.576 --> 00:30:44.450
It's like no, no, no.

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:46.710
It's just means that
there are some people who

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:49.575
speak English that do things
like race horses and breed

00:30:49.575 --> 00:30:52.390
horses.

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:54.819
It's a little different
with Dothraki.

00:30:54.819 --> 00:30:57.110
The horses are definitely
more important to their style

00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:59.800
of life than it is for
modern day English speakers.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.170
But really where
the lexicon plays

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:07.590
a part is in illustrating
where-- I'm sorry.

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:08.840
Just small examples.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.040
This is the word for
horse in Dothraki, hrazef.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.620
But it would be no
different if this

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:16.160
were the word for horse,
which is actually big dog.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.530
It wouldn't change
anything about the Dothraki

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:20.480
if suddenly that was
their word for horse,

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:23.266
was a gigantic
dog, which I think

00:31:23.266 --> 00:31:24.640
would be a good
word for a horse.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:27.440
I call dogs little horses
because of the Simpsons,

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:32.050
and so obviously then
horses would be big dogs.

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:36.080
Anyway, what the lexicon
does with your culture, what

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:39.230
it tells you about is really
where the people live,

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:42.670
what level of technology
they're at, and kind of

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:44.980
like what their daily
interactions are.

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.390
So for example, these are
all words of Dothraki.

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:49.930
There's the word for kale
if you ever wanted that,

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:51.830
which you shouldn't.

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:53.730
Carrot, turnip, cabbage.

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:55.080
Awful.

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.500
I'm not down with cabbage.

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.270
The word for radish is knew.

00:31:58.270 --> 00:31:59.860
My little cousin created it.

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.820
When I was in Colorado
just this last week I said,

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:03.810
oh, you know what?

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:06.240
There's no word for radish,
but obviously there's

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.810
going to be radishes
in this area.

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:11.990
And she said I want to do it,
and so she came up with gato.

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:13.140
That's the word for radish.

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.640
It's also the word for cat in
Spanish, but that's all right.

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.680
It's the word for
radish in Dothraki.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.110
Anyway, Dothraki has
no words for these.

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:25.830
The obvious reason
for that is because,

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:28.150
well, they just
don't live in an area

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:32.709
where these types of fruits
or-- avocado is a fruit-- exist.

00:32:32.709 --> 00:32:33.500
Avocado is a fruit.

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.520
Avocado is a berry.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.970
I know this because I
looked it up on Wikipedia,

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:39.670
and so it must be true.

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:41.050
Apparently avocado is a berry.

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:43.315
Fascinating.

00:32:43.315 --> 00:32:45.690
So yeah, Dothraki doesn't have
a bunch of words for that,

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:48.700
but it's because it's
not really interesting

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.740
that they don't have
a word for pineapple.

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:53.970
It just means that they don't
have pineapples in the place

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:54.777
where they live.

00:32:54.777 --> 00:32:57.110
If they encounter other people
that did have pineapples,

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:59.130
they'd probably borrow
the word or maybe

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:03.360
come up with some sort of a
calque for it on their own

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.160
if they decided.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.060
Maybe they could call
it a dangerous fruit.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:06.726
It's very spiky.

00:33:09.304 --> 00:33:10.970
Can you imagine
somebody actually trying

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:12.190
to just bite into a pineapple?

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:13.530
I hope nobody would
do that, that they

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:15.860
would know you have to cut
it up, but you never know.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:16.990
You never know.

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:20.220
Anyway, the place where
actually the lexicon

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.740
can reflect the
culture is usually

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:25.342
in places like idioms,
or expressions,

00:33:25.342 --> 00:33:27.550
or things where you're just
talking about daily life.

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:30.150
So for example, we
know from the book

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:32.860
that they worship
a great horse god,

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.760
and so I gave him this
name, "Vezhof," which

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.218
is like "the Great
Stallion." "Vez"

00:33:36.218 --> 00:33:39.060
is stallion, and "of" is kind
of an augmentative suffix,

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:43.400
so "Vezhof" is the word for
that great stallion in the sky.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:47.370
And then we also saw
that they evidently

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:50.660
don't respect a lot
of modern technology

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:54.870
enough to give them-- to
borrow the words, I noticed.

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:56.470
Or at least this is
my interpretation.

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:58.450
So for armor, they
have this word,

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:02.200
"shor tawakof," which
means "steel dress."

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.860
That's basically the
word for Westerosi style

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:07.600
armor, which they don't respect.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:11.860
And then when I came
up with expressions,

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.380
we have this expression,
"Shieraki gori ha yeraan,"

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:16.199
"the stars are
charging for you."

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:20.190
It means basically good luck,
or go you, or break a leg.

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:24.130
It comes from the idea
that basically a lot

00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:26.420
of Dothraki superstition
and religion

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:28.344
is tied up with cosmology.

00:34:28.344 --> 00:34:30.260
They believe that when
they die, first of all,

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:31.718
that their bodies
should be burned,

00:34:31.718 --> 00:34:34.600
and then the idea is that
the soul goes up to the sky

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:38.810
and they become the stars,
and that they kind of ride

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:42.199
in the Great Stallion's
khalasar in the sky.

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:45.770
And so that's why the bleeding
comet is so important to them.

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:48.239
And along with this, I came
up with this expression,

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:52.199
"torga essheyi,"
which means in secret.

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:54.080
And it actually
means "under a roof."

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.354
So the idea is if you
want to do something,

00:34:56.354 --> 00:34:58.020
and you want to be
above board about it,

00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:59.334
you do it under the open sky.

00:34:59.334 --> 00:35:01.250
They say that everything
important that's done

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:02.374
is done under the open sky.

00:35:02.374 --> 00:35:04.020
So if you're something
under a roof,

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.790
you're kind of
doing it on the sly.

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:09.830
That's kind of like where
the culture can really

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:13.040
influence the lexicon in a place
where a language creator can

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.180
have fun.

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:18.070
All right, last is the
writing system for a language,

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:20.380
and sadly Dothraki doesn't
have a writing system.

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:21.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:23.527
This is mentioned in the
books that the Dothraki don't

00:35:23.527 --> 00:35:25.110
have a written form
of their language,

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:26.850
so of course, to
fit with the cannon

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:28.255
you have to stick with that.

00:35:28.255 --> 00:35:29.960
But that was really
a bummer to me

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.777
because I love creating script.

00:35:31.777 --> 00:35:33.360
It's like my number
one favorite thing

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.606
to do in the entire world.

00:35:34.606 --> 00:35:36.980
Instead we just had to come
up with a simple Romanization

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:40.420
so that the actors could see
it and be able to figure out

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:41.760
how things are pronounced.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.789
But I have gotten to
do scripts for some

00:35:45.789 --> 00:35:47.080
of the other shows I worked on.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.035
So I just want to show
you a couple of them.

00:35:49.035 --> 00:35:52.190
So for the show
"Defiance" on Syfy,

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:54.420
I got to do three
scripts for three

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.010
of the different
languages I created.

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:57.718
This was the Castithan,
which is supposed

00:35:57.718 --> 00:36:02.280
to be basically the Roman
script of the alien universe.

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.490
Everybody has to use and learn
to know how to read this.

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:06.800
It's an abugida.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.810
So the top word-- I
think these are names.

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:16.900
The top word says "key ree
den." "Keyreeden." "Kreeden."

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.904
Oh no, "Freeden" "Freeden."

00:36:19.904 --> 00:36:20.820
That's what that says.

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:22.760
That must be somebody's name.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:23.760
Or "Fieriden?"

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.520
No, "Fereeden." "Freeden?"

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.270
I have no idea what
that's supposed to be,

00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:29.001
but it's definitely
somebody's name,

00:36:29.001 --> 00:36:31.000
because that doesn't look
like a Castithan word.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.802
It looks like
somebody's English name.

00:36:32.802 --> 00:36:35.010
On the lower right hand,
though, I can see "taliswo."

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:36.220
That's what that one says.

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:39.330
The one with the big-- I
love that letter by the way.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:40.620
It's just "zwo" on the end.

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:42.390
It looks like an
M, but then goes

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:44.140
on a really cool roller coaster.

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:45.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:48.140
And then there's a
fountain in the middle.

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:50.110
That just says "zwo."

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:50.760
And it's funny.

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:53.280
I evolved it so there's a
reason it looks like that,

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.780
but it looks cool now.

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.190
Anyway, so this
is another script

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:59.630
I created for the Irathients.

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:02.680
It's kind of more
curvilinear I guess,

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:05.340
and their language doesn't
have as much status

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:06.930
in the world as theirs.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:12.250
And then this one for
the Indojisnen created.

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:15.030
Most of the scripts that I
create I evolved naturally

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:17.340
over time, and scripts
evolve just the way languages

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:19.460
do, except that it's more
dependent on the medium.

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:23.080
With these obviously
no naturalistic script

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.930
would ever be evolved that
would be written like this,

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:29.130
but the idea is that
these Indojinsen have

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:32.990
kind of genetically modified
themselves to do things better

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.900
than other beings.

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.770
And so one of the
little ideas with that,

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:38.910
well, they probably also
modified their hands

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:41.360
so they can do precise
movements exactly the same way

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.580
every time.

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:45.100
The big Indojinsen on the show
is a doctor and does surgery,

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.510
so she's got implants for that.

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:49.051
So I figured they could probably
modify themselves to produce

00:37:49.051 --> 00:37:52.250
these glyphs exactly the
same way every single time,

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:54.840
and so it was a
post hoc creation.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.550
Not a naturally evolved system.

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:58.940
And this one.

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:03.666
Did anybody ever watch the
show "Star-Crossed" on the CW?

00:38:03.666 --> 00:38:04.165
Oh.

00:38:04.165 --> 00:38:04.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:09.500
Well, maybe someday it will
come out on DVD or Netflix.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:12.750
But it lasted for
one season and I

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:16.850
was really grateful I got to
do a writing system for it.

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:18.310
And I decided to
do something that

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:24.190
was really just funky and
totally hard to read and write.

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:28.000
I don't actually even know
what these things say.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.360
The little dipsy
doodles you see that go

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:34.380
above and below the
characters, they basically

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:38.180
tag those letters as being
a part of a word type.

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:42.560
So I know that the second
one is an adjective,

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.530
and I don't know what
it's an adjective for.

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:46.830
Or maybe it's just
a name, I think.

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:50.550
But basically it's like you need
to know what the letters say,

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:52.150
how the sound changes
work, and then

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:54.260
how the little things
that go above and beyond

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:56.940
tag them as different
types of words.

00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:00.370
It's gloriously difficult.

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:01.017
I love it.

00:39:01.017 --> 00:39:01.850
It's so nonsensical.

00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:06.290
Anyway, for friend's
novel, this was fun.

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:10.370
This friend's novel, she
created a-- basically these guys

00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:12.890
in the novel create a
language themselves.

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:15.085
They are English speakers,
so they're definitely

00:39:15.085 --> 00:39:16.960
influenced by English
and the Roman alphabet,

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:23.720
and they wanted to create a
way to create a kind a cipher.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.090
So this is basically
a cipher, and I

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:27.590
have no idea how it works.

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:31.310
It's impossible to read, but I
did that for her novel called

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:34.302
"The Zonix Deceit,"
which is fun.

00:39:34.302 --> 00:39:36.420
It looks pretty cool.

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:38.390
So then what you do with it?

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:40.530
I found that's one of the
most interesting things

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:42.900
that fans have done
with is get tattoos.

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.130
And that's just really,
really cool to me.

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:48.530
I would never get a
tattoo in my entire life,

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:51.260
but I find it really
intriguing that they do.

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:54.360
So these are all in Dothraki.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.105
I think that that
one is really neat.

00:39:56.105 --> 00:40:00.210
It says "shekh ma
shierak-i anni"

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:03.210
across here, which is
"my sun and stars."

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:04.866
And across the
back of the neck it

00:40:04.866 --> 00:40:07.365
says "jalan attihirari anni,"
which means "moon of my life."

00:40:07.365 --> 00:40:08.520
I was like, yeah.

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.740
And the one in the lower left
there, those are two sisters.

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:13.270
And both of them
got the same tattoo

00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:15.700
that says "qoy qoyi," which
means "blood of my blood,"

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:18.255
so it's like, yeah,
we're related.

00:40:18.255 --> 00:40:18.755
That's cool.

00:40:18.755 --> 00:40:19.255
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:19.255 --> 00:40:22.040
I just thought that
was so awesome.

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.640
And then people
have also gotten--

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.580
these ones are
even more awesome.

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:28.000
They're tattoos in some
of the scripts I did

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.031
for "Star-Crossed"
and "Defiance" here.

00:40:33.031 --> 00:40:35.030
I can't read it-- OK, I
know the one on the left

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:37.790
says Evan, which was
that person's boyfriend.

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:40.880
And then the one on the
right, that's her name.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:44.010
So the one on the right in the
upper right, that says Laura.

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:45.990
And what's so cool
about this tattoo is

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:49.550
she got that tattoo of her
name on her arm before the show

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:52.150
"Defiance" even aired.

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:55.120
They were just giving teasers
of what the language looked

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.020
like a little bit,
and she says, I really

00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:58.120
want to see what
my name looks like,

00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.411
because I want to get a tattoo.

00:40:59.411 --> 00:41:01.090
I'm like, OK, sure.

00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:02.200
Before the show airs.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.350
So I showed it to her, and
sure enough there it is.

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:05.750
I was like wow.

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:07.440
That is awesome.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:11.170
But probably my most favorite
tattoo that I've ever seen

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:13.870
is somebody-- his
name is Jean Peron.

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:16.200
I think he's French--
got a tattoo from one

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.970
of the languages I
just created on my own.

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:20.910
So this is that first language
I showed you, Kamakawi.

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:25.160
And this says [INAUDIBLE],
"silent scream."

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.320
I don't know what
the significance is,

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.880
but that was a language
I basically just

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:33.400
created for myself and the
writing system the same thing,

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.200
and he got it tattooed on him.

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:38.670
I swear if I ever
meet him in real life,

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:41.100
pretty much my house and
wallet are open to him.

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:44.290
That's just amazing.

00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:50.370
Anyway, so that's kind of like
a basic introduction to how

00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:53.250
you go from nothing
to a language.

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:56.940
And if you're interested
in anymore detailed,

00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:00.960
by the way, run through,
I'm coming out with a book

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.090
next year called "The Art
of Language Invention"

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:05.760
with Penguin Random
House, but for now you

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.470
can always just learn Dothraki.

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:10.490
So thank you guys so much
for coming, and staying,

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:12.120
and listening.

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.227
Thank you guys.

00:42:13.227 --> 00:42:19.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:22.550
AUDIENCE: So for the show how
much-- for all the shows you've

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:24.580
worked on, how much do
you work with the actors?

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:27.910
And how readily do they
accept instruction?

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:30.020
And how much do you
have to sort of have

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:31.630
back and forth with them?

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:32.940
DAVID PETERSON: It totally
depends on the show.

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:34.250
It totally depends on the show.

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:38.480
So "Game of Thrones," I've
never worked with the actors.

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:40.180
I've met a lot of them.

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:42.780
I've met a lot of them, and
they do really good work,

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:47.710
but they have separate dialect
coaches on set for everybody,

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:50.800
because they were designing
different English accents

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.490
for Westeros.

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:57.440
So then I just kind of
send-- well first of all,

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.620
they get all their lines
recorded by me on MP3.

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:02.440
So that's really, I think,
their number one resource,

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.660
but then they can go
to the dialect coaches

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:07.000
if they need pointers
on various things.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.090
But then for other shows,
like with "Defiance,"

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:12.030
I talked with pretty
much all the main cast

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:13.840
before the show
started, and then they

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.830
kind of got the hang
of it and go now

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:19.970
with "The 100," which
I work on on the CW.

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:22.300
I'm actually talking
with two actors today.

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:27.050
So it really depends on
the show, and the actors,

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:29.200
and how comfortable
they are with it.

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.060
I've noticed that,
in general, most

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:33.174
of the main cast of
every show I work on,

00:43:33.174 --> 00:43:34.340
they tend to be really good.

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:38.720
They usually come
into the project

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:40.928
and are told you're going
to be having a lot of lines

00:43:40.928 --> 00:43:42.391
in a created
language, and I think

00:43:42.391 --> 00:43:43.890
part of the reason
why they're hired

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:46.130
is because they think it's cool.

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:49.330
Most of the actors that I've
talked with on every show

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:52.100
that I worked on thought
it was really, really neat,

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:55.820
which I was so grateful
for, because if they thought

00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:57.990
it was just a burden, it's
like this is probably not

00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.970
going to turn out well.

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:01.799
So I've been fortunate so far.

00:44:01.799 --> 00:44:03.590
AUDIENCE: I actually
had the same question.

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:05.214
I was going to ask
you about the actors

00:44:05.214 --> 00:44:07.680
and how they learn the
phonology of languages,

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.630
but you pretty much answered it.

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:13.010
DAVID PETERSON: I think if
I could add a little more,

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:14.600
I will note this.

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:19.645
Actors that are British
tend to be better.

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:27.520
They tend to get
to it more easily.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:28.520
There's always outliers.

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.070
Like Jason Momoa was incredible.

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:31.125
What a gift that was.

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:34.820
Dude is a horse.

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:36.040
I love that guy.

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:39.590
And he really just totally
went all out with the Dothraki,

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:41.970
and he sounds wonderful.

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:43.640
I wish he didn't have to die.

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:44.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:45.690
I mean, he's still alive.

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:48.023
His character-- I wish his
character didn't have to die.

00:44:48.023 --> 00:44:50.285
Jason Momoa is alive
and well [LAUGHTER].

00:44:50.285 --> 00:44:54.530
But what I've noticed is I
think a lot of the British born

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:57.690
actors and actresses
from all over Britain--

00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:01.200
I think they've had
a lot of experience

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:02.850
having to change
their accent, either

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:06.020
to do a different British accent
or to do an American accent

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:07.780
for lots of the stuff
that they worked on,

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:09.770
so they're really used to it.

00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:12.120
And so when it comes
to a languages,

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:14.950
they just jump
right in, and they

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:18.750
tend to be pretty good
right from the get go.

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:21.500
AUDIENCE: How do you
come up with swear words,

00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:23.574
or cursor words, dirty
words, or whatever.

00:45:23.574 --> 00:45:24.990
DAVID PETERSON:
There was actually

00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:28.510
a really interesting
book that came out

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:32.820
just a couple years ago about
curse words in languages.

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:33.819
There are patterns.

00:45:33.819 --> 00:45:34.610
There are patterns.

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:37.480
Like all languages
have a feces word.

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.330
All languages have
one of those, and it

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:40.550
tends to be a curse word.

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:46.260
But then also
things will differ.

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:51.870
In French, for example, a lot
of swearing is with the devil.

00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:53.730
We don't tend to
do that as much,

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:55.680
like say oh devil take you.

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:58.300
It sounds a little fanciful,
but it doesn't actually

00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:00.950
feel like a swear.

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:04.670
There are usual domains
that swear words come from.

00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:07.910
One of them is body functions.

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:11.340
Another is reproduction,
and then another

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:19.040
is usually religo-metaphorical
superstition type things.

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:22.665
So all of my languages,
they all have a feces word

00:46:22.665 --> 00:46:25.040
because it seems like every
single language on the planet

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:28.450
is always going to
have a feces word.

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:31.600
But then with the
Dothraki, for example,

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:34.590
since they place so
much cultural importance

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:36.664
on being able to ride
and being able ride well,

00:46:36.664 --> 00:46:38.580
I guess if you can't
ride, they literally just

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:42.090
abandon you and leave you to
die, which seems kind of weird.

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:42.670
I don't know.

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:43.211
I don't know.

00:46:43.211 --> 00:46:44.510
Seems cruel.

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:45.780
I wouldn't do it.

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:49.150
Look, if you were khalasar,
I wouldn't leave you behind.

00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:52.650
I'd find a cart for you.

00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:55.670
So we already had them
insulting Viserys calling him

00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:57.400
the cart king,
the sorefoot king,

00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.980
so it seemed like
calling somebody

00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:01.610
a walker would be
that type of insult

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:04.354
where it kind of means
gringo when you're talking

00:47:04.354 --> 00:47:05.770
about somebody
who's non-Dothraki.

00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:08.190
If you're talking to a
Dothraki and you're joking,

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:09.697
maybe you can get away with it.

00:47:09.697 --> 00:47:12.030
But if you're serious, you
could really insult somebody,

00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:12.720
you know?

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:16.100
So I kind of went
there for that.

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:19.710
And then otherwise
it's just fun stuff.

00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:24.542
With the "Defiance"
languages where

00:47:24.542 --> 00:47:26.250
you have all these
different alien races,

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:27.624
and then they're
coming to Earth,

00:47:27.624 --> 00:47:31.170
there are actually a lot of
insults that go back and forth

00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:34.330
and change meanings
coming from English

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:36.660
and then also coming
from the alien languages.

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:39.147
And there's also
a lot of-- I don't

00:47:39.147 --> 00:47:41.480
know if you'd call it species
tension or racial tension,

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:42.855
but there are a
lot of those type

00:47:42.855 --> 00:47:45.470
of terms that end
up getting used.

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:49.030
It kind of depends on
the project, I guess.

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:52.330
AUDIENCE: You started going this
direction in the last question,

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:55.200
but I wanted to
ask, for Dothraki,

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:57.620
in what way did
things like irregulars

00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:02.690
and the sort of sound of words
get influenced by the lifestyle

00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:05.350
and sort of character
of Dothraki?

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:08.220
Like angry invectives
shouted from horse to horse,

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:11.340
or communicating from horse
to horse, when you're writing.

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:12.920
Can't really be a
delicate, difficult

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.902
to understand language.

00:48:14.902 --> 00:48:16.110
DAVID PETERSON: I don't know.

00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:17.480
They do a lot of sitting too.

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:19.510
And also if you notice--
and I did actually

00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:21.260
like this about how
they portrayed it--

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:25.190
they show them in their
nomadic lifestyle.

00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:26.970
They show them moving
from place to place.

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:28.970
And you'll notice that
when they move as a herd,

00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:30.960
it's very, very slowly.

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:33.190
So it's not it's not a
quick thing that happens.

00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:35.860
So I figure a lot of
conversation happens.

00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:37.900
It's not that bad.

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:39.360
It shouldn't be too loud.

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:44.680
I don't know how much
that influenced--

00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:46.760
don't think that type of
thing really influences,

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.332
say, the sound of the language
or the grammar a whole lot.

00:48:50.332 --> 00:48:51.790
I don't think that's
something that

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:55.070
happens in natural
languages at least,

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:56.760
and I was going for natural.

00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:00.170
As far as irregulars, that could
be an entirely different talk,

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:05.420
but the process is that
for all the languages

00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:08.280
that I create I start
with a very old language,

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.500
and then I evolve
the sound system.

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:14.330
I evolve the word
meanings, and I

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:18.300
evolve the grammar over a period
of between 1000 and 2000 years

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:20.050
depending on what
the time frame is.

00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:25.100
And so things like irregular
conjugations, irregular

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:28.860
declensions, irregular plurals--
if a language has irregular

00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:30.550
plurals, and all languages do.

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:34.880
Those always come from basically
a combination of sound change

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:37.320
and analogical change
and things like that.

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:41.010
So for example, your
mouse, mice in English--

00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:44.440
that actually came from a
totally regular pluralization

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.150
strategy where the
old word for mouse

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:49.580
was "moos" with the long
"oo," and the regular plural

00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:51.320
was "moosi."

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:54.320
And then what happened is that
the vowels changed, so "moos"

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.920
eventually became mouse
in the great vowel shift.

00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:01.760
And then over on the right
hand, "moosi" became "mewsi."

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:05.510
And then we lost that "ew"
vowel and it became "meesi."

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:10.790
We lost the vowel on the end,
and then long E became I,

00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:12.870
and so then we're
left with mouse, mice.

00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:15.974
That's how irregularities
emerge in language.

00:50:15.974 --> 00:50:17.640
As a language creator,
it's challenging,

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.490
but that's what you have to
try to emulate, that process.

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:22.420
So that's where all the
irregulars come from.

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:23.265
It's fun.

00:50:23.265 --> 00:50:25.890
AUDIENCE: One the languages that
you have mentioned in passing,

00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:30.000
but didn't say much
about, was the prosody.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.730
What do you do come
up with that scheme?

00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:35.237
That's important for actors
delivering it for sure.

00:50:35.237 --> 00:50:37.070
DAVID PETERSON: I
actually realized too late

00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:38.528
I should've done
something on that.

00:50:38.528 --> 00:50:44.090
So first, if a language
is going to have stress,

00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:47.310
that's something that you can
just plan out and figure out--

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:48.260
the stress system.

00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:53.800
I haven't been courageous
enough to try a tonal system

00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:58.674
with actors, because
with tonal systems

00:50:58.674 --> 00:51:00.340
it's so important to
get the tone right.

00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:02.672
It could be a change
in word meaning.

00:51:02.672 --> 00:51:04.130
I just don't feel
confident that it

00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:06.410
would come across
the correct way.

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:11.120
If I was going to
be in a situation

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:13.300
where I could be on
set every single day,

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:14.870
and be there for
every single line,

00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:17.170
and say no that
was wrong, maybe.

00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:20.060
But I think actors would
really get tired of that.

00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:22.740
So I've only done
stress systems.

00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:27.720
And so stress systems, they come
up in a very-- stress systems

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:29.700
work in a number
of ways basically.

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:33.720
Some of it is based
on sound changes.

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.769
So for example, the reason that
French apparently has no stress

00:51:36.769 --> 00:51:38.310
is because it's
lopped off everything

00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:41.600
off the ends of words, and so
the only kind of stress that's

00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:44.930
there is kind of a light
stress at the end of a word.

00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:50.210
But with Dothraki, for
example, the stress system

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:51.192
is fairly simple.

00:51:51.192 --> 00:51:52.900
If it ends in a
consonant, it will always

00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:54.570
be stressed on
the last syllable.

00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:56.990
If ends in a vowel, it
will most of the time

00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:59.180
be stressed on the
first syllable,

00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:02.130
unless the second to
last syllable is heavy,

00:52:02.130 --> 00:52:03.190
then the stress is there.

00:52:08.290 --> 00:52:15.360
A nice example is like to
the Dothraki, dothrakaan,

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:17.370
stressed on the last syllable.

00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:19.330
The proper pronunciation
of Dothraki

00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:21.690
is Dothraki, stress
on the first syllable.

00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:25.260
But the word for dragon,
"zhavvorsa," because there's

00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:29.010
that heavy internal syllable,
so it gets penultimate stress.

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:32.250
Then there are a couple
of other strange things,

00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:34.409
like there are certain
derivation patterns that

00:52:34.409 --> 00:52:35.950
move the stress
around, but you don't

00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:38.670
need to worry about those.

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:40.040
So that's the stress pattern.

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:41.820
Then when it comes
to the intonation,

00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:44.450
that really is just
up to me to figure out

00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:47.380
how I want the intonation
of a sentence to go.

00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:52.370
And I am not happy with
any method of transcribing

00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:56.220
intonation that's ever been
devised in linguistics or out

00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:56.920
of linguistics.

00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:59.420
I really don't think that
there's a good way to do it.

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:03.490
So all I do is just first I
record every sentence exactly

00:53:03.490 --> 00:53:05.510
the way it should
be spoken and hope

00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:07.610
that the actors will mimic.

00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:09.800
And then I kind of
do a thing where

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.370
I do a phonetic breakdown.

00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:13.130
I don't do IPA
because I discovered

00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:17.780
actors don't learn that
anymore, which is too bad.

00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:19.870
I break it down
syllable by syllable,

00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:22.890
and I put syllables
that are supposed

00:53:22.890 --> 00:53:26.730
to have more
prominence in all caps.

00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:29.100
And so for languages
like Irathient

00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:33.090
on "Defiance" that have a really
funky intonational pattern,

00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:36.440
there are often words
were the entire word

00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:40.780
has high intonation, because
one of the neat things

00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:43.390
that Irathient does is for
its subordinate clauses, which

00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:45.380
usually come first,
most of the words

00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:47.130
actually get kind
of a high tone.

00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:48.850
And then we have the
comma, it goes down

00:53:48.850 --> 00:53:51.440
to the regular low tone.

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:54.145
But again, this
is not something--

00:53:54.145 --> 00:53:56.270
I don't think it could be
written down effectively.

00:53:56.270 --> 00:54:01.120
I don't think it could
be conveyed effectively.

00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:04.830
So I really just do that with
the caps and the lowercase.

00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:06.407
I record all the
lines, and I just

00:54:06.407 --> 00:54:07.740
say, well, if it works it works.

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:09.420
If it doesn't, if doesn't.

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:11.470
Most of the time it works.

00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:14.120
I've noticed that to the
intonation that I do,

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:16.560
they tend to do a more
subtle version, especially

00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:18.780
with Irathient, but
you can still hear it.

00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:21.170
And I think that actually
makes it a little better.

00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:22.820
Probably my thing
is to exaggerated,

00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:26.870
but at least it gives them the
idea of how it should sound.

00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:28.870
AUDIENCE: On that note,
join me in thanking him.

00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:29.828
DAVID PETERSON: Thanks.

00:54:29.828 --> 00:54:31.020
[APPLAUSE]
