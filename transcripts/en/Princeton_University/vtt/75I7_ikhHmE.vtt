00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.310
JUAN CARLOS PINZON: Hola,
un saludos especiales. 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.230
NELLIE GORBEA: Hola, 
Bienvenidos a Adelante Tigres. 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.780
MARGARITA ROSA:
Bienvenidos.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.100
CHRISTOPHER L. EISGRUBER: It's my
pleasure to welcome you

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.040
back to Princeton
for Adelante Tigres.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.530
GERSON LEIVA: Bienvenidos,
Adelante Tigres.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.112
YVONNE GONZALEZ ROGERS &amp;
MARIA ROGERS: Adelante Tigres.

00:01:06.112 --> 00:01:07.570
CHRISTOPHER L. EISGRUBER: These
alumni conferences

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.520
have been important
ways for Princeton

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.560
to reflect on its
past, to reflect

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.360
on what we've done
right and to reflect

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.240
on what we've done
wrong, and to understand

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.840
what it is that we need to do
going into a complicated future

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.750
to be an even better and
more welcoming and inclusive

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.730
place than we've
been in the past.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.580
Those topics, of course, are
especially important today.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.380
There's a lot of
discussion in the world,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.810
important discussion,
taking place

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.010
about issues around immigration,
inclusivity and equality.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.570
And one of the
things that gets me

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.870
excited about this
conference is our opportunity

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.630
to talk about those issues
in terms that are personal,

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.130
in terms that are scholarly.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.542
And I look forward to joining
you in those conversations.

00:01:47.542 --> 00:01:49.000
MARGARITA ROSA:
Coming to Princeton

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.760
and being such a
minority, I was a minority

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.130
as a woman, a minority
as a person of color,

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.040
a minority as a
low-income person,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.370
was jarring and at the
same time, inspiring,

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.970
because I took the
opportunity to learn

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.730
a lot more about my own culture.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.520
MANUEL DEL VALLE: We knew
what our identity was.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.030
We were looking for
access for ourselves,

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.620
our culture and values.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.220
MARGARITA ROSA: The group split
into the Accion Puertorriquena

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.220
and I believe it was
the Chicano Caucus

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.650
and the Cuban organization.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.020
And somewhere along
the line I was

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.020
elected to be the first
president of Accion

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.080
Puertorriquena.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.680
MANUEL DEL VALLE: So
in terms of the goal:

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.530
to institutionalize Latino
experience at Princeton,

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.630
include us, not ignore
us and not exclude us.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.570
And that's a function
of analyzing who we are

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.310
and where we are.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.550
And it was easier to get
other like-minded students

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.200
from Mexico, from
L.A., from New Mexico,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.640
to arrive at the
same conclusion.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.620
MARGARITA ROSA: We
would pave the way

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.360
and help others from similar
backgrounds become aware

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.690
of the opportunity, be
encouraged to attend,

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.490
and also be supported
while they were here.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.490
NELLIE GORBEA: I initially
didn't have Princeton

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.200
actually on my list
because I thought

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.550
it was somewhat unattainable.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.560
JOSE ALVAREZ: It all
had to do with a guy who

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.710
went to my high school
a few years back who

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.660
had come from Princeton as part
of one of these college fairs.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.570
YVONNE GONZALEZ ROGERS: What
brought me to Princeton

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.920
were actually teachers.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.700
So when I was in
the seventh grade

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.500
I had a history teacher whose
name was Mr. Ludwikowski

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.540
and he was a Marine.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.060
And he said to me, you
know, you're a smart kid.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.400
You should think about going
to a place like Princeton.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.190
NELLIE GORBEA: I went
and visited the campus

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.480
and I was thrilled by the
community that I saw there.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.070
It was supportive,
but was also engaged

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.480
with the rest of the campus.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.600
JOSE ALVAREZ: And I just became
enamored by what was available.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.720
YVONNE GONZALEZ: And I
received the brochure

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.470
and the trifold pamphlet and
fell in love with Princeton

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.640
and what I read about it.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.560
So it was the only
school I applied

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.660
to other than the
University of Texas

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.120
at Austin, where I
had a full scholarship

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.440
for the honors program.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.106
JOSE ALVAREZ: I applied
early, I got in.

00:04:12.106 --> 00:04:16.530
And then all of my friends and
relatives, parents and brothers

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.029
and sisters said,
well, that's great,

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:19.230
but how are you
going to pay for it?

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.605
YVONNE GONZALEZ:
In my view there

00:04:20.605 --> 00:04:23.629
was no other choice to go
anywhere other than Princeton.

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:25.420
JOSE ALVAREZ: Obviously,
things worked out.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.880
The incredibly generous
alums of Princeton University

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.430
made it possible for me to
get through the University.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.920
That's true for
my wife, as well.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.460
My wife comes from a working-class 
family and the University

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.270
and the alumni made it
possible for her and for me

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.336
to get through this
incredible place.

00:04:45.336 --> 00:04:46.710
NELLIE GORBEA:
The Latino student

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.760
organizations tended to serve
as a real cohesive space,

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.000
but it was not, like I said,
an exclusive community.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.140
Most of us roomed with
people who were not Hispanic.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.400
I was involved in other
organizations as well.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.740
For example, I was a member of
the Princeton equestrian team.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.590
I was part of the Russian
club in my first few years.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.570
So we all did other
things, as well.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.580
So you know it's a very
tumultuous time in your life

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.081
as you're trying to
make out who you are

00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:19.080
and what you're going to
do with the rest of it.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.770
GERMAN LARA: For any student
at Princeton, going to college

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.720
is something you have to
acclimate yourself to.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.610
And every student at
Princeton, regardless

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.030
of nationality or ethnic origin,
has to make that adjustment.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.820
IRMA MARTINEZ: Students
today I'm sure struggle, too,

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.510
but it's just part of being
young and being 18, 19, 20,

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.150
and feeling kind
of alienated here.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.160
And I do feel like we were.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.410
DAVID MEJIAS: In
the fall of 1995,

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.790
there was a call
for students who

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.490
were interested in ethnic
studies, what we had identified

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.160
at the time as Latino and
Asian American studies,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.250
to attend a meeting at
the Third World Center.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.920
And it was a pretty
active, lively discussion

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.320
on what we needed
to do as a community

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.760
to ensure that we made progress
with these two programs,

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.290
these two initiatives.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.750
So as a result of that
meeting, a suggestion

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.520
was made that we think
about the idea of a sit-in.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:21.780
We proceeded to set a date
for the sit-in and 17 of us

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.160
gathered and walked
into Nassau Hall

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.320
and that's where we
spent the day and a half

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.850
voicing our concerns.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.590
At the end of the
sit-in, the students who

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.080
were working as the negotiators
met with the administration

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.190
and felt that their needs,
their specific concerns

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.970
were addressed.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.210
The University made a
commitment to allocate funds

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.690
for professorships in the areas
of Latino and Asian American

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:53.190
studies

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.160
and also allocated funds
to develop curriculum

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.830
in those two areas.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.820
MARTA TIENDA: We had
strong leaders at the time

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.350
of the student organizations.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:02.880
They wanted to have
a Latino studies

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.370
program where they could at
least earn a certificate.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.250
The importance of the
intellectual domain

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.740
asking the questions,
not let's compare Latinos

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.990
to whites, blacks and others,
which is an important exercise,

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.410
but what can we learn
about labor markets

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:17.430
by studying Latinos.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.830
What can we learn about
language acquisition

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.390
by studying bilingualism?

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.880
What can we learn
about education systems

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.980
and how they are not
operating effectively

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.090
by studying Latinos.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.790
That's a different way
of phrasing it, posing

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.310
the question, which is what
I try to do, rather than say

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.120
oh, it's our turn.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.690
Let's add another column
to the comparison.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.320
Adelante means forward, onward.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.320
I think it's an
important opportunity

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.410
to see where the University
is, because the University is

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.590
an institution that continues
to grow, develop and change.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.190
And whatever the
alumni got out of it,

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:52.500
they still have an opportunity
to give back and call and forge

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:53.880
the next generation.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.340
The students who come
here are second to none

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.100
when we think about the big
distribution of possibilities

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.270
and opportunities.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.550
And to participate in
shaping that I think

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.232
is a phenomenal opportunity.

00:08:05.232 --> 00:08:07.440
JEREMY BORJON: As a graduate
student, being a Latino,

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.640
the experience is fundamentally
different as an undergraduate.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.790
And there's a few reasons
why that's the case.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.250
The biggest one is we're older.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.680
We have more life experiences.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.930
Our priorities are
completely different.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.220
JUAN CARLOS PINZON:
It was great to join

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.760
other international students
coming from everywhere

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.270
in the world with their own
stories, with their own lives,

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.460
with their own vision,
with their own experience.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.501
SARA LOPEZ: Getting to
know everybody in my class

00:08:34.501 --> 00:08:36.990
and maintaining
those friendships

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:41.750
has been just one of the
best lessons in life.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.052
Sorry, I get a little choked
up when I talk about Princeton.

00:08:45.052 --> 00:08:48.419
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:55.584 --> 00:08:57.500
IRMA MARTINEZ: Ballet
Folklórico de Princeton.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.006
It's Mexican folk dance music.

00:08:59.006 --> 00:08:59.630
It's beautiful.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.520
Each state in Mexico
has their own tradition

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.221
of the music and the costumes.

00:09:04.221 --> 00:09:05.720
GERSON LEIVA: We
went about starting

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.120
the first urban Latin dance
company on campus called

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.080
the Más Flow Dance Company.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.010
And within four years, it
became one of the biggest dance

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.600
companies on this campus.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:20.450
We danced the traditional salsa,
merengue, bachata, kizomba,

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:21.550
samba.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.780
And we always, always
encourage our members

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.914
to take on a choreography.

00:09:30.157 --> 00:09:31.740
JEREMY BORJON: I
brought with me today

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.120
two pictures from graduation.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.510
My mom, my grandma in the
middle, and my tia, then

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.930
my Uncle Raymundo and myself.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.160
And unfortunately,
my Uncle Raymundo

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.650
passed away about
three years ago.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:51.720
And everything I'm doing
is to honor his memory

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:58.230
and also to honor the
three amazing women who

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.675
raised me to who I am today.

00:09:59.675 --> 00:10:01.050
GERSON LEIVA: My
parents migrated

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:04.290
from El Salvador in the
'80s during the civil war.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.000
And it wasn't easy for them.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.120
And this is something that when
I wake up day-to-day basis,

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.840
it's something I think about.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.220
I have a ton of opportunities
that they didn't.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:21.120
And so now I'm focused on
making the most of them.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.890
I don't think I'll ever face as
much adversity as they faced.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:33.090
And when I think about who
I want to become in life,

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.010
I want to become them.

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.600
I want to be able to
overcome everything,

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.999
no matter what
life throws at me.

00:10:37.999 --> 00:10:40.290
JEREMY BORJON: A lot of people
had told my mom that she

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:41.715
wasn't raising me right.

00:10:41.715 --> 00:10:43.620
That I was reading
too many books

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.560
and I had too many
grandiose ideas,

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.980
I lived too much to debate
and to argue as opposed

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.410
to actually going out and
doing work with my hands.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:55.680
GERSON LEIVA: I feel as though
I have that responsibility now

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.300
to go back and show the
people that, in my community,

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.360
that it's possible to do
big things, to dream big.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.734

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:12.530
PEDRO PABLO KUCZYNSKI:
I am happy to be here.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:17.680
I'm honored to be
in this ceremony.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.180
MARISA SALAZAR:
What stood out to me

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.900
were the diverse, vibrant,
interconnected communities

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.149
from which Princeton
was formed and which

00:11:25.149 --> 00:11:26.190
have shaped my time here.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:29.431
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:30.037 --> 00:11:31.620
IRMA MARTINEZ: I
first became involved

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.200
in ALPA, which is the
Association of Latino Princeton

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.100
Alumni, it's been about
seven, eight years.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.030
We started to put
a working board

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:43.710
together and having
elections and reconnecting

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:47.460
with alums, fellow alums and
the current students here.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:51.300
And actually that
helped me understand

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.910
that I am a Princetonian.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.285
GERMAN LARA: I do think
it's important for alumni

00:11:56.285 --> 00:11:57.750
and for students
to know that there

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:01.680
are Latino alumni on
the Board of Trustees.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:06.540
YVONNE GONZALEZ ROGERS: When the
alumni elected me University trustee,

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.190
I think I was in
a state of shock

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:13.440
that I was actually coming
back to Princeton as a trustee.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:18.960
I was amazed that a
Mexican American kid from San

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.920
Antonio, Texas, could ever come
back to a place like Princeton

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.360
and be trustee.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:31.740
I was incredibly humbled to be
offered that position of trust.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.510
MARGARITA ROSA: I'm very
grateful to Sonia Sotomayor,

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.984
who was here when
I was here and who

00:12:36.984 --> 00:12:38.400
told me when my
daughter was going

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.290
to come here that I shouldn't
let anybody else bring her.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:41.880
She wanted to bring her here.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.630
And a year or two ago, she
told a story at Alumni Day.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:49.800
SONIA SOTOMAYOR: One of my
most joyous moments of my life

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.640
was helping Margarita bring
her daughter, Marisol,

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.370
to Princeton.

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:56.370
MARGARITA ROSA: It was
that moment of separation

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:57.900
from your child.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.050
And so to have a friend, a
dear friend, who had been here

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:04.510
with me who was very proud
and happy that my daughter was

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:05.010
coming.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:08.460
Who had actually brought
her things to the campus

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:12.480
and then sat with me
as I sort of sniffled

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.600
when I walked away and realized
that my little girl was now

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:19.470
a college student, was
really very, very sweet.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:23.380
DAVID MEJIAS: I was very moved
to see Sonia Sotomayor's quote

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.210
engraved in the middle of campus
greens in front of Nassau Hall.

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:32.010
That, to me, is emblematic
of what this conference means

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.850
and what it's going to
allow Latino alumni to do.

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:37.590
SONIA SOTOMAYOR: Princeton
in the nation's service,

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:41.460
in the service of all
nations, and in the service

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:48.455
of humanity, one person
and one act at a time.

00:13:48.455 --> 00:13:51.892
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:57.299 --> 00:13:59.840
CHRISTOPHER L. EISGRUBER: I tremendously
enjoyed the alumni conferences

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.214
that we've had in the past,
and I've been looking forward

00:14:02.214 --> 00:14:04.070
to this one all year long.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:05.570
I've already enjoyed
the opportunity

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:08.870
to talk to some of you about
your experiences on the campus

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:11.540
while you were here and
what they meant to you.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.790
I really enjoyed talking
to Charlie Hey when I was

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.920
down in Puerto Rico last year.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.200
And he at the time
gave me a copy

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.020
of Bacalao, the
newsletter that he

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.120
and Sonia Sotomayor
and others put out

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.160
while they were on the campus.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.920
His stories about that
time were tremendous

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.160
and it'll be wonderful over
the course of the next few days

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.130
to hear you talk about
your time at Princeton

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:37.640
and to hear about the tapestry
of the Latino community

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.490
as all of you moved through
Princeton and into your alumni

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:41.840
careers.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.520
I look forward to
talking to you.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.134
Welcome back to Princeton.

00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:45.800
Adelante Tigres.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.150
