PALI BHAT: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.330
Today we're going to talk about
Monetizing Digital Goods

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:06.720
With Google Wallet.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.880
I'm Pali, a product manager
on the Google Wallet Team.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.462
And I'm going to be joined today
by Dan and Joel, who are

00:00:12.462 --> 00:00:15.960
software engineers on the team,
and Bryan, who's with

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.860
Kabam, a partner of
Google Wallet.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.080
So I'm going to start off today
by talking a little bit

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.895
about Google Wallet for digital
goods and how it will

00:00:25.895 --> 00:00:28.640
help developers monetize
their digital goods.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.990
Then we're going to hand off to
Dan and Joel, here, to talk

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.310
about the integration process
for Google Wallet.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.870
And we'll turn over to Bryan to
talk about their experience

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.140
with integrating with Google
Wallet and the experience

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.920
they've had with monetizing
their digital goods.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.270
And want to wrap up with
some exciting news.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.810
So if you stick around to the
end, there is some exciting

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.560
news coming up.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.500
So first up, I want
to just level-set

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.370
everybody on Google Wallet.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.010
How many of you have used
Google Wallet before?

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.140
Show of hands.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.500
Wow, everybody.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.640
Well, it was a little bit of a
trick question, because the

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.570
only way to purchase tickets
for I/O was by

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.870
using Google Wallet.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.200
So you wouldn't be here
if you hadn't used

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.550
Google Wallet already.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.700
In addition, we've got some
great booths set up if you

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.090
want to try out tap and pay.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.260
So do come by our booth.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.840
And we've got a Code Lab set up
if you want to try out and

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.130
actually do an integration.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.375
So Google Wallet is just your
physical wallet that you put

00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:40.350
it in the cloud, so it's
accessible from any device,

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.140
whether it's your desktop
computer or your mobile

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.860
device, so you have
it on the go.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.800
Now Google Wallet for digital
goods is the same Google

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.600
Wallet, all the benefits we
talked about, but optimized

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.760
for digital content.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.480
When we announced this
product last year, we

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.140
called it In-App Payments.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.390
And since we launched, we've
learned that developers are

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.240
using this for a whole lot more

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.800
than just in-app payments.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.110
So they're using it to monetize
all kinds of digital

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.760
content, whether it's virtual
swords within a game or

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.360
whether it's music videos,
online articles, et cetera.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.280
So Google Wallet is really for
the gamut of all of the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.670
digital content that developers

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.920
are looking to monetize.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.010
And the beautiful thing about
Google Wallet is that it

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.520
already powers all of Google.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.520
So if you look at the technology
behind payments for

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.860
Google Play, Offers, YouTube,
Google+ Games, Chrome Web

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.480
Store, all of this is powered
by Google Wallet.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.660
And so developers get access
to the huge technology

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.180
investments that we put in to
make this the very best

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.270
product in terms of conversions,
in terms of

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.010
monetization for all the
Google properties.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.710
And you guys have access
to it with Google

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.220
Wallet for digital goods.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.480
After we've launched, a whole
lot of great developers are

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.050
already on board and
onto Google Wallet.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.760
We're going to be joined by one
of them, Kabam, to talk

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.475
about their experience.

00:03:10.475 --> 00:03:14.040
But we also have all of the
large brands, like Zynga,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.490
Rovio, Gameloft, EA, et cetera,
already integrated

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.530
with Google Wallet.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.860
So there's a ton of momentum,
and there's already hundreds

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.450
of developers on
Google Wallet.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.310
And with today's announcements,
we're looking

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.895
to scale this much, much more.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.920
Now when we started Google
Wallet, we looked at three key

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.880
principles.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.200
The first principle was really
to have a streamlined

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.100
experience.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.380
We wanted to make it as simple
to buy with Google Wallet as

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.720
it is to click a button
on the screen.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.640
And if you look at signed-in
users today with Google

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.780
Wallet, that's all it takes.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.020
And we're going to demonstrate
a little bit of that purchase

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.400
experience here.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.300
But it's just one click,
and you're done.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.880
The second key principle we
wanted to start off with was,

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.130
make it really simple to
integrate with this product.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.470
And we're going to hit upon this
theme a lot more during

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.210
the rest of the session.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:16.760
And a big, big point that we've
actually focused on, a

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.990
point of focus we've had
throughout this process of

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.520
launching Google Wallet for
digital goods, is to make the

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.870
integration very, very simple.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.830
In many cases, developers have
told us that it takes just a

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.140
couple of hours to integrate.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.750
And we'll demonstrate some
of that as well.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.810
And the last one was, of course,
attractive pricing.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.260
We wanted to make sure that we
increase developer bottom

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.510
lines as much as possible.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.560
And we'll talk a little bit
more about this as well.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.900
Now since we launched last year
at Google I/O, we've been

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:47.515
hard at work.

00:04:47.515 --> 00:04:49.495
So we've done a bunch
of different things.

00:04:49.495 --> 00:04:53.120
The first, of course, is that
in July and August, we

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.570
launched support for Chrome Web
Store and Google+ Games

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:57.260
developers.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.540
So anyone on the Chrome Web
Store or Google+ Games can use

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.180
Google Wallet to monetize
their digital content.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.930
And then, in the fall, we
streamlined the user

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.810
experience to this one-step
process that I just described.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.350
In December of last year, we
expanded support from the

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.000
United States to 18
seller countries.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.660
So if you're developers in any
of these seller countries, you

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.330
can start using Google Wallet
for digital goods right away.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.440
And the other big win was
expanding this product to

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.200
140-plus buyer countries.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.650
So you have buyers that you
can target across 140

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.260
countries on the planet.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.750
We, of course, support nine
currencies as well.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.770
Now in January, we launched
another big push with Google

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.670
Wallet in making the
signup easier.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.240
And with the new signup flow
that we have, all we collect

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.130
from a new user is, apart from
your credit card details, just

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.040
your name and zip code.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.110
And you can sign up, and
it's that simple.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.420
And we've seen conversions
go up big-time after this

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.980
particular launch.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.080
And then in March this year, we

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.190
launched Mobile Web Support.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.060
The nice thing about Mobile Web
Support is now, if a user

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.070
actually comes to your site or
your app on a mobile device

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.420
and they're using a mobile
browser, we'll present to them

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.790
a streamlined mobile
web experience.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.470
And the cool thing about this
is that you don't have to do

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.460
even one bit of work for this.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.500
We just detect the device and
automatically present the

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.310
right flow, whether you're
coming through your PC, or

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.960
you're coming on your
mobile phone.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.390
And the last couple of months
have been really, really busy

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.440
on our team--

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.580
Dan and Joel can attest
to that--

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.430
because we've been hard at work
on three cool things that

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.310
we want to talk about today.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.030
And the first of them, of
course, is something that

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.460
we've got lots and lots of
feedback on throughout the

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:04.060
course of this launch
in this last year.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.540
Developers love that we
allow single-item

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.170
purchases to be so simple.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.540
But one of the consistent pieces
of feedback that we've

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.220
always got is, when are
you going to support

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.010
subscriptions?

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:19.090
So without further ado, as
of today, we support

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:19.670
subscriptions.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:26.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.930
The nice thing about the
subscription functionality we

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.740
are doing is that it's as
simple to use as our

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:33.940
single-item purchase.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.050
So the user has still just
this one-step process we

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:37.640
talked about.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.870
A signed-in Wallet user just has
one step to subscribe to

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.390
your content, right?

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.920
They just click the Finish
button and they're done.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.790
We're going to lunch with
monthly subscription support.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:52.750
And we'll do free trials
right away.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.320
And the coolest thing
about this is that

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.330
it's live in Sandbox.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.870
So whether it's to go buy our
Google Wallet desk, which is

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:06.030
on the second floor, right on
this floor here, or the Code

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:10.680
Lab at 1:15 on Friday, you can
go in and try this out.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.330
And feel free to knock on this
and go use this product,

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.690
because it's already live.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:20.070
So look forward to all you
developers taking advantage of

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:23.060
this, including those who
are doing this live

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.310
stream on the web.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.560
Now of course, once we launch
subscriptions, the first

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.460
question, of course, was how
would we do subscription

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:31.775
management?

00:08:31.775 --> 00:08:33.929
And how would we give merchants
and developers the

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:35.580
way to do subscription
management, including

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.059
canceling subscriptions when a
user calls you, et cetera?

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:40.929
And so we're doing a
revamp of all our

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:42.909
merchant services as well.

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:47.790
And you guys will see this soon,
where we're going to

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:50.670
give you a much more streamlined
interface and

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.590
subscription management
functionality.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:54.940
Pretty cool.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.520
But while we were revamping
this, we figured, why don't we

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.590
just go ahead and improve
the analytics?

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:04.720
So when this new functionality
launches, we're going to give

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.400
you enhanced analytics.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:12.430
So we've got all of this really
rich demographic data

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.360
that we're going to
bring to bear.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.110
And we're going to give you
analytics, whether it's by

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.930
gender, by age, or country.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.730
And we'll give you really cool
graphs to show you how your

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.000
sales have been trending as
you introduce new digital

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.880
content, new pricing
to your users.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.240
You can take advantage of that
as soon as we launch this

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.490
functionality.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.880
Now, with that, I want to hand
over to Dan and Joel to talk

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.190
about what's most important to
you guys, which is how easy

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.020
the integration is
going to be.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:43.440
Dan.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.280
DAN ZINK: All right.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.096
Thanks, Pali.

00:09:46.096 --> 00:09:47.350
Hi, I'm Dan.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:48.310
JOEL LEITCH: And I'm Joel.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:49.860
DAN ZINK: And we're both
engineers working on Google

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.150
Wallet for digital goods.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.400
We'd like to talk a little bit
about integration right now.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.520
So since we announced the
product a year ago, not much

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.650
has changed with integration.

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:01.600
What we do, if you want to
integrate with Google Wallets

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.435
for digital goods, what you do
is you create a JWT, or a J,

00:10:05.435 --> 00:10:08.470
W, T, which stands for
a JSON Web Token.

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.870
This describes the thing
that you're selling.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.090
I've got an example here
on the screen.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.610
It's a data structure here that
holds the description of

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.700
a digital item being sold.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.490
You can see in here, we've got
the issuer, which is the

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:24.090
person selling the item, the
audience, which is us, Google.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:27.750
We've got an issued-at time
and an expiration date and

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:28.670
also a type.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.390
The "type" field there
is important.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.390
It's just "typ." It says
the type of purchase

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.160
that is being made.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.640
That purchase is described
in the request

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.010
substructure in here.

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:42.850
And in there, you can see the
name, description, price, and

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.860
currency code of what's being
sold, along with an optional

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.220
field called "seller data."
Google does not interpret the

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:49.940
seller data.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.210
We simply hold onto it and echo
it back to you later once

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.630
a purchase or a subscription
has been completed.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:58.260
It's a good place to do your
own record-keeping.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.750
So once you've created the JWT,
basically once you've

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.730
create that data structure and
run it through a JWT library

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:09.310
that will actually JSON encode
it, and base64 encode it, and

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:11.240
sign in with your secret key.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.050
Then you need to pass it into
our JavaScript library.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.870
We've tried to keep this
very simple as well.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.280
What you would typically do
here is put your own "Buy"

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.010
button on your page,
bind the "Buy"

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.620
button to a click handler.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.330
In this case, we've called it
"purchase." And in that

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.040
"purchase" function-- this is
just a JavaScript function--

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.160
you can pass the JWT into
our JavaScript Buy call.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.100
Along with the JWT,
you can provide a

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.230
success and failure callback.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.030
These, again, are just
JavaScript functions.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.790
And they get called when
somebody exits the buy flow.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.500
Now with subscriptions it's
really, really similar.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.470
So if you've already integrated
for items, then

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:49.930
doing it for a subscription
should be pretty

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:50.940
straightforward.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.860
I've highlighted the
changes in yellow.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.660
The JWT structure is
slightly different.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.650
Instead of being for an item in
the "type" field, it's for

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:00.320
a subscription instead.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.760
And the contents of the request
substructure are

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.290
slightly different as well.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:07.120
Instead of having the price and
currency code right there

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.680
in the request, we've got
another structure inside of

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.480
there that we call
a recurrence.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.990
And in there we've got price,
currency code, and frequency.

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:17.770
So you can see in this example,
we're charging $4.99

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.510
a month, USD.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:20.580
JOEL LEITCH: So wait
a second, Dan.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.790
DAN ZINK: What, Joel?

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:22.700
JOEL LEITCH: We have
an audience full of

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:23.650
developers out here.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:24.125
DAN ZINK: We do.

00:12:24.125 --> 00:12:25.960
JOEL LEITCH: So let's just do
the live integration right

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.710
here on stage.

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:27.540
DAN ZINK: A live demo.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:28.610
JOEL LEITCH: Yeah,
let's do it.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:29.090
DAN ZINK: All right.

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:30.980
Do you have any site in mind
that you might want to

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:31.950
integrate with?

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.300
JOEL LEITCH: I do, actually.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.730
You know my dogs, right?

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:35.590
DAN ZINK: Yeah, I
love your dogs.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:37.690
JOEL LEITCH: So I have two
dogs, Pepper and Nutmeg.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:38.310
They're pugs.

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.010
And I've written a
blog about them.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.170
DAN ZINK: Oh, cool.

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:42.830
JOEL LEITCH: So why don't we
just integrate subscriptions

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:43.610
right into my blog.

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:44.680
DAN ZINK: Sounds like
a great idea.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.980
So before we get started, I want
to go through the basic

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:50.060
steps we're going to do to
integrate with your blog.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.550
We're going to first add a
buy button to your blog.

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:55.190
It's a button somebody can
click on to subscribe.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:56.930
And then we're going to
go through building

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:58.920
a JWT on your server.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.480
And then we're going to take
that JWT and pass it into our

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.200
JavaScript Buy function.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.210
And then finally, the last step
is that we're going to

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:06.230
handle the postback.

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:08.350
And this is the server-to-server
call that

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.020
Google makes back to your server
once the payment has

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.860
been completed, whether it
be a subscription or a

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.090
single-item purchase.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:16.920
JOEL LEITCH: OK, sounds good.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.560
So why don't we start off by
taking a look at my blog?

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.810
DAN ZINK: Yeah, let's do that.

00:13:24.688 --> 00:13:26.270
JOEL LEITCH: So there
you see it.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:28.250
There's my pugs, Pepper
and Nutmeg.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:28.680
DAN ZINK: Nice.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.700
JOEL LEITCH: And some very,
very rich content on here.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:32.690
DAN ZINK: Very nice.

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:35.040
JOEL LEITCH: But I'd like to
make some money off of this.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.730
DAN ZINK: Sounds good.

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:37.810
JOEL LEITCH: So let's walk
through integrating

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:38.630
subscriptions then.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:39.450
DAN ZINK: That sounds good.

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:40.770
So Joel, just to make
sure you've done

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:41.700
some prep work here.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.880
Have you already created a
subscriptions database table

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.280
on your data store to
keep track of who's

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.290
subscribed and who isn't?

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:48.880
JOEL LEITCH: Yeah, I've
got that all set up.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.490
DAN ZINK: OK, great.

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:52.360
So the first step that we want
to do here is adding a buy

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.560
button to your page.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.080
So let's actually go into your
server code here and read the

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.890
state of a user, to see if
they're subscribed or not, and

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:03.210
then pass that into our web
template so we can show the

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:04.510
appropriate messaging.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.600
And what we're going to want to
do is show some different

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.510
messaging for people that
are subscribed versus

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:09.930
unsubscribed.

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:10.360
JOEL LEITCH: OK.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:15.400
So right now what I've got is,
you'll notice on line 36, I'm

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.970
reading from my data store.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:21.110
I'm passing an email to figure
out whether or not this user

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.900
has subscribed.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:27.260
Later down on line 40, I'm
just passing it into this

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.690
template values data structure,
which then

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:32.650
propagates into the
actual template.

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:34.460
So I'm going to open up the
template now, and I'm just

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.110
going to make sure this premium
content that you see

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:42.730
on line 10 gets hidden behind
that "has subscribed" flag.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:43.260
DAN ZINK: That sounds great.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.410
So again, we're showing people
who haven't subscribed a

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:47.870
"subscribe" button, and people
who have subscribed get the

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:49.670
premium content.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:52.820
JOEL LEITCH: So now I've got the
premium content tucked in

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:56.330
behind the "if" statement
that you see on line 9.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.330
So if they have subscribed,
they're going to see this

00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:59.590
premium content.

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:02.250
And I'm a grateful guy,
so I'm going to thank

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:03.320
you for your support.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.090
DAN ZINK: That's very nice.

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.760
JOEL LEITCH: And if they haven't
subscribed, you'll

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.490
notice the "else"
statement on 14.

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:11.240
And if they haven't subscribed,
I'm just going to

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.000
throw a Subscribe button
on the page.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.430
And I'm actually hooking
it up to a purchase JS

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:18.840
function right now.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.720
But we'll get in to implement
that later.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.480
DAN ZINK: Let's take a look
at what this looks like.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.790
We're going to reload
the page.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:27.280
JOEL LEITCH: All right.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.520
I see the Subscribe button.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:28.860
DAN ZINK: All right.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:29.940
Exactly as expected.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.080
Nobody has subscribed yet,
including yourself.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.830
So we're just showing
a Subscribe button.

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:35.510
So let's move on to
the next step.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:37.000
Let's actually create the JWT.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.910
So Joel, if you could open
up the server code.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.620
I see you've done that.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.990
So the next step is to create
that Python data structure

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:45.520
that describes the purchase.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.550
Just like I showed on the slide
a few slides earlier,

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.690
we're going to create the
data structure, pass

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.220
it into a JWT library.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.540
And I should've mentioned
earlier, these are available

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.870
across a number of programming
languages.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.770
We're going to pass it in there,
which is going to turn

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:02.820
it into JSON and base64 encode
it, and sign it with your

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:03.320
secret key.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.140
JOEL LEITCH: Yep.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:08.420
So just going back up, you'll
notice what I've done here is

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.290
I've pasted in the
JWT payload.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:14.290
That's the structure that you
saw a few slides ago.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:15.850
In here, you'll notice
the issuer.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.010
You'll notice I have
a seller ID.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:18.180
That's just a constant
I stored in

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.970
another file for now.

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:23.650
I pulled out my seller ID from
the Merchant Center, as well

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:27.440
as I've got my seller secret
stored in the constant as well

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.860
in that same file.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.850
Both of those pieces of
information are right off the

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:33.050
Merchant Center.

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.430
You'll notice the
"type" field.

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:39.610
That looks familiar to the
single-item JWT, other than

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:41.560
now we have "subscription"
in there.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.320
And as Dan referenced earlier,
we have this recurrence

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.860
structure inside
of the request.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:50.440
One other thing to note is, if
you look at line 47 here, I'm

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.040
just putting in the
user's email.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.810
I'm going to be using this later
to determine whether or

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:57.590
not the user has subscribed.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:01.580
And then I pass it into
JWT library, and I

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:02.390
call Encode on it.

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:06.190
Basically this will base64
encode the JWT payload and

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:09.369
then sign that structure.

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:11.099
And now what I'm going to do,
just so we can see some

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:16.430
progress, I'm going to put it
into the template so we can

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:20.220
see that it's actually
generating a JWT.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.230
DAN ZINK: Now you normally
wouldn't show

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:22.550
this to your customers.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:23.810
It does just look
like gibberish.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.819
But it is base64 encoded JSON.

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:29.055
And in fact, if you ran it
through a base64 decoder, you

00:17:29.055 --> 00:17:31.700
would see the original
data in there.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:32.580
JOEL LEITCH: One other
thing to note.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.630
The Subscribe button still
does not work.

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:37.470
DAN ZINK: JOEL: OK, so let's
move on to the next step here,

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:38.290
the third step.

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:41.220
Let's actually take that JWT
and pass it into the Buy

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:44.380
function from the Google Wallet
for digital goods

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.090
JavaScript library.

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.840
This will actually bring up
the buy flow and allow

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.900
somebody to subscribe.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:52.330
JOEL LEITCH: OK.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.865
So let me go back up
so we can see this.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.630
Sorry about that.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:10.350
What you're seeing on line 7
is us loading up the Google

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:11.890
Wallet library.

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:15.270
One thing to point out here on
line 10, we're pointing it at

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:16.520
the Sandbox configuration.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.970
From line 7 to line 12
is all copy paste

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.080
right off our dev docs.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.350
And then just below that, I've
implemented the Purchase call

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:31.826
that I said I would
implement later.

00:18:31.826 --> 00:18:34.110
In here you'll notice
all I'm doing is

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:35.770
calling the Buy function.

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:37.590
And that Buy function
is supplied by the

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:39.210
library loaded above.

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:41.650
In there I'm just passing the
JWT that we generated on the

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:43.510
server side, and I'm
just setting up a

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:44.620
success handler here.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:48.310
I left the failure handler
off just for this demo.

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:50.970
And all the success handler's
going to do, as you can see on

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:53.410
line 19, is it's just going
to reload the page.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:55.470
And I'm going to leverage the
postbacks to actually figure

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:57.505
out whether or not the
user has subscribed.

00:18:57.505 --> 00:18:59.300
DAN ZINK: So let's take a look
and see what this looks like

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.420
right now, now that we've got
all that code written.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:04.860
OK.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.360
So we actually have a
mostly working buy

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.080
flow at this point.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.990
We're actually able to launch
the Payment dialogue.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.290
You can see we're charging
$4.99 a month.

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:14.090
We're getting really
close right now.

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:16.630
The thing that we have not done
yet, though, is actually

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.630
recorded anywhere in our code
that somebody has subscribed.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.710
So what we've got to do is
the last step, which is

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.310
implementing the postback
handler.

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:26.570
So when a purchase completes,
whether it's a single-item

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:29.890
purchase, the traditional API
that we've had for a year now,

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:33.790
or a subscription, Google's
going to send your server a

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.750
server-to-server postback to the
URL that you've defined in

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.940
your integration
settings page.

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.830
So Joel, if you could open up
your server code and go ahead

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:42.700
and write that.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.080
Looks like you've
got that done.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.170
JOEL LEITCH: Quick typer.

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:47.520
DAN ZINK: Very fast.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:51.110
JOEL LEITCH: So just to explain
what's happening here,

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:52.880
Google will do a post
to your server

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.070
when a purchase completes.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:57.450
It's going to post to a url that
you've specified in the

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:58.420
Merchant Center.

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:02.840
And what it does is it posts a
request to your server with a

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.000
JWT parameter.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.350
So what I'm doing here is I'm
extracting that JWT parameter

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.730
out of the request, and then
I'm passing it through that

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:09.960
same JWT library.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.780
But instead of encoding at this
time, I'm actually going

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:12.820
to decode it.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:17.860
And what decoding will do, it
will base64 decode the JWT

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.960
payload, and it'll also verify
that the signature is correct.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:26.060
So if we get past this point,
we have a decoded JWT.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.690
And the next thing I recommend
doing is making sure that this

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:31.030
JWT was actually
meant for you.

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:33.220
To do this, all you have to do
is check that the issuer is

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.800
from Google and that the
audience is your seller ID.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.170
If all is good at this point,
what I'm doing here is I'm

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:43.540
just pulling out the order ID
more for record keeping.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.570
And I'm extracting that
email that I had put

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:47.460
in the seller data.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:51.170
And I'm going to then store this
in my data store so I can

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:53.150
tell when a user comes
back whether

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:54.630
or not they're described.

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:57.520
And on line 78-- this is an
important point here-- on line

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.250
78, what we're going to do is
we're going to echo the order

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:04.310
ID back in the response so
Google knows that we've

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:07.160
completed processing
this request.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.130
DAN: So that's all there
is to it, really.

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.920
We tried to keep the
integration very

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.100
straightforward.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.980
So we should have something
that's working right now.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.980
But there's one problem that
we haven't addressed yet.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:18.770
And the problem that we haven't
addressed is that

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:21.290
we've been doing all of this on
Joel's laptop, and that's

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:22.580
on the Google I/O network.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.220
And the server-to-server call
won't work from here.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.330
To fix this, we'll have to
push the App Engine.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:27.690
JOEL: Yep.

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:30.680
But in the interest of time, I
actually pushed this exact

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.930
code just a couple hours ago.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:36.760
So I'm just going to go hit
my App Engine instance.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.980
You'll notice the content looks
exactly the same as my

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.030
local host.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:43.130
I'm going to click on the
Subscribe button.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:44.840
This is going to pop
up the Google

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.820
Wallet payment dialogue.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:50.740
One thing you'll notice, it's
still Pay to Pug Lover.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:54.430
Just below that, you'll see
my list of credit cards.

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.460
You'll notice I have
one expired.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.435
And I'm just going to complete
this purchase with my AmEx.

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:04.070
And there we go.

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.760
Purchase went through.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.275
Or subscription went
through, actually.

00:22:07.275 --> 00:22:08.810
DAN ZINK: OK, so now
your JavaScript

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:09.960
success handler is called.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.290
The page is reloaded.

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:12.290
JOEL LEITCH: And there
it is. "Thank you for

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:17.330
your support!" [APPLAUSE]

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:20.700
DAN: So to recap here, we've
gone through four steps to do

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:21.420
this integration.

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.950
We added a Buy button
to Joel's page.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:25.870
We built a JWT on the server.

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:29.450
We passed the JWT into the
JavaScript function that the

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:30.740
library provides.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.630
And then we wrote a
postback handler.

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:35.100
So we've been trying to keep
this really straightforward,

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.720
try to make it as simple
as possible.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.380
But don't just take
our word for it.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:41.020
We've got Bryan from Kabam
here, who's done an

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.040
integration with us.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.860
And he'd like to
tell you more.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:44.620
Welcome, Bryan.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:45.870
BRYAN SCHWAB: Thanks.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:50.275
Hey, everyone.

00:22:50.275 --> 00:22:53.400
I'm Bryan Schwab, and I lead
the Payments Team at Kabam.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.960
And really happy to
be here today.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.520
This is my first Google I/O. And
what I'd like to talk to

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.960
you about today is a little bit
about what we do and how

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.290
we've integrated Google
Wallet into our games.

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:05.978
[INAUDIBLE]

00:23:05.978 --> 00:23:09.100
developers about integration,
as well as some tips for

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:10.350
monetization.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:14.430
Kabam is one of the leaders
in social games.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.950
We make games specifically
for hard-core gamers.

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:19.490
Some of our top games are
Dragons of Atlantis, Kingdoms

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:22.500
of Camelot, The Godfather:
Five Families, Thirst of

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.625
Night, Edgeworld, and others.

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:31.040
The Godfather was our first game
that we partnered with a

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.760
major movie studio.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.880
This game was really important
for us because it was the

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.860
first game that we launched
exclusively on Google+.

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:41.080
This game was on no other social
platform at the time.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.280
We also included it in the
Google Chrome store as well.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.950
And we were really happy
with this integration.

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:49.550
And Google was really great
about helping us with any

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:52.420
problems that we had, ironing
out, and making sure that we

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:53.640
got this launched on time.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.895
So it was a really positive
experience.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.960
Now I want to get into a few
tips to help you with your

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.920
integration.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.130
First off, you should definitely
read through all

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:07.550
the documentation, play with
the sample code, before you

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:08.880
even start coding.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.060
Really understand that
whole flow and how it

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:13.200
works in your mind.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.120
Break down the front end and
back end, and how it works.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.120
For our team, this is really
helpful, because once you

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.710
understand the whole situation
on how the platform works, you

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:24.010
can really break down the tasks
in the sprint and assign

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:26.890
it to different developers and
bring it together later.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.620
Next, the JWT is
very important.

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:37.980
So make sure that you use the
libraries that are provided.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.090
There's libraries provided
for multiple

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:41.650
different programming languages.

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:43.100
Bring those into your
project and use it.

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.690
There's no need to reinvent
the wheel.

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:51.660
Especially because JWT errors
can cause problems in the

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:52.910
transaction, it won't work.

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:54.450
So you don't want that at all.

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.850
Another thing you want to do
is create a unit test, such

00:24:56.850 --> 00:25:00.830
that when you generate your JWT
code, you check it with

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:02.400
what's provided in
the sample code.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.430
You want to make sure those
match up so you know and

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:07.400
you're pretty sure that
everything works correctly.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.750
For us, we had a problem when
we were first working with

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:13.170
this code that the JWT wasn't
generating correctly.

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:15.420
So we drilled down to the
specific class where it was

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.550
happening, and we fixed
the problem.

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:20.540
But then we followed it up by
writing a unit test and making

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.940
sure that that unit test always
checked that code to

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.170
make sure it was working.

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:25.600
And then we never had that
problem anymore.

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:29.990
Next, the Sandbox.

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:31.870
The Sandbox is very helpful.

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:34.060
Really, this is the first time
where your front end and back

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:35.440
end are going to come together,
and you're really

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.070
going to be testing
them as one unit.

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:40.640
This is also the first time,
as you've seen earlier, how

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.520
you're going to get real data
into your postback handler.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.430
So this is important to test
and make sure that the

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:49.250
postback handler is handling the
transaction correctly, and

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:51.510
you're seeing the output of
everything in the database,

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:53.510
and everything looks great.

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.955
Another good thing about this
is that, in the Sandbox, you

00:25:55.955 --> 00:25:57.120
have test credit cards.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.920
I was going to give out Pali's
credit card number today, but

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.270
I'm sure he wouldn't
like that.

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:04.680
Send it out to a wider audience
in your team, and

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.920
have everybody bang on it.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.820
And make sure if you find out
any issues you can address it

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:10.830
there in the Sandbox
before you go live.

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:11.800
For us, this was great.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.630
When we were on the road to
finishing up Godfather, we

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:16.565
were testing in the Sandbox.

00:26:16.565 --> 00:26:18.440
We had a tight iteration loop.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.740
And then it was really great to
just flip the switch and go

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.102
from Sandbox to production.

00:26:22.102 --> 00:26:23.755
It was very easy.

00:26:23.755 --> 00:26:25.430
So take advantage of
that resource.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.750
One of our top games
is Edgeworld.

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:34.070
And we make games for
hardcore gamers.

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:40.141
Our games involve strategy,
action, combat, and teamwork.

00:26:40.141 --> 00:26:43.440
Edgeworld is a game where it
immerses players in an epic

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.900
battle to take over this
abandoned alien world.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.950
And so what I'd like to do is
jump into the game right now

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:52.990
and show you how our Google
Wallet integration looks.

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.145
So here's my online base.

00:27:09.145 --> 00:27:11.190
And I've built up
my troops, and I

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:12.380
think I'm pretty powerful.

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:14.150
So I'm going to go and
attack somebody.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:19.330
Find a base that I've been
trying to attack for a while

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:22.740
now and send out some
troops and see if I

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.470
can win this time.

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:26.720
As we load the base--

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:34.985
let me pull up the Warp Gate,
select some units.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:41.380
I'll send this particular unit
in, along with a few of these.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:44.710
Send them into battle.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:47.240
Now, I can kind of tell off
hand that that probably

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.510
doesn't look very good.

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:52.370
Doesn't look like I'm
strong enough.

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:54.450
But in my head I thought
I was powerful enough.

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:58.073
But I guess that's
not gonna happen.

00:27:58.073 --> 00:27:59.323
Yeah.

00:28:06.454 --> 00:28:07.890
The black there.

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:08.670
That's me.

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:11.622
So I'm dead.

00:28:11.622 --> 00:28:13.840
So I'm going to leave
that base and

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:16.980
pretend that never happened.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.940
I really need to get some
more powerful units.

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:23.710
And our in-game currency
here is platinum.

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:27.072
So I'm going to go in and get a
little bit more platinum so

00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:29.020
that I can train my troops.

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.600
And I'm just going to
select one of the

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.280
payment options here.

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.810
And the cool thing about this
is now, with the streamlined

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:38.030
experience, I didn't have to
log in or do anything.

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:40.080
So I'm really happy
about that change.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:43.300
And earlier today, I actually
signed up for

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:44.910
this amazing pug blog.

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:47.480
So I already had my credit
card in here.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.625
So let me select that credit
card, hit Finish.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.290
Hopefully it'll go through.

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:59.500
Hit OK, and then back
to the game.

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.090
So as you can see, those
new changes really

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:03.190
made it pretty simple.

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:07.140
My time spent in paying was
pretty small, which is great.

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:18.000
Another thing I want to talk
about is best practices for

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.130
monetization.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:23.620
What you should do in your game
is create a price matrix

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.540
of all of your in-game currency
versus some of the

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.580
major currencies out there,
not just USD, but British

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:32.680
pounds, euros.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.540
Then you want to geolocate
your users.

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.540
You want to find out where
they're coming

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:36.940
from into your game.

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.100
There's plenty of libraries out
there that you can import

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:39.590
into your project.

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:43.640
There's free databases
to help with this.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.500
Once you have that, what you
want to do is hit them with a

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:49.170
combination of finding out where
they're coming from, and

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:51.120
then present them with the
language that's native to

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.316
them, as well as the currency.

00:29:53.316 --> 00:29:56.430
Now this is important for your
conversion, because users are

00:29:56.430 --> 00:30:00.090
used to thinking in their own
currency, calculating worth,

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:02.220
as well as reading
the language.

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:05.650
As you can see here, we have an
example of a user coming in

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:07.030
from Europe.

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:09.810
And the code we've detected,
they've come from Germany.

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:12.670
So we've served up the language
as German as well as

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:14.890
provided them the options
to purchase in euros.

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:20.370
Next, you want to think about
scaling your bonus items, if

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:22.530
you have bonus items.

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:25.040
We provide bonus items as part
of the package of buying

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.390
in-game currency.

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:30.050
And so what's key here is to
not just do a one-to-one of

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:32.660
price point to in-game currency
to bonus items.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.390
You want to scale those bonus
items up to make those higher

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:38.020
price points attractive.

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.390
And lastly is gifting.

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:42.610
Gifting was really successful
for us.

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:45.910
As you can see in this type of
game, it's really hard to

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:46.545
become powerful.

00:30:46.545 --> 00:30:49.510
And as you invite your friends,
they usually start in

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:51.910
a level where they're
not powerful at all.

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:55.180
So in order for everybody to
have fun, what happens is

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:57.760
their friends will gift them
items so that they can get up

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.690
to a higher level of power.

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:02.230
And everybody has a great
time at that point.

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:05.150
So it's really helpful.

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:07.800
Lastly, I'm going to leave you
with a few more tips when

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.750
you're working with
Google Wallet.

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:13.840
First is make your postbacks
idempotent.

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.990
This is important because you
want to be able to send the

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:19.270
transactions over and over
again, have the code check for

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:20.410
duplicates.

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:22.880
Where this helped us out was we
had a problem one time when

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.520
there was a timeout
in the database.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:27.210
So we were able to just resend
that transaction again.

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:29.450
The database was up, and
it went through.

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:33.640
Another place where this helps
you out is if you have a huge

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.310
list of test transactions.

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:38.600
And what you can do with that
is you can just send the

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.200
matcher postback and
really slam it.

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:43.370
And make sure that the load and
performance is there and

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:47.070
looks good before you go live.

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:49.815
Next is you want to track
everything about payments.

00:31:49.815 --> 00:31:51.670
I cannot stress this enough.

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:54.550
Any time that someone is in
your payments flow, in the

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:56.690
funnel, you want to track
everything that they do to

00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:59.010
find out where they drop off.

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:02.050
This is also important when
you're doing A/B testing.

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:04.850
When you have a hypothesis, you
want to make sure that you

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:07.340
can determine which one
is the successful one.

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.260
So record everything.

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.660
There's a lot of variables going
on here, IP addresses,

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.940
what they've chosen as their
price point, what the currency

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:18.000
that was served, everything that
comes in with a postback.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.170
Just record everything.

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:24.880
And lastly, think about other
countries outside of the US.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.016
The easy ones to pick off
right away are Canada,

00:32:28.016 --> 00:32:30.350
Australia, and the UK.

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:34.750
But also think about FIGS,
which is France, Italy,

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.290
Germany, and Spain.

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:38.650
And the cool thing about Google
Wallet is you can just

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:40.260
have your USD bank account.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.030
Google Wallet will take care of
all the translation of all

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:46.270
those currencies into yours.

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:47.290
So thank you, everybody.

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:49.470
I hope these tips
will help you.

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:51.450
I really enjoyed being
here today.

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:54.380
And hopefully this will help
you with your integration.

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:57.340
As you can see from the final
result, the new streamlined

00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.090
purchase flow is very nice.

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:01.740
And hopefully it'll also help
you with your monetization.

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:04.350
And for some really exciting
news about Google Wallet,

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:06.010
here's Pali.

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:06.870
PALI BHAT: Thanks, Bryan.

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:12.084
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:12.084 --> 00:33:14.890
PALI BHAT: You know, I guess
we put this slide together

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:19.030
before we saw Sergei's
skydiver stunt.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:23.880
So there's a new bar for
exciting at this year's Google

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:27.010
I/O. But I think this will
still be really, really

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:30.530
interesting to you guys.

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:33.440
So last year when we announced
the pricing for in-app

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.720
payments, it was huge.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:39.550
It was 5% flat for all
your transactions.

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:42.720
And that was a great rate
for developers.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.730
We've been getting amazing
feedback about this rate from

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:48.510
developers who've integrated
with us and developers who're

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:51.130
looking to integrate with us.

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:54.180
One of the things that we've
always been trying to do is

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:57.070
figure out how we can make
it better for developers.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:34:00.060
And as some of our developers
have gotten traction, like

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:04.180
Kabam and others, they started
to create these price matrices

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:07.900
where they give different
levels of buy-in to the

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:10.880
players of their game,
in Kabam's case.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:14.010
And they have goods that they're
selling everywhere

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:18.150
from $1 to $5, all the way
up to transactions that

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:21.080
are $300 at a time.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:25.880
And of course, the feedback we
get is that 5% is awesome when

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:29.130
you do a $1 transaction, because
all Google Wallet

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:32.199
takes from you is $0.05.

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:35.889
But it could be better for
larger transactions.

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:40.460
So if it's $100 transaction or a
$300 transaction, how do you

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.909
make it better for developers?

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:46.060
And the usual approach that all
of the solutions in the

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.550
market take is that
they create a

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:50.699
micro transaction rate.

00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:54.280
This is like the 5% rate we
have, which is really awesome.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.690
And then they create another
rate, which is for larger

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:59.970
transactions, or regular
transactions.

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:05.380
And that rate usually is tiered
along different volume

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:05.840
structures.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:08.700
So if you are higher volume,
you get a lower rate.

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:12.710
It's all sorts of confusing
tier structures.

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:15.380
In fact, you probably need a
degree to figure out how this

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.082
pricing works.

00:35:17.082 --> 00:35:19.760
And they usually have
long FAQ documents.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.650
That's usually the first sign
that this pricing is super

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:23.850
complicated.

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:28.450
So what we did was try to
simplify it all, and try to

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:31.210
figure out how we can make
it better for both micro

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:34.260
transactions and large
transactions, and just have

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:37.720
one price structure that
works for everybody.

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:42.350
So today, we want to announce
a new rate.

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:48.112
And that's 5%, or
1.9% plus $0.30.

00:35:48.112 --> 00:35:49.300
I'll repeat that.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:53.790
It's 5%, or 1.9% plus $0.30.

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:56.320
Of course, if you're a developer
in a different

00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:00.090
country, this fixed
fee will change.

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:01.920
What's different about
this rate?

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:07.570
What's different is Google will
automatically apply the

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:09.890
lowest fees for every
transaction.

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:12.490
We're not going to force you
to pick whether you're a

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:15.930
micro-transaction developer or a
large-transaction developer.

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:19.330
We'll just figure it out, and
we'll apply the lowest

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:20.410
transaction.

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:23.670
The second thing is we're not
going to have any volume

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:25.260
restrictions.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.890
Right from your first
transaction, we'll give you

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:30.760
the lowest fee.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.761
Bryan, how does that
sound to you?

00:36:32.761 --> 00:36:37.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:40.330
BRYAN SCHWAB: I'll tell you
that my CFO is going to be

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:41.800
happy about that.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.960
PALI BHAT: Yeah, indeed.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:46.930
And the commitment that Google
Wallet has to all you

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:49.760
developers is that we're
committed to increasing your

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.360
bottom line.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:55.290
For Google, we want to make sure
that you have the best

00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:58.480
rate, and you don't have to
think about whether it's small

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.150
transactions or larger
transactions.

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:03.060
The best thing is that as of--

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:05.590
Joel and Dan, what
was it, 3:00 PM?

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:06.410
DAN ZINK: Yeah, something
like that.

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:07.880
PALI BHAT: Something
like that.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.630
This has just gone live to all
existing and app payments

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:11.230
developers.

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:11.610
OK?

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:14.320
So if you are Google Wallet for
digital goods, and you're

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:17.850
using it today, you've done this
integration, everyone's

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:20.460
got this price automatically.

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.600
And if you integrate tomorrow,
or you try it out in the Code

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:27.170
Lab, 1:15 on Friday, we'll
just give it to you

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:27.850
automatically.

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:30.920
So starting from this point
on, this price is live.

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:37.550
So I want to wrap up and cover
what we talked about today.

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:40.080
The first thing is Google
Wallet is optimized for

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.960
digital content.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.500
Doesn't matter what kind
of digital content.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.260
You don't have to have an app.

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.660
It doesn't have to be
in-game currency.

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.920
It could be in-game currency
and in-app payments.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:55.670
It could be digital
content, like

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:57.090
music, that you're selling.

00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:59.110
Or it could be Joel's
pug blog.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:03.940
Whatever it is, you can monetize
using Google Wallet.

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:08.430
The second thing is that our
integration is really simple.

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:10.530
It's as simple as a few hours.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:12.030
Of course, if you're Dan
and Joel, it only

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:13.660
takes you 10 minutes.

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.410
Right?

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:18.790
The third is we announced
earlier that we'll support

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:21.885
both single-item purchases and
subscription purchases.

00:38:21.885 --> 00:38:23.830
This is already live
in Sandbox.

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:25.250
You can go try it
out right now.

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:31.680
The fifth thing I want to talk
about is how can you increase

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.970
your bottom line.

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:37.620
That new pricing that we showed
you is a huge step

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:39.260
towards increasing
your bottom line.

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:41.820
Other thing, of course, is that
convergence matters more

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:43.160
than everything else.

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:47.050
And with our streamlined flow
and streamlined signup, you

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:49.880
should have amazing conversion
with Google Wallet.

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:55.360
So in terms of next steps, I
just want to cover a quick few

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.090
next steps.

00:38:56.090 --> 00:39:00.600
First, we have a Code Lab
on Friday at 1:15.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.700
Do make sure you stop by.

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:04.800
And we can even show you how
to integrate with new

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:07.530
subscriptions right away.

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:11.000
We've given a set of links,
developer documentation,

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.100
creating an account,
and you can also

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.670
follow us on our blog.

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:16.590
Of course, if you want to go
back over the slide deck,

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:19.830
we've given a link
to that, too.

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:24.820
Before I wrap up and invite over
Dan, Joel, and Bryan for

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:29.000
questions, I want to just send
out a big thank-you to all you

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.480
developers from Google Wallet.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:35.210
The reason for us building these
products is so you guys

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:35.700
can use it.

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:37.220
So thank you for your support.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:40.290
And we hope with today's
announcement, you can monetize

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:43.670
your digital content much, much
better and increase your

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:46.320
bottom line while doing it.

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.310
Guys, if you want
to come over.

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:53.500
And of course, in true Google
I/O form, this entire

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:57.110
presentation was built in
HTML and impress.js.

00:39:57.110 --> 00:39:59.250
So huge thank-you to the
guys who built this and

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:00.760
open-sourced it.

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:05.060
And of course, we use some of
the cool pictures that are out

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:11.170
there on Flickr with the
Creative Commons license.

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:15.090
So with that, if you have any
questions, we're all happy to

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:16.470
answer them.

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:17.940
Thank you.

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:26.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:27.420
AUDIENCE: Hi, question
over here.

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:31.110
If you're going to look into
international markets, the tax

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:34.410
ramifications on these
charges, how are they

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:34.990
determined?

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:37.180
How do you know?

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.630
PALI BHAT: How do
we determine--

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:39.560
AUDIENCE: For instance,
say you do a

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.270
transaction in France.

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:43.400
Obviously, there's some amount
of money, from a tax

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:46.000
perspective, that has to be
remitted back to France, or to

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.470
you, or wherever.

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:49.280
How do you find your
notification, or how do you

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.990
actually determine
that amount?

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.950
PALI BHAT: OK.

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:55.680
So there are two
kinds of taxes.

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:59.600
So one is the tax that the user
pays, so the buyer pays,

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:03.370
and the tax the developer then
has to pay the same amount.

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:06.310
So on the buyer side, it's
really, really simple.

00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:10.830
We use tax tables that are
provided by both the developer

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:14.040
on our Merchant Center and
determine where the location

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:14.880
of the buyer is.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.980
So when they sign up for Google
Wallet, they have to

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:19.375
provide us their instrument
and their billing address.

00:41:19.375 --> 00:41:22.070
So we use that to determine
what the taxes are.

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:24.290
And of course, all developers
can go into our Merchant

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:26.630
Center, look at every order,
determine what the tax

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:28.900
ramifications of those are,
and then appropriately

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:30.810
complete their taxes.

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:31.540
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:32.790
PALI BHAT: Thank you.

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:35.780
Please.

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:38.940
AUDIENCE: What do you recommend
for a three-party

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:39.670
transaction?

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:45.150
Like I use the Paypal API, and
it allows me to take a cut,

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:49.780
pay the event director most
of it, and the credit card

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:51.395
payment happens once.

00:41:51.395 --> 00:41:54.620
Do you have any help for that?

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.250
PALI BHAT: Yeah, so
great question.

00:41:56.250 --> 00:42:01.390
So what you're looking for is
how do I partition and do a

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:04.450
rev share to a third party?

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:06.720
With our current integration,
we've tried to keep it really,

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.940
really simple.

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:11.670
And part of that simplicity is
that, today, we don't allow

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:13.980
you to rev share to
a third party.

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.350
However, this is something
that we are

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:16.610
actively looking at.

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:20.520
So stay tuned in to our blog,
and you might see some

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.800
exciting announcements
come up.

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.756
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:24.756 --> 00:42:25.210
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:27.434
So you mentioned in the demo,
showed off in the demo,

00:42:27.434 --> 00:42:30.640
rather, the seller information
that you put in.

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.860
You used the email
in your example.

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:37.250
What extra metadata is
available for those

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:37.750
transactions?

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:40.050
Obviously, if I missed that
callback that's made by Google

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:42.810
Wallet for whatever reason, I'm
going to have to have some

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:46.780
kind of backup that runs
on a scheduled basis.

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:49.630
Can I get those transactions
back through the API in order

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:51.070
to make sure that my records
are correct?

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:58.200
JOEL LEITCH: So if you were
to miss a postback--

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:01.370
there was that one important
step that I mentioned that--

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:03.620
writing out the order ID
into the response.

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:08.420
If that actually fails, then we
would actually terminate,

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:09.740
or cancel, the order.

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.240
And you can reconcile that
in the Merchant Center.

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:19.710
AUDIENCE: Any kind of general
transaction data?

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:22.560
If I want to run my own
analytics, for example, or I

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:24.325
lose my data for whatever
reason, and I want to recreate

00:43:24.325 --> 00:43:26.240
my database?

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.150
JOEL LEITCH: So all the
transaction information is in

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.920
Merchant Center.

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:31.460
You can pull some reports off
Merchant Center and then do

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:35.800
the reconciliation in
an offline process.

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.210
PALI BHAT: So you can definitely
do that on the

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:39.030
Merchant Center site.

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:42.320
And if you want to dive in
further, you can just stop by

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:46.820
one of our booths or in the Code
Lab on Friday, 1:15, and

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:48.870
we'll be happy to work through
some of the ideas with you.

00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:49.390
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:50.840
PALI BHAT: Yeah.

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:53.300
AUDIENCE: Quick question about
the user interface.

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:56.210
Does it automatically detect
the mobile browsers and

00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:58.690
launches the Play application,
or--

00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:04.350
JOEL LEITCH: What we're showing
you right now is a

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:05.580
web-based UI.

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:08.900
It will detect if you're on a
desktop web interface or a

00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:11.665
mobile web interface and show
you the appropriate flow.

00:44:11.665 --> 00:44:13.590
It does not kick over
to Google Play.

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:20.740
PALI BHAT: Any other
questions?

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:23.690
OK.

00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:25.660
If nothing else, thank
you for coming.

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:27.160
Really enjoyed having
you guys here.
