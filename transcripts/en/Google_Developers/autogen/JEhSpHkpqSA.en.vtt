 very good we are in this version 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.080
 google developer live in spanish broadcast 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.820
 special from the technological heart of 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.740
 been united in this silicon valley in 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.250
 where are we going to talk to today 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.570
 on the google cloud platform 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.420
 specifically about open data 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.760
 about open data in the region and for 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.650
 what better than our expert 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.570
 expert of course we have here 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.449
 present with us from the 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.250
 cloud platform team felipe hoffa in 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.350
 which will be talking about the cases 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.850
 of success some very elements 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.280
 interesting and we will be analyzing 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.570
 of course all the information of what 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.489
 pending and the google tools and 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.470
 with contribution as they contribute these 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.960
 course to our regional ecosystem 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.089
 so without more let's go to the presentation 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.339
 from our expert today 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.930
 felipe hoffa is a pleasure to be with you 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.790
 conversing in today's constant 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.739
 thank you for having me here very well 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.659
 good good felipe I would like us 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.070
 you start to comment a bit to me at all 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.979
 the audience very interested in this 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.960
 effect of open data in general 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.549
 complexities that they have of course and 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.270
 some now we will be talking 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.860
 today in our interview 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.930
 particular but that is the first point 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.610
 that I have to keep in mind when 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.470
 I'm working open data in the 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.900
 open data region 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.110
 let's start with tim berners-lee who invented 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.580
 the impressive website 20 years ago 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.580
 25 years back exactly 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.830
 finally all the data could be 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.280
 connected we can explore precisely 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.700
 five years ago he comes to make a 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.970
 talk where he says declares the success of his 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.000
 first vision and gives us the next 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.610
 mission is where we have to go now 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.630
 and what we have to do now is 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.810
 share non-raw data 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.250
 said particularly speaking of that of 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.930
 that felipe conference is very 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.909
 interesting because there is a very 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.530
 motivational inside the attentive talk 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.780
 of everyone screaming is not true and 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.660
 they scream because that's one of those 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.800
 the questions does not make us scream gnaw 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.860
 from aitana 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.870
 that raw data now precisely see the 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.180
 video meeting lenses tim berners-lee 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.860
 about the future web or with 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.170
 subtitles in Spanish if you want that is 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.220
 very interesting the best part is that no 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.110
 they heard this winter if he's right 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.540
 government around the world are 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.840
 making your data your data portals 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.340
 exact public but I was actually 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.440
 analyzing we were analyzing I think that 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.640
 you have us to share because 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.290
 you commented on governments around the world 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.030
 and also in our region is 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.440
 important that everyone is 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.360
 aware that we have our 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.950
 governments involved in the path of 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.170
 exact 'open data' look here between 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.270
 some for example the usa with the 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.950
 first clear but not only usa 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.750
 up to argentina 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.570
 you have worked with good data 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.680
 aires the city of colombia here you 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:04.230
 I found in Spain clear we also have 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.350
 Uruguay has a good place Lima has 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.770
 your city has its data portal 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.140
 and for the specific case that we are going to 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.050
 see today 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.000
 chile chile chile so we're going to be 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.440
 analyzing the data but before 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 enter us into them because I know that 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.930
 he was an expert in the field and all the 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.069
 world that is not watching for 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.750
 course, you are very interested in knowing 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.420
 that you found in the portals because 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.040
 basically not in detail but which 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.140
 are the most common data that are 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.990
 publishing the portals in general 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.459
 what are the main utilities 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.630
 that they are giving to governments then 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.370
 let's see the chili very well but in 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.770
 general that you could observe of the 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.800
 data sets that you were analyzing the 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.480
 governments publish everything or we have 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.230
 economic information information 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.690
 social housing information there is a 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.080
 endless data that are interesting from 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.120
 analyze correct 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.430
 exact good but the main problem 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.110
 that you are leaving is surely imagining 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.540
 you're following us there in this 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.460
 precise moment is that how are we going 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.660
 those data that are available and there 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.480
 we are going to ask our 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.760
 expert how we started using that 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.530
 information in a productive way like 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.670
 we show you why are you commenting felipe 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.040
 it's very interesting that there are so many 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.510
 information but how are we going to start 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.820
 to process and where we are going to see the 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.380
 this is what you have to tell us about 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.210
 What is the case that we are going about? 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.950
 to see on clear day here in 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.890
 chile in a portal 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.620
 fixed is the pharmacy do it education 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.420
 and I looked at the biggest rate that 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.150
 I had basically I like 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.100
 work with bit cave the database 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.160
 of google that allows you to analyze in 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.750
 line accurate data frames and decide 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.660
 find the data is the largest in this 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.230
 portal ok it turns out that is the census 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.930
 2002 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.750
 15 million Chileans all 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.780
 answers that gave several files 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.630
 for each file in a different table and 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.460
 here you can see the biggest one is the table 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.770
 of people ok 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.950
 every 15 million rows each with 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.560
 his answer and they left three files 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.310
 two 90-megapixel tablets one of 10 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.170
 megas 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.720
 and these data are available are 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.730
 open the question is what do we do with 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.110
 them exact there is complexity not 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.450
 because you commented we have all the 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.040
 available data that is in the portal 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.510
 we can also say what is the portal 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.960
 in which you are extracting the data 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:27.690
 how is the url of the point data portal 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.310
 go uve point cl ok there is all the 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.990
 information that the government of chile 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.390
 is obviously leaving in the in the 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.190
 open data environment with a license 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.980
 creative commons that allows us to 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.410
 we use it share 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.630
 do analysis on this exact data 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.130
 what felipe did is what is 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.470
 generating in all countries in this 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.390
 case of chile is one but actually in 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.180
 all of Latin America that you commented on 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.750
 generally the world is also 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.010
 running with the same licenses 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.290
 You also find some other 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.900
 licenses in general is a creative 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:00.090
 commons is one of the best licenses 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.830
 important that people choose in the 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.240
 least restrictive license is 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.420
 that's why that allows us all 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.730
 be able to work with data with a lot 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.900
 more exact freedom so you were 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.000
 enter to the portal 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.920
 you got the information as you comment 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.210
 in three files but the problem that you 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.490
 I'm going to start planting and here we are going to 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.110
 inquire our expert towards you that 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.520
 you are of course following us as 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.470
 always on google I saw her in this 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.750
 special version from silicon valley 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.700
 of course here with felipe hoffa 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.650
 the downloads have what format they are 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.540
 happy everything to show this story 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.360
 but I'm going to show her her life but 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:36.480
 project all part is not true with 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:39.710
 these three files I try to download them 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.710
 we use w 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:45.750
 by console and come on we are downloading 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:47.639
 the exact ones it takes 22 seconds in 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.729
 downloading the first type took me a minute 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:53.550
 in lowering the three I have another in files 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:55.949
 190 mega on my hard drive that I do with 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:59.250
 what I do is act of buying the 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:07:02.219
 points and unzipping that was delayed 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:04.139
 about ten seconds supercomputer 

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:07.169
 that we already have about 22 seconds of 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:10.229
 work one minute going down and the second 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:13.740
 unzipping and it gives me a point file 

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:16.500
 that single-sided 1-point bird and we look for 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.830
 the extension and we do not know what is it that 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.990
 his actions has appeared efe pss 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.069
 spc1 csps exact from the software that 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.469
 It is used for processing 

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:26.849
 statistic someone knows someone 

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:28.199
 I have it installed now I do not have 

00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:30.330
 installed you are there if you have 

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:32.909
 some you have installed surely not 

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:35.819
 happy then ok 

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:38.090
 they are open data but I can not do 

00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:40.760
 nothing with them 

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:43.699
 in my first step now the next 

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:46.220
 step is how far this data 

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:47.690
 I went to the place investigate where you have to 

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.460
 investigate what surely 

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.290
 developers are imagining in this 

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.479
 precise moment felipe is not true 

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.990
 in the taco bell flow tax elector 

00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:59.479
 and after several hours investigating 

00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:03.770
 I managed to write a program in ere that ls 

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:08.860
 pss face and passes them to csb point too 

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:11.259
 now I have 36 and 20 tables with cc bs 

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.610
 with a little magic what I want 

00:08:11.259 --> 00:08:16.560
 put all these columns together in one 

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.560
 file to magic 

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.770
 and if I eat you a routine in python 

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.270
 let's say he's going to show it to 

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.980
 developers or surely they can 

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:27.500
 observe at this precise moment those 

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:31.130
 magic lines of exact felipe the finger 

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:33.710
 of the 30 active ones of 1 this in a 

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:36.680
 ultrafast computer in 6 minutes 

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:39.160
 they are talking about 1.1 gigas of data 

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.160
 loose 

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:46.690
 and finally after giving enough 

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:48.399
 work I managed to have an active csb ok that 

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:50.459
 the government could have could have me 

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:53.800
 offered that instead of that pss 

00:08:50.459 --> 00:08:56.050
 but I still have the question what do I do 

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.180
 with this clear now we get to the point 

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:59.560
 that we had the csb but but not 

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:02.140
 we did nothing yet all that process 

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.820
 it took how long to clean a 

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:06.190
 expert programmer because there are there 

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:08.020
 We do not force knowledge and want 

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:10.930
 look for meaning only time 

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.459
 of processing we have already return a 

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:14.950
 hour but at the time of passing 

00:09:12.459 --> 00:09:17.830
 researching looking for more 

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:20.860
 exact and now how do we analyze the data 

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:22.450
 in a spreadsheet I do not think it's the best 

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:26.170
 Solution not doing so much 

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:27.910
 of data I can program without using for 

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:29.410
 example the data store load the data 

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.820
 in the data but it would not be either 

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.950
 right because we are talking about these 

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.050
 database concepts can also 

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:36.970
 use normal sql database and a 

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:38.680
 very clear but they will always have a 

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:44.110
 limit how fast my computer 

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:46.540
 how much memory do I have and of course I 

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:48.370
 wants to live I know her as 

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:50.710
 the expert here who knows her 

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.790
 diary is eyes felipe so we use my 

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.470
 exact leather 

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:54.880
 we skip this time the description of 

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:56.860
 my squad can watch your videos 

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.510
 assumptions or follow felipe in the 

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.520
 English version also where by 

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:02.020
 Of course there is the definition and everything 

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.360
 what can be done with my exact picture 

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:07.800
 but for now after these 22 

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:12.800
 minutes plus a lot of work 

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.800
 let's upload what is fsb to google 

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:18.089
 once it's in google cloud storage 

00:10:15.529 --> 00:10:20.430
 we can import the visual data ok 

00:10:18.089 --> 00:10:21.750
 I'm going to show the scripts so far 

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:23.640
 to do it the short version 

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.260
 perfect says the procedure 

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.290
 while you're working, let's say it's 

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:30.029
 also once I have sccb if I already 

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:32.430
 subo klaus now yes I'm already using 

00:10:30.029 --> 00:10:35.430
 the google platform placed the data 

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:37.019
 set 6 and imported them to see exactly what 

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:39.329
 you can do by entity and you can 

00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:41.730
 do by web here the writer is like 

00:10:39.329 --> 00:10:44.579
 I did it by web effect three minutes 

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:46.709
 then we are ready to explore the 

00:10:44.579 --> 00:10:48.930
 data that good I do not see the time and 

00:10:46.709 --> 00:10:50.430
 surely to you developer that does not 

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:52.649
 they are following not only the developers 

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.779
 but everyone involved is also in 

00:10:52.649 --> 00:10:56.850
 this technological environment that motivates 

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:59.279
 daily in Latin America in our 

00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:01.350
 I wanted Latin America and in all the speech 

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:02.040
 Hispanic women are waiting for those questions 

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:04.560
 felipe 

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.600
 those consultations and let's see some consultations 

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.029
 for example how many elements we have 

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:11.519
 here I have a query in the browser 

00:11:09.029 --> 00:11:13.680
 My cave was already written from 

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:15.410
 select you sing disc run the box 

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.899
 even though 

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:20.180
 and the row number exactly the 

00:11:17.899 --> 00:11:22.459
 number of people visible how many 

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:25.129
 we have there like 15 million rows 

00:11:22.459 --> 00:11:27.440
 perfect we can ask three questions 

00:11:25.129 --> 00:11:29.449
 for example more complicated issues like 

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.279
 how religions are distributed 

00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:34.279
 useful what barbarian what barbarian what 

00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:36.439
 interesting that felipe and I would like 

00:11:34.279 --> 00:11:37.610
 start listening to what you have for 

00:11:36.439 --> 00:11:39.680
 offer us in the consultations you said 

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:41.000
 religions distributions religions in 

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.370
 chile is something very interesting that comes out 

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.910
 of the open data set data that 

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:48.350
 we have exact here I have the query 

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:50.870
 it was a small thing that not many people 

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:53.329
 You still know that you can autocomplete 

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:55.069
 in the grid that I did not know that 

00:11:53.329 --> 00:11:57.860
 that I heard for example, I'm ready 

00:11:55.069 --> 00:12:00.769
 here and I see the three tables that 

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:02.180
 they start consensus I will put the one of 

00:12:00.769 --> 00:12:04.940
 person 

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:07.250
 column p 28 says what religion I'm going 

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:10.370
 to ask square and tell me according to 

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:11.839
 that column and we have results but 

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:15.260
 the results are not easy to read 

00:12:11.839 --> 00:12:18.200
 are encoded as modified by the 

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:20.089
 exact government but Maria I have to go 

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.070
 to look for the schema let's say basically 

00:12:20.089 --> 00:12:24.170
 that we long to see us in the same portal 

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:26.930
 of gum you can find what is the 

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:29.300
 scheme and what does each column mean by 

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:35.870
 example of 28 that we have in this case 

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:37.270
 is the religion and if we go together 

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:39.740
 the results with what it means 

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:41.270
 we can see here what are the 

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:43.670
 most popular religions and the least 

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:45.950
 popular in Chile in 2002 in 

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:47.540
 a distribution of religions very 

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:50.170
 quickly and how long it took to do 

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:54.230
 that query 15 million records 

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:55.040
 how long do we take 1.5 according to gara and 1.5 

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:57.560
 seconds 

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.839
 it's really impressive if really 

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:01.970
 and the grace that now you can do 

00:12:59.839 --> 00:13:05.370
 interactive query without defining indexes 

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:07.260
 without making correct processing pre 

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:08.680
 for example or that we already know the 

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.270
 religions 

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.010
 How would you look for what is the religion that 

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:13.960
 is growing faster good felipe 

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:16.720
 It's super easy because in this case 

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.370
 we could compare the data sets but 

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.770
 if we have work data sets as we do 

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:22.620
 in this case we have a column that is 

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:24.660
 the number of children 

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:28.980
 then we can quickly write 

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:30.990
 a question I have here the number 

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.220
 average of children per religion maybe 

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:34.860
 nobody had ever seen this question 

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:37.020
 before and we can add regional 

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:39.930
 we can look for what we want 

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:43.190
 ask in this case here I have the 

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:46.530
 data divided by religion that 

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:48.120
 religions have more children and it is very very 

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:50.340
 interesting what Felipe says because 

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.830
 that the amount of opportunities that it gives 

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:55.110
 a set of data already placed on my leather 

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:57.660
 and basically because when you start playing 

00:13:55.110 --> 00:14:00.450
 and detect and discover things that are not 

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.530
 there is something that many also use that 

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.150
 many journalists use 

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:05.420
 research is not true that they are supported 

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:08.640
 in the open data sets and start 

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:10.260
 walk or determine the strata of a 

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.540
 country is very interesting the concept that 

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:14.250
 it was being placed not clear happens to us 

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.730
 a lot are very used to us 

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.730
 give the data 

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:21.610
 processed do not explain us how 

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.310
 they simply tell us these are the 

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:26.020
 exact numbers and always ways 

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:28.510
 other than the data if they have the 

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:31.150
 raw data if they have tools to 

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:33.280
 analyze them you can make your own 

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:35.050
 questions and with virtual and what can 

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.430
 do freely because basically it 

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:38.440
 can register the levels but already what 

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:40.210
 you know let's say very quickly they enter 

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.250
 the console and there's the data set and 

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:44.200
 well let's see later but to 

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.880
 see I was going to ask you more let's say 

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.110
 how do I share but I am that you have more 

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.880
 surprises for us so let's continue 

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:50.530
 seeing the clear axes says two pictures 

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.810
 more than example each one for example 

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:55.120
 leaving the subject religions how many 

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:58.600
 children on average have mothers 

00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:00.820
 according to here they are in that they are occupied 

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.860
 pretty interesting photos or 

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.940
 we can analyze it later of course 

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.440
 of course it is very interesting what 

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.270
 He also comments because women already 

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:09.640
 see how many children they have if they are 

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:12.010
 occupied in an employee in a job 

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:14.380
 traditional if they are enterprising because you 

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:15.910
 you know that there is now a current 

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:17.650
 said in very big chile let's say of 

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:19.330
 enterprising women too and it is very 

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:21.310
 interesting to see it in that sense so 

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.610
 or the unemployed because I think you should 

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:24.740
 have also 

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.720
 is the domestic service 

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:29.089
 domestic we can analyze all that very 

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.250
 ok with my account and we can do joyce 

00:15:29.089 --> 00:15:33.829
 we also have the table of people 

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:35.450
 we have the household table we can see 

00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:36.890
 as such 

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.870
 what tools do people use to 

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:40.880
 cook ok etc 

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:42.709
 and there technically we are going to put it to 

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.470
 try the expert developers who 

00:15:42.709 --> 00:15:47.870
 he always said how much it costs him to see 

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:50.060
 and being a joint member in general costs 

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:51.769
 a little more structurally as you see 

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.959
 that when I start to link because 

00:15:51.769 --> 00:15:56.209
 in the relational data it cost not 

00:15:53.959 --> 00:15:58.720
 but usual and costs it does not cost 

00:15:56.209 --> 00:16:00.879
 perhaps 

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:04.240
 it's still a difficult subject as 

00:16:00.879 --> 00:16:07.389
 always but the ability to join two 

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:09.850
 tables of a terabyte there are companies that 

00:16:07.389 --> 00:16:12.160
 they have all their sales and they also take 

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:14.050
 all the weather the record of time 

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:17.139
 for each exact day they are able to 

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:19.300
 cross that data or cross your data from 

00:16:17.139 --> 00:16:22.240
 Google analytics with your sales data 

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:24.100
 with your exact usage data really 

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.560
 surprising 

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.879
 in that sense felipe and we're back to 

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.620
 topic too but from the point of 

00:16:27.879 --> 00:16:30.879
 seen then many companies and 

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.500
 governments also use what they 

00:16:30.879 --> 00:16:35.290
 they called and lola 

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.189
 the analytical let's say for that case 

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:39.970
 particular would be a solution 

00:16:36.189 --> 00:16:42.370
 interesting but of course the app is a 

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:44.980
 Tremendous tool of jaén and back in 

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:46.959
 general to work what it requires is 

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:49.389
 a giant amount of pre 

00:16:46.959 --> 00:16:51.819
 processing and definition of the cube 

00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:53.560
 the exact dimensions in vitoria are 

00:16:51.819 --> 00:16:54.780
 it is necessary once the data is 

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.810
 above 

00:16:54.780 --> 00:17:00.510
 or you can look for any dimension that 

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:02.550
 you want that makes it super attractive 

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:04.350
 for governments in general of what 

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:05.970
 we are showing this example now 

00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:06.960
 we see more of the example but for all 

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:08.540
 the developers that are us 

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.830
 looking and for all the fans 

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:12.750
 technological also that follow us in 

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:14.520
 this google or by live here in the 

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:16.740
 heart of silicon valley this remains 

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:19.050
 available felipe this is a model to 

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.450
 follow is not true that what we are 

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:23.130
 transmitting not exact take the 

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:24.990
 public data leave shipments query 

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:27.409
 nothing better than parts that can share 

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:29.610
 the Caesars 

00:17:27.409 --> 00:17:32.879
 Basically you can go to your data set 

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:35.530
 find how to share it look here I have 

00:17:32.879 --> 00:17:38.830
 for example the descent he 

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:42.940
 the Chilean census I will share the data 

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:45.340
 set and I'll share it with everyone 

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:47.280
 the people who can enter the eric disk 

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:51.160
 it's something to train and leather icloud.com 

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:52.630
 you can see these data that are 

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.670
 like the cans sets that are also 

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:57.340
 public because some that by defects 

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:59.830
 of the wikipedia of different things that 

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:01.660
 they are like public of ita sets let's say you 

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:03.790
 you can also make your data the public 

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:06.460
 this process is good what the 

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:08.500
 community a community working on 

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:10.900
 the data is open in beat query 

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.100
 it's not called interesting we limit ourselves not 

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:14.350
 to all the newspapers but of course 

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:16.510
 they start working on it I do not know 

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:20.910
 a better way to share data 

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:22.690
 public leave them immediately 

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:25.110
 enabled for people to do 

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:28.210
 questions for people to occupy them 

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:29.770
 that is very interesting and good at 

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:32.110
 general we were seeing then for 

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:34.720
 make a synthesis we were not seeing 

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:36.970
 how is the process that takes us from 

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.740
 the portal if in any of the countries 

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:42.280
 to change but as I have the data and 

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:44.170
 it came to leave it shared in bit 

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:45.970
 widely accessible query where 

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:48.250
 even I can access with clients not 

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:50.260
 certain web clients mobile clients and 

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:52.390
 start manipulating your data I already have 

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:55.780
 I want to start programming in Chile 

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:57.640
 according to hackney 12 people came to be 

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:59.830
 some of guava script joined them with 

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:02.380
 the maps visualize how the 

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:04.330
 Wow people was absolutely interesting 

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:06.040
 and have had comments to me already to go 

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:07.750
 also closing our our process 

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.710
 of today's day let's say what 

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:10.060
 they were the examples because they are very 

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:11.590
 interesting what happened in chile and 

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:13.630
 what do we want to invite for 

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:15.160
 course at all regional levels 

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:16.630
 to add this movement of data 

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.100
 open and start using these 

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.240
 tools that happened in chile because 

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.210
 there are very good applications 

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:24.740
 clark healthy this daniel fuenzalida did 

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:26.840
 together with map for what 

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:30.170
 make it possible to visualize all these 

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:32.900
 pictures on the map of chile makes 

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:35.330
 images proportional to numbers 

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.830
 numbers that go towards more images 

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:38.630
 large depending if there were more 

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:42.110
 amount of people in that exact region 

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:43.580
 for the question that had exact or 

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:44.929
 cristian pérez a very visualization 

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:48.290
 interesting about how people are 

00:19:44.929 --> 00:19:50.330
 migrating within the country that of what 

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:51.620
 commune that as a van that's very 

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:52.760
 interesting even for governments 

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.990
 same because when you see him 

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.580
 question let's say to them 

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:57.500
 Departament say how are the 

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:59.990
 internal migratory movements or 

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:01.730
 queries that are difficult to answer 

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:04.160
 the questions difficult to answer in 

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:06.170
 minutes we could do it or in second 

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:08.540
 exact and we're done in two hours 

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:10.670
 three hours where we passed that they did not 

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:13.330
 they knew visual since I passed them the 

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:16.850
 data that used everything they already knew 

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:19.760
 over javascript maps and managed to put together 

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:24.050
 all really very very very interesting 

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:26.030
 felipe some advice that leaves you 

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:27.550
 the developers and this community of 

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:30.020
 regional developers that 

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:31.130
 permanently is enthusiastic about 

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.900
 google technologies 

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:35.510
 enthusiast of this movement of data 

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:37.250
 open as I knew how quickly 

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:38.780
 start collaborating what are your 

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:40.490
 tips 

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:42.500
 there are two things we can do one if 

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:45.530
 I have data is to upload it to liquefy and 

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:47.570
 share them and the other is to share this 

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:49.430
 video if they know people who have data 

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:51.500
 public and knows people what government in 

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:53.990
 the banks everything they can share 

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:56.160
 data share this video shows the 

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:58.470
 ability to see and 

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:00.270
 with this mode the world when we are the 

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:02.340
 world and with that message we said goodbye 

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:04.500
 of this special emission in the silicon 

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:06.780
 valley with team felipe josva 

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:08.730
 of experts from the cloud platform of 

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:11.190
 google in this particular case talking 

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:12.960
 of open data so keep programming 

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:14.580
 continue to develop share the 

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:16.740
 information and we continue with this 

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:18.570
 technological evolution that he proposes 

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:20.760
 our dearest region many 

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:21.510
 thank you very much thank you all and we 

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.040
 we see 

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.390
 possibly in following issues 

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:27.500
 felipe thank you very much for joining us 

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:27.500
 Thank God
