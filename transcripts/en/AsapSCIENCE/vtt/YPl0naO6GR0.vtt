00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.799
There are...a lot of popular diets out there.
So we thought we’d create a simple video

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.740
investigating which ones are scientifically
sound, and actually work.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.930
From the outside it seems like a simple equation:
your weight is determined by the balance between

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.930
the calories you take in, and the calories
you burn. By changing what you eat or your

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.440
activity level, you can tip this equation
towards weight gain or loss. Which brings

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.050
us to our first category of diets:

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.740
Calorie Restriction. Companies like Weight
Watchers claim you can eat whatever you want,

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.170
as long as you stay below a prescribed number
of daily calories. Getting all your calories

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.660
from junk food is technically allowed, but
from a health perspective, it’s important

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.160
to think of the nutritional value of the foods
too. If you don’t, you risk heart problems,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.850
nutrient deficiencies and chronic health issues.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.030
Calorie Restriction with Optimal Nutrition
or CRON diets, generally reduce their caloric

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.250
intake by 20% while still meeting the daily
nutritional requirements. For example, instead

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.010
of having a whole apple, a CRON dieter will
just have the apple skin, which contains most

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.150
of the nutrients.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.400
If used properly (and not excessively), calorie
restriction can be a safe and effective tool

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.470
for weight loss.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.800
Next up is Carb Restriction. Many diets like
the South Beach, Atkins, or Zone Diet suggest

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.570
that carbs are the enemy of the fit body you’ve
always dreamed of.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.570
The ideology claims that when more carbs are
taken in than burned off, the liver converts

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.110
them into fats. But for most healthy, reasonably
active people, carbs are broken down to glucose

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.550
and transported to the cells for energy. Very
little is actually turned into fat.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.120
In response to excessive glucose, the body
uses insulin to turn it into glycogen, which

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.280
is stored in the liver and muscles. This glycogen
may later be broken down in times of low glucose,

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.520
to refuel the body.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.470
But the type of carbs you eat do matter - those
from simple sugars like honey, fruit or sugar

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.300
are more readily turned into triglycerides
or fat than complex carbs like whole grains

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.200
and veggies. If you consistently eat way more
than necessary, and most calories are simple

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.670
carbs, then these will be converted to fat.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.780
Low carb diets often have extreme restriction
at first; no starches like bread or pasta,

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.640
and no sugars including from fruits or even
alcohol. This can lead to some intense side

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.890
effects, including constipation, dry mouth,
bad breath, fatigue, dizziness and nausea.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.390
In studies, carb restriction dieters tend
to lose weight faster, initially, compared

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.680
to those simply using calorie restriction,
but this is likely due to water loss, which

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.120
returns in later phases when you’re encouraged
to eat normally again.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.700
On top of this, the Atkins diet, for example,
promotes caloric intake from high-fat and

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.920
high-protein sources, which means meats, cheeses,
cream, butter and...losing weight? Sounds

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.099
pretty good right? But many doctors show concern
over the high intake of saturated fat - that

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.630
may lead to more ‘bad’ cholesterol and
therefore an increased risk of heart disease.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.950
Some claim these kinds of diets are dangerous
and unhealthy, given that they promote the

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.630
limitation of foods like carrots, sweet potatoes,
or apples, that provide the body with important

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.459
micronutrients and vitamins. Instead, people
require supplements, which the body is not

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.990
able to absorb as effectively as vitamins,
minerals and micronutrients in whole foods.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.350
Then there are High Protein Diets. The main
principle is that protein rich foods are not

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.680
as easily broken down by the body and take
more energy to digest than carb-rich food.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.230
This means you won’t feel hungry again as
quickly, and you’re more likely to run a

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.810
caloric deficit than if you ate the same number
of calories from carbs.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.371
The Paleo Diet, for example, suggests that
10,000 years ago agriculture was introduced,

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:29.890
and the human diet changed from hunter-gathers
eating primarily meat, wild fruits, veggies

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.700
and nuts, to diets containing more grains.
And as a result, some believe the human body

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.410
isn’t designed to digest these processed
foods like grains, dairy, and breads. Some

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.870
also believe that grains lead to inflammation
related health problems, but this is largely

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.250
untrue except in the case of people with celiac
disease.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.620
But because of it’s straightforward guidelines,
many find it easy to follow, and it does promote

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.910
more nutrient absorption. However, as paleo
cuts out all grains and legumes, we lose an

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.519
important source of dietary fibre necessary
to keep our bowels running smoothly. Not to

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:07.130
mention the high protein leads to nitrogen
production meaning stinky farts! Add to that

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.300
constipation which allows your digested material
to sit longer in the large intestine and continuing

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.920
to decompose and...yup. Smelly farts.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.300
Now there is another class of diets we might
call the “Just Stop Eating” Diets. Those

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.499
looking to ‘get slim quick’ might be tempted
to only eat cabbage soup for 7 days, or do

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:29.740
the ‘Master Cleanse Diet’ which only allows
salt water in the morning and a concoction

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.019
of water, maple syrup, lemon and cayenne pepper
through the day, and a laxative tea at night

00:04:35.019 --> 00:04:39.339
- but these diets are exceptionally unhealthy.
Not only is most of your weight loss from

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:43.940
water weight, but there are many side effects
such as dizziness, fatigue, dehydration and

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.940
nausea.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.409
The Master Cleanse can ever lead to a white
tongue, which some claim is the toxins leaving

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:54.001
your body, but it’s actually due to swelling
and a yeast infection of the mouth. And after

00:04:54.001 --> 00:04:57.650
going through all that, you’re likely to
gain any weight lost after stopping.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.199
Then of course there are straight up crazy
diets. Like eating cotton balls dipped in

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.690
soup or juice so that you feel full, which
of course provides hardly any nutritional

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.409
content and can cause intestinal blockages
which require surgical intervention.

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:15.370
Or how about the sleeping beauty diet where
you just...sleep? You can’t eat if you’re

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.389
always asleep! The truth is most diets focusing
on quick, dramatic results also have a ‘yo-yo’

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.569
effect, where you lose initial weight but
slow down your metabolic rate, so your body

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:29.659
starts burning less calories. And when you
start eating again...there’s all the weight

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:31.360
back, and often more!

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.710
After following contestants from the show
‘The Biggest Loser’ for 6 years - some

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:40.560
of which who had lost hundreds of pounds in
7 months - scientists noticed something interesting.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.839
Not only did most of the participants in the
study regain their weight, but their metabolic

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:50.879
rates changed. One man in particular now burns
800 fewer calories a day than would be expected

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:56.520
for a man his size! This is 6 years after
leaving the show, showing how extreme measures

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.190
to lose weight - while they may be successful
at the time - have long lasting impacts on

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.550
your metabolism, making it harder to keep
off weight in the future.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.960
The hard truth is, that even using many of
the principled diets, about 97% of people

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.150
regain everything lost and sometimes more
within 3 years. If you want to lose weight,

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.649
finding a diet that works for you and keeps
you motivated, with small incremental changes

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:24.309
is important. Of course, a number on a scale
doesn’t measure how healthy a person is,

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:29.069
though many struggle with this perception.
