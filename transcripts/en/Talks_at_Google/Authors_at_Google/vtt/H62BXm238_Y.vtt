JEN: So on behalf of
Authors at Kirkland,

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.380
I just want to thank you
all for taking time out

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.980
of your day to join us, and I
also want to welcome our guest,

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.144
Katherine Hitchcock to Google.

00:00:09.144 --> 00:00:11.060
Katherine is a resident
of the Seattle region.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.940
She's also a UW alumnus, and
she came into the industry

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.830
at a very key time.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.650
She started at IBM as
a programmer in 1966,

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.600
in what would eventually
become Silicon Valley

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.180
that we know and love today.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.840
I'm sure it's a very
different landscape now

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.680
than she had experienced
when she started,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.870
but she's the big reason the
way that it's come to be,

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.570
and people like her.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.880
She's witnessed that amazing
transformation of the tech

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.540
industry, and she has a really
unique perspective and insight.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.320
She'll be sharing
some tales with us

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.760
today about her journey.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.840
And she's going to
show us and demonstrate

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.130
how she's been paving the way.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.540
And as you saw in the clip,
she's continuing to do that,

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.957
and that's amazing.

00:00:47.957 --> 00:00:49.790
She's honing the skills
of a new generation,

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.260
inspiring more kids
to take up the reins

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.980
and contributing to
programs right in her area.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.252
And that's awesome to me.

00:00:58.252 --> 00:01:00.030
After the talk,
Katherine will be

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.170
happy to take your
questions, and then we'll

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.379
have time where she
will do some signing.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.800
Books are available for
purchase over on the table.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.050
They're $5 apiece,
and other than that,

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.530
please silence your phones.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.463
At the end, like I
said, we'll have time

00:01:14.463 --> 00:01:17.110
to take questions, so hold
on to those if you can.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.650
And without further ado,
I'd like welcome Katherine

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.574
Hitchcock.

00:01:20.574 --> 00:01:23.808
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.931
KATHERINE HITCHCOCK:
Thank you for inviting me,

00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:32.880
and as Jen said, I started
as a computer programmer

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.680
50 years ago.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.427
I retired 15 years
ago, and if you

00:01:36.427 --> 00:01:42.520
look at when Google started--
maybe 18 years ago--

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.036
there's a lot that's
happened since I retired,

00:01:45.036 --> 00:01:47.481
and I will tell you
that I have no advantage

00:01:47.481 --> 00:01:50.170
over my grandchildren on all
of the new technology that's

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.904
coming out.

00:01:50.904 --> 00:01:54.490
But what I can tell
you about is what

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.772
it was like when I started.

00:01:56.772 --> 00:02:00.684
So as Jen said, I graduated from
the University of Washington

00:02:00.684 --> 00:02:01.662
in 1966.

00:02:01.662 --> 00:02:05.590
I have a bachelor of
science in mathematics,

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.650
and I hired on to
IBM in San Jose.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.650
And I want to let
you know what it

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.950
was like at IBM 50 years ago,
what was happening and going

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:15.690
on.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.600
I'd like to share with you
a couple of the projects

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.805
that I worked on
at the beginning.

00:02:20.805 --> 00:02:24.114
And then I'd like to talk to you
about an environmental project

00:02:24.114 --> 00:02:26.110
that I worked on.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.161
So when I arrived in 1966
in Santa Clara county,

00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:34.250
it was just at that
transition from when

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.745
we were using punch
cards to communicate

00:02:36.745 --> 00:02:39.696
to computers to when
we were using terminals

00:02:39.696 --> 00:02:41.528
and had an
interactive interface.

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:45.680
So the first project that I
worked on was with the punch

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.740
card environment, but there was
something else going on there

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.023
also, So just 10 years
before I arrived in San Jose,

00:02:54.023 --> 00:02:59.975
so that would've been in the
mid-'50s, IBM engineers had

00:02:59.975 --> 00:03:02.940
invented the disk drive.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.240
So this is the coded surfaces
spinning at high speed

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.290
with the heads floating
over the surface,

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.501
just like a
microscope above them.

00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:18.585
And if they dipped down and
touched, causing a head crash.

00:03:18.585 --> 00:03:26.500
But this technology that was
invented in the early '50s

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.760
led to IBM having this
location in south San Jose.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.890
This is where they
built the disk drive.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.360
This is where the
engineers innovated

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.890
and added new functions to it.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.541
And this project,
these small number

00:03:44.541 --> 00:03:48.180
of engineers who
invented the disk drive,

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.969
were continually asked
to stop the project.

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:56.100
In fact, upper management
would come from back east

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.380
and cancel the project.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.357
The manager changed
the name of the project

00:04:00.357 --> 00:04:03.219
and kept everybody
working on it.

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:04.650
And there's a quote here.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.910
It's a quote, actually,
that I kept on my desk

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.230
for a long time, because
I like the sentiment.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.320
It said, "The disk
memory unit, the heart

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.029
of today's random
access computer,

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.310
is not the logical
outcome of a decision made

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.380
by IBM management.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.520
It was developed in
one of our laboratories

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.560
as a bootleg project over the
stern warning from management

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.530
that the project
had to be dropped

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.150
because of budget difficulties.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.245
A handful of men
ignored this warning.

00:04:32.245 --> 00:04:34.160
They broke the rules.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.310
They risked their job to
work on a project, a project

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.730
that they believed in."

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.240
And this was a
quote from Arthur K.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:48.090
Watson who was the son of Thomas
J. Watson, who was the founder.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.830
So as I said, this
technology led

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.022
to the construction of the
IBM Cottle Road location.

00:04:55.022 --> 00:04:57.770
And prior to that, this
large piece of property

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.740
was a farm with orchards.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.200
The farmhouse still stood
at the edge of the property

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.604
across from acres of parking
lots and large manufacturing

00:05:06.604 --> 00:05:08.300
buildings.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.995
Inside these manufacturing
buildings, a team of employees

00:05:10.995 --> 00:05:14.590
assembled the disk drives
while another team worked

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.645
in a special clean room,
a dust-free environment

00:05:17.645 --> 00:05:20.630
to coat the magnetic disks.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.035
Another building
offered office space

00:05:24.035 --> 00:05:27.212
for engineers who designed
innovations and improvements

00:05:27.212 --> 00:05:30.153
and enhancements to
the disk technology.

00:05:30.153 --> 00:05:33.695
One building contained a
research lab, and another,

00:05:33.695 --> 00:05:36.640
an education center.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.675
This facility was the
headquarters for the disk drive

00:05:40.675 --> 00:05:43.940
division of IBM, and it
was the only division

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.900
whose headquarters was
not in New York City--

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.730
excuse me-- New York state.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:53.960
And all things were there
when I arrived in 1966.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.660
My workspace was located in
a large open high ceiling

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.780
manufacturing building
called Building 5.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.960
And I walked through
a maze of passageways

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.334
to my work area, a desk with a
bookshelf attached to the back

00:06:07.334 --> 00:06:09.794
to provide privacy.

00:06:09.794 --> 00:06:12.430
At the other end of
the building running

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.900
batch programs was the
computer, and in order

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.550
to submit a batch job
or to pick up my output,

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.770
I had to walk the
length of this building

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.890
through this labyrinth.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.482
I often thought it was a test.

00:06:27.482 --> 00:06:29.440
If you couldn't find your
way through the maze,

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.611
you probably were not
smart enough to work here.

00:06:33.611 --> 00:06:38.014
My first assignment was to
modify a batch program written

00:06:38.014 --> 00:06:40.310
in auto-coder.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.420
It was one of the
many programs involved

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.280
in purchasing the
parts and tracking

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.587
the parts for manufacturing
the disk drive.

00:06:48.587 --> 00:06:50.170
The technical leader
in our department

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.900
gave me this assignment,
and when I asked him

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.324
about the documentation,
the program lead said,

00:06:56.324 --> 00:06:58.510
there is none.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.040
Find out what it does
by reading the code.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.700
I sat at my desk
almost falling asleep

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.440
studying this obscure code.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.270
Weeks later, when I
figured everything out,

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:16.180
made my modification, the same
guy gave me the documentation.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.410
I looked at him
dumbfounded, since he

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.010
told me there was none.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:25.680
He said, "I wanted you to learn
that the code is the reality,

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.078
not what the
documentation says."

00:07:28.078 --> 00:07:30.062
This was my first lesson.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.160
Within a short time, IBM
announced a new programming

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.050
language.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.630
It was called PL/I, and of
my colleagues, Burt Swanson,

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.480
organized and taught
a class on PL/I,

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.520
and I was a student
in that class.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.610
At the end, Burt asked me
to teach the next class.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.350
He indicated that he only
wanted to teach it once

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:59.172
as a way of learning PL/I. So I
taught the series several times

00:07:59.172 --> 00:08:03.560
in a row to the newly arriving
programmers in our area.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.250
And then I taught it as part
of the IBM continuing education

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:11.980
program that was offered in the
beautiful new education center.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:16.070
This was available to
anybody working at IBM along

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:19.560
with other classes, and I taught
it in the evening in addition

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.430
to my normal work assignments
for a couple of years.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.782
On this building, there was
a quote from Thomas J Watson,

00:08:26.782 --> 00:08:31.620
and it said, "There's no
saturation point to education."

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.802
So this education was
open to all employees.

00:08:35.802 --> 00:08:39.490
Then I was assigned to work
a mobile computing project,

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.370
to design and build an
interactive online purchasing

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:48.440
system to be used by the
IBM manufacturing location.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.055
This was an endeavor
to eliminate

00:08:50.055 --> 00:08:53.990
the duplicate efforts, update
to the latest operating

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:59.276
system, which by now was OS 260,
and standardize the purchasing

00:08:59.276 --> 00:09:01.950
programs in IBM.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.100
We were redesigning
the purchasing process

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:08.340
from the punch card batch
system to an interactive system

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.565
using remote terminals.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.510
Currently, the purchasing
staff relied on weekly computer

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.885
runs that printed a
stack of fanfold paper,

00:09:18.885 --> 00:09:20.926
giving them the status on
the current information

00:09:20.926 --> 00:09:22.390
about the inventory.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.806
They didn't have display
terminals at their desks,

00:09:25.806 --> 00:09:29.135
and they did not have the latest
information on the inventory

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:29.968
at their fingertips.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:38.206
We were creating something
that we hadn't seen before,

00:09:38.206 --> 00:09:41.560
and there was no template
that we could copy.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.950
We needed to distinguish
out the necessary steps

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.660
for placing a purchase
order, determine

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.530
how to store the data
on the disk device,

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:52.546
and design display screens
for the interaction.

00:09:52.546 --> 00:09:55.910
But even as I itemized
these different tasks,

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.830
I'm looking in hindsight.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.480
At the time, it was a
confusing, unfocused attempt

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.527
to figure out what to do.

00:10:03.527 --> 00:10:06.325
Many new programmers had
been hired and assigned

00:10:06.325 --> 00:10:11.670
to the project, but we were too
inexperienced to make progress,

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.590
and I felt it was a waste of
time to teach a programming

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.098
language to employees
who were not going

00:10:17.098 --> 00:10:20.030
to be using it anytime soon.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.153
I was discouraged,
and I wanted results.

00:10:23.153 --> 00:10:26.534
And after months of
struggling on this project,

00:10:26.534 --> 00:10:28.466
I decided to look for
another assignment.

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:37.895
So in early January of 1968,
while hiking one weekend

00:10:37.895 --> 00:10:41.110
with friends, I reviewed
the working conditions

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:43.366
and debated my options.

00:10:43.366 --> 00:10:46.872
By the end of the hike, I had
decided the situation at work

00:10:46.872 --> 00:10:50.690
was unacceptable, and
I'd request a transfer.

00:10:55.046 --> 00:10:59.560
There weren't publicly
available lists of jobs.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.660
You needed to
request a transfer,

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.500
submit it to the
personnel department,

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.820
and then they would tell
you if any managers were

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:06.790
looking for a job.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.280
This time, he let
me know that there

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.676
was an opening for a programming
position in another IBM

00:11:17.676 --> 00:11:21.850
location, which was located
across the valley near Los

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:23.716
Gatos.

00:11:23.716 --> 00:11:26.810
Now I mentioned previously
about the disk technology

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:30.560
that led to this large
manufacturing and engineering

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.992
offices and education center.

00:11:32.992 --> 00:11:35.306
But there was another
result that came out

00:11:35.306 --> 00:11:37.530
of that group of engineers
working together,

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.526
and their manager,
the one who changed

00:11:40.526 --> 00:11:44.250
the name of the project,
[INAUDIBLE] canceled.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.180
This manager's name
was Ray Johnson,

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.440
and with the success
of the disk drive,

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.575
upper management took
him very seriously.

00:11:53.575 --> 00:11:57.980
And the started a new
division within IBM

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.796
based on his philosophy,
and this division

00:12:00.796 --> 00:12:04.440
had the specific
mission of looking ahead

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.205
to see how computers
would be used

00:12:06.205 --> 00:12:09.870
in the next seven to 10 years.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:13.320
This was called the Advanced
Systems Develop Division,

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:17.236
and this was the location that
was looking for a programmer.

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:22.750
I knew that one of my students
in my PL/I class worked there,

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.800
and so one day I
asked him, Bob Martin,

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:31.340
if he would stay after class
and tell me about this division,

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.120
about ASDD.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:39.630
He said, with the success
of the disk project,

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.360
Ray influenced IBM to
start this new division

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.260
based on his philosophy.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.640
And his philosophy, I asked.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.650
To have a place
for people to work

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:52.080
on new ideas for the future.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.480
Ray wanted to hire smart
engineers and programmers,

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.920
give them a good working
environment with good support

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:02.324
facilities, and let the
innovation come from them.

00:13:02.324 --> 00:13:05.250
This lab had an
excellent model shop,

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.875
where they would
build any specialized

00:13:06.875 --> 00:13:10.790
piece of electrical
hardware for the project.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.515
And there was an excellent
technical library

00:13:13.515 --> 00:13:19.010
that started when they
first arrived in the '50s.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:22.020
In fact, many of the
engineers and model builders

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.768
from that early project
worked at this lab,

00:13:24.768 --> 00:13:25.976
including the head librarian.

00:13:29.788 --> 00:13:32.260
You're saying the ideas
come from the employees.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.665
I asked, how does that work?

00:13:34.665 --> 00:13:37.310
If you have an idea
about how computers

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:40.030
can be used in a
certain area, then you

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:44.780
can propose it to management
and receive funding and staff

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:47.260
for it.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.200
It's a good working place.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.912
There's a lot of
excellent people,

00:13:50.912 --> 00:13:52.645
and the projects are dynamic.

00:13:52.645 --> 00:13:55.370
It's a great place to work.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:58.625
So I drove over
for my interview.

00:13:58.625 --> 00:14:02.006
And this building,
the ASDD building,

00:14:02.006 --> 00:14:03.455
was nestled against
the foothills,

00:14:03.455 --> 00:14:05.870
up against the Santa
Cruz Mountains.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:09.540
It wasn't an innovative design--
a simple one-story building

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.640
constructed of
redwood and glass.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.220
And walking from the visitor's
parking lot up a few steps

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.850
into the main lobby,
I looked across

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:20.430
at the interior window-lined
courtyard with a fountain.

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:23.518
A plaque on the fountain
quoted Ray Johnson.

00:14:23.518 --> 00:14:27.010
"Your first responsibility
is to answer the questions

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:30.652
of your colleagues."

00:14:30.652 --> 00:14:34.612
The project with the
opening was for a programmer

00:14:34.612 --> 00:14:37.110
for the library
management system.

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:41.760
The librarian, Marjorie Griffin,
who had worked with Ray,

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.380
had watched the
development of computers,

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:46.657
and she envisioned
how they could

00:14:46.657 --> 00:14:48.660
help run her technical library.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:53.050
And finally, she convinced
the lab to start a project.

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:55.100
We're not just looking
at Marjorie's library,

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.420
but the requirements for
large institutional libraries

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:01.430
like university and
public libraries.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.250
We want to put all
the functions online

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.020
with an interactive interface.

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:11.168
He told me that at that time
in the mid-1960s, as computers

00:15:11.168 --> 00:15:13.872
were becoming
increasingly available,

00:15:13.872 --> 00:15:17.150
the different managers at
university or public libraries

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.650
were ordering computers to
solve a particular departmental

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:21.840
problem.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.580
Perhaps they wanted to
automate the ordering process

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.564
or the circulation process.

00:15:26.564 --> 00:15:28.022
But these systems
were not designed

00:15:28.022 --> 00:15:31.020
to interconnect to
one another, and they

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.010
were looking at the library
in piecemeal fashion.

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:39.050
This project was to look at
it as an integrated whole.

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:42.020
We have the file system
designed and loaded

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.585
with all the information
from index cards

00:15:44.585 --> 00:15:47.708
from of Marjorie's
library, I was told.

00:15:47.708 --> 00:15:50.460
And now we're ready to
design and implement

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.470
the other functions--
the ordering, receiving,

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:55.865
cataloging, searching,
circulation.

00:15:55.865 --> 00:15:59.182
Did I want the job?

00:15:59.182 --> 00:16:00.661
Well, I had reservations.

00:16:00.661 --> 00:16:03.922
At first glance, it seemed
like another example

00:16:03.922 --> 00:16:08.390
of a large project trying to
do everything for everyone,

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.615
but this project had
several advantages.

00:16:10.615 --> 00:16:12.965
For one thing, they were
actually writing programs

00:16:12.965 --> 00:16:15.400
and building the system.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.880
For another, the library
and the librarians

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.690
were just down the hall, and
we could ask them questions

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.826
about how it should work.

00:16:23.826 --> 00:16:26.694
And in addition, there were
only about five programmers

00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:29.265
working on the project,
so there were fewer people

00:16:29.265 --> 00:16:33.180
to coordinate with, and I
decided to take the job.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.780
And thus began the most
productive and satisfying

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:36.660
assignment.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.810
Bob Martin, who was
in my PL/I class,

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:42.890
was the lead programmer
on the project.

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:46.680
It was an interesting,
unusual situation,

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.040
where he would give me
programming assignment

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.315
during the day for
the library project,

00:16:51.315 --> 00:16:54.650
and I would give him
programming for the PL/I class

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:58.120
I was teaching after work.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:02.890
All the library data for
each book-- author, subject--

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:07.920
was stored in computerized
records on the disk drive.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.890
At this time, disk storage
was very expensive,

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:15.029
and it was not foreseen
how the price would drop.

00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:19.250
The file system design minimized
the use of disk storage

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.349
and eliminated duplicate data.

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:26.450
He repeatedly said that one
extra byte of data per book

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:29.015
would amount to a million
extra bytes of data

00:17:29.015 --> 00:17:31.130
in a million-volume library.

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:36.650
So the attention to saving disk
space was a guiding factor.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:39.280
With the file system
designed, implemented,

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.800
and loaded with real
data, we were soon

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.360
displaying the results
of simple searches

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.705
on this display terminal.

00:17:45.705 --> 00:17:49.225
The display terminal was
a 2260 display terminal.

00:17:49.225 --> 00:17:53.840
It had 12 lines of
data for the output.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.620
Each line was 80 bytes
long, and it had one line

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:01.085
at the bottom for input.

00:18:01.085 --> 00:18:04.540
Bob explained the
programming environment.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:09.460
The programming language was
IBM 360 assembler language.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:12.130
The code was written
in 4K blocks,

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:15.800
and an experimental
multitasking monitor

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.015
managed the task switching by
swapping the blocks in and out

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:21.606
of memory.

00:18:21.606 --> 00:18:24.040
This experimental
multitasking monitor

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.680
was stored on one of the
removable disk packs,

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.230
and whenever our project
had dedicated computer time

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:34.092
or testing, we mounted
the disk [INAUDIBLE],

00:18:34.092 --> 00:18:37.220
booted up the operating system
with our multitasking monitor

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:41.582
that drove the displays, and
then all the library data

00:18:41.582 --> 00:18:43.570
was stored on another
disk pack that

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:46.420
was mounted at the same time.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.540
I enjoyed writing in
assembler language

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:52.900
and fitting all my
instructions into 4K blocks.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.680
I also enjoyed working
with the librarians

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.315
as I taught them
the new functions

00:18:57.315 --> 00:18:59.610
and features as
they were developed.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:02.490
They were eager to
use the new system

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:05.850
and very patient with the
crashes that inevitably

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:08.250
occurred with the new system.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:11.565
They were particularly good
about describing what they were

00:19:11.565 --> 00:19:13.778
doing when everything quit.

00:19:13.778 --> 00:19:16.360
And that made it easier
to reproduce the problem

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.680
and fix it.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.390
John, Bill, and I worked on
the design and implementation

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.690
of the ordering system.

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:26.910
We wanted to capture the
information about a book

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:29.990
only once and eliminate
the duplicate typing that

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:32.510
always led to the
possibility of errors.

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:35.910
Currently, the librarians typed
this information over and over

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:40.878
again on the purchase order and
on the multitude of index cards

00:19:40.878 --> 00:19:42.342
for the card catalog.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.165
One by one, we implemented
the ordering and receiving

00:19:49.165 --> 00:19:51.773
and cataloging functions,
and one by one,

00:19:51.773 --> 00:19:54.539
we taught the librarians
how to use them.

00:19:54.539 --> 00:19:56.580
Step by step, the
library functions

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.778
were being automated into
one integrated system.

00:19:59.778 --> 00:20:03.760
There were still more functions
to design and implement.

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.280
Periodicals had
different requirements.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.312
Circulation had not
been addressed yet.

00:20:09.312 --> 00:20:13.120
In the midst of this designing,
programming, debugging,

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.930
testing, and
teaching, we were also

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:19.390
giving demonstrations
on the system,

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:23.710
both to upper management
and to outside visitors.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:26.310
The librarians from
Stanford University

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.060
were our guests one
afternoon, and their eyes

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.485
sparkled in recognition
of the advantage

00:20:31.485 --> 00:20:35.480
of this online integrated
library system.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.930
Once I gave a demonstration
to the IBM chief scientist.

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:41.210
He sat on my left.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:45.650
I began my demonstration in
the file system, the searching,

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.072
the ordering, and I
had finished only half

00:20:48.072 --> 00:20:53.744
of my first explanation when he
interrupted me to say, go on.

00:20:53.744 --> 00:20:56.790
This happened
several times, and I

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.910
must have had a stark
expression on my face

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:01.080
with each interruption.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:04.890
Then he paused to say,
I do this to everyone.

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:07.308
Now please go on.

00:21:07.308 --> 00:21:11.190
I realized that he'd caught
on very quickly to each idea

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.710
and did not need
further explanation.

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:17.270
Probably why he was
the chief scientist.

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:21.482
I started working on an
advanced searching function.

00:21:21.482 --> 00:21:24.970
I designed and
implemented a Boolean one.

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:26.790
It was very primitive,
and I wished

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:28.690
for something more
sophisticated,

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.540
but I did not have the
vision to design it,

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:35.090
and today, search engines
like you have here at Google

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:39.120
exceed my wildest imagination.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.750
As we finished the
basic functions,

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:42.930
we opened the system
for general use

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:47.610
by scientists and engineers, and
the card catalog and the index

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.580
cards became obsolete.

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:58.246
Then the library project
system was canceled.

00:21:58.246 --> 00:22:01.102
It was May 9, 1969.

00:22:01.102 --> 00:22:03.006
I had been on the
project for over a year,

00:22:03.006 --> 00:22:06.330
and I remember the shock
when I learned this.

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:08.050
It was too unbelievable.

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:09.990
We weren't done.

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.800
But the political
winds had shifted,

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.156
and we had lost our funding.

00:22:16.156 --> 00:22:21.196
This was 1969 when we
demonstrated the library

00:22:21.196 --> 00:22:22.660
project.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.430
It was many years
before libraries

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:27.450
were automated in the
way that we envisioned,

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:30.530
and it wasn't done by IBM.

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:33.640
But we had built an
interactive application

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.720
that modeled how
people could interact

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.885
with computers via terminal.

00:22:37.885 --> 00:22:40.440
We were well on our way
out of that batch mode

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.065
into an interactive way of
working with a computer,

00:22:43.065 --> 00:22:44.400
and we were going forward.

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:51.268
Now I'd like to turn to
an environmental project

00:22:51.268 --> 00:22:52.660
that I did.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:59.080
I started a couple, but I'd like
to tell you about one of them.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:09.436
By now, I lived with
a group of women

00:23:09.436 --> 00:23:13.193
in Appleton, which is kind of
in the middle of Silicon Vally.

00:23:13.193 --> 00:23:17.493
I worked in the Los
Gatos lab, which

00:23:17.493 --> 00:23:19.858
was in the hills in the
south end of the valley,

00:23:19.858 --> 00:23:24.330
and so I commuted in a carpool
with a fellow colleague

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:28.446
who was a recent
graduate from Stanford.

00:23:28.446 --> 00:23:31.290
And after about an
hour of driving,

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:34.610
we would arrive at the lab.

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:38.130
During this commute, I realized
how many cars on the road

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:41.154
had only one person per car.

00:23:41.154 --> 00:23:42.570
I thought people
could share rides

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:44.840
if they only knew other
people who lived near them

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.120
and were going the same way.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.600
We figured out how to
write a computer program

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:53.016
to match people coming from
the same area and going to IBM.

00:23:53.016 --> 00:23:56.410
It involved putting their
name and home location,

00:23:56.410 --> 00:24:01.330
specified its accordance on a
city map on a punched cards.

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:02.750
The cards would
be sorted and then

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:06.590
printed to give each person a
list of people from their area.

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:10.110
I wrote the program
and tested it.

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:13.900
And I went to the IBM
personnel department,

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.550
which today would be called
HR, to offer this as a service

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:20.146
to the employees.

00:24:20.146 --> 00:24:22.475
I met with the personnel
manager in his office.

00:24:22.475 --> 00:24:25.710
It was an office just big
enough for his desk and two

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:30.540
guest chairs, and I sat down.

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:32.570
I've written a computer
program to match people

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:37.360
by where they live, so they can
form carpools to come to work,

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.030
I said by way of introduction.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:43.000
But the personnel manager
wasn't interested.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.227
The way people get
to and from work

00:24:45.227 --> 00:24:51.415
is their responsibility, not
IBM's, he said dismissively.

00:24:51.415 --> 00:24:53.900
I was flustered.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.622
I had not expected to be met
with this opposition to what I

00:24:56.622 --> 00:25:02.420
considered a contribution,
and what could I say?

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:06.480
But IBM is subsidizing people
driving individual cars,

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:10.328
because IBM's paying
a huge amount of money

00:25:10.328 --> 00:25:13.220
for parking lots.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:17.310
He sat across from me and
reached for a cigarette.

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:19.630
Perhaps he was
uncomfortable and had

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:23.740
no respond for my
obviously true observation.

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.680
Since he was not going
to be of any help

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:30.090
in promoting the carpool
idea, I said, well, maybe I

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:31.767
could stand out
in the parking lot

00:25:31.767 --> 00:25:34.110
and give out information
forms to people

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:38.050
to see how many would be
interested in carpooling.

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:42.820
His hands stopped in
mid-air with the lit match

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.411
aiming at his cigarette.

00:25:44.411 --> 00:25:46.616
And he looked
directly into my eyes

00:25:46.616 --> 00:25:51.010
and said, that would
not be a good idea,

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:52.890
and with chilling firmness.

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:56.370
It was strong enough to stop
me from further discussion,

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:59.069
and I left his office.

00:25:59.069 --> 00:26:02.720
I did not realize at the
moment what he was saying,

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.588
but I understood later.

00:26:04.588 --> 00:26:07.857
I had touched on a
very sensitive nerve.

00:26:07.857 --> 00:26:10.720
Any action like
organizing employees

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:14.150
would seem like an
effort to unionize IBM.

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:16.890
My comment about handing
out questionnaires

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:20.428
was too close to organizing
for him to be comfortable.

00:26:20.428 --> 00:26:24.270
I returned to my office and
put the computer program,

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:27.880
the stack of cards, on
the corner of my desk.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.310
I had no place to
file it, and I wanted

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:33.380
it to stay in my awareness,
and for months and months,

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.810
it sat on my desk,
always reminding me

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:38.700
of what I was trying
to accomplish.

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:44.000
Two year later, when the
1973 oil embargo started,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.290
and gas prices
soared, and people

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:49.050
had to wait in long
lines to purchase fuel,

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:51.168
I received a call from
the personnel manager

00:26:51.168 --> 00:26:55.000
asking about my program to
match people for carpools.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.320
And this is when IBM
implemented my carpool program.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.885
A map was posted on the
bulletin board with information

00:27:01.885 --> 00:27:04.014
about how to participate.

00:27:04.014 --> 00:27:07.640
I never knew how successful it
was in terms of how many people

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:11.200
were matched or how many
carpools were formed,

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.680
but for many years, I
continued to see the map posted

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.304
on the bulletin board.

00:27:17.304 --> 00:27:22.880
About this time, the ASDD
lab, a division of ASDD,

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:26.100
which had that location in
Los Gatos-- and by the way,

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:29.080
it had another location
in Mohansic New York--

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:32.090
IBM terminated the division.

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:37.980
When this happened, it
wasn't a big surprise for me.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:42.260
I could see that the division
no longer functioned according

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.810
to its original vision.

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:46.650
No longer were the
ideas initiated

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.780
by engineers and programmers.

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:52.390
Instead, a more
structured management team

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:55.220
dictated projects.

00:27:55.220 --> 00:28:00.585
So I as a little bit at a
loss, restless for a change,

00:28:00.585 --> 00:28:04.924
and not really sure
what was next for me.

00:28:04.924 --> 00:28:07.630
And then one fairly
normal workday

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:11.010
as I was finishing up
my project for the lab,

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:14.040
I attended a late
morning seminar.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:17.600
I walked into the
auditorium and took a seat.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.610
The speaker,
Jacqueline Wexler, who

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:24.250
was the president of Hunter
College in New York City,

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:27.573
was talking about
change, about how

00:28:27.573 --> 00:28:29.780
so many young people
wanted change,

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:31.970
big change and radical change.

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:34.716
This was the early '70s,
and unrest and protests

00:28:34.716 --> 00:28:36.192
were on the campus.

00:28:36.192 --> 00:28:38.805
Then she spoke about the
realistic steady path

00:28:38.805 --> 00:28:41.014
of change, growth, and progress.

00:28:41.014 --> 00:28:45.110
As I sat there, and her
presentation flowed over me,

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:47.828
and she was speaking on
some of the same things

00:28:47.828 --> 00:28:52.020
I had struggled with-- how
change occurs for people,

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:55.635
for corporations,
and for societies.

00:28:55.635 --> 00:28:58.120
I knew there was a luncheon
following the presentation,

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:00.230
and I knew Marjorie
Griffin, the librarian,

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:03.186
had arrange for the speaker.

00:29:03.186 --> 00:29:05.154
"Marjorie," I said
as I ran up to her.

00:29:05.154 --> 00:29:07.614
"I want to come
to the luncheon."

00:29:07.614 --> 00:29:10.790
She looked at her guest
list and shook her head.

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:11.740
I'm sorry.

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:14.187
All the places are taken.

00:29:14.187 --> 00:29:18.019
And I turned and walked away,
still excited by the ideas.

00:29:18.019 --> 00:29:20.445
I knew some of the
people on the guest list.

00:29:20.445 --> 00:29:23.470
The retired founder of
our lab, Ray Johnson,

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:25.655
was attending with his wife.

00:29:25.655 --> 00:29:28.840
As I slowly walked back
through the auditorium immersed

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.520
in my thoughts, and
then a moment later,

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.080
Marjorie stopped me.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.838
Ray's wife couldn't make it.

00:29:34.838 --> 00:29:37.218
You can have her
place at the luncheon.

00:29:37.218 --> 00:29:39.598
And this all happened so
fast that I could barely

00:29:39.598 --> 00:29:41.502
catch my breath.

00:29:41.502 --> 00:29:43.160
The next thing I
knew, I was seated

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.120
at a long table with
a white tablecloth

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.860
and place settings
for 20 people.

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.770
I looked around to
locate the speaker.

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:52.960
She sat off to my right down
at the other end of the table,

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.800
too far away for me to
be able to talk to her

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.942
or even hear her conversation.

00:29:58.942 --> 00:30:02.590
I was introduced to the
man sitting on my left.

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:06.500
He was the IBM vice-president.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:10.920
My first comment to him
was, how do corporations

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:15.427
change if they keep promoting
into management people who

00:30:15.427 --> 00:30:18.720
think the same way as
the current managers?

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:23.650
To his credit, he
responded by asking, what

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:26.040
would you like to see changed?

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.670
Well, this wasn't going to
be an abstract conversation

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:29.340
about change.

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:32.500
He directed me immediately
to the practical.

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.690
Well, I said, I've written
a computer program to match

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:38.020
people so they can
carpool to work,

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:40.680
and when I went to the personnel
department to offer this,

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:45.650
they said it was the employee's
responsibility, not IBM's.

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:49.090
He sidestepped me once
again when he asked,

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:51.850
do you know about
the work that Dr. Pat

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:55.080
Manti is doing in the San
Jose research division?

00:30:55.080 --> 00:31:00.930
It's a project involving
geographic database problems,

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:03.810
and no, I didn't.

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:05.590
Well, he said, you
should go talk to him,

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:09.255
and I'll call him and let
him know to expect you.

00:31:09.255 --> 00:31:11.990
The result of the luncheon was
an appointment the next day

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:15.172
with Dr. Manti, and here
I learned about the ideas

00:31:15.172 --> 00:31:18.340
they were exploring to solve
the class of problems that

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:20.879
required geographical data.

00:31:20.879 --> 00:31:22.420
They were looking
at how to organized

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:26.522
the data to facilitate searches
based on location, path,

00:31:26.522 --> 00:31:27.878
and direction.

00:31:27.878 --> 00:31:31.100
He felt that my idea of
matching people for carpools

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:34.010
was exactly the kind
of geographical problem

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:35.420
they were addressing.

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:38.820
Did I want to come and spend the
summer as an internship working

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.224
with them?

00:31:40.224 --> 00:31:42.584
And of course, I did.

00:31:42.584 --> 00:31:46.130
This led to a summer
working on the GADS project,

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:50.380
and it stood for Geographical
Access Data Storage.

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:52.350
And it was very
early research on how

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:58.510
to store data for sorting and
retrieving geographical data.

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:02.110
I redesigned my carpool
program to use the GADS data

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:03.930
structures.

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:06.180
It was a wonderful
summer of engaging work

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:10.040
with bright,
forward-thinking colleagues.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.516
It didn't result
in any carpools.

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:20.170
But this summer
was my introduction

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:24.630
to working and knowing
about IBM research.

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:27.160
So the IBM San
Jose research lab,

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:30.200
which was located right there
next to the manufacturing

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.000
and development of a
disk storage device,

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.130
had a focus on projects that
could enhance the disk's

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:42.452
technology, both in terms
of material science research

00:32:42.452 --> 00:32:47.630
like the coding material, and
in terms of computer science

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:49.150
research.

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:54.180
Ted Codd, the inventor of the
relational model for database

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:58.000
management, worked here
and wrote his 1970 paper

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.324
on relational databases.

00:33:00.324 --> 00:33:02.970
And Don Chamberlain
and Raymond Boyce,

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:07.280
who [INAUDIBLE] SQL, or
S-Q-L, as a special purpose

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:10.060
programming language work here.

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:13.950
John Backus, already
named as an IBM fellow

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:16.415
for inventing FORTRAN,
worked here also.

00:33:22.462 --> 00:33:27.575
I went on to other projects, but
a few years later, I came back,

00:33:27.575 --> 00:33:30.160
and I started working
at the research lab,

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:35.320
and I finished my career
working at the lab.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:41.670
That building that was on
the San Jose [INAUDIBLE],

00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:44.900
they built a new lab on
the hills just adjacent

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:49.450
to that Cottle Road facility,
and the research lab

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:53.534
continues to be a dynamic
environment, an impressive list

00:33:53.534 --> 00:33:57.254
of inventions and discoveries
that continue to this day.

00:34:01.718 --> 00:34:04.694
And then I'd like to give you a
little bit of a retrospective,

00:34:04.694 --> 00:34:08.840
because as I said, I
stopped working In 2001,

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:13.670
but in 2006, I was in San
Jose, and I decided to go back

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:17.880
and have lunch with some of my
colleagues at the IBM Almaden

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.060
Research Center.

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:22.999
And I was driving there,
I had a flood of memories

00:34:22.999 --> 00:34:26.634
from when I first drove down
that highway 40 years earlier

00:34:26.634 --> 00:34:29.325
to interview for a job.

00:34:29.325 --> 00:34:32.750
And reflecting on that day,
my senior year at university,

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:36.295
and my subsequent decision
to accept the IBM offer,

00:34:36.295 --> 00:34:39.131
I pondered how things
had turned out.

00:34:39.131 --> 00:34:44.011
As I continued down the highway,
I turned right at the entrance

00:34:44.011 --> 00:34:48.669
to the IBM Cottle Road
site where I first started,

00:34:48.669 --> 00:34:51.054
and I was surprised
to see a Hitachi

00:34:51.054 --> 00:34:55.046
sign next to the IBM sign.

00:34:55.046 --> 00:34:57.690
I noted this and continued
on my way a few more

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:59.860
miles before I turned
up into the foothills

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.230
and approached the Almaden lab.

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:03.889
And at the entrance
to this lab, there

00:35:03.889 --> 00:35:07.530
were two signs--
IBM and Hitachi.

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:10.370
What did this mean?

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:13.602
I walked into the lobby
of the IBM Almaden lab,

00:35:13.602 --> 00:35:17.610
and I saw a large
celebratory display

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:19.474
acknowledging the
50th anniversary

00:35:19.474 --> 00:35:22.840
of the random access
disk technology developed

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.934
by those engineers.

00:35:24.934 --> 00:35:27.970
50 years, I mused to myself.

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:31.685
And I was here 40 years ago,
very close to the beginning.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.156
I left the lobby and walked
down the wide hallway

00:35:37.156 --> 00:35:39.130
toward the cafeteria.

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:42.155
Floor to ceiling glass windows
on my right and beautiful

00:35:42.155 --> 00:35:46.170
[INAUDIBLE] tile under my feet,
and on the wall to the left

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:49.385
were a row of plaques with
photos and descriptions

00:35:49.385 --> 00:35:51.780
of people who had
recently received

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:55.390
IBM outstanding technical
achievement awards or research

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:58.010
division awards, and
I smiled remembering

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:01.366
when I had been a recipient.

00:36:01.366 --> 00:36:04.160
In the cafeteria, I
joined my colleagues.

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:08.730
Several of them I had known and
worked with for over 25 years.

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:11.370
At lunch, I asked about
the Hitachi signs,

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:16.910
and I learned that IBM had
sold the magnetic disk drive

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:19.770
disks to Hitachi.

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:22.600
What a surprise.

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:26.080
50 years after its invention, 50
years of continuing innovation

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:30.080
and improvement, IBM no
longer owned the magnetic disk

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.250
technology.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:33.774
I thought about how close
I was to the beginning

00:36:33.774 --> 00:36:37.120
since I had started just 10
years after its invention.

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.800
I returned to my
car and thought,

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:48.440
the times brought 40 years
of change to me and to IBM.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:52.990
In retrospect, I used very
little of the math classes

00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:55.670
that I studied at the
University of Washington.

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:59.380
Mostly, I used my logic
and problem solving skills.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:02.386
I liked writing and
debugging programs.

00:37:02.386 --> 00:37:05.470
It fit well with my
logical thinking patterns,

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:09.113
and each program was like
a challenging puzzle.

00:37:09.113 --> 00:37:13.450
Early in my career, when the
library project was canceled,

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:15.890
and I was struggling with
the challenges of the meaning

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:19.510
of life and on the brink
of a discouraging attitude,

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:22.540
another employee
said to me, you'll

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:27.292
get used to the disappointments
and give up on your ideals.

00:37:27.292 --> 00:37:30.680
I wondered when and
if this could happen.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:34.050
Fortunately, there were several
turning points in my career

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:35.730
and lessons learned
that carried me

00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:38.222
onward into exciting and
challenging projects.

00:37:38.222 --> 00:37:41.185
I not only found my way
but actively participated

00:37:41.185 --> 00:37:43.930
in creating my way
during this time

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:46.726
of rapidly changing technology.

00:37:46.726 --> 00:37:47.710
Thank you.

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:51.154
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:54.106 --> 00:37:58.925
So would you like to
ask any questions?

00:37:58.925 --> 00:38:01.187
JEN: We have a mic up
here, and I can come to you

00:38:01.187 --> 00:38:02.805
if you want to raise your hand.

00:38:02.805 --> 00:38:05.715
I'd be more than happy to.

00:38:05.715 --> 00:38:08.150
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you.

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:11.914
So I know from the timeline
of your early career,

00:38:11.914 --> 00:38:14.080
it looks to me like you
were working on that library

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:18.400
system very similar to the
time that Doug Englebart had

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:22.130
developed his various
demo of user interactions

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:25.810
with computers using a mouse
and others things like that.

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:30.757
I was wondering if at the
time, if that was something

00:38:30.757 --> 00:38:34.830
you were aware of or how
that-- because obviously, ideas

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:38.777
like that were just about to
change the industry really

00:38:38.777 --> 00:38:39.318
dramatically.

00:38:39.318 --> 00:38:40.359
KATHERINE HITCHCOCK: Yes.

00:38:40.359 --> 00:38:43.880
Well, I had the opportunity
of visiting his lab early.

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:47.815
It still would've
been about 1972,

00:38:47.815 --> 00:38:50.640
so the library project
was '68 and '69.

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:54.500
But in about 1972, I visited
his lab and the mouse.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:59.220
And I was quite amazed, but
didn't really see a use of it

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:02.970
for several years afterwards.

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:07.335
But if you look at punching
holes in cards to communicate

00:39:07.335 --> 00:39:10.520
to computers,
typing at a terminal

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:15.050
to communicate to
computers, moving a mouse

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:20.199
to communicate to
touching to swiping,

00:39:20.199 --> 00:39:23.611
we made a lot of progress.

00:39:23.611 --> 00:39:24.111
[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:26.779 --> 00:39:28.195
AUDIENCE: First,
one observation--

00:39:28.195 --> 00:39:30.408
I was in Peru last
month and dropped

00:39:30.408 --> 00:39:32.040
into the library
for some reason,

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:35.070
even though I speak no
Spanish, and there was a card

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:37.620
catalog there, and I
hadn't really thought them

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:39.590
for a very long
time and certainly

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:41.380
hadn't seen one for awhile.

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.888
I guess they do still exist.

00:39:43.888 --> 00:39:47.045
I ddint' see anybody using
it, so maybe they just

00:39:47.045 --> 00:39:49.160
haven't cleared it out yet.

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:53.240
But my question was
in all your stories,

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:57.990
you didn't mention
anything about how

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:01.370
it was being a woman in what
was at that time and still

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:04.345
is largely now a
man's industry, and I

00:40:04.345 --> 00:40:06.890
was wondering
what-- you must have

00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:10.800
had some problems with
people's attitudes back then.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.610
Any thoughts on that?

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:14.910
KATHERINE HITCHCOCK: Thank
you for your question.

00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:18.150
When I hired on in
1966, it was a big year

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:21.500
for hiring new people.

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:26.200
Corporations were hiring a
lot of people, and in my area,

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.707
there were four
women programmers

00:40:28.707 --> 00:40:29.540
that had been hired.

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:33.295
In fact, I would
say more than that,

00:40:33.295 --> 00:40:35.980
because these four
lived near myself,

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:38.430
and my roommate
was a programmer.

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:42.510
And we carpooled together,
so with that environment,

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:48.720
it didn't look unusual to be
a woman in that environment.

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:53.400
I will say that in those
meetings, it was about 5%.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.540
If I looked around the
room and saw how many

00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:58.726
men or women there were, maybe
5%, maybe going up to 10%.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:05.510
I think my focus was on
solving the problems.

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:11.450
If there were
things coming at me,

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:13.740
I just didn't hear
them or see them.

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:17.100
I don't think it was
a conscious effort.

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.922
I think it was just the
way I was that I would

00:41:19.922 --> 00:41:21.920
be looking at the problems.

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:25.126
I do remember at that time
being kind of mystified,

00:41:25.126 --> 00:41:27.875
because there was a
man who had been hired,

00:41:27.875 --> 00:41:30.080
and he was working in our area.

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:33.580
And we were told that
he was being groomed

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:37.645
to work at this project and
then on that project and then

00:41:37.645 --> 00:41:39.820
on up in the corporation.

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:43.908
And I was like, who's
going to groom me?

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:55.586
There was a project, so I
didn't feel that discrimination

00:41:55.586 --> 00:41:56.085
personally.

00:42:00.262 --> 00:42:04.710
And I do know that
later on, there

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:08.590
was a time when a
woman in my department,

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:12.400
which might've been 30 people in
the department, was meeting me,

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:15.506
and she came to me, and
she was very upset with me.

00:42:15.506 --> 00:42:20.050
And she said, you've
never supported me.

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:26.461
And it was her wanting
that networking of women,

00:42:26.461 --> 00:42:30.610
and she felt like I had
not provided that for her.

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:34.160
And I can see in retrospect
where I could've provided

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:37.160
something that I didn't.

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:40.700
And in my view, I was just
really focusing on what

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:43.992
problems that I'm solving.

00:42:43.992 --> 00:42:48.440
I do talk about one incident
where I walked into a lab.

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:51.465
The guys were there taking
apart a piece of equipment.

00:42:51.465 --> 00:42:52.340
It was a new printer.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:55.220
It was right after I had
worked on the gas project.

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:56.580
I knew about this printer.

00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:59.590
I knew it was a
graphics printer,

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:01.160
and as they were
setting it up, there

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:04.245
was a black line that
came across the printer.

00:43:04.245 --> 00:43:07.430
And they were saying, oh,
it must be clicking sound.

00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:10.800
And I said, no, there's
light getting in,

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:14.170
because I knew the
printer, and I know

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:15.592
it was a photographic process.

00:43:15.592 --> 00:43:17.190
I said that there's
something open,

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:19.231
and it's exposing the
paper, and light is getting

00:43:19.231 --> 00:43:21.032
in causing the black line.

00:43:21.032 --> 00:43:22.620
And I said this a
couple of times,

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:24.686
and finally they discovered it.

00:43:24.686 --> 00:43:29.140
But they didn't discover
it because I said it.

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:33.300
And it was like, well, wish
they would've listened to me.

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:46.725
Does that-- I think I was
kind of oblivious to it,

00:43:46.725 --> 00:43:50.266
or maybe that's why
I'm saying "atypical."

00:43:50.266 --> 00:43:53.740
If you were looking for
a story about how much

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:58.810
I had to fight for my
rights, it's not my story.

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:01.780
And I hope that other people
will tell it, and in fact,

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:05.523
as I've shared this story,
I've had women come up to me

00:44:05.523 --> 00:44:12.266
and say, well, in my physics
class, my physics professor--

00:44:12.266 --> 00:44:17.328
I guess it was in high school--
would not give me an A ,

00:44:17.328 --> 00:44:20.280
because he had to
give it to the men,

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:25.780
because the men had to support a
family And here was a woman who

00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:30.212
just was enthralled with
science and met with that kind

00:44:30.212 --> 00:44:31.450
of thing.

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:35.200
And I told her, she
should write her book.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.930
JEN: So in the book, you
talk about the different work

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:39.410
environments that you worked in.

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:42.450
We talked a little bit
about this earlier.

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:45.890
How do you feel thinking
about how the open office

00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:49.970
environment and the busy
workplace that you observed

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:52.802
at Google-- what would
that environment be

00:44:52.802 --> 00:44:55.030
like for you to work in today?

00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:56.640
Would that be
productive for you?

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:58.015
KATHERINE HITCHCOCK:
Well, I have

00:44:58.015 --> 00:45:02.886
to say the cafeteria
was very noisy.

00:45:02.886 --> 00:45:04.610
But walking through
the workspace,

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:07.661
you didn't have anywhere
near that amount of noise

00:45:07.661 --> 00:45:08.160
whatsoever.

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:16.050
For us at that time to
get an office, first

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:20.530
of all, when I worked
at the Los Gatos lab,

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:24.050
we had two people per office.

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:26.380
And actually, I think
I'd like to say something

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:30.070
about my office mate, because
Alice was my office mate there

00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:33.590
at one time, and she was
about 15 years older than I

00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:36.425
and had a degree in
math from Berkeley.

00:45:36.425 --> 00:45:38.930
And she had been working
as a computer programmer.

00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:43.220
So I had some models different
people, different women

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:43.720
[INAUDIBLE].

00:45:47.185 --> 00:45:52.180
But the desire to have your
own office was very strong.

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:54.465
So we had two-people
offices, and then

00:45:54.465 --> 00:45:58.905
when they opened that
Almaden Research Lab,

00:45:58.905 --> 00:46:01.320
we had one-person offices.

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:08.530
So to see everything going
back to open is interesting.

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:09.490
I don't know how it is.

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:14.780
You guys have to say how it is
to work in that environment.

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:17.050
JEN: So we've all worked
on that project that

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:19.875
got canceled and put those
hours and hours of time

00:46:19.875 --> 00:46:22.560
and tribulation and blood,
sweat, and tears only

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:25.572
to have it canceled or moved
or changed or defragged

00:46:25.572 --> 00:46:29.280
or whatever word you want
to use for it, just like you

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.074
did with the librarian system.

00:46:31.074 --> 00:46:32.743
How did you get through that?

00:46:32.743 --> 00:46:34.595
How did you cope through it?

00:46:34.595 --> 00:46:35.990
Provide us with some insight.

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:37.316
It's a very difficult
situation to be in.

00:46:37.316 --> 00:46:38.482
KATHERINE HITCHCOCK: It was.

00:46:38.482 --> 00:46:40.034
It really was.

00:46:40.034 --> 00:46:43.556
When you see something that you
think will really contribute,

00:46:43.556 --> 00:46:48.416
and you put your heart in it,
it's very hard, very, very hard

00:46:48.416 --> 00:46:49.364
to have it canceled.

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:59.180
And there were other projects,
none of them quite as fond

00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:00.871
to me as the library project.

00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:05.520
It takes time.

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:12.380
I don't know that I
could answer it directly,

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:17.000
but I will tell that
because Los Gatos lab was

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.300
an experimental environment,
because they were looking

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:24.335
at showing ideas and proving
them, and in the book

00:47:24.335 --> 00:47:28.195
I talk about some of the ideas
that they showed and approved

00:47:28.195 --> 00:47:35.452
like the bar code and the ATM
were developed in those labs.

00:47:35.452 --> 00:47:40.130
But because it was a lab for
proving things and showing

00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:43.180
them, I never really
ended up taking something

00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:46.835
all the way to completion,
and by the time

00:47:46.835 --> 00:47:53.030
I had started here with the
GADS project or something,

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:56.405
and even just working
on it for a summer,

00:47:56.405 --> 00:47:58.692
I never had that sense
of taking something

00:47:58.692 --> 00:48:00.280
from the beginning
to completion,

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:06.316
and I realized that-- and I talk
about this later in the book--

00:48:06.316 --> 00:48:09.220
that I had developed a
perception that nothing

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:12.675
would ever come of anything.

00:48:12.675 --> 00:48:14.070
That was my perception.

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:16.550
And then I realized
how my perception

00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:19.938
influenced how I worked.

00:48:19.938 --> 00:48:22.220
And there's a very
conscious moment

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:24.610
in this book, where
I make that decision

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:27.240
to change my perception,
where I change it

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:33.200
from a perception
of nothing ever

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:38.380
goes anywhere to I'm going to
work on projects that succeed.

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:42.220
And I had a way of doing that.

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.620
I had just attended
a lecture that

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:49.340
talked about how to build
that confidence in people

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:51.067
[INAUDIBLE] solve the problem.

00:48:51.067 --> 00:48:53.260
And the thing that's
kind of back to this

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:55.700
is coding, because
if you can see

00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:59.008
that you can solve a problem,
well, then, it's like, oh.

00:48:59.008 --> 00:49:00.924
Well, I can solve
another problem.

00:49:00.924 --> 00:49:04.756
You start to build that
perception in you that I can

00:49:04.756 --> 00:49:07.870
solve problems, as opposed
that perception that I had

00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:10.010
[INAUDIBLE] problems
that I couldn't.

00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:14.950
So I decided to get a project
that was a short project-- not

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:19.140
short by today's terms,
for instance-- and one that

00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:21.710
had not many people
and that would succeed.

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:24.185
And I was very fortunate
to get that done,

00:49:24.185 --> 00:49:27.160
and then that really
changed my outlook.

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:29.050
And I consciously worked on it.

00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:31.490
Instead of having,
oh, nothing's working.

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:35.822
Why should I work such
long hours to the projects

00:49:35.822 --> 00:49:38.950
I worked on are
going to succeed.

00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:40.760
And that, I would
say, is probably

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:43.230
the major accomplishment
of my career

00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:46.918
is to have made that shift.

00:49:46.918 --> 00:49:48.418
AUDIENCE: Google's
corporate culture

00:49:48.418 --> 00:49:51.507
is kind of [INAUDIBLE]
between this bottom-up

00:49:51.507 --> 00:49:53.743
engineering-driven
culture that you

00:49:53.743 --> 00:49:56.477
talked about the [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:56.477 --> 00:49:59.956
And also kind of like a top-down
management-driven culture, so

00:49:59.956 --> 00:50:01.447
[INAUDIBLE].

00:50:01.447 --> 00:50:03.890
Have you worked in both
kind of open environments?

00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:08.070
Do you have any thoughts on
which strategy seems to work

00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:10.706
better for you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:10.706 --> 00:50:12.122
KATHERINE HITCHCOCK:
Well, I think

00:50:12.122 --> 00:50:15.760
there needs to be a place
for both in the organization.

00:50:20.224 --> 00:50:22.065
Certainly, if
you've got a product

00:50:22.065 --> 00:50:25.090
that you want to get
out in a timely manner,

00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:29.875
then you want the whole
team focused on that.

00:50:29.875 --> 00:50:33.340
But the place to be able
to bring in the new ideas,

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:36.310
and if you look around,
probably a lot of new ideas

00:50:36.310 --> 00:50:38.800
get started in new
companies, maybe

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:43.040
because they can't
survive in an old company.

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.381
I don't know.

00:50:45.381 --> 00:50:48.146
But I do think that
the corporation needs

00:50:48.146 --> 00:50:50.895
to have both of those
and really foster

00:50:50.895 --> 00:50:55.260
that environment of ideas
coming from the people.

00:50:55.260 --> 00:51:00.155
That's where your brilliance is.

00:51:00.155 --> 00:51:02.030
JEN: Thank you so much
for coming, Katherine.

00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:03.530
We're really happy
to have you here.

00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:04.280
KATHERINE HITCHCOCK:
Thank you, and thank you

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:05.630
all for coming also.

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:08.980
[APPLAUSE]
