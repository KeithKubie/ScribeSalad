00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.960
In Java, a variable can't just hold objects of any type, but one has to specify

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.540
the type that it can hold. In this parking space analogy, look at this variable

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:18.135
here. This particular one holds bicycles and we say that's the type of this

00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:23.310
variable. Now, look at this variable here. There's the name. And in Java, we

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.100
write the type before the name. First the type, then the name. String is the

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.729
type, greeting is the name. String greeting.
