00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.340
Two words you'll hear thrown
a lot in macroeconomic circles

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:11.830
are monetary policy
and fiscal policy.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.550
And they're normally talked
about in the context of ways

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.280
to shift aggregate demand
in one direction or another

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.570
and often times to kind of
stimulate aggregate demand,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.102
to shift it to the right.

00:00:23.102 --> 00:00:24.560
And what I want to
do in this video

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.122
is focus on what these
two different tools who

00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:28.580
are, who are the
actors, and how do

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.820
they go about actually shifting
the aggregate demand curve.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.250
So monetary policy--
this is literally

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.410
deciding how much
money to print.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.450
So it's literally
printing money--

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.990
either deciding to print more
of it or deciding to print less.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.800
It tends to be done
in the United States--

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.530
especially in most
large countries-- it's

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.860
done by the central bank,
which is sometimes directly

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.770
part of the government.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.820
Sometimes it's
quasi-independent.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.610
In the US, it's a quasi--
The US central bank, which

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.530
is the Federal Reserve,
is quasi-independent.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.349
And in future videos
we'll talk more

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:08.550
about the governance structure
of the Federal Reserve.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.700
Most of the major appointees
are made by the US government.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.590
All of its excess profits
goes back to the US Treasury,

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.120
so in that way it's part
of the US government.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.690
But it's set up to be--
also has some influence

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.540
from private industry.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.120
The member banks have a
stake in what's going on.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.920
It often coordinates
amongst member banks.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.025
So you have your Federal
Reserve as a central bank

00:01:31.025 --> 00:01:31.900
in the United States.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.310
It's quasi-independent,
but it's been

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.290
given the right to print money.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.590
And I'll just draw it
here as physical dollars,

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.950
but most of the money that
is going to print actually

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.830
is electronic money.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.337
And the way this affects
the aggregate demand curve,

00:01:45.337 --> 00:01:47.170
the Federal Reserve
doesn't just print money

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.340
and go out and start buying
things with that money.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.006
Well, it does buy
things, but it doesn't

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:52.950
go out and buy
goods and services.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.680
What it does with this is
it essentially lends it out,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.300
so it's essentially buying debt.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.640
And if buying debt seems like a
weird thing to say, buying debt

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.030
it is the same thing
as lending money.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.950
If I buy a treasury bond,
so if I'm buying debt,

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.360
I'm buying a treasury
bond means I'm implicitly

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.560
lending that money.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.640
If I buy the bond directly
from the government,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.290
that means I'm lending that
money to the US government.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.870
If I directly buy a bond
from a US corporation,

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.380
I'm essentially lending that
money to the corporation.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.720
They're going to give
me interest payments

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.386
in the form of coupons,
and then they're

00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:34.970
going to pay back that
money at some future date.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.860
So this is essentially
lending money.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.940
And what this does is it's
increasing the supply of money

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.600
that's out there to be lent.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.599
And so if we think of the
market for money-- so let's

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.390
see, now we're thinking
microeconomic terms

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.535
for the market for money.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.590
If this is the price of
money, which is really

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.410
just the interest
rate as a percentage,

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.070
and this right over here
is the supply of money.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.030
And I'll just draw-- so this
might be our supply curve.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.020
That's supply.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.020
And this is the demand curve.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.107
And let's say right over here,
this is short-term money.

00:03:17.107 --> 00:03:19.315
And we won't focus on the
different durations and all

00:03:19.315 --> 00:03:19.980
of that.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.771
But let's say we're
sitting right over here

00:03:21.771 --> 00:03:24.540
at a clearing
interest rate of 5%.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.370
So it makes sense.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.286
So this is right here.

00:03:26.286 --> 00:03:28.910
This is our demand curve.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.629
So all of the people who will
get more than 5% benefit out

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.170
of the money-- maybe they have
an investment where they could

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.932
get 10% on the money
or 8% or 5.1%--

00:03:37.932 --> 00:03:40.390
they're all willing to borrow
that money and then invest it

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.420
in whatever they want to do.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.836
Or this might even
be consumption,

00:03:42.836 --> 00:03:44.350
people who are saying, hey, 5%.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.374
That's worth it for
me to go out and buy

00:03:46.374 --> 00:03:48.040
that thing that makes
me whatever happy.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.870
But from an investment point of
view it makes even more sense.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.078
If I'm going to get an 8%
return on my money-- that's

00:03:52.078 --> 00:03:55.140
my benefit-- it makes sense
for me to borrow it at 5%.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.420
It makes sense all
the way up to 5.0001%.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.950
I'd actually borrow it.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.210
And so in the Federal
Reserve, or any central bank,

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.100
prints money and it buys debt.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.280
It goes out into debt
markets and it usually

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.930
buys the safest kind
of debt, but that

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.736
affects all of the debt markets.

00:04:09.736 --> 00:04:11.110
It goes out and
buys debt market.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.090
They're essentially shifting
the supply curve of money

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.340
to the right.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.644
They shift the supply
curve to the right.

00:04:17.644 --> 00:04:19.019
And so at any
given interest rate

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.140
you could say that
there is more money.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.110
And so the supply curve might
look something like that.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.820
And this is interesting because
assuming the demand has not

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.670
shifted, what you now have
is a different clearing

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.170
price, a different equilibrium
price, for the money.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.170
Maybe this is now at 3%.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.050
And you also have more money
being lent and borrowed.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.990
So if this was the
old quantity of money

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.299
that was lent and
borrowed-- I'm just

00:04:47.299 --> 00:04:48.590
going to make up a number here.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.670
Let's say that this is $100
billion in some time period.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.715
And now we're at $120 billion.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.880
So now by essentially printing
money, buying debt, increasing

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.970
the supply of money
two things happen.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.729
Interest rates went down.

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.520
And so now you have
all of these characters

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.480
out here who before, they
weren't going to borrow money

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.750
at 5% because their
benefit on that money

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.850
was between 5% and 3%.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.120
Maybe it's 4% or 3.5%.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.550
It didn't make sense
for them to borrow at 5%

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.249
and invest it and only get
a 4% return or a 3% return.

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:27.040
But now that interest
rates have gone down,

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.130
now it does make sense for
them to borrow the money,

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.680
all the way down to someone
who has some type of project

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.610
or investment that
has a 3% return.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.460
They also say, hey, I'm neutral.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.060
Now I could borrow at 3%,
and then I could invest it.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.807
But definitely the
person with 3.1% or 3.2%,

00:05:41.807 --> 00:05:43.890
if they have investments
that give them that much,

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.890
they would definitely
want to borrow.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.310
And we could assume that all
this incremental borrowing--

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.960
so this little example that
I did right over here--

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.080
all this incremental
$20 billion of borrowing

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.090
is going to be spent.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.280
People will borrow
money not to just sit

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.490
but stuff it into
their mattresses.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.210
They'll borrow that money
to go invest it in some way,

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.250
to spend it.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.960
And so what this
will do, all of this

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.060
will shift aggregate
demand to the right.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.430
Right here, we're talking
in microeconomic terms,

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.290
but then if we think about
aggregate supply and demand--

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.280
so this is aggregate.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.960
Let me write aggregate
right over here.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.850
This is price.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.060
This is real GDP.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.480
This is our aggregate demand.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.730
And then our short run aggregate
supply might look something

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:30.430
like this.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.850
And so if we're shifting
aggregate demand

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.580
to the right where there's going
to be more demand for goods

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.954
and services, these people
are going to borrow this money

00:06:41.954 --> 00:06:42.550
and spend it.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:47.550
You're going to essentially
stimulate the economy.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.790
So this shifts to the right.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.550
You have a situation where real
GDP will go from this state

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.520
to this state right over here.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.800
So it was expansionary.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.860
And obviously, if the
Federal Reserve decides

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.130
to print less money
or if they even

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.560
decide to essentially soak up
the money that's in the market

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.300
by selling some of the
debt that they own,

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.050
so that they're sucking
dollars out of it,

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.360
then the opposite
effect would happen.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.360
Now fiscal policy is
essentially the government

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.520
directly going out there and
demanding goods and services

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.820
from the economy.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.920
You have the government.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.210
It has two sources of
revenue that it can spend.

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.080
It has money from taxes.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.570
It has tax revenue.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.830
And then it can go
out and borrow money.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.090
And so it also has
access to debt markets.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.210
And when the government
borrows money,

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.124
they're essentially
issuing treasury bills,

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:40.540
if you're talking about the
US Treasury Bills and Treasury

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:40.970
Bonds.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.880
If you were to buy those
from the US government,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.963
you're essentially lending
money to the government

00:07:44.963 --> 00:07:47.100
to finance their debt.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.430
And so they can take these
two sources of money,

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:53.190
and then if they decide
to spend more-- and let's

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:55.060
say that they're going
to hold taxes fixed.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.840
So they're not going to take
out any demand from the economy.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.985
They might ratchet up debt
and then ratchet up spending.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.830
And then this
government is directly

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:09.050
going out there and demanding
more goods and services.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.040
So that could also shift
the aggregate demand curve

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:12.920
to the right.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.660
So these are two different
levers, two different tools,

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.120
that have been
used in governments

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.075
all around the world to shift
aggregate demand one way

00:08:20.075 --> 00:08:23.030
or another or an attempt to
shift aggregate demand one

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:23.860
way or the other.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.940
Monetary policy
is more indirect.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.940
Printing money, using that to
increase the supply of money

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.090
that's out there to be lent,
that lowers interest rates.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.630
And then because it
lowers interest rates,

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.770
there's more willingness to
borrow and invest that money.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:42.190
Fiscal policy, you're directly
going out there and just buying

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.660
more goods and services
by usually ratcheting up

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:46.160
your debt.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.600
Or fiscal policy could
go the other way.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.720
If you're trying to restrain
the economy, you could lower

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.380
your debt, lower
your spending, or you

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.620
could do some other
combination. s
