00:00:00.101 --> 00:00:01.755
 In the previous video, we understood how 

00:00:01.755 --> 00:00:04.423
 to find the face on the surface of this box of cereal, 

00:00:04.423 --> 00:00:07.475
 finding the faces on each of the six surfaces 

00:00:07.475 --> 00:00:09.320
 of the box and then gathered them. 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.300
 In this clip I will do this again, 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.831
 but I'll do it by visualizing the box's unfolding. 

00:00:14.831 --> 00:00:16.647
 The way I look at a box break 

00:00:16.647 --> 00:00:18.730
 like this, is the following - what happens if you need to 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.525
 to cut the box and then open it? 

00:00:22.525 --> 00:00:23.664
 What am I talking about? 

00:00:23.664 --> 00:00:26.541
 This is what we could imagine, 

00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:29.740
 that we cut the box and the incision can be ... 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.464
 Let's see, I can cut it here in the back. 

00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:35.387
 I can make a cut right there, 

00:00:35.387 --> 00:00:37.917
 I can cut it ... 

00:00:37.917 --> 00:00:42.917
 I can cut it as follows. 

00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:45.820
 If I do it this way, this top cover 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.140
 will open so that he can go out 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.827
 as follows. Then I can, too 

00:00:51.827 --> 00:00:55.502
 to make a cut for this country. 

00:00:56.572 --> 00:00:58.161
 I can make a cross section there 

00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:03.008
 and I can make a cut right here. 

00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:06.367
 Now this country will go forward, 

00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:07.783
 and I can do the same thing 

00:01:07.783 --> 00:01:09.022
 with this country here. 

00:01:09.022 --> 00:01:10.621
 Then it can go forward, 

00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:12.395
 and the back ... 

00:01:12.395 --> 00:01:14.449
 I can draw it. 

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:16.276
 So I will also have a cut. 

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:18.087
 I will draw it as a dashed line because 

00:01:18.087 --> 00:01:20.457
 it is assumed that you do not see this incision. 

00:01:20.457 --> 00:01:22.410
 And the corresponding cut of this 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.054
 on the country we can not see, 

00:01:24.054 --> 00:01:25.965
 we can draw a bit more accurately. 

00:01:25.965 --> 00:01:28.527
 The corresponding cut will be right here in the back. 

00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:32.437
 Right there in the back and then we have a section right here. 

00:01:32.437 --> 00:01:33.740
 So, what will happen, 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.375
 if we unfold all this? 

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:36.533
 Well, we will have, 

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:38.796
 we will have the front of the box. 

00:01:38.796 --> 00:01:40.624
 I will try to draw it as clearly as I can. 

00:01:40.624 --> 00:01:43.508
 The front of the box looks like this. 

00:01:43.508 --> 00:01:48.171
 We will have this top cover that looks like this, 

00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:51.101
 if we have to unfold it completely. 

00:01:51.101 --> 00:01:52.355
 We have these two side covers. 

00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:54.048
 So it's a side cover. 

00:01:54.048 --> 00:01:56.440
 This is a side cover. 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.499
 And this is one more, this country is stretched right here. 

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:00.820
 This is a side cover. 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.621
 Then we'll have the bottom of the box. 

00:02:03.621 --> 00:02:07.063
 The bottom of the box will look like this. 

00:02:07.063 --> 00:02:09.340
 The bottom of the box. 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.095
 And then we have the back of the box. 

00:02:11.095 --> 00:02:12.644
 The one that will be connected to the bottom. 

00:02:12.644 --> 00:02:14.279
 We did not cut that. 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:15.722
 And so we have the back of the box. 

00:02:15.722 --> 00:02:19.627
 The back of the box will look like this. 

00:02:19.627 --> 00:02:20.951
 So we got it. 

00:02:20.951 --> 00:02:22.059
 We did the unfolding. 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.776
 This will happen if 

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:24.378
 make the incisions I spoke about, 

00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:26.654
 and then unfold the box. It will look like this. 

00:02:26.654 --> 00:02:29.854
 Now how can we use this loophole to find the face on the surface? 

00:02:29.854 --> 00:02:31.528
 We just have to find it now 

00:02:31.528 --> 00:02:34.523
 face on the surface of this figure. 

00:02:34.523 --> 00:02:35.552
 How are we going to make it? 

00:02:35.552 --> 00:02:37.422
 We know a lot about the dimensions. 

00:02:37.422 --> 00:02:39.887
 We know that this width is here, 

00:02:39.887 --> 00:02:41.450
 that it's ten centimeters. 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.264
 Ten centimeters from here to here. 

00:02:45.264 --> 00:02:48.056
 We know the height, actually 

00:02:48.056 --> 00:02:50.482
 the whole distance from here upwards. 

00:02:50.482 --> 00:02:52.605
 Since the height of the box is 20 centimeters, 

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:57.067
 this will be 20 centimeters. 

00:02:57.067 --> 00:02:59.341
 And you have another 20 centimeters 

00:02:59.341 --> 00:03:03.175
 right here. 

00:03:03.175 --> 00:03:06.251
 And here, in the same way. 

00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:08.761
 And then you have, look at the depth of the box 

00:03:08.761 --> 00:03:10.984
 is three centimeters, so it's three centimeters. 

00:03:10.984 --> 00:03:15.915
 Three centimeters and then it's three centimeters. 

00:03:15.915 --> 00:03:18.006
 So what is the person, 

00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:19.926
 actually let me just make an area first. 

00:03:19.926 --> 00:03:22.626
 What is the face of this whole area, 

00:03:22.626 --> 00:03:27.045
 which shade with this blue color? 

00:03:27.045 --> 00:03:30.285
 Well, it's ten centimeters ... 

00:03:30.285 --> 00:03:32.833
 I will use a color that you can see much easier. 

00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:37.342
 It's ten centimeters wide, ten centimeters. 

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:39.538
 How much is the height? 

00:03:39.538 --> 00:03:43.948
 20 plus 3, plus 20, plus 3. 

00:03:43.948 --> 00:03:48.948
 This will be 40 plus six. That's 46 centimeters. 

00:03:49.056 --> 00:03:50.747
 This is this blue area. 

00:03:50.747 --> 00:03:55.352
 This will be 460 square centimeters. 

00:03:55.352 --> 00:03:57.907
 460 square centimeters and now only 

00:03:57.907 --> 00:04:00.369
 we have to find the face of the two covers. 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:02.267
 So that cover here 

00:04:02.267 --> 00:04:05.139
 is 20 inches by 3 centimeters. 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.704
 So it's 60 centimeters square. 

00:04:07.704 --> 00:04:11.334
 And so 60 centimeters square, 

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:13.307
 or 60 square centimeters. 

00:04:13.307 --> 00:04:16.046
 And then that lid will have exactly the same face. 

00:04:16.046 --> 00:04:17.656
 Another 60 square centimeters. 

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:21.408
 60 square centimeters and collect everything together. 

00:04:21.408 --> 00:04:23.232
 We deserve fanfare. 

00:04:23.232 --> 00:04:25.671
 We get ... This will be 

00:04:25.671 --> 00:04:29.127
 580 square centimeters. 

00:04:29.127 --> 00:04:30.950
 Which is exactly the same thing we got in the other video, 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.804
 in which we did not use a loophole. 

00:04:32.804 --> 00:04:34.529
 However, it is good to be able to do it in both ways. 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:35.797
 To be able to visualize the unfolding, 

00:04:35.797 --> 00:04:37.570
 or you can look at it and think 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.094
 for the different countries, even for those who 

00:04:39.094 --> 00:04:41.361
 may not be visible.
