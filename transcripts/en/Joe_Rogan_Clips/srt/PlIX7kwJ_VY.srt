1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,100
Yeah. What changes face like, oof.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,130
Jesus here. So I heard he's
retired, right? Connor? Yeah.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,010
You don't buy it. Right. And then, I
don't know if you had a guess. Yeah,

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,990
he's fighting yet. Hans Mullen
camp, you know Han's from monster.

5
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:23,940
He sent me pictures of sparring with
Connor today. Oh, so Connor's training.

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,170
Yeah, I know how doing something
monsters. Yeah. It works for monster.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,970
He's, he's training, he's got to fight.
He's probably just fucking with people,

8
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:33,571
you know.
I mean,

9
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:38,490
Connor is a master showman in terms of
like how to keep people interested in

10
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:43,080
him. And I just think he just, he got way
out of line with all this Khabib stuff,

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,170
you know? But I'd like to wait. I like the
way he takes his losses. Oh, he took it.

12
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:46,480
Well,

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,440
I like the way I like the way he goes
out there and talk smack whatever you,

14
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:51,390
when I think of like as a,

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,870
I mean like from a sports psychology
point of view, I think he's, uh, he's,

16
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,930
I think he's developed
there, you know? Yeah.

17
00:00:57,931 --> 00:01:00,960
But I don't think the way
to get in another fight we
could be is to continue to

18
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:04,980
talk shit after he smashes.
You mean he doesn't have any reason to,

19
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,160
you can just talk shit like he,
he didn't just win.

20
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,370
He smashed and tapped you like it was,

21
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,120
it was only like one or two moments in
the fight where Conor was taking control

22
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:19,560
with some of the striking in the stand
up, you know, and that's another choke.

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,030
That's another misunderstood choke,

24
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:25,340
that fulcrum choke that can be got Connor
with that is a legit net crank. Yeah.

25
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:27,660
Yeah. And people that don't think
that, oh, he tapped to that.

26
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:30,210
Like you would tap to that too.
And if you didn't, you're stupid.

27
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:32,820
And people are like, yeah, because
the chin was down there right there.

28
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:36,570
Like you can, there's a lot
when you're, there's a lot of,

29
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,350
it generates a lot of forced Yankee down
hinge your jaw for what? Yeah, yeah.

30
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,340
And face apart. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That,
that's a legit, that's a legit submission.

31
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,730
Yeah. Especially with that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. Yeah.

32
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,060
Back the back of your form against the
guys back as leveraged with the cause of

33
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:57,720
that fulcrum. Yeah, that's horrific.
Very powerful. It hurts bad man.

34
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,970
There's a lot of those net
cranks. It just like, Oh,

35
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:03,960
you watch people and you
just go, please tap. Yeah.

36
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:08,961
There it is right there like you see with
Khabib's left arm pressing against the

37
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:13,980
back of Conner and then also yanking
on that and that is ripping his fucking

38
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:18,470
neck apartment. You never, yeah.
You until you felt one. Yeah. Yeah.

39
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,540
Um,
but Connor,

40
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,750
it's interesting that the way he's posted
up like that or just trying to get up

41
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:30,750
and he's getting cracked at the
same time. Yeah. You got to kind of,

42
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,940
he was already, he had already
been smashed by then too. You know,

43
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:38,700
he'd been hitting hit with so
many big punches from the top.

44
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,820
He takes a great shot though,
I'll tell you that. Yeah.

45
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,450
But it's just one of those things where
I think in order for him to really have

46
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,450
a real chance at getting another shot,

47
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,600
what he's got to do is beat somebody
big and say something that makes Khabib

48
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,080
considerate, you know, but not in, no,

49
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,250
not in the way of what he's been
doing in terms of, you know,

50
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,610
talking shit about him and
talking smack. I, I mean,

51
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:06,280
I think the only way it's
going to be public demand,

52
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:09,580
like he's gonna have to get to a position
where people want to see him fight.

53
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,880
He began to see that the result
may be different this time.

54
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,050
And then maybe if he could just fucking
communicate something to them, say,

55
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:21,640
you know, I respect you, you know,
all trash. Talk aside, you know,

56
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:24,880
I'd like to test myself against you
one more time. And I think I earned it.

57
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,440
I think that's the only way he's
going to get it. I think you're,

58
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:29,020
the only way he's going to get at is to,
to win a couple of fights,

59
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,000
beat some real big name guys
and then make it. So that's, uh,

60
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,930
something that could be, is
actually interested in. Well, okay.

61
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:39,940
So I don't know if that's the only way,
but it's the way that would be, uh,

62
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,000
that I would like to see.

63
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,530
They already offered it to Qbb keep it
could be used said fuck off. Yeah. Yeah.

64
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,620
That's like that path that you're
talking about. Sounds like a one,

65
00:03:48,621 --> 00:03:52,220
that one that fits good for me. Yeah.
I'd like to see it that way. Yeah.

66
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,200
Do you think that trash talking in MMA
has gone too far or do you like it all

67
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,190
right? I mean, well, I think
it's entertaining. Yeah. Uh,

68
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,720
for some people I think it's not,
oh, here, it's, it's hard because

69
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:12,230
it's not, um, it's not
always what I want to see.

70
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,370
And it's not, uh, I don't know.
It's not the type of person I am,

71
00:04:16,371 --> 00:04:19,430
but not everyone's going to be me.
That's not what makes the world go around.

72
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,960
And there's a lot of
people want to see it.

73
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,980
And also sometimes it does bring
some energy and some, you know,

74
00:04:24,981 --> 00:04:28,070
when it's well done, it does bring some
energy and some excitement to the fight.

75
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,760
And to the sport and at the same time,
not every fight. What's Indian wedding?

76
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:36,470
It was really interesting and was really
excited about the UFC is that there's a

77
00:04:36,471 --> 00:04:41,471
lot of fights that people want to see
that have no bearing on the title.

78
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,250
Right? And so there's something to that
fights that just people want to see.

79
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,270
And I think trash talk sometimes makes
fight that people want to see. Yeah,

80
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,540
for sure. Yeah, it makes sense.
Emotional makes things intense.

81
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,140
It's great for selling things.
It's great for selling paper views.

82
00:04:57,141 --> 00:05:00,270
But the question is like,
is it good for the sport overall?

83
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,360
It should it be something that we
encourage. Well, how was that for,

84
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:07,530
and that's the thing is how do we decide
what's good for the sport? In what way?

85
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,340
Right. How do we decide, is it
good for the way the sport, uh,

86
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,310
do want the sport to look at as far as
martial arts and being a respectful thing

87
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:17,490
and people looking at us like that,
maybe not a,

88
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,030
is it good for the sport of the growth
of the sport and for more opportunities

89
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:25,770
for athletes and for our athletes
to become, uh, uh, names that,

90
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:29,760
uh, that draw attention from other people
that normally didn't know about it?

91
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,500
I Dunno. I Dunno either, but
yeah, so, so I dunno, I, I,

92
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,140
I'm torn.
I like both.

93
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,640
I like exactly Machida type character
that's very spiteful and bowels and never

94
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,100
talks trash and fights like a,
you know,

95
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,800
just a world champion
caliber martial artist.

96
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,630
And I also like the guy that talks mad
shit. I think it's funny. Yeah. Yeah,

97
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:54,210
exactly. I enjoy it. It's like,

98
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,550
I like press conferences for that very
reason where know guys are talking shit

99
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:02,350
to each other and they're looking over
at each other on the podium and you know,

100
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,930
it's funny, I'll come on there was some of
them. Yes. Some of it is hilarious. Yeah.

101
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,561
How about Connor?

102
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:10,220
When Jeremy Stevens slick ask them
for Pfizer Hula Fuck is that guy.

103
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,150
It was effective when he, when he got,
when he got up, what was like, okay,

104
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:16,460
I don't have typed in so to
everyone, so let's, yeah,

105
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,430
let's get them all in one
place. Right. That was great.

106
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,380
So I can see what everyone at one
time this be efficient. Come on.

107
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,930
There's comedy back when he was talking
about with red panties night. Yeah. Yeah.

108
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:30,140
That was a baby. We got there.
Caught up with Greg or fight.

109
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,400
He's a fucking character.

110
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:38,600
MONTCO mine isn't that weird situation
though where he really never has to fight

111
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:41,960
again. So you've got to wonder
what his motivation is. You know,

112
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,990
like he has $100 million.

113
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,460
He has a gigantic whiskey company
that proper 12 is murdering it.

114
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,210
That that places killing it
that that company is, they're,

115
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,830
they're moving into other countries now.
I mean they're killing it. He'd done,

116
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,460
doesn't have to do a thing ever
financially unless he wants to eat diamond

117
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:02,980
sandwiches.
He's like,

118
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:05,480
you basically could do whatever the fuck
he wants for the rest of his life and

119
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:10,100
just live off interest. But he still
likes to fight. Yeah, I think so.

120
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,410
Yeah. I mean that's what
brought him into the QBE fight.

121
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,820
He didn't have to fight Khabib, but
just, you know, how much does he want it?

122
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:17,211
I mean,

123
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:20,180
does he want it the same way a guy like
style bender wants it or a guy like

124
00:07:20,181 --> 00:07:23,850
Calvin Calvin Gaslin wants it.
And also I think that, you know,

125
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,370
part of wanting it is different
too. Um, maybe, maybe there's,

126
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:31,700
maybe people might want things on their
terms to one certain terms of way you

127
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,000
get in his way. Like, like some
people be like, oh, you want it,

128
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,170
I want it any way I can get it.
Some people might want it and say,

129
00:07:38,171 --> 00:07:40,970
well now I want it this way.
Well, he was gonna Fight Cowboy.

130
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,790
That was a fight that they were,
they were basically trying to make,

131
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:47,570
but it was going to have to be a
co main event. And because of that,

132
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:51,110
I think Connor was not interested in
anymore. He wanted it to be a main event,

133
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,230
you know? And I'm like, Jesus, like,

134
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:58,960
is that really what kept us from Connor
versus Cowboy Kenny [inaudible] versus

135
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,890
cowboy?
Make that a fucking main event.

136
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:05,891
Like make some malarkey title come up
with some hundred 60 pound title or some

137
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:10,940
shit. Just come on, man. Do it. I mean,

138
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:13,310
they give out these interim
titles left and right.

139
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:17,150
How about you come up with some excited
when that was going to happen? Yeah. Yeah.

140
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,590
I was excited to see it. Hundred 65
pound malarkey title. Just come off, man.

141
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,270
Conor versus cowboy for the
title. Yeah. Make a title up,

142
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,630
but that's what they're trying
to make it. Yeah. No, I agree.

143
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:31,220
I don't think it would hurt at all,

144
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,010
but apparently Dana says it makes a big
difference in the amount of paper views

145
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,800
here. Okay. Yeah.
