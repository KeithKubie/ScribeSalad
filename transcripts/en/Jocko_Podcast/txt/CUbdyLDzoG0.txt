Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number 90 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening.

Speaker 2:          00:00:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:14       As my wife, Tori mentioned this past week has been in one of the most challenging of my life. I want to say thanks to my friends and family for your support. You really have no idea how much a few words of encouragement can mean when you are at a time and place like this. Thanks again. My platoon isn't a very active area of operations in southern Afghanistan. Our mission is to close with and destroy the enemy.

Speaker 2:          00:00:47       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:00:47       There is no outside the wire here because there is no wire. My boys are simply always on alert. We haven't had a shower since we've been in Afghanistan.

Speaker 2:          00:01:02       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       We've run nonstop missions and have been very successful at accomplishing these without experiencing any injuries to our own. I'm just trying to paint a picture of life here and not trying to make you feel sorry for us.

Speaker 2:          00:01:20       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:01:21       trust me. I belong here with these guys and we are a family. Rather. I want to paint a picture because I'd like to tell you about Travis mills. I know you don't know him, but it would mean a lot to me to be able to spread his story. My platoon string of missions without injury came to an abrupt and violent and last week when we hit a dismounted IED during combat operations, I had three paratroopers injured from the blast.

Speaker 2:          00:01:59       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:59       One was minor, one was severe in one was simply beyond words. The most severe injury was sustained by my weapons squad leader, Travis. Big Mills. I'd like to take the opportunity to tell you about them. Even under the conditions that I've described. He is the best of us.

Speaker 2:          00:02:28       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       He was the biggest guy in the platoon and has the biggest heart to go with it.

Speaker 2:          00:02:33       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       He was eager to please and always cheered us up.

Speaker 2:          00:02:37       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:38       He led from the front and was injured because of it. He preferred that he take the injury over any man in his squad. He was the most fearless person I have ever seen in combat when we weren't in combat. He was great to have around. You. Woke up every morning and saying a bunch of different songs to us. Usually Keisha or Britney spears or the songs of some other girl band. We had this ritual. Anytime we finished a patrol where we had a firefight, once we returned to the strong point, he'd run to the front of the formation and sing songs about the 82nd airborne. He would do dance gestures and all. He even did it for the brigade commander when he came to visit.

Speaker 2:          00:03:32       It was a big hit.

Speaker 1:          00:03:35       I laughed at how are he laughed at how serious I am and how I don't like to be touched. So he made it his personal mission to make me laugh. Usually this involved an overly aggressive and a little too intimate man hug, followed by a middle school style dance where he'd grind on me.

Speaker 2:          00:03:58       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:03:59       he kept me sane. I laughed at his antics constantly in combat. There is no one we would rather have been with. He risked his life to save all this constantly, and I can recall two times specifically where he literally saved me. Needless to say, I took his injury hard, including the personal guilt that'll leader feels when he is responsible for his men. So I wanted to tell you these things. Everyone is asking how I'm doing. Yes, I am hurting.

Speaker 2:          00:04:40       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:04:40       but you know I'm going to be okay. More importantly, Travis is going to be okay. The truth is obscene things here, so terrible that I'll never be able to put them into words. Travis injury being at the top of the list, but I've also seen things here so wonderful that I'll never be able to put them into words either.

Speaker 2:          00:05:06       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:05:06       I know that sounds crazy, but it's true. How do you put into words the spirit, like the one I've just described in big mills, the reality of it is that I have the honor of leading people like Travis.

Speaker 2:          00:05:25       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:25       There are many more in my platoon just like him. So while I've seen some things I'd like to never talk about again, I've seen just as many that I'll spend the rest of my life trying to explain to anyone who will listen. I've seen a tremendous love and care between brothers that have only each other to rely on and have only one care to bring each other home.

Speaker 3:          00:06:00       It's a selfless, deep, everlasting bond that I consider myself lucky and absolutely privileged to be a part of. Thank you so much again for your support, but know that I am fine. I am exactly where I need to be right now. My family here is taking care of each other and we will persevere as one.

Speaker 2:          00:06:29       Oh

Speaker 3:          00:06:35       now that is a letter that was written to friends and family at home from Lieutenant Zack Lewis, commander of First Platoon Bravo troop.

Speaker 2:          00:06:54       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:06:55       473rd Cavalry Squadron, Fourth Brigade Combat Team of the 82nd airborne division, the all Americans and I think that letter describes staff Sergeant Travis Mills as only a fellow platoon member could explaining is unbelievably positive attitude. There's courage under fire and is on wavering leadership and tonight I am honored beyond words to have the man that Lieutenant Lewis spoke of Travis Mills here with us to talk through his experiences on the battlefield

Speaker 2:          00:07:59       and off.

Speaker 3:          00:08:02       Travis, welcome to the show. Good evening. Thank you for having me. Yeah. Now I'm going to say this upfront. I was a little nervous about having you on because this show has a reputation of being very serious and very solemn. And I know that you have an issue with both of those terms in a broad perspective. So for those of you that haven't heard anything from Travis before,

Speaker 2:          00:08:36       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:08:37       There's not a lot of serious stuff that Travis does, so, um, serious comedian and hilarious guy with an incredible attitude. Um, welcome to the show, man. Thanks for coming on. Thank you so much. I'll

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       do my best to be serious. Um, I think my ltd described it very well in that letter he wrote to his family. I made sure that I kept their spirits up and I would hug him and everything like that. But under fire it was a whole different person. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:09:10       yeah. No, I thought he did a great job of capturing, you know, what everyone's feeling over there. And I didn't, I didn't go in Afghanistan, but what does the similar to what we'd fill in Iraq. Um, and you know, I talk about this a lot about the fact that this is why guys miss combat. You know, you miss combat, even though it's when you're over there and you're in this crappy situation and you're like, oh, I can't wait to get home. But then when you get home, you have that little thing in the back of your mind that says, that misses that comradery, which only comes from that place. So he did a good job of describing that. So I think to, to understand where a man ends up, we kind of got to understand where a man comes from. So going back to the beginning, the young Travis mills, the young Travis Mills, and you know how you grew up in all that. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:10:10       talk a little bit about that. Yeah, I'm a, I'm from Michigan. When I go around and I speak throughout the nation and I always say, is anybody from Ohio before? I tell him permission and I yell, Oh, H and then they yell io and to get real passionate and then I yell sucks, you know? And I get, I get some booze, but I'm from a small town in Michigan, um, right around the film area. I grew up playing football, basketball and baseball. I have an older sister and younger brother. Um, my parents are phenomenal people and you know, just good, wholesome values. And then I went to college and play football, uh, after high school was over and decided that probably wasn't the right time for me to go to college and take it serious. So I went to the,

Speaker 1:          00:10:47       hold on. So you were playing three sports in high school and I, I got a quote from your book in here by the way. Um, I'm going to read it.

Speaker 2:          00:10:57       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:57       I was the fun kid who lived at the end of your block. I was big for my age and for a lot of boyhood years I had a big gap between my two front teeth. Yup. Now is that a negative thing? Um, no, not at all. Okay. Because some of us at the table, you're still have a gap between our phones. I'm just saying. Oh, I on the sides now, right? Yeah, I do. But I, uh, I like to wear my hair, my hair shaved and a buzz cut, particularly in the summer is when it got hot with that opie Taylor kind of look, I fit into small town America. And you did karate, by the way.

Speaker 4:          00:11:36       You're looking at the 1993 create a cry state champion. I Michigan, I was six. But that's, it's not a competitive age bracket for karate champion chess, spinning back kick kids right over at rest on that breaking.

Speaker 1:          00:11:51       Uh, actually you had, you had a contest here. I'm going to, I'm going to read about it. It wasn't all easy. And one of my first karate matches, I got kicked hard in the sternum and couldn't breathe. I gas panic and tried to suck air when my normal breathing didn't return. Immediately I raised my hand and forfeited the match. I'm kind of disappointed my dad rushed over. Travis, what are you doing? You forfeit the match. You, you never forfeit the match no matter how hard you're hurting. You never quit ever.

Speaker 4:          00:12:20       Yeah. My Dad was disappointed in me too. Yeah. So I never did it again. And then I just, I dunno, I just went hard the rest of that after that, I just, I don't know. My Dad taught me good values. My mom took karate with me. Um, so don't mess with your mom either. No. No. Wow. Yeah. She's, she's five foot two, 125 pounds. How did, how did she produce your big ass? I don't know. I don't know. That was your dad a five. 11. No kidding. Yeah. Yeah. But I was six foot three when I was at my walk around weight and, uh, the first match I ever had, I had a girl and she beat me cause I wouldn't hit her. And then I was cleared to like hit girls and I thought that, okay, so the next year I thought it went, went to town on, you know, just put a weapon and now I know you don't hit girls either way.

Speaker 4:          00:13:05       So I learned, you know, that's a lose, lose situation. But then your mom, your mom told, you know, go hit her. Yeah, that's what it is in the book. Like she was like, hey listen, you got to go beat her up. Well, okay. So it was competition and she was in my, you know, they didn't have the separate gender brackets. So everybody was the same. And the first girl I faced, I wouldn't hit and I lost about, and then the next girl after that, my mom was like, you can, you can hit them. And I was like, oh, okay. So I was just like, you're going down. And I went after it. Oh, that's jacked up, man. I was sick. So I mean, I hadn't, yeah. You know, puberty and everything he didn't hit yet. That was seven for me.

Speaker 1:          00:13:47       The uh, football team, Vince Laville. Did I say that right? I love, Yay. Okay, well, you know, don't worry about so much of a French speaker over on my end. Oh, whatever that language is. If I know his name, I would've said the same thing. Here's how he described you. The first time I met Travis, he was in middle school at track meet. I had heard about him. So I went over to watch him. He won the shop put, which meant she was strong. Then he ran over. Then he ran over to the 100 yard hurdles in one though too, which meant she was fast. You don't see that combination a lot. I knew that this kid was going to be a special athlete in high school. He became a superstar three sport athlete, baseball, basketball and football. He was the leader on each team and made first team all conference in all three sports with football. He was definitely a big cog in our teams. We'll, we're the smallest school in our conference and we got beat up for a lot of years, but his junior year, Travis and his friends got into weightlifting and power lifting and went to all the football camps. That year. We won the conference championship and made the playoffs for the first time ever. Travis has work ethic moded everybody motivated everybody. Everybody got stronger because Travis was their leader. Jack

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       and steal. What champions do first time we ever made to play off. How did you, how did you, what like got you. What made you start lifting a coach? When I was in seventh, sixth or seventh grade, he said that after school, if I wasn't playing a sport, I had to go lift weights and he was the vice principal, the high school. So having friends in high places is nice because when you get in trouble you don't really get in trouble, you know? Um, the story. Yeah. The story in there about me getting in trouble in class freshman year. Where'd you do? Uh, I don't really, I broke a childish, nevermind, but just tell us what you did. It's in the book, you know, my buddy fired in class, got kicked in the hallway, so then my other buddy did, so I wanted to go out there.

Speaker 4:          00:15:34       So I finally let one rep so I can go out in the hallway and he took us into the office, but he just said, guys, knock it off. You can't do this anymore. Which protein? Powder. Oh, that's all. Yeah. So my buddy Eric, he got his parents are very competitive like mine were and we were the both the team captains and stars of the show, if you will. So I went home and said, hey, can I get some cell tech and nitrile tech? And it was before they had the rally reg regulations on it and my parents like, no, you can't do that. I'm like, well Eric's parents let him get it. Maybe it wasn't true. Right. Eric went homes at the same thing to his parents so we both got to get on those. And then, I mean, you know, protein powders, it's often that's going to disrupt science class.

Speaker 4:          00:16:12       But no, I mean it was, it was fun. You know, everybody, I worked at a grocery store, um, after the football games, the old man would come in and drink coffee and hang out with me and my boss. Just like the owner. The storage is accepted it like the wives would shop and you get away with it. Yeah. As at the water cooler. Bowser coffee pot and we just hang out. Tell me what I did wrong. I did write very varsity varsity blues town. Big Time. Yeah. Yeah. I saw some video footage of you at those games and it was like madness at those games. We'll have the one, the one run. I had looked pretty good on film. Yeah, look pretty good to me. It was one time I did anything special. So you get done with your senior year of football. And Did you maintain the high level of discipline in your grades after that point?

Speaker 4:          00:16:57       No, actually I broke up with a girlfriend that has a 4.0. So my grades went right down. No more steady partner. No, no more like she would help do homework. Yeah. Be in the same class and write lefthanded for the scratch work and hand her to me. Nothing like that. And so that, that meant, did you get looked at, did you get looked at for college ball? I did. I had a couple offers for baseball and football. Um, D two couple of d one smaller d ones. And for some reason my guidance counselor, he just, I think he just knew Mr. Sampson, great guy. He kind of figured I wasn't going to like college and be disciplined enough. So he's like, what about this community college? They're really good. Um, you can go there and play football. And I, and I decided to go there and, uh, I just, I mean if I was cut off from football, I wasn't cut out for this study in there at that, at that time in my life.

Speaker 4:          00:17:45       Right. And so you went there for what? A one year? A semester. One semester. And my girlfriend was like, you should move home. So I did and I met her boyfriend, Collin. So then, then I joined the army. He moved back in my life. How did this happen? It's her fault. I have no one to call him lately. I haven't talked. I haven't, you know, we all look him up. I mean, he worked at a popup golf course and I found everything out. So I grabbed my buddy up and went over there and the manager of the place, like sent them home. Why'd she tell you to come home? Chill. I can be by her, I guess. I don't know. And then I was like, Hey, what's this about? And then she finally broke down and told me. So I was like, oh hey. Did you know the army was taken people and give them bonuses.

Speaker 4:          00:18:25       See Ya. Cause you were in debt, you ran up, you know, it was about 10 grand in debt for community college, but that was for the whole year. The baseball coach asked me to play there too. Um, yeah. But then you, uh, you're in debt. You're, um, Collin wisdom on the scene now that kind of threw a loop. So you end up joining the army. I joined the army, I went to all the recruiters and the army had the best thing going, which was cash, $24,000. That money's at today. No idea. Does, did Budweiser get any of that money? You know, now I don't, I'm actually, I'm not a beer. Not a boozer. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. No, no, no, that's not go that far. I'm a whiskey fans, but uh, no. I mean I just, I saw a way to pay my bills back. I saw a way to travel and do some more fun stuff. I went in there to be an electrician and they show me airborne video. I was like, I want that. Oh yeah, deal. Deal. What's that called? Bait and switch. But I really want to do is I want to get a good thing, you know, where I can carry on in the civilian life and have a good trade that you have that I can play back to the civilian world. They're like, watch this video. You're like that. That's me.

Speaker 4:          00:19:37       Is it like airborne recruiting video? Um, well to be honest with Ya, I was a ranger regiment recruiting video and I signed up for all that. But then all the rumors were like if you don't make it, you're going to Korea. And I'm like, I don't want to go to Korea. And then 22 of my friends went to Fort Bragg cause you got to pick your duty station because they were filling up the new brigades and they're like, oh you guys, we need you to fill in here and you can pick where you go. So all of us from basic training went cause what year was this? 2006 Oh yeah. So that's, so that's totally different from me because I joined the navy in 1990 oh yeah. That was before I was even a Christ a champion. We're talking old school. So there was no war going on.

Speaker 4:          00:20:16       And even though in my mind I always thought like the seals were just like fighting wars worldwide at all times, which was not true. But I thought that, but yeah, it wasn't like everyone that was joining the military. It's not like when you guys joined the, your generation of people joined, you knew you were going to war. Oh, absolutely. 100%. You know, I, uh, the, the biggest regret I actually do have and, and not to kiss up to what you've done, but it's not tried to go to the Rangers or go special forces or to the see like not even, I didn't even try it. I wish I would have. Well you would of w w did you start thinking about that further in your career? Absolutely. Yeah. I was going to come back, um, and I was either going to a recruiter and get my last year and a half of college cause I went to college when I could.

Speaker 4:          00:20:56       I took college under enlistments and that was going to try to go recruit her to um, go ahead and get my degree and then go to the special operations world. Because if you don't do it that way, if you become an officer lady, you got to go back through the queue and everything. But it was either going to be go right to a special operations and try that out or go become an officer and then go. But yeah, just uh, you know, I dunno, I have no excuses stuff for us. It's a weird thing and I don't really like anybody. Like I was, if you compare you as an athlete in high school and me and as an athlete in high school, it's not even comparable. You, you were like 10 times the athlete I was for some reason I was stupid enough to think like I can make it through that training and you weren't smart enough to go.

Speaker 4:          00:21:38       Like, I can make that see the gallery to, cause you would on this, the saddest thing is with the whole, uh, the ranger contract I had and all these guys were going and I got talked to my buddies that go into Fort Bragg. I ran to a bunch of them. They're like, oh yeah, we made it. I was like, oh my gosh, I could have this. It's an interesting, it's an interesting, uh, it's actually humility. It's you being like, hey man, you know, I don't know. I played, you know, football and baseball and ran track or was that, is that right? Well, a basketball, football, baseball and basketball. I'm a great athlete, but I might not make it through that. That's actually a form of humility, you know, I think it is. I was just, yeah, I don't know where her head was at. I just, I, I, you know, looking back now, I'm embarrassed about it a little bit and I wish I, I wish I would went and tried it out.

Speaker 4:          00:22:19       I mean, I live a really good life. I have a wonderful life and everything. Not to jump ahead. A two beautiful children. So life life's good. As bad as the situation. I'm, you know, I found myself in in April of 2012 but, but looking back, I wish I would've tried something. Yeah, yeah. I mean, but the 82nd airborne is, which is where you ended up is freaking awesome unit. Oh, I yeah. I mean I drink the koolaid and everybody's like, oh, about standards. How'd you like, and this is something that, cause a lot of people that listen to podcast, um, they joined the military, believe it or not. And like we just met a guy the other day who's going September 18th going in the Marine Corps. But I always want to tell them like when you show up to bootcamp, it's going to be a shock to your system, right?

Speaker 4:          00:23:03       I mean it is going to be, you're going to lack of sleep. It's not going to be stuff that you used to it. It sounds like you've got a little, you know, shock to your system and you showed up there of just normal military stuff. And I guess my point in saying that is when you show up to bootcamp who campus is, is not going to be fun for you. It's going to be a transition. I mean, you can mentally prepare all day, you know, and then you get yelled at and you're like, why is this guy always yelling at me? I didn't, I'm doing the wrong leave me alone. Um, it made me eat coleslaw. I don't even like Cole slaw. I mean, the first thing I come out and they're like, oh, well I guess Coleslaw for lunch. I'm like, Shit. So they put it on my slate and then after I eat the Coleslaw you at first I'm like, oh, he wants me eat this for some reason to do this. And then the next time at dinner and I'm like, okay, finally. No. Cool. So it's like military big bastard, Jude eight first. I remember

Speaker 5:          00:23:46       you, you get to school goals, so damn happy. Those aren't, you know, so yeah. Yeah. That's uh, that's boot camp, right? Yeah. That's okay. I always thought when I talked to that are going on, I'm like, just play the game. Understand it's going to end and make the army what you can make it like make it work for you. I understand the job you're getting yourself into and things like that because people ask, would you still join if you know what happened? And I said, yeah, absolutely I would. Um, I enjoyed every second. I was going to be a 20 year guy. I figured and I reenlisted and, and uh, just,

Speaker 3:          00:24:16       you know. Yeah, it's cool. This is cool. A thing that you wrote kind of as you're wrapping up bootcamp, um, you're thinking about September 11th, you know, like I said, that for you is one that you clearly knew that going in in 2006 and here's what you said. I remember feeling a ragged mix of emotions, anger, confusion, dismay, and wondering why anybody would want to do this to us. I was American, I understood we'd been attacked and that our country was now at war. And that when there's a war, somebody needs to have the courage and intestinal wherewithal to do the actual defending, fighting and unavoidable killing that accompany military actions that would turn out to be me.

Speaker 3:          00:25:03       And that's another thing that people need to think about if you're doing in the military. And I've gone through this with a bunch of people that, you know, I, I, this happened to be a long time ago, this parent, you know, said, can you come talk to my son and he really wants to be a seal. And I was like, yeah, sure, no problem. And so I meet this kid strapping young kid, look super happy and positive and he does water polo and he's a great athlete. And he's like, yeah, I really want to do it in the seal teams. You know, what advice do you have for me? I'm like, are, are you ready to kill people and are you ready to die? And it was like the whole room got just them two but they're looking at me like I'm crazy. But my point was like, that's what the military is. You kill people and you risk your life. That's, that's what the military is

Speaker 5:          00:25:42       mean. Yeah, absolutely. They have the combat and noncombat a combat mos is, you know, just in every of your service. So with the seal teams, with the infantry, that's, that's what your job is and you're willing to risk your life. Um, for others. I mean it's just when I signed up I was like, yeah, I'm ready to do this, but you're never really understand everything. And then when you go through basic training and they show you all these videos and a lot of it, they showed a lot of band of brothers stuff, which is what got me interested in going into the military. And um, I just took it as like, this is what I is what I'm born to do. This is awesome. Yeah. But when I get what you're saying and then people ask me, can you talk to out of doing this?

Speaker 5:          00:26:16       And I'm like, no, no, you can't. You can't talk yet. Poor a young man out there doing this stuff. Find people that want to tell you like, well, I was going to join. But then I did this and I'm like, I don't, I don't care. Like don't, you know, and everybody I talk to, not everybody, but that's what I talked to. They got to give me their worst story possible. I was like, oh, I got a brother who's a friend that lost two legs, you know, in a bear trap. And I'm like, okay, so I know what you're going through. I don't. Okay. That works for me

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       I guess. Do you got to watch out for them? Bear trap. Sneak up on you. My brother's friend was crazy. I met him one time. When I get what you're, I know exactly what you're doing. I'm like, oh, okay dude.

Speaker 1:          00:26:55       Uh, this cracked me up. You're at airborne school most you're doing your first jumps. Do five jumps at airborne school, most back to the book most without incident, except my third jump, which was supposed to be a daytime combat jump with full gear on the way down. I dropped my rucksack too slowly. You're supposed to release it when you come to the tree line. But when I released the packet, stayed just ahead of me and I landed on top of the metal frame frame. Ouch. I yelled in pain. The jump master was already on the ground and yelled back at me, did you bring something private mills? I said, no. He glared at me and added then shut up. I showed up airborne schools. Really funny. And so this is what happened to me at airborne school. I was a first for review. I'm not like I'm, I, I'm a person that falls fast through the air when parachuting.

Speaker 1:          00:27:43       I don't know why I'm just one of those people float though. I don't flow. And, and the other thing was I didn't like doing a PLF, which is the proper way to land, which is you keep your feet and knees together and then you like act like you have one big leg and that's the way you're supposed to prevent getting injured, breaking your ankle or knee or whatever. And so when I was parachuting at Airborne School, I wasn't really doing a PLF. I was just kind of athletically landing on my feet, right? So anyways, they got these loudspeakers down on the, on the, uh, field. And as all these new guys, all of us are just new. And the guys on the megaphone, he goes and he's talking to me because my feet are apart and I'm just going to do an athletic cleaning, goes feet, knees together, feet together, a bone feed, knees together on the street, names together, a burn. Y'all write airborne.

Speaker 4:          00:28:29       So, uh, yeah, I thought that was funny. Is that correct? Did it hurt? No, I didn't get hurt. That's impressive to get hurt because you got, you know, I was a, I was actually a jump master dart towards the end of my military time that was in and you know, got the balls of feet, calf, you know, I had it all day. You had dialed, oh, those instructors, how long has the jump master school to be an instructor at Fort Benning? Well, Admin, so it's completely different. So it's not that much different I guess. But for me it was like a three week course and I was able to like check people's equipment, but they didn't make you memorize the Turman. Oh, they did. Did, did they? Uh, you got to memorize like the pre jump brief and everything and stuff like that. But no, like, like this is a nylon stitch with 5,000 grain testing. Steel is stronger than America, so he doesn't no way stronger than in America. No Way. But no, they don't. They don't do that to you. That's a, that's a good good

Speaker 1:          00:29:21       times. Um, you're getting ready for your first deployment to show up at 82nd. Everyone, you're, you're there, you're getting ready for your first deployment. You know, you're going to Afghanistan and you're leaving just after Christmas and here or go into the book. My Dad didn't to me about leaving

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       over the next few days. We hung out and did whatever we normally did, but most he said during that time was be sure to keep your head down. Then the day before I left, Dad told me a story about when he went into the army, he taken washable paint and written a note to his parents in their shower stall where they were sure to be able to see it. It said one short sentence of reassurance. All will be fine. Early in the morning that I left, I took a washable marker and went into my parents' bathroom right above the faucets where they were sure to see it. I wrote the same short message. All will be fine. I was miles away from the house. When my dad called, he told me he saw the note, I didn't say much and he didn't say much. He told me he loved me. Then his voice became hoarse and his words of support for me came out, broken and choked. First time going on deployment.

Speaker 5:          00:30:49       And it was, it was a little rough too because I'm a guy from my hometown, a marine. Uh, he was a buddy of mine. His Dad was my baseball coach. His brother was in my grade and the day after Christmas on the 26th, he got shot by a sniper in Iraq and ended up right to his heart and he didn't make it home. So his, uh, my brother's actually, his girlfriend was his, uh, Chris is a little sister and she was at my house and I found out from, from friends that what had happened before the family found out from people that were deployed with the unit. So, I mean that was, that was rough on my parents, you know, to have me, you know, in a couple of weeks going overseas and then I'm at home the day after Christmas, you know, a guy gets shot that I know.

Speaker 3:          00:31:28       Yeah, there's uh, um, it's one, I think that's one of the hardest things for a win. Win military families see someone wounded or killed, they know that that could be their, their loved one. And that's why that, that's, I mean a days before you're leaving, man. That's, that's harsh.

Speaker 5:          00:31:47       And, and then we're good. We're close friends with the family. Like, like I said, his dad coached me from I think 10 years old, up to 14. Yeah, 14 or 15, but you know, knew the family, are they? Well, so, so it was a little rough and things like that for a bit, uh, on my parents. But you know, people now when they see me, they say, Hey, do you go and speak to a lot of military things? And I'm like, you know, I don't really do that that much. If they want me to come in I will, but I'm not sure. But guys are going overseas want to see me on stage saying, hey guys, you're going to be a okay. You know, I'm yes, try not get her out. I mean, I mean I talked a lot of companies but when it comes down to that I'm like, hey guys, you'll be good over there. It's like some movie that that six uh, I don't know it is, but they're like maple tree made me the man I am today. Yes. Yeah, I've never seen it. Mega told that line and he's got like two fake legs. He's good. He's real good with movie quotes, especially bad movie. I'm so glad I forgot you were here. No, it's great. Now and then chime in

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       here. So your first deployment, what are you, are you in the e three Ernie for? Um, when I went over there, I think I was in e three. That's, I might have been an easy to actually, am I personalizing, I was only in the military like six months where I deployed. That's, that's crazy. I was a good time. I worked for a colonel basically PSD for the kernel, right? Yeah. Yeah. So like try me and like a young private, you go to a unit that's not an infantry, you don't get treated like crap. You work for a, uh, lieutenant colonel who was a direct descendant of colonel Custer. He's, uh, it was his great uncle and the guys just as wild Scotty d and he always walk around and see what's better than a pair of vases, guys to pair. And he show like the double A's on his own and a phenomenal guy really.

Speaker 4:          00:33:25       And we just go around with them. So we ever got yelled at or my, my team leader was, was a cook sergeant rush. Like if we, if we ever got yelled at, he just go to the colonel and be like, hey, so they're bothering us. And in the crumby be like, don't even talk to my guys. And I'm like, this is so nice. Being protected sign. Literally a colonel. So that was a relatively Kush. And you were living on a, if you're with a colonel, I'm assuming you were living in like pretty good fom Salerno. Oh yeah. And they have like hard buildings and they had tents. We were in the very first hard building. Oh. We all went in and bought a satellite Internet. I had a shower every day. Hot meals. It was a wonder if, how often are you rolling out into town every day.

Speaker 4:          00:34:00       Okay. But we'd go out to government work and come back, you know, and then I was in the gym. I'd go eight o'clock. I don't like being in the gym with people. Like I was like, I don't know, none of my machines. And I super set it a lot. So I'd go from eight till 11 at night, just crush it. And then midnight child, which is like the greatest thing ever. Yeah, no crowd. Oh, you just, you're like, I'll like omelets and hot wings. Oh, you get the Combo breakfast and dinner scenario booming down. I know you're a much cooler guy than me, but when you got the midnight child, five sal, I'm telling you, it's like, yeah, I went to the hot wings, I'll take pancakes and, and don't, she doesn't take mashed potatoes with gravy on that.

Speaker 4:          00:34:39       And uh, you guys, it sounds like on that first, well you didn't, you didn't even shoot, you even shoot your gun first employee didn't have to, I was on patrols every day. I had a suicide bomber run out the house and like detonated on the front of our truck. Just like what an idiot. No, I mean like, and like, you know, it's nuts. Ax hanging off the light and as you know, but he's just, the truck's not hurting. It's like genius Bro. Genius job. Well done. A for effort. Yeah. Like a F for judgment. Yeah. Yeah. But still that, I mean that, that having a suicide bomber hit your truck, that's like, uh, that's at least a reality check out a minimum. Right? Well, I mean, yeah, so it was, it was our, our uh, one of our front trucks and then also we had a guy run up on the kernel opening the hospital and detonate himself.

Speaker 4:          00:35:26       Um, I was in the truck at that time, like in the gun, but we just found out if we go out there and we just make sure that everyone knows, we're really aware. Every time we take a turn, you know, our guns are rotating, we're not sleeping, we're up and out. Um, we didn't really get messed with and um, and that, and that helped. I mean, I was, you know, I was in a place where there was bombs and things like that, but I was very protected, you know, dod would roll out before the colonel went anywhere. Oh, that's right. Yeah. How many guns, how many go on trucks did you take on a convoy? Just portal. Just four of us would have been the three truck or two trucks. He was in the two. I was just a hundred the first, like six months.

Speaker 4:          00:36:00       And then I was a, I moved to like be a TC, but it, it, it, the threat level was like medium. I mean, cause you have to take it. Yeah. You can take a bigger convoy with more aggressive facilities. If I was in the Hump, it was all Humvees we were before, like any other there. And I had a two, four, nine like is my, my main weapon I had to saw. They're like, yeah, okay. The front truck. Yep. 50 cal a backdrop. We're gonna give you a mark and you just going to get a saw. And I was like, oh, awesome. Thank you. So I had, I had a saw. That's what I put it up there. Like it was a big old gun. Yeah. That's awesome. Good Times. Yeah. Why didn't they give you a real gun up there? Uh, apparently the, my biceps were big enough.

Speaker 4:          00:36:43       That was a real gun show, you know, and I get that. I had 22 at the time. I got some supplements sent to me. Respect SF guys found a way for me to get some of their supplements. Wonderful. Uh, no. Do you went to for, is this the, is this deployment you went for a home for R and R on? It is and you had your first meeting, first meeting with one of your platoon mates, sisters, you know, I love it. I love to antagonize people. And I got in my space friend request and uh, I thought, man, this must be a dating Paige is it, you know, cowgirl hat around blouse, shirt, whatever, Jean skirt. I was like, that's a dating site. You know, there's an ad, wait a second, that last name is Sam was my medic. Let's do some investigation. He was home and rnr and I was looking through, I was like, that's his little sister.

Speaker 4:          00:37:31       She's 18 so it's legal. And I was just like, except you know, and we started chit chatting and I just did to make him mad, you know, but we ended up enjoying each other's company the first time we ever met. I was like, I just a vacation. I've been here 11 and a half months, you know, I got coming home for three for a 18 days. You want, you want to go on vacation? She was like, yeah, sure. So we decide we're going to go to Cozumel, Mexico. How'd you, how'd you talk to her dad into that? She was 18, so she knew what she wanted, I guess. I don't know. He didn't kill me so heavy. Right. And so you go to Mexico, that's your first date. Is that I'm just going to take you to Mexico. Yeah. Yeah. You guys. I say, I don't know that $24,000 when I know exactly where, um, went to Mexico, then back to Michigan for a week, had a great time.

Speaker 4:          00:38:13       Uh, she went back to Texas, had to go back overseas. I got held up in Atlanta, so I called her up, was like, Hey, I'm in Atlanta for the night. You want to come? And she said, yeah. So she came out the next morning saying our goodbyes crocodile to your streaming from her face. Um, and she's like, I love you. And I'm like, I'm no idiot. So I love you too. You know, as fast as I could. It's like, I love you all. I didn't even pause. It's just like in between her soft, I wanna marry you. And I'm like, yeah, I get that. But you know, in my head I said that cause I was like, I want to marry you to real Casanova here, jump on that airplane, get back overseas, give her a call. Right. 24 hours later and Afghanistan, I'm like, Hey, what's going on baby? She's like, guess what? I'm like, I don't know what weddings plans.

Speaker 4:          00:38:53       zales.com bought her a ring and called her dad and whatnot and he living, I guess that's cool. I'm like, well, okay, thanks. And then we got married. How did her brother feel about it? Was he was her brother in your platoon with you? I'll use my medic. Yeah, he actually wrote in the same truck as me am I colonel would pick on him on the radio. Hey Buck, what do you think mills is doing with your sister? And it's like, I'm like breakfast break. You can let that go because you mean I'm standing up in the truck, you know? And Josh can do hammer makes when the back seat. And I'm like, no, no, no. Don't do this. Don't do this here. Um, but, uh, no, he, he knew I was good guy. He's like, he told his mom and dad, he's like, look, I know how it looks.

Speaker 4:          00:39:29       And he's actually a good guy and really nice. So we'll see how it works out. And then I ended up marrying her. Yeah, no, that's awesome man. That's a great story. Do you detail it, um, in here that it's pretty, uh, it's pretty unbelievable. You know, that you pulled all that off? Well, in the colonel was actually setting me up to go to the prep school in Virginia for West Point. He's like, you should be playing football on my, my uh, lieutenant at the time. Um, Lieutenant Phillips, now he's a major but, or maybe as a colonel now, but, um, he was training, he was a football coach and he holds a record in Chicago. Yeah. Most consecutive losses at the school that he was coaching hat in high school. Yeah. They were that bad. Great guy though. And he was like helping me coach and train up and lift weights and do whatever.

Speaker 4:          00:40:12       But then I met Kelsey, I was like, I be, I'm just going to do this, you know? So we got married when I got back. How long, how long after you went home for Christmas did you come back? Uh, I came back in April and the 13th night. 14th morning. And then you won't find it in my book, but we got married at the courthouse on the 17th. So there you go. Yeah. And then we got married again and big wedding junior like most miniature, that money. Well, I needed to, I spent all my money, you know, I was like, I don't know how to get a house. So I'm on, I'm like, look, we need to, I need that Bh face during must've favor with this damn wedding. You know? So when you guys do your waiver in Texas in Mckinney, about 112 that day, and then, uh, did you say you settled down and now you, now you know, you're staying in the army, you've pretty pretty much saying, I'm saying the army at this point.

Speaker 4:          00:40:57       Well, I mean, I really enjoyed it. I got moved around to another unit and when I got back because I had to go to like a line unit, couldn't be a PSD guy. I mean I was up for it. I was like, this is awesome. But uh, yeah, we've got a house or an apartment in North Carolina, uh, right outside Fort Bragg there bought a dog. Um, life was good and I figured the military is doing well and then just kind of hung out for 15 months or 18 months before I deployed. I was going to say, so it's 18 months between deployments for you? It was that usually a year and three months. So like I went for 15 months, so they gave me 18 months off and I went for a year and then I, they gave me, um, 15 months off. Then I had to go again for my third. But I'm jumping ahead here.

Speaker 3:          00:41:35       So you, you get back over on deployment? Um,

Speaker 2:          00:41:39       yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:41:40       And this is, uh, this is like within days that you deal type me up on that, but one of your, one of your friends, Tyler Juden is saying that, right? [inaudible] Yup. He's uh, out on amount of patrol. IED hits the first vehicle, then they get a snarl small arms ambush and I'm going to the book. Here are guys needed to get the disabled vehicle out of the way. And while they worked toward this objective, Tyler sprinted up to a high sight on a nearby hale and fired through some five to seven magazines, ammo protecting his soldiers below. When the disabled truck was finally cleared, Tyler sprinted back to the truck. But the enemy had specifically targeted him and RPG flew in and he was hit. They rushed him back to the hospital at the fob, but it was too late. Tyler died on the operating table.

Speaker 2:          00:42:26       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:42:27       fury rose up inside of me. I wanted to find whatever Taliban savages did this to Tyler and shoot them in the face. Tyler was always cautious. He took his job extremely seriously and never made mistakes. There was no reason for him to die. He described to me once how he believed his job as a sniper ultimately saved innocent lives. He was putting into practice what he knew to be true. He was helping the world, not hindering it, and he'd been trained to be one of the rough man who stands ready in the night, prepared to do his duty, prepared to visit violence on those who would do us harm Tyler's death far hit far too close to home and we'd only just arrived.

Speaker 2:          00:43:11       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:43:12       So that's not a fun way to kick off deployment. No. And I'm not sure if he's experienced in your unit, but it seems like the guys get hit are the ones that you don't expect will ever get hit. So Tyler was a year older than me. Uh, I respected him. I mean it was, it was crazy cause you know, a guy's your older cycle or whatever, but he had such a professionalism about them and I looked up to him and I tried to learn what I could from him. And he only had like a, he probably had an extra year and a half in the army than I did, but, but either way and highly ranked sniper and a, he went up and just, he didn't take bad shots, so he was just popping everybody. They did Tyree him. He actually, I'm pretty sure it was a camp Chapman that he at the end, not sure if you've ever been to the SF.

Speaker 4:          00:43:51       No, I haven't based there. Um, uh, but anyway, that's where he ended up not making, there's only two weeks into the appointment and um, you know, when, when that guy like that gets hit one you obviously frustrated and angry, you don't know why it happened, but two, it's like, well Geez, if he can get, you know, hit or taken out, you know, it kind of takes you down to competence, integrity, a peg or two as well because he's the guy you wouldn't expect. Not that you expect anybody to get hit I guess. But you know, like a super soldier style guy. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:44:18       Yeah. And I'm sure like everybody, if you held them in that regard, everybody held him in that regard and so everybody's feeling that same kind of a straight up nervousness, right? Yeah. And

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       there was, he would walk by like on our ACU is I could have a strange pulls, tuck the string in some standard stuff if my way that would be hanging out and he's what might yank on it and they make you do pushups and yell at me and I wanted to punch him in the face but I couldn't, you know, and I understood why he was doing it so much is a fun story I guess I like tell people cause I mean if I could've decked him I probably would have only been in one fist fight ever and knocked myself out playing volleyball. That was it. That was the one, yeah. It's sad but true. It's in the book. Yeah. I don't know what that really, you might as well tell it. Well yeah we just were playing volleyball and I never got mad is going over the net. We made [inaudible] for like cables for the antennas. We use those and five 50 cord and it was like quick go over net. I was six foot three and the net was only six foot tall. So I was like, just hammering it home. I had a vertical, you know, like Lebron. So he's ridiculous. Whole belly button above the net. And I kept going over and they kept yelling. So I pulled my hand back real fast for I did it and I caught myself right in the eye socket knocked out.

Speaker 4:          00:45:34       Do you actually knocked yourself out? Yeah. Yeah. But, but later on when I had this happen, I didn't get knocked out. Game engine with a fist of fury could've done Floyd winter stood a chance against me. I don't know if I'm impressed, if that's like super impressive or super not impressive. Right. You either have the office of iron or glass jaw. We're not sure which. I hit a bomb knocked out. So my answers had been just of iron. The questions have been answered. Probably be in jail right now if I went in fisticuffs with anybody. So, uh, you, it sounds like you guys ended up doing Overwatch's of a road in, um, what up bae?

Speaker 5:          00:46:15       Zach Pass. Okay. Yeah. And great time. How long were you on that for? Oh, we went out there and they were like, yeah, just go ahead and pack for you know, a couple of weeks. And then we were out there I think 57 50 days or so. And we just live on top of a mountain. And then like just monitoring the road. Yeah. Just cause they had a, they were bringing up convoys that jingle trucks with military gear on to build another farb and we had people on both sides. And I actually, uh, I was so afraid to tell my wife I went down one day and get some food or something or get a resupply and uh, I'm only back up. They made a stop. They want to register mortars. And I was like, what the, I just want to get back up there. I got out and I slammed my door and like the brilliant guy am, I went ahead and use a fist.

Speaker 5:          00:46:56       If you're in a hammer to homer and I ripped the scab open on my hand and I told the wife my story of my life, it was so much blood, it was gushing was ridiculous. But, uh, as my wedding ring fingers, I took my wedding ring off, put on the front of the Hummer and I got the medic. I was like, get out your doc, you know, Willis or whatever have fixed this up for me. And he had to put tape on it. I got back in, left my wedding ring right on the front of that Hummer and drove back up mountain. So lakes for 37 days. Every time I got a chance to go down the mountain I was headed metal detector out. Like please find this tungsten ring please. I don't want to tell my whole life

Speaker 4:          00:47:25       I you have in front of it. And I,

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       I was like to give people that didn't serve a little, you know, impression or of of what it's like. And I thought this one wrapped it up pretty good. Going to the book here, going so long without taking a shower came with its share of complications. Guys got trench foot from their feet being wet and sweaty and not taking care of them properly. I got strange rashes in intimate areas and it wasn't uncommon for a guy to mutter about his balls sticking to his leg when he hiked. Every dude got chafed up pretty badly in his bodily crevices. And a common complaint was that a guy had SLAs, slang for sweaty ass. My armpits hurt. I sweated so much that the salt got trapped in my skin and my back broke out in a raised bubbly rash. This happened to other guys too. The only solution is to get your ID card out and have another dude scrape your back hard until the salt crystals pop out. It's a brutal procedure and it feels like getting cut with a razor blade, but it's all part of the fun day to day, day to day get. So

Speaker 4:          00:48:39       I mean it sounds like I was complaining to them that one, Huh? No. Yeah, watching someone like scrape salt crystals like size of table salt come out of there. But I'm not sure if you've ever experienced anything like that. No, but uh, yeah, that's pretty bad. And you get so gross and then, I don't know, I took four real showers out here. Yeah, like real ones. I mean you'd go get a water bottle and poke holes in the top and spray yourself down, but then you got to get dirty all over again. This whole long process or like how it takes like nine days or something before you get comfortable with your nasty. Yeah. Yeah. And then you don't even want to break the cycle and get clean again. Take you 90 days to get used to it again. No, the best part, it's like the winter, cause you don't smell as bad in the winter.

Speaker 4:          00:49:16       Like when the winter you don't take showers, you're like, oh it doesn't even matter. I brush my teeth keeping pearly white teeth look whiter, you know? But uh, yeah, no, it's pretty. I actually decided I'm halfway into that deployment. I was like told, my wife just sent me eight pair range of panties. So I wore a whole bear like range of panties for a month and I just took them off. I was like, no, we're not gonna wash these just all more here except it and move on 12 bucks. Wellsmith so matter of fact, whereas abs like past my, uh, my pants got so torn, they were like chats. Like I bought chicks are hanging out stuff and one of the sergeant majors came in, you know, and they're all out of out of shape. Like looking back at diction, change brands. I'm like Sargent Major. If I change my pants, I'm gonna get another pair. It looks just like this. Like I'm not on the fob and you come into like, you got to get a new uniform and all that. I'm like, bring me one. I'm like, yeah, okay, let me do that. You got it bud. I know. Going to get back in that truck and roll your ass out of here. So back to the chicken wings and pancakes. Oh, I know a lot of Mras delicious.

Speaker 1:          00:50:19       Good Times. Yeah. You know I gotta just straight up. I mean in, in the seal teams we just don't GAF to

Speaker 3:          00:50:27       eat that many. Mrs is yet to do the, either you make them, you can make those things delicious. Yeah, you can. That burrito get at me makes it a little bit in there. Yeah. Uh, I actually, my first deployment to Iraq, we eight Mras for a little while and I was legitimately sick of them and, and it wasn't, it wasn't that long, but I was already sick of them at one. No 50 days. I can promise you that. Yeah. Well I mean, yeah. Yeah. You're just going to say something about the seal teams weren't you? No, not, I would never, I don't have fiscal period defend myself. So we're getting shipped in steaks, crap like that. I mean that later on that point we had like steaks on like one day a week they'd bring out like these frozen steaks and we'd cook them over like an open pit of fire with the stick through them.

Speaker 3:          00:51:14       Yeah. Dude is legit. Like I, we'd go out to some rant, my first and when we'd go out to, cause we were living at, we on by op and Baghdad, Big Chow Hall, everything good. And we'd go out to do an op somewhere to be some SF group in the middle of nowhere and you'd see how they're living. And it wasn't always an SF group or someone's just an army, you know, some Army platoon or company out there in the middle of nowhere and you're like, Dang, these boys are roughing it nasty and we're here. Like they brought Gatorade. They bought a case. Give me too. Me Too. I'm a hide one of my pillow case. You'd feel bad. They did. Oh man, you're in the seal teams are like, dude, I'm ashamed to do like even be hanging out with you right now. You guys smell so bad, but I don't know why they brought me out here.

Speaker 3:          00:51:54       You guys go sit over there. We're just gonna sit here. Leave us alone. We'd hit guys. Do you know what? We've gone three days without a shower. This is crap, man. Yeah, we did that. Let's totally the same life, but in during this, I mean, and during the shock is still like, it's funny like my friends from high school, right? I have two really good friends, I can talk with whatever, but if I run to another person from high school or whatever, we'll catch up on everything. Then it's like, oh great talking to you and you know, and then you'd find a way out the conversation, but you run the military buddies you haven't seen in years and you can just go right back into it. You know, just cause you understand where you've been, where you're going through. Um, speaking to going through stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:52:36       Here we go back to the book, the Taliban screeched to a stop and started shooting at the amp bullets cracked all around us. We got word from higher command to engage. I yelled to my men fire, we shot our rifles and Schwartz let loose with several bursts of machine gun rat, a tat, tat rat, a tat, tat rat a tat tat. This is my first large scale fire fight of any kind. It hit me with a wham that this wasn't really a training exercise anymore. This was the real deal. My adrenaline rose and way that a surge of energy, but I also felt calm as if all my training kicked in at once and I just did what I was trained to do. I honestly wasn't afraid. I took aim and fired at the bad guys. They fired at me and it didn't phase me to think that I might kill somebody when I wanted, when they wanted to kill me first, I, several Taliban members get hit and fall more, fell and more.

Speaker 3:          00:53:29       The last few who are left turned around and took off, took off up the wadi. We got word to get not to give chase because why? These are great choke points for a potential enemy and bushes. When the shooting died down completely, we approached close enough to see the bodies of the enemy soldiers I just helped to kill. It was a surreal feeling, but I reminded myself that this is what a soldier's are built to do. We receive reports later that three of my men are three of the men killed were top Taliban leaders in the region. So there's your first gunfight.

Speaker 4:          00:54:03       Yeah, it was pretty awesome. So the a and p m AP commander was a former Taliban guy and he switched over sides and ran NP and he was like, yeah, they're having a big meeting. I got to call, they're going to come down this Swati, we'll go check it out. And then all of a sudden just like just dropping, you know, Martin 19 and, um, the 50 cal and two 40 on him and just hey, you know, going nuts. And then, uh, then, you know, they, they come back and they, they, they're really good about taking their bodies away with them. You know, they're, they're pretty good about it, but they were like 18 or a 20 people deep in the, in the wadi coming in. We just led into him and uh, yeah, that was my first like real taste of like I shoot my gun at people.

Speaker 4:          00:54:40       What were you a team leader at this point? Uh, no, I was so I was actually a squad leader. Oh, that's right. I was, I was a position up so I was still in e five, but I was in a squad leader position so I was trying to do is of what a weapons squad? No, no, that we were actually, uh, we were mounted. So I had my own truck, but I had two tracks that were under me, so I had to, to uh, two trucks that were two teams. [inaudible] had two team leaders that were underneath me and then we each had a truck. So my senior like team leader had one, he was a TC of his truck and then as a TC of the junior team leader that, yeah, that's a good time.

Speaker 3:          00:55:15       Again, I said that it does speak in somewhere or the other day and I said something along those lines and like somebody said like, I think it's kind of weird that you say it's good time and fun. And I'm like, well, it's adrenaline rush. Like, yeah, that's a good time and fun. I mean

Speaker 4:          00:55:31       they shot at me first and then he started it. Defend Yourself. But uh, yeah, and then I mean, yeah, it just, it doesn't, it didn't phase me, it didn't hit me hard. I wasn't worried about it. Um, just kept moving on. It. Matter of fact, that region died right down like completely after that if you kill all those bad guys, they just in fact like a, that was our first night out there too. They moved out to the middle of nowhere and the snow storm and I was like, maybe I have not first night or second night out there and we just shot everybody and then for the next like two months it was quiet and they were like, they back filled with some other platoon that like, hey, we're going to bring you in this platoon here. You guys are going to go up north where there's a lot of fighting in Baltimore. God, all right, cool. Let's do it. So that's, that's the next big movement that you made was that spot and that place had a bad rep like as far as being a lot of fighting there. I bomb guy was real heavy,

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       real heavy. It was, I'm the bottom of river. And when we got there, um, the Italians were there before us and I guess they were just like, hey, Taliban, don't mess with us. Here's, here's some money and we're good. And we're, uh, we're the a second. So we're like, no, not going to happen. And the infantry platoon that we replaced, I mean, for the record, I am infantry, I was in a cab unit, but they always have a Charlie troop is an infantry platoon. They bring in and then we had these coin between was always like two infantry in two cab squads to make platoons up. But um, yeah, we replaced these uh, immature guys. They had two guys killed, unfortunately fell into a river. There's actually a ceasefire with the Taliban defined the bodies and bring the bodies back. Um, and we got up there and there was like a, a line in the sand.

Speaker 5:          00:57:06       They said, look, you cross this line, you're going to get shot at. And we were like, all right, cool. So we, we started taking ground and um, everywhere that there's a fighting position on top of the mountain, they would booby trap it when they were done. So a guy, one of the Fo's, Sergeant Fox, good guy, he picked up a matchbox. It's like, Yep, I got a matchbox it looks like. And then just finally found his torso that was, you know, everything else was gone, just his body armor. Um, but instead of staying in one spot at this one, we took one more spot and they're like, yeah, well some um, Marsac guys went up here was these, the strong points are corvette and impala is that we're talking about now? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. These are in your book, you talk about those being an impala was the, the even worse one, even further into enemy territory.

Speaker 5:          00:57:55       Yeah. And they were like, yeah, we had like a march. That guy got shot in the head when he was up there. Um, because there's like an eight man team that went in there. Like, you guys can't really go there. So we decided one night we're going to go there. We'd trained, we've got all ready for it. Uh, what was the impala physically, what does it like a little, uh, former, like, like house or something. It was actually absolutely as a house. Um, and we decided we're going to take it one night because it was the last house on the edge of town and then there was 1200 meters between the next like village and the Taliban would go in there and shoot at us and you know, be able to sneak down away far enough. And, uh, we had, um, a javelin team come up on one side.

Speaker 5:          00:58:32       We went up in the middle of night on this side and we had other people on this side and we just, we just took it in the middle of the night and then they said, we're going to go up there for like three days. Do we constantly come back? And they're like, Hey, you know what? We're going to stay there. So the work didn't stop. We had to fill sandbags, put up barbed wire. Um, and then we went up the side of a mountain and, and Doug in a, uh, um, an LP, but it was like we had 21 guys or a tablet and never knew. We only had 20 minutes a one man platoon. So we had like 13 down at the cop and then we'd sent the rest of them up on top of the hill and we dug in so deep that was eight foot deep pits and there was a living room, uh, two 40 pit, a 50 cal pit, um, uh, like a little dining kitchen area.

Speaker 5:          00:59:15       And then like three sleeping pits, like three, like that two cots would fit in. Like it was huge. Did you put overhead cover on them somehow? Uh, no. We just dug them deep enough where he didn't, didn't need it. Yeah. I mean we put our, I guess we put our, uh, um, ponchos over it, you know, things like that. Not Protection from mortars. No, no. Yeah. And if you stood up when they were digging it and they started digging it, when you stood up and you were digging, they start shooting at us. And then we just rain hell. And, um, we dug in and after about a month of that, we just were killing so many. They just gave it up. They're like, all right, we're done. Um, and that's where we, I mean, we can't, they came out, we were black on water and then like the brass came out.

Speaker 5:          00:59:51       They're like, well, why don't you guys shaven? Where's your haircuts? I'm like, Hey, we didn't have water. Are you kidding me right now, bro? And then at the same sergeant, you're yelling for my pants. They wanted to go up to cop. So my platoon sergeants like, hey, sergeant middles, I need you. Can you take one of your teams and just go? So we took four men out and I walked them right over what I thought the road was clear, you know, but it was all filled with water when we took the place walking more huge IUTs that just the batteries had died in them cause they waited, we waited too long. But when they're dried up, like, oh, there's a mortar. Oh look at that. That's it. That's 18 mine and triple stack, you know? Um, but anyways, side would like took them up on top of the [inaudible] and stuff like that.

Speaker 5:          01:00:26       And it was funny because as they're yelling at us for not being shaven or cleaned up, I go according to the way up this just like a hundred yards probably like I'm a straight up and I go up a quarter of the way with them and I said, all right, I'll be right back. So I run to the top and I'd say, Hey Lt, you know, the sergeant major is coming up in the kernel so just be ready, you know, sort of like trying to put our uniforms on and everything instead of like just our tee shirts. And I run back down and he's bear calling. He said, sounds like I can't do it. I'm like, no, eat your midnight child. Childless us alone. How about that? Are you kidding me? Did he make it to the OPI? He made it up to the top. He did eventually.

Speaker 5:          01:01:00       And I'm like, but I came back down. I kind of put a little bit of fear in him. I said, sergeant major, this is not the spot that you want to stop right there, that town that's Taliban held anybody in that town's shoots at us. And if they see that we're not moving quick, they're going to take pop shots. So you're gonna need to, yeah, I mean mostly true. Yeah. And he's like, he was like sitting down and looking and I was like, no, no, no, no. You need to need to move. Sorry to make you need to go. And I mean, and no offense to Nebraska, it wasn't even my sergeant major. I don't think that was there at the time. It was like a different unit or whatever. But, but yeah, I mean it was, it was a, it was a wild, wild west.

Speaker 5:          01:01:31       We were just shooting, um, firefights everyday, but we were the northern limit, you know, there was no buddy farther posts, uh, push to than us. Yeah. I want one part. You're talking about how you, you ended up shooting 11 javelins in, in a day, I think. Yeah. That's, that's getting after it on pretty much anyone's standards. Yeah. I think we shot 29, that whole deployment. Um, it was, it was cool. Damn. Um, so you conventional army can be fun. Yeah. Yeah. Do the conventional army we were within Ramadi were freaking getting after it every single day is, they were awesome. Awesome. Um, like you were getting in a firefight everyday there, huh? Um, or for a bit. There we were and then it died right down. They were just tired because you know, once they shot once

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       we just, we let loose. We had enough ammo to, to last us for years probably and we let them know we'd let them know. Yeah. America's real cool when it comes to ammo. Yeah. In those situations it's like, oh, you guys need more. Yeah, we'll be right there. Uh, all right. You are. Yeah. Seem to happen. You were like, you were like, did you find you found triple stacked ids in your position? Yeah. So dumbest thing ever. We went in and we cleared it and then we had like marines, EOD, like Marsac EOD clear stuff. Like there was like an unexploded RPG round in the side of one in the walls. And then there was other booby traps while it turns out where we were rolling all of our big barrels for the generator and stuff like that was like, it was all bootstrapped, right.

Speaker 4:          01:03:06       We're exactly where we step. And this guy, Sergeant Barton, he's a great guy. He, there's this metal out of the ground. He's like, Huh, what's that? Starts beating on it with a shovel. And I'm going, I'm getting ready to go on my rnr Tang and like, what are you doing dude? Cause like some in the ground here, just looking, looking at it and started digging around. He's like, oh, oh that's not oh shit. And then it turns out we were on these 50 gallon drums taking all this supplies. Oh, right over top, right in the breezeway. God is where I would. So it was so hot there. And uh, I mean I get I racks out too, but it was so hot. Like me and my buddy who was on my, uh, team, uh, leaders, um, would go out there and spare ourselves as water. Bobby being our PT shorts, sprays out of the water bottle, lay on our cots and just see how long it took to dry. Usually about 10 to 15 minutes to get completely dry. And our costs were right on top of these just and no, I do cause I mean EOD came through and they didn't find it.

Speaker 3:          01:03:57       So was it, you figure it was like a command debt that had the battery died or something?

Speaker 4:          01:04:01       Uh, it was uh, yeah, well it was um, a pressure plates. Oh my XO. Like these big drums were having the circuit connect but the batteries and I'm dying, you know. Luckily we didn't take the property to, you know, after like the, I think after the march that guy's got hit. Um, they went in there and booby trapped at all knowing that we were trying to take it, but somehow the batteries didn't work, which helped out for us because we like, we jumped over a rock wall that they had where there's like a hole in the wall ready from probably a hell fire or something from time before. So right where we, you know, obviously be easy place for us to jump over. That's where we all jumped over and there was stuff stack there too. So

Speaker 3:          01:04:36       it's where you talk about it in here. Um, and, and I heard this from the Vietnam seals. They would set up ambushes on VC and they would, you know, go, okay, we're going to shoot from here and when we shoot from here, they're going to take cover over here behind this lock. So they'd put a big claim or one underneath that log and there you're, you're talking about how the Taliban is doing the same thing over there. Um, you know, basically, oh, we, as soon as we start shooting at them, they're going to run to these covered positions. So we'll just put booby traps your minds in any of these covered positions.

Speaker 4:          01:05:05       Yeah, we actually had to change up our, uh, slps are standing operating procedures on my third deployment and instead of diving for cover, you had to take a knee. Yeah, that's, that's what I was reading it. I was just, that's what it reminded me of. It reminded me of that's, that's what

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       my predecessors in the seal teams in Vietnam would do to the enemy and now the enemy was doing it to us or to you guys. It's really scary. Um, this is, this is an interesting spot. You're heading home for leave. From there, I left in May and caught series of connecting flights home to America. I gave Kelsey a huge kiss at the airport in Dallas and when I got back to the house, gave our dog buddy a big hug. It felt great to be back, but it also felt surreal. And this is the strange part of this leave time. I didn't quite know what to do with myself. I could take a hot shower anytime I wanted. I could sit on the couch and play video games. I could drink a beer and eat a cheeseburger outside on the back porch. Nobody was shooting at me.

Speaker 3:          01:05:59       Nobody stunk. Nobody was sleeping on triple stacked. IDDS Kelsey was finishing up the semester with college and work. So I bought a truck and we drove up to Michigan to see my parents. We had a few bright and happy days with them than it was soon time to go. Just like that, I hugged my parents, gave Kelsey a big kiss and flew out to Detroit to head back overseas. It felt oddly good to be back to Afghanistan. The feeling is difficult to explain in America. When I'd hung around with some friends in Dallas and got reacquainted with some of my buddies from high school back in Michigan, I'd seen firsthand hand how most of the people my age lived. If a dude who's 22 or 23 like me, he was usually finishing up college or hanging out trying to find an internship or an entry level job.

Speaker 3:          01:06:47       He might be living in his parents' basement trying to scrape together enough money to move out, or maybe he was partying hard on weekends or maybe still in a frat. He was almost always short on money. Almost always wondering what to do with his future. Not that there was anything wrong with any of that guy's got to do what a guy's got to do. But by contrast, at my age in the military, I lead people in combat. I controlled firefights. I handled hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equipment. I made decisions that affected whether people would live or die. It felt real. On a personal level. I made decent money. I was married, I had a good credit score. I was thinking of buying a house soon. It felt good to be trusted with this much responsibility. I was proud of my drive and sense of accomplishment. I was already a man.

Speaker 3:          01:07:41       I think statements like that are like what? Get kids or if I say kids, but like when I meet kids, like I've just met at, at this uh, event we were just at in this, you know, he's like, Hey, I'm 19 I just joined the Marine Corps. I'm leaving September 18th and that statements like that is what I think makes people do in the middle of, it gets a lot of people that joined the military like 22 years old. Oh yeah, you're getting paid. You've got a steady job. Your job is more meaningful than any job they could have. I mean, nevermind, maybe they're working in fast food, right? Like I did. You don't, never mind that they're working Wendy's. Even

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       if they have a kick ass job somewhere, it doesn't matter. Your job is more meaningful because you're a soldier fighting for freedom. Yeah. And they would, you know, you'd go back home and you see what they're doing and you're like, wow, my life to change. You know? And I'm like, I'm going to Afghanistan. Uh, I got married, I have an apartment. I'd, you know, I'd have two cars or whatever. And it's at that young of an age, I mean, and my friends back home, they, they were still a really nice, and you know, I still get along with them and everything. I just felt like what I was doing was, was a different purpose. And, and I was trusted with more things. I mean, when you're in college and everybody's like, Oh, you're a kid in college, but when you're in the army and you're like, oh, you're in the army, you're on your second deployment, you know, what do you do it while I'm in charge of seven other lives is included as well as my own.

Speaker 4:          01:08:57       And I tell them where to move, what to do, how to shoot and how to do things. And they're like, oh, okay, yeah, I'll get some kid in the gym. They might jam, will be like, oh yeah, well you know, well I'm only 23 and I'll, oh yeah, when I was at 23,000 my third seal platoon killed. Actually we weren't, we were drinking beers because there was nothing going on. But anyway, still in Budweiser killing Budweiser, like a beast. Um, so then how did you feel about that two weeks of leave during the middle of deployment? Well, I mean, it's a constant worry. Like, how am my guys doing? We all had a satellite phone, we didn't have internet or things like that, so I couldn't just be like, hit him up real quick. On a, because the army is, makes you do that well, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:09:39       They, they allow it and then they, they say you need, you know this stuff. But they're pretty, aren't they? Don't they push it pretty hard? No, I mean, well that's uh, and I, and I don't just, uh, I don't discriminate. I don't know how to say this politically correct. There's, there's the army that's at Bagram air force base that wears PT belts that, you know, goes to Dunkin, goes and gets her Dunkin donuts and that complaints because not a lot of taste to hot. And then there's the people like us where it's like, there's 22 of us are 21 of us sitting out in middle of nowhere taking no showers. No one's going to come say, hey, you need to do this. We had one kid come out and I ran into him again and Lansing, Michigan actually had an event, you know, out of the military.

Speaker 4:          01:10:17       And I didn't realize it was him, but he came out, he chose to be a financial, um, guy, unless it is in the financial world and that's fine. Hey, you want to do finance or you want work on the s four shop great comes out. They're given a survey, some dumb survey that they're just whatever big army wants, you know the good idea, fairies or whatever. But he's on the rooftop and he's like, Oh man, I hope we get in a gun fight. It's going to be great and look over and say excuse me. And he's like, well no, I just, you know, cause I, I'm on the five all the time. I just, I love, I want to see a gun, you know, I hope we get in a firefight. I said, w what don't you get if they shoot at us, my guys could get hit for what you're hoping happens here.

Speaker 4:          01:10:51       I said, I got an idea, get off my roof. And he's like, well, I said, no, seriously get, I'm going to throw you off this roof. You don't get off it. And he looked at a critter. When am I when a guys and criticals, oh no, sergeant mills is real. He'll throw you off this room. And I said, if we get shot at, don't get my guys, wait, stay the fuck off the roof and get down. And he was just like, but I don't get it. I'm like, it's not a game. This isn't, I mean, when we get in a firefight, you know, we get, you know, people run up on their PT shorts and their flip flops and they got the Kevlar on their body armor. But I mean that's real. I bullets are flying and the way he was just so nonchalant. I hope we get a firefight.

Speaker 4:          01:11:26       That'd be really cool. It's like my guys could get shot. Like what, what part of cool don't you get? So I mean the, the, you know, the army does push something to, but other times were just left alone. Yeah. I just remember guys going from La, from guys that were in combat all the time, not fobbing but, and they did seem like the command, their commands wanted him to go home for those two weeks and hey man, you need to take this break on the leaves. Mandatory. Yeah. I thought you meant like calling home, calling home stuff's not man. [inaudible] going home. Sorry. Yeah, yeah. You have to go home. You have to go. Okay. That's what I thought in a lot of guys. Some guys don't want to, but you have to, you know the call home thing I think is is, I don't know how often you called home, but I tried to call him like once a week.

Speaker 4:          01:12:05       Once or twice a week. Because if you start doing more than that, I think it's worse on both before you run out of things to say, oh, that's cool. What's going, you know, for, I mean, no offense to anybody who loved life out there, but in my wife and I get along great, you know? But when I would call home, hey, were you doing well? I just know today in Afghanistan, I don't want to be like, well, I was out now I got shot at, and then I ended up killing two people and then this guy got hurt. But it's, it's okay, he's going to be fine. Don't worry about dates, you know? She can't say that Kinda stuff like, oh well, you know, I went on patrol today, got to help with help a kid tie his shoe, you know, and like that gets old.

Speaker 4:          01:12:33       And then what'd you do? Well, I went to school today and I mean there's no real story there, right? So you got to let it build for a week or two. You know, I, I definitely recommend that. I mean that in the nicest way. I know. Totally. And I think if you're, if you're calling home every day, then you're like, you're missing it. You're connecting and just like, no, like you said, let it build, have something to talk about Rio and cause then it gets annoying. Like, well, what are you thinking about? And then you get, you know, I see it happen. I, you know, I even say I, it happened to me and Kelsey, um, you know, like, what are you thinking about? Whoa. No. Are you thinking, what do you want to talk about? Well, I don't know. Oh, you got nothing to talk to me about.

Speaker 4:          01:13:07       It's like, well, no, I don't. And it's not a bad thing. It's not that I love you any less, it's that literally, I can't tell you what happened here because it's not going to make you feel better about the situation. So you know, another thing is, you know, you got all this stuff going on and the new website, you won't believe this and you're like, what? And she's like, um, we lost that library book that we got out and now they called and they want us to pay for it. And you're like, it just got the check was getting the check. We're going to be good. Are they overcharging? I mean, do your research, you find it online cheaper. Yeah. Yeah. Some of the big, the big, yeah, the big trauma drama at home, you know, they're wide eyed. Like, oh no. It's like, okay, well I watched the guy bleeding nose bleed out today and put my finger on a bullet holes, so I get what you're saying. The same thing. I was like, Whoa, my God, can you believe this? But you go ahead. Tell me about what happened with you. Tell you, tell me about the spoiled by mandates that you had on your sandwich. MMM. Oh, that's no joke. That's awful. You get home

Speaker 1:          01:14:11       from that deployment. Going back to the book, my parents flew down from Michigan, Josh and Deanna, this is your, Josh is your brother-in-law. DNS. His wife were there and some of the guys from my unit came over. I manned the barbecue smell of charcoal, fired hamburgers, drifted over the neighborhood, and I felt like the luckiest man alive. Kelsey and I had a dog, two cars and now a house. We were young family living the American dream. So you had the goal of Vine House and now you actually bought one, right?

Speaker 4:          01:14:40       Power of attorney. I called my wife and she's like, guess what I did today? I was like, what? She goes, I bought a house. I'm like, how'd you do that? She's like, well, you bought it on that piece of paper. I'm attorney. So speaking of jokes, I tell every time I talk get there. But uh, no. We bought a house and then my brother in law, he was, they had a young, a young child. They still do Reagan, but at the time she was like seven, eight months old I guess. And it's like you drink at night Josh, because I have responsibility, you know, like, oh I'm, I'm all holier than thou or something like I can't drink. And then by the end of the night he passed out in the fire. Junk is can be smoked a pack, a snack. He doesn't even smoke cigarettes, smoke cigarettes, trying to wake him up. He's in a fire ant here on my backyard like, oh, that hurts so bad. And then I was like responsibilities, famous last words back to them

Speaker 1:          01:15:26       book. Fortunately after I got home, I didn't struggle with any past memories of combat. Although I do, I know any number of soldiers who do. I told a few stories to Kelsey about our units, time and row and BMG about going without a shower for so long and about some firefights. We got into an impala and corvette, but she didn't like to talk about those things much and I understood that. I found I could shut off the memory's pretty easily. My logic was straightforward. I was a combat soldier. That's what I did. I told my mind to go to certain places and I refuse to allow it to go to other places. I found that I could connect with my family best that way. Although I know other guys handled things differently with equal success. And the reason I threw that in there, it's just cause you know, I get a lot of guys that asked me about how to handle

Speaker 4:          01:16:15       the, the whatever memories that are bringing it home. And I thought that was a pretty good methodology man. Like, okay, I'm not going to think about that right now. Yeah. I mean I, it wasn't like I had a barrier. Um, you, you're just so desensitized when you're over there. Like, um, I'm pretty sure the book talks about it, but we went out on patrol and then when the a and a guys or amp was wearing a bright green, you know, uh, like a construction vest and now we're all in the getting ready to load up in the trucks. And someone made the joke, I think it was me or maybe creator, but either way, we're like, well that guy's going to get shot today. Cause he stood out, ended up being the only guy that was shot that day and he ended up dying, you know, eventually from his wounds.

Speaker 4:          01:16:50       But she's like, oh well he got he. Yup, that guy died. But you're just, you don't say it like hoping to get shot, but you're just like, whoa. That's part of what happens. But, uh, she didn't like hearing my stories of the combat and things like that. So I was just like, well, I guess I won't talk about him. She's like, you just get so excited about telling those stories and you laugh about it and it's real serious. I'm like, well, I made it like, you know, well, you still snap in action. I was driving in my house with my buddy and we went past the firing range and they opened up the two forties and like I hit the brakes, contact, right contact, right. And I pull over and me and him are both reaching for our, our m four is we're supposed to be next to us.

Speaker 4:          01:17:24       We're like, oh Yo, I made a minivan. It was a Chevy impala for me. It wasn't anywhere. That's beautiful. I haven't been even, I love it. Oh, speaking of minivans, you found out you're, you're, uh, going to be a daddy at this point to when you came home from your second deployment. Oh no, that'd be awful. If I came second appointment, if I was gonna be a day, it took us a little while. Oh Wow. Four months after I got back to find out we're gonna. Yeah. Right on. Yeah. I guess confused. I wasn't home. I wasn't, I wasn't trying to imply anything. Yeah. But we, uh, yeah, so, uh, I didn't plan on it right away. Um, you know, having children, but found out we were going to have children or have a daughter and worked out great. You know, I'm very excited. Did the whole nesting thing.

Speaker 4:          01:18:08       My wife had a sweet Mazda three hatchback would love testing thing. You know, like you said the baby room up, get everything. Oh yeah. I could tell my wife because I bought her a brand new car in 2010 it was brand new off the line Mazda three hatchback. She loves it. I loved it. And I was like, that baby, she's not gonna fit in that car. And she was like, yeah, it's going to be fine. I'm like, no, it's not. Finally I got so mad one day, like after arguing with her about it, I went up there and I popped the car seat in and say, go ahead and jump into Jerry driver's seat, honey, go ahead. Jump in there and she couldn't fit in. She's like, Oh, just get rid of it. Then. She was so mad. I loved every second of, you know, cause then I won.

Speaker 4:          01:18:40       I won that game. Right. You were right. That feels good. Um, I got you off topic. Sorry. Yeah, we're going to have a kid. I'm straight on topic of way tight on topic over here. I know you're, yeah, well you're a professional. I didn't doubt that. Uh, September 27, 2011, our daughter was born. Wow. I made some weird noises in the back of my throat. There are kid was with Goo all over her and she was wrinkly and scrunched up and all I could think of that. She was the most beautiful thing in the world. It's so great to cry. The nurse said I didn't know how to cry so I just kept making weird noises in my throat is awkward. I was like, nurses like it's okay, it's okay to cry, Mr. Mills. I'm like cry. And I'm like, whew. That was weird in the side.

Speaker 4:          01:19:31       He's like, this guy's taking this kid home. I mean almost fought the pediatrician that day they were talking about Belgium beer or some damn thing and like I hear the two doctors talking and my kids in there crying and the nurse comes out say, hey, who suppose to be looking at my kid? And they're like, oh doctor this you, he has a baby in there cause I don't have one in there. And she goes, you must have a guy goes, huh? I almost forgot. Huh? And chuckles it off and then goes back talk. And I told her, I said get that kid back in that room. And I turned around and that guy, and I'm already up like you know, 1820 hours cause we went into labor and do so whatever and eyes are bloodshot and I'm just like still jack from lifting weights and I'm like, you know, you're not going to look at my kid, find a better pediatrician.

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       And the guy's like, and I had to go get calcium element in the in. She was, they were very nice when they, I don't know, I don't know why I'm towering over this guy. Like I will beat you if you touch my kid. You're not doing your job bro. Now let me put her in the car. So you'd take her home and we get home and my mother in law's with us and we're looking at in Kelsey [inaudible] she was, why she not buckled as a damn man. I thought you did. She was trapped. I thought you did it strike, you know, direct on for my kid. Good Dad award number one coming out of the gates coming out of the gates strong. I picked fail 45 minute drive, no car or no buckled. Garcia. I'm a good driver, so that's good. Luckily, uh, and meanwhile this time you're still a soldier. You go to, you go to a jump master school and you failed jump master school the first time I did any, did the sad part, it wasn't like the j Npi or you guys jump masters. Did you fail the written exam?

Speaker 4:          01:21:02       That reading is fundamental. What that academic um, part of jump master school, I've heard that's the most brutal part. It was rough. It was rough. And uh, I feel I failed that and everyone's like, oh, you must be a dumb ass. I'm like, I am. But I went back the next week, you know, the next cycle and I ended up through, you know, I thought it was cool in here. You talked about, um, you know, one kid you threw out the plane. Yeah, yeah. I get another kid. You kicked out of the plane. They were fine. Yeah. And that's the thing, they can't win. Thank you later. Cause they're just like scared. Right? I'm not sure if they made it on, I don't know really well in the whole book that you made up here. Yeah. And claimed most fabricated look. Uh No. Yeah. So I give them a brief and I they always made the youngest or the like the least senior guy give the brief.

Speaker 4:          01:21:48       And so like you tell him the brief, if you know I say green light go and you don't go give you the orchard more times. If you don't jump out we'll unhook you, attach you, give you all four. And I'll such equipment though, you know, say go to the real paratroopers or whatever. It's what I know jumper is that when it's called a name for it. Yeah. A jump refusal jump refusal. That's right. So yeah cause then that military term pro. Oh yeah. And then as I'd say my brief, your, this is all three pages you got to memorize. That stopped my brief right there and say, but I guarantee you today if you're on my door you are going. So I told the guy, you know, green light go. And like the first guy went the second I went there and guy went, fourth guy or whatever, then I'll go and then finally I get to like 13 or 14 I supposed to exit all, you know, 30 paratroopers are 32, whatever.

Speaker 4:          01:22:28       Uh, and this guy's like froze. And I'm like, I know you think you're not going to go but you better jump off this plane. And he was like, you know, and I said, I told you you were going. And then back with shirt back was pants. I just throw them out. And then the person behind was like, I'm like getting going there. And then another jump, the same thing happened. I said, I told you you were going, he's, they're frozen the door like in one foot back. And I just grab the top of, oh, sorry. I backed up, grab the top of the plane. I just kicked right in the back of his parachute out the door. He went, I was like, we'd hear those rumors, but I never saw it happen. I mean, if they don't jump, they're going to lose money and then they're going to waste a good pass and end up playing.

Speaker 4:          01:23:03       Either can go back around, make another pass and like prolong everybody's night and make it harder. Because I haven't personally gotta do paperwork on now, which I don't like to do. Or you can barely write. Yeah. What I understand. So why no right hand so please be right handed. So we expect, but that's cool. Take tape folks to me with like, um, but, but yeah, I mean I saw it was just fear got the best of them and I just was like, no, we're going today. And you're, you know, I said some other choice words in their ear, but they went. But what I liked about that from like a broader perspective than just airborne school is like so often, man, people just need to like go. Cause like you said, once you go and you get that first thing under your belt, then can they go and they jump.

Speaker 4:          01:23:41       It's no problem. You know, but so often people or did they just hesitate, they're just scared of the unknown. You know, and what you gotta do is just go, just jump. Well, my fit jumping airborne school back, I was, you know, Pv two mills, I jumped out and it was nighttime combat was so scared. I know what to do, but I was like, I'm not going to be the big sissy on this airplane, you know. So I dove out like Superman and I got my left leg caught up in the risers. I was coming down like a, like a flamingo and my shoot started collapse on me and I was shaking my, I was falling fastener, but I pull my reserve. You, you pulled your reserve and everyone cool. Yeah, no kid. They were mad about that. Oh yeah. But I was dropping fast and I guess you survived, which is a good thing.

Speaker 4:          01:24:19       Yeah. Yeah. But my leg was tangled up so bad. Send the first jump in division and I'm like, oh, I don't know if I want to do this anymore. And then the guy in front of me went and I was like, well, okay. He did it. That's, yeah, that's not good to have, uh, uh, have to pull your reserve and airborne school. Um, but I mean, it wasn't because of a malfunction. It's cause my own stupidity. I dove out like you see with me on my left leg, got caught up in there and I couldn't shake it out. And then I was hit like watching the silhouettes above me, like boilers are of males. I'm like, okay, um, you pick up, he's six, so now you're now you're staff sergeant take over a weapons squad, which is a senior spot. But I was, I went to work that day on the, I got picked, finished all ALC or whatever. Um, and which is e six course. I went to my first started, said I have offers and you know, second first brigade a five away and I'm, I'm going to take those. I don't have a squad leader spot. You know, when I get back from this four day vacation or four day break, I came back and gave me the senior spot. Here. He goes, Oh yes.

Speaker 4:          01:25:22       Uh, and Kelsey, she didn't really want you to go overseas again. Did she? I mean, yes and no. She understood it, but I mean obviously no wife wants to, their loved one to go overseas or their husbands go overseas, but we just bought a house. The baby was just born. Quite frankly, we could have used, we could use the tax free money 100% could use the money that you get from being over there and also we have the soldiers come to my house and have barbecues and she sees how they look up to me and how I'm in charge of them and it's this whole comradery and brotherhood thing. I had orders to Fort Hood. I had my sergeant major cancel them. I was like, ah, I don't know why you're kicking me out. He goes, I'm not kicking you out. I said, sergeant major, I have orders to Fort Hood and he's like, do you not want to go? I said, no, I need you to play with these guys. So he's just like, I'll take care of. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       The way you put it in the book is, the reason I went overseas was because of the soldier next to me. The guys in my squad, our job was to protect American, keep the Taliban at bay. I drained my men, I taught them all. I knew it was my job to take care of them. I couldn't imagine them deploying without me.

Speaker 5:          01:26:23       Yeah. I mean I was quite frankly upset when I got those orders. Um, but they were building a new brigade and they want to combat ncls with over two years of combat experience to go help, you know, lead these guys. And I was like a noble, I get it, but not, not for me right now.

Speaker 2:          01:26:39       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:26:40       You leaving? Um, and Josh is going away at the same time. Your brother in law, your wife's brother going away. Same time here we go back to the book. She was in tears, a beautiful mess. Josh was leaving on that same deployment too, but a day later than I was. So he came to see me off and support his sister. I hugged him and he hugged me back. Chloe was five months old and sleeping soundly in her car seat. She never woke up. When I kissed her cheek, I on strap. My daughter picked her up and cradled are tightly. One last time in my arms, she inhaled, deeply smiled and carried on sleeping. Then I waved goodbye walking away from my loved ones. I had to ask myself if this third deployment felt different from the first two I had a child to think about now a family. I knew there would be 10 stays in firefights ahead, but honestly I wasn't afraid of dying.

Speaker 2:          01:27:35       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:27:35       I wouldn't be reckless and make myself an easy target and I didn't want to die, but I knew that if I got hit, then I got hit. If it happened that it was meant to be as a soldier, it's not like I talk about my emotions every day. I don't write poetry. I don't watch romantic comedies. As a rule, I'm trained to kill people. That's what I do. You've got to be tough in the 82nd you've got to be as hard as life. You don't want to show weakness ever, particularly with any of your guys around. When you're overseas and out in the middle of nowhere and you have 12 to 20 guys with you, you can't take a seat and say you're done. As a leader, I couldn't throw my helmet down and complain that things weren't fair. You have to make the best of it. You'd have to keep going. You've got to be as tough as they come. But even so, as I walked away from my wife and child and brother-in-law, the wind struck my eye and I wiped away the wetness with the back of my sleeve.

Speaker 2:          01:28:45       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:28:46       Harder going away on this deployment?

Speaker 5:          01:28:48       No, a little bit. Yeah. It didn't feel right. Um, I actually had a conversation, my brother in law and in his garage with him and I was like, you know, Josh, it's always the guy that you don't expect to get hit and it gets hit and uh, we can start naming all the people from our deployments cause we the same brigade, always just different units has it. I just don't feel good about it, you know? I mean, not that I couldn't go where I wasn't going to go, but, but yeah, it was harder. You know, my wife and everything, I was supposed to leave the next day I went to work and they're like, hey, look, we need you to take this chocolate guys over. Um, can you leave tonight instead of tomorrow night? And I was like, well, yeah, but I got to leave work right now and I gotta go see my wife and my kid.

Speaker 5:          01:29:23       And they're like, yeah, yeah, you can go. So I went. Um, but it, it does, you know, I wouldn't say each deployments harder. Um, the second one wasn't hard for me to go. I mean, had said goodbye, but part of my job, the third one was more, man, I hope I get to come back home. But you've got to push those thoughts, you know, out of your head. You can't stop. You can't dwell on it. You can't think about it. You can't, you know, worry about what's going to happen. You got to just push through and whatever happens does happen. But you know, as long as you're not reckless and careless, you know, you, you can't affect what your outcomes are going to be anyway. So you might as well just keep pushing forward. Yeah. Do you, um, and now you end up on this deployment the fall, but a strong point that you're in so small, it doesn't even have a name, just like out in the middle of nowhere. This is drunk.

Speaker 5:          01:30:11       And you got there. And what was the, uh, what was the environment like there? I mean, the, the units that leave always give real great advice. Um, and their commander told our commander, you're not gonna really change a lot stuff here with how the rules of engagements now, um, because the rules of engagements over different presidencies are different. Leadership changed. And they said, you know, when we go out, we take shape and cream, we line where we walked, you know, we come back, that's all you're gonna do. And of course, when we get there were hard charging. We're like, we're going to go here, here, here, and here and here. And Sop is changed. The bow space, I'll changed. Uh, we lived in, um, like my first boat, I was on a big five second appointment, I was in a row of little out, a little strong points and fobs.

Speaker 5:          01:30:55       Um, and then this one we were just like, hey, here you go. We're going to helicopter you and you're dropped off. They says you ThreeSixty around is all bad. And uh, that's just how it was. So we'd go out the first day I went out and got huge firefight. Um, and that's when my guys really understood, like I wasn't a lot of schools. Like I went to college and went to jump school and went to the advanced leadership course, ALC course for aesics. So when I got back and I got to, uh, the weapons squad leader spot, some of the guys didn't know who I was from. Anybody. My first sergeant knew man, that's why I got the spot. But, um, the other guys were like, why the hell is this guy jokes around? He doesn't, he's not mean he doesn't smoke anybody. He's, he's, you know, really, I was polite I guess or whatever, you know, normal everyday guy. I didn't have this chip on my shoulder after I first firefight, like two of the guys that came from a different industry unit where like, look, I didn't get while you were in the squad leader, I didn't get how you got you six. Um, and while you were in charge, but now I do because you know when shit hits the fan and I was, I was a guy needed to be there I guess. Yeah. I mean this firefight going to go into the book here. Uh, Sergeant Butler yelled, I'm hit, I'm hit.

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       One of his team leaders, Sergeant Marty Miller ran over to him and swept his hands long Butler's body to look for blood. Miller ran back to our lieutenants are four we could, he couldn't find any. And you, you just, um, you sprinted out into this river bed during this fire fights going on and here you are. I'm still wearing my body armor, but I was essentially weapon lists. If I'd kept my rifle, it would only slowed me down. I ran over to where Sergeant Butler lay, he was probably 50 meters total away. It's my leg. He shouted. I can't put any weight on it. Shut up. I yelled, get on my back. Now let's go without waiting for him to answer. I grabbed his right hand with my left, squatted down and threw him over my shoulders and a fireman's carry. He was probably 185 pounds. I have to come up and ran back to safety. So there you go. Just uh, I understand after you perform like that to firefight your boys like, oh yeah, we get it. Well we uh, yeah, so we were

Speaker 5:          01:32:57       on one side of the Wadi, the driver bed and uh, my CEO was like, we're going to cross this river bed. And I'm like, all right. I mean that's really, really open but let's do it. So first, second and headquarters, whatever went across.

Speaker 1:          01:33:10       Right, exactly. And just, just, I always have to point this stuff out cause we have a lot of guys that are in the military that listen to this and so you're just doing a classic cover move. One element is going to stay back on the high ground or on one side of the river to cover as the other other elements pushing across.

Speaker 5:          01:33:23       Yeah. And this was our first day in country. So we're just trying to learn the battlespace. Okay. Cause we were thinking about setting up another uh, oop or strong point on the, on the Wadi, cause there's a lot of traffic and um, they start to move over over there and they'd get about 50 meters away, 75 meters, whatever. And then all hell breaks loose shots from everywhere. And third squad and four squad weapons squad was just me are over on the river, you know, riverbed and we start laying in, everybody ducks down takes cover and I'm still standing and I'm yelling at them. One of my guns shooting to the far left. Where should we shoot into the far right, use the right elements. So I walk over and I kicked the team leader, you know, actually I think it might, it's Max's head real hard.

Speaker 5:          01:34:01       And I said, I said, you fix this and fix it now. And I told him where to shoot. And went back over and a direct to some more traffic. And then some of the other two team leaders from the third squad were just firing all their rounds after we already gained the fire. Superiorities I yelled at them and said, you to know better, you've been here before, control your rounds, control your flyer and just make sure it's a pressing. And then Butler went down and were like, oh, Butler just got hit. And he ended up tearing his MCL ACL and a meniscus or whatever. I mean, this is pretty bad damage. And um, my first starts like third squad, go and get him and I, I said, no first our nor, but I got it. So I took my weapon off am I am for, you know, and I was like, here, hold this for me.

Speaker 5:          01:34:36       I tossed in my m four, because there's just, you know, it gets in the way and I ran down. Then the ane, hey, we're on the riverbank, right? Kind of right behind where they're at. I said, you guys do not shoot that, don't you? I can shoot, you know, don't you shoot me in the back? Sorry about that. I ain't gotta edit that or maybe you don't. I was like, don't you guys shoot me? I ran out and got him, took him back and I set him down. So I ran a out 50, came back and took them about about 50 to 80 behind the building, set them down and I sat down and get a drink of water at first sight. Like my first son goes to sergeant males need you back here. Oh, okay. I ran back. I was like, Oh crap. Where's my gun? And Marty had it somewhere. He's like, Oh, here you go. And I was the last one on the objective. We had to hike back two miles with Butler on a stretcher. Um, but that was the last one with the fo on the objective, uh, and smoke for the Kyle was to come over and cover our movement to them.

Speaker 5:          01:35:25       The two guys at yelled at, or the ones that told me, they found me a hell and back like, we get it now sergeant mills will find you're held back. They were just kept shooting them like, you guys are team leaders, you've been here. What are you doing?

Speaker 1:          01:35:33       Yeah, that's awesome man. Just reality check. It's, it's a, it's another example. I mean again, just you're talking about how you were in leadership position. You're just backed off a little bit. You're, you're paying attention to what's going on. Instead of you being on your gun and shooting, your backed off, you're watching. That's what you need to do in a leadership position. You got to back off a little bit. You got to observe what's happening. You got to make sense of what's happening and then you've got to make sure that people are doing the right things.

Speaker 5:          01:35:58       Yeah, I mean, you know, I, if I shot my gun, I mean that's great. I got chance changed, shoot my m four and do had to do, but if I wasn't controlling my too heavy weapons squad, you know, like I had the two forties I was king of the battlefield, if you will, and with the heaviest fire pilot, I was in charge of it. They weren't doing the job the right way. Then we were all in trouble.

Speaker 1:          01:36:16       Yeah. As I always say, God bless the machine gunners. Um, yeah. Any of that. It sounds like that deployment was, I mean the, the firefights that you talk about in here, we're a lot, you're getting a lot of firefights every other day, if not every day. And so, so this one here, you went out and did this raid, um, and then you get word after you do this raid that there's no aircraft to come and pick you up from the raid and go ahead and walk back.

Speaker 5:          01:36:52       Yeah, that's good times. Yeah. We, uh, we went out, we, um, I told my guys like, look, it's going to be hellacious. Bring extra. We had each of us 2000 rounds of seven, six to gain. And then we also had, um, I always carried 2000 rounds of seven, six, two or I guess depending on the mission, it would change me a thousand to 2000. And then I carry 20 grenades, 10 on my, on my, uh, armor and 10 in my bag. And then another 20, 40 Mike, Mike and I have two or three. Jesus. And then 420, um, five, five, six rounds, like not in my magazines. And I always had programs like freaking 200 pounds. Yeah. What? Yeah, but without, without ammunition you're kind of screwed. That's true. Good point. So I was at 12 magazines on my person and then I'd have, you know, 13th 1:00 AM I in the chamber.

Speaker 5:          01:37:39       So I had 13 full magazines on me, not because 13 is like some special number, just cause like my mag pouches where yeah, my mag pouch was, you know, too deep. So I could have six, three on each side. Um, yeah. And we went out there and we ended up getting like seven different firefights in my back home we had for, and uh, I got, I got, um, I got put next to the gun the one time and you know how it's called pig town rat. Tell the cop when you put your seven, six, two Lincoln, you have one side come out and then you switched back it in and then they'll try to come out. So when you hooked to a gun, it pulls out your bag. And then if you have another bag next to you, clip it together. Oh, we shot through all my rounds.

Speaker 5:          01:38:15       One the, one of the things which I do all the seven, six, two rounds. I was like, oh, this is so much on like lighter. And I got to another spot in one of my guys, Brandon, um, fast that he was one of the guys got hurt with me later on, but he was almost knocked at like past now. So have you. I said, I'm going to take my bag. He goes, no, I go, sorry. I said, gimme your bag. Don't argue with me. And I was like, you need to make it back to the fob. And then our, uh, our pa the, that came out with this awesome guy, ranger regiment guy and it turned into be a doctor. He was dehydrating really bad on the lock back going hallucinations and stuff. So, um, w we decided, me and two other guys, three other guys, go ahead and just like try to head and walk faster than everybody else.

Speaker 5:          01:38:56       I'm like made it back to the fob first to get a get a m m wrap to come get them. But yeah, and we actually, one of the guys who were detained, we, we, we detained all these guys that had 600 pounds, homemade explosives, batteries, RPGs. And the thing was a drone filed their RPG team back on a motorcycle to this compound, AK 47. But we didn't get pictures with all their stuff. So we turned them over to the local national government and they said, well you didn't get pictures of these guys or these guys are free. So they let them go. Turns out the guy that uh, um, we had detained one of them cause we hide them. Fingerprints were all over my bomb and the, there's 13 bombs in a row and they're all over the bombs at the one that I hit. So the guy that we captured as the one that put the bomb in Alpha troop caught him and he took care of them. So,

Speaker 3:          01:39:48       all right, sorry to bring it down to tone. My Bet. Going to April 10th, 2012 you get some Intel on the afternoon that there's a IED out in the village and you guys are going to go check it out and here we go into the book. We hiked only about 400 yards to the village in addition to my weapons team. There were other squads along on patrol, a total of 28 soldiers. My Lieutenant Zachary Louis went to the left with the first and second squads heading to meet with the village elders while the rest of our men went with me around the village to the outside to offer support in case of an attack along with my gun team I had in my platoon sergeant and a medic Sergeant Daniel Bateson with my group all looks calm. It was just another day in Afghanistan, another normal patrol. We approached and abandoned ANA security posts to portable buildings and stop near the buildings to establish a security perimeter.

Speaker 3:          01:40:49       I called for fessy to bring the sweeper check. This area was the only order I gave fast. He walked up a path used by villagers and scanned all the area around. He went up and back and all was clear, no beeps. There was no reason to question anything fast. He finished his mind sweeping duties and went up and went to set up on the far flag. I called riot up to to me and asked him where he thought we should put the gun. I knew where it should go, but I wanted to let him decide, making sure he knew his stuff. He motioned to exactly where I thought we should put it, a good spot, and I said, all right, go get NAF and bring them up here. That was it. Riot let left to go get Nafta and as he did, I set my backpack down. The backpack, touching the dirt was all. It took such a simple act of war. My world erupted. I saw a flash of flame and hurt, hurt a huge Kaboom, hot, jagged piece, pieces of explosives. Rip through me. I cartwheeled backward end over end, hit the ground and slammed my face hard against the compacted earth. Instantly I felt my left eye starting to swell shut. I smelled burning flesh my own. I tasted dirt and I was wet with sweat and moisture, just like I'd walked out of a hot shower.

Speaker 2:          01:42:19       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:42:20       dirt fell everywhere through the air. It rained down and clung to my eyes, nose and mouth. I don't remember rolling over, but I must have because I glanced to the side and saw that my right arm was completely gone. I caught a glimpse of my left arm covered in blood and tattered by arm. Tremble does, if it had a will of its own. I looked down and saw my right leg was also gone. The stump looked like a piece of raw meat. The bottom of my left leg was still attached, but held on only by a few strands of skin. I saw all this in a flash. In an instant.

Speaker 2:          01:42:57       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:42:58       I felt confusion, but no panic. My first thought of what was of my guys, I flopped my remaining arm toward the microphone, clipped to my carrier plate and somehow managed to push the button. I hit a bomb. I said, I need help. Bateson. My medic rushed up to me along with staff sergeant Keith Handbright, our platoon sergeant, only about 30 seconds had passed since the blast. Immediately they applied tourniquets to hold whatever blood was still inside me. I'm not gonna make it. I said, leave me and go to save my guys. Shut up. Sergeant Mills said, Bateson let me do my job. I ignored Bateson and yelled my man's name like roll call fasc riot nef to see if they were okay to were hit fastly and riot and other medics were already caring for them. They were bleeding, but nothing was missing. They yelled back that they were going to be okay.

Speaker 3:          01:43:54       I calmed down. More soldiers ran toward me. Sergeant Alex Voice and other medic wondered aloud where to best get ivy access. There are no pulses to check except for my carotid order artery. He quickly ripped open my vest, shaved a spot on my chest and put an IV straight into my sternum. It hurts going in and I must've howled because he yelled at me that I was going to be fine. I yelled back, doc, shut up. I know he and I both calmed down. Someone's stuck offense in all pop in my mouth. It's a potent pain killer that releases as the pop dissolves I down the first one, spit out the stick and asked for another. You won't need it. Someone said, I was still thinking that I was going to die. I didn't want to show fear. I didn't want to freak out. You never want to show for your around your men. Let me let my family know I dealt with it without crying. I said, tell him yourself someone grunted he was being encouraging, letting me know I wasn't dead yet. I tried to see around me. I raised my head wanting to get a visual of FASC in riot. Someone's shoved my head back down by still commanded a voice.

Speaker 3:          01:45:18       My one eye was swollen, completely shut. The other eye was blurry from dirt. I tried to raise my head again. Again, I was pushed flat. My eyes were watering. Now the dirt turning to mud time passed and I didn't know what was happening. I mumbled something, but there was no reply. Only this steady wa or warp of a Black Hawk helicopter touching down nearby. Six men surrounded me, have teed me up and carried me over. All told, it might've been 10 minutes since the blast until the helicopter arrived. Fessy in riot were first inside the helicopter. Everything was foggy and noisy and I couldn't make out my surroundings clearly. My two guys were on seats and I saw blood and bandages jumbled in their direction. FASC had shrapnel in his face ride, had shrapnel, his face, legs and hands. Their images faded away.

Speaker 2:          01:46:13       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:46:13       I focused on the noise of the rotors. We were in the air and the flight medic. We're taking care of me right at yelled in pain. I tried to look around. Someone needed to attend to riot. Where are the medics? One of the medics were talking to the pilots upfront. Riot was yelling again. I looked in fessy direction and told them to calm down. Fessy nodded. Riot stopped yelling and I winked at him to let him know he was going to be okay.

Speaker 2:          01:46:42       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:46:42       it was all I could think to do. The flight medic. Was it back in view? I could barely see him. The goop in my eyes. You are a green flight suit and had a big Darth Vader helmet. I tried to speak. He gave me a quizzical look. I yelled as loud as I could. Take your helmet off. He took his helmet off. Get my guys water and tell them they're going to be okay. I barked, don't worry. I'll take care of them for you. He said he was busy with some task on me that I couldn't see. A moment went by and I added, I'm sorry for what the medic asked for, making you take your helmet off. He gave me a ride grin. I realized he'd been doing his job all, all along doing it. Well, both the medics had. I just couldn't see all that was happening around me. My mind went in and out. I was coherent but fuzzy and spots. In 15 minutes, the helicopter landed in Kandahar hospital staffed, rushed me straight to the operating table. We're going to put you under. Now came a voice from above me. I'm fine. I said, leave me alone. The mass came over my face and I tried to push it away. I remember asking one question, am I ever going to see my baby girl again?

Speaker 2:          01:48:17       Cool.

Speaker 5:          01:48:21       Little intense. Yeah. Yeah. I, uh, my is more choice words. I didn't put in the book, I said to the flight medic, I had yelled three times and then last time through the f word in there, take your effing helmet off. And he did, uh, in my head I was just thinking saving private Ryan, don't go out like for your mom, like the medic when he got shot in the movie. And uh, I just, you know, I was the guy that I had a sniper round crack next to my head and I rolled in and I was so embarrassed to have rolled away from it. Um, then I stood on top of the mountain in Shawn off a magazine and a half before I got back down. And, uh, so just the whole don't show fear. I figured I can't change what happened right now. If I raise my policy, I'm going to bleed faster. And, um, you know, thanks to my platoon, sergeant, uh, Sergeant Hambright and Doc Bates and then doc voice, uh, I was able to maintain most of my blood.

Speaker 3:          01:49:12       They must've slapped those things on you. Quick tourniquets. Oh, within 20 seconds or 30 seconds I think. And how did was that, was the aircraft airborne somewhere and got redirected to you? How'd you guys get a helicopter there so fast?

Speaker 5:          01:49:25       I don't know. We usually only went out when it was when there was helicopters on station, um, because the threat was so, so real. Um, not that we need to talk about this and you guys edit it out. But, um, at nighttime the Taliban had free reign to do what they wanted. We were told because of politics or whatever, somebody said, we can go at nighttime. So we had the best nighttime capabilities, but we couldn't go out. So on the red camera, 30 feet in the air, we would watch them on the screen and watch them put bombs in at nighttime and we couldn't shoot him, couldn't shoot mortars at them and couldn't get him. So, uh, it kind of sucked because you'd watch them put the bombs and then the next day you're supposed to go out and try to find him. And that's why in 2012 they wouldn't let you shoot them a, they won't let us go out and get them.

Speaker 5:          01:50:09       They're like, no, I can't go at nighttime. And we're like, but we can see them. I mean, I don't want, if you guys talk about it, you know, it doesn't bother me. I just reality, you know, I don't like, I want you don't get political so you don't have to on this with me. But just watching him put bombs and knowing I had to go and try to find them. And then the guy that I found, uh, or we walk back through, you know, seven different firefights and 10 clicks, uh, when they went out to do the surveillance on the site, that got blown up at, uh, I blown up. There was 13 in a row right there. And if some reason the, my super Brandon went up and down, not once, but twice and nothing alarmed him. So there was six daisy chain together, call it squad killer.

Speaker 5:          01:50:44       So you had to be the front guy to hit the first one and then everybody behind them would get just taken out. So in a way it was as probably better that I got hit that day. Then have somebody walk past and hit it and then everyone behind him you're taken out too. Um, yeah. So just, just the politics of war I guess kind of sucked because I would watch him put bombs in, couldn't shoot him. The Chi was to come on station and the guy shooting Nsa Han yards away with dropped their weapons and walk away and all of a sudden they were no longer combatant until the Chi was, we're out of fuel and we weren't going to run, you know, a thousand meters this way because if we did, then the guys just take either a case and take off. So, you know, the red tape.

Speaker 5:          01:51:20       But when I got blown up, I did rate on my lt until, yeah, I got hit. Uh, I don't know how bad it is. And I told my ma get away from me and he kept fighting me off and tell me to somebody my job. Then the doctors worked on me for 14 hours. I was told nine, uh, nine doctors and seven nurses and two nurses for nine hours, pump air into my lungs, keep me alive, like took turns pumping air. Um, I was so low on blood, they did over 30 transfusions and they didn't have enough in stock. They were like on the big speaker in Kandahar saying a positive blood and universal, we need it now. And they were right from, I had a lot of tests I had to do for like, you know, possible HIV or things like that because it was just like, just take it and put it right in. Yep. Cool. All right, thanks for your blood and we're gonna put it right in them. Um, they knocked me out medically, you know, maybe unconscious. Um, and they kept me like that for four days. So

Speaker 4:          01:52:09       I just realized, you know, I always said God bless them machine gunners, but how about a little God bless the doctors and nurses for sure. Oh absolutely. And the medics and the medics. I would sound like

Speaker 5:          01:52:18       I go when I speak, I, uh, my one side's about perspective and I tell him, you know, about the guys that have not made it back home and I'm thankful to still be around and living and I'm going to keep living, you know, for them so that, you know, their sacrifice wasn't in vain because what happened to me is nowhere near what happened. My Buddy Francis Gene Phillips, a fourth there, Frankie great friend of mine, he died, you know, let behind a wife and a four year old at the time. So I'm thankful for the medical advancements in Vietnam. A lot of guys didn't come back like me. And I get sometimes people are like, well, we just didn't see people like you who during the Vietnam War. It's just, it's so sad this happened. And I say, well, that's the guys, they didn't come back. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:52:53       You know, so, so yeah. I mean the doctors know how to tie things in and my calf muscles around the end of my left leg now I guess for padding or something, I'm just nuts, you know. But um, that was on the 10th and then I still had my left hand when they, they got done working on me. My wrist is blown up pretty bad by my finger, my index, my middle of my thumb. And then two days later in bog them, they cut it off. My brother in law flew in from his outpost to Kandahar with me and escorted me because did you guys have to feel blue books out moving before deployed? We call it the blue book. It's like, if I die, bury me with this. It's not a blue book, but we do. We do do that. Yeah. Well I don't know.

Speaker 5:          01:53:31       It was, yeah, like a little blue pants. They'd call it the Blue Book and the army. But it's like, if I die, you know, I want my wedding ring, I want picture of my wife and I, my kid, or you know, I want this music to play. Right. Basically. Plan your funeral is kind of morbid, but I guess it's all right. Um, but he was a guy who was supposed to escort my body back home. So he came to where I was at and then they shipped me to bother them on April 12th and I was 12. They took a look at my hand, like, it's not gonna make it, it's just necrotizing and you know, limb length is a huge thing, so they cut it off. Um, and then, so they didn't tell him they're doing it. So I worked, rolled into surgery and I came back into my hand was gone.

Speaker 5:          01:54:06       Um, but I didn't know, cause I still, you know, medic or sedated. And then two days later they went for the very first time on April 14th and I woke up in the room, my brother in law, he was wanting to tell me, but what I, I don't know if I'd put it in the book. I don't think I did April 14th, actually my birthday. So my 25th birthday I found out as was a quadruple amputee. And it's funny because on my first deployment when I didn't know about amputations and things and Josh was just a friend of mine, not my brother in law, I was like, look, I'm very athletic. I play a lot of sports. If I, if I lose a leg or something, just let me bleed out. Like, I mean I was that naive at 19 years old. Like if I lose a hand, just I don't, I don't need to live, you know, cause I didn't know any different. We're now I have, I wake up, no arms and legs and I'm like, oh, okay. Well at least I made it, I guess.

Speaker 3:          01:54:50       Um, meanwhile, back on the home front, going into the book, Kelsey received a call at 11:53 AM her time while standing in her parents' kitchen in Dallas, Texas. She was making a tuna fish sandwich and, and then it's the commander on the phone and she describes, you know, he, he tells her straight forward, you know, the severe injury. And this is what she wrote in her journal. I could not wrap my head around the pain my husband must be feeling. I was all alone in the house and my action subset, my daughter to the point where she was screaming, I could do nothing to sooth her. I couldn't pick her up. I couldn't look at her. My body felt like he was being torn into. I wanted so badly to be able to talk to Travis and let them know I love him and that I think God, that he was still alive. Did it continues on. Kelsey called my dad in Michigan, but when she tried to tell him what happened, little would come out. My Dad knew something was wrong and kept repeating. Is he alive? Is he alive? Is he alive?

Speaker 3:          01:56:00       And then your dad said this until you go through something like that yourself, it's hard to describe the feeling. There is no eating anymore. You don't leave the house. There's a lot of pacing around. You just wait. Whenever the phone rang, we jumped. You look at the phone and you don't know if you want to answer it or not. So it wasn't, obviously, it wasn't just you that got hit, um, to, you know, your, your family back home gets hit with the shock of all this and all also in your squad. [inaudible] yeah, there. Yeah. Which is the coolest name ever, right. Cause it's spells the riot. I've mentioned him earlier. Um, but yeah, he got wounded.

Speaker 5:          01:56:50       He was pretty bad. I mean he was able to get up and walk a couple days after he was, it was, he was sore for quite a bit

Speaker 3:          01:56:56       and then, and then fast he got hit as well.

Speaker 5:          01:56:58       He did. And luckily he had his sunglasses on, um, because he, his face was just blasted, but he still has, his vision is doing great. Uh, just got engaged. So, um, I mean like, yeah, it's just a bad day. You know, my dad, when he says you don't eat and do that stuff, he actually was in the hospital with me and got diverticulitis real bad and he almost died. He was so dehydrated and had to go in and like give him surgery and like get handout for six months. You probably would be mad if I told her about it. But he had a class me back cause you got so dehydrated, um, cause you cared. You know, it was just so, so worrisome for him, you know? And then when I woke up, I was kind of a Dick. I didn't want to like my brother and I was like, you got to call, you know Kelsey and you got to call your mom and dad.

Speaker 5:          01:57:36       And I'm like, I'm not talking to anybody. Can as you know, you're angry or sad. You're questioning does God hate me and my bad person? What did I do wrong in life to get this? I mean I pay my taxes, you know, I have a family, why would this happen to me? And then a little bit goes like Forrest Gump where it's like lieutenant Dan like, no, what, what, what the hell, you know, why did I live through this? Um, is this some kind of sick punishment that for something I did wrong? And, um, I mean you, you come to a realization like, hey, you know what, sometimes bad things happen to good people. It is what it is. You can't change it. You might as well keep pushing forward and it's nothing I did wrong in life. It's just what was slated. So,

Speaker 3:          01:58:09       you know, that's what happened. Yeah. I thought it was interesting. Um, uh, that one of the guys on the Medevac Bird Lik Rhoda Rhoda, a Facebook to Kelsey and was explaining, you know, what it was like and, and uh, yeah, I mean here, here's what he wrote. My name is first sergeant weight, the other medic, the other flight medic was staff sergeant hockersmith. You belong to a family of warriors. Other wounded soldiers in

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       the aircraft were injured and screaming, but your husband is warm, worried about, more worried about then than himself.

Speaker 1:          01:58:51       He described it. Then he describes how you were doing the thing and tell him to take his helmet off and, and uh, you know, here coming back to the book, his face was dirty and there was Dustin, his eyes, but he never shed a tear. I replay in my mind a moment when he looked at other wounded soldier at another wounded soldier and wink to reinsure them that it would be okay. My crew is still on duty and his unit's area. Now we go back to Kandahar on Monday, but we won't go back the same way. I'm an e eight, but this aesics is the example for myself and others to emulate.

Speaker 2:          01:59:26       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:59:28       I actually, yeah, I've had to get my, I was strapped down so I had to get my arm out because when I was yelling at him I was like, Hey, take your hand off. I said, take your helmet off. And that finally I got my arm off straight. How were you conscious man, that's freaking crazy. Good genes I guess. Uh, you know, but I put my arm out and I, I said, take your, you know, helmet f word helmet off. And I put my hand over my head, the emotion, like, you know, as my arms drooping down or whatever, but I just don't take your helmet off. And then he did and I was like, get my guys walked around me fine. And then later I did apologize for yelling at him. I was like, Hey, sorry I yelled in this war. I, yeah. You know, but you know, at that time, I guess maybe it was easier for me to like think about everything else going on except for myself, you know? And I just, I just figured it is what it is. Whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen and it doesn't do me any justice to scream out or yell or, or be afraid. I mean, Hey, I can't change what's going on right now. So just do the best I can to, you know, help situation.

Speaker 1:          02:00:21       Yeah, man. And, and Josh shows up like you, you know, you just talked about this and Josh just say, Hey, I'm going to tell it to you straight. [inaudible] cause you asked, you said to Josh, Hey, am I paralyzed and I'm going to the book here. No Man, Josh said you're not paralyzed. You don't need to lie to me. I whispered. I can take it. I'm going to tell you straight. Josh knew. I'd want to know the truth. You're not paralyzed, but both your arms and legs are gone. The date was April 14th, 2012 still the same day as when I'd heard the news. I was a quadruple amputee. It was my 25th birthday.

Speaker 2:          02:01:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:01:06       Damn. You talk about the pain and I think this is something that people don't get myself included. Um, uh, the pain was so bad. Part of the pain was the thought of what I'd become. I could hardly picture the new me yet. The pain was more than emotional. It was a physical pain. It coursed through my body. I felt like I was on fire. I tried to focus on my breathing and take stock of why my pain was so bad. Even with all the medications flowing through me, it still felt like I was in a red hot vice. I could hardly it. I knew Josh would never lie to me, but my arms and legs still felt like they were attached. My hands felt like they were burning like someone who was clamping them inside of an industrial furnace. But my hands weren't there. The flames were eating away. My ligaments, my nerves, my skin, my legs, my phantom legs were clamped in that same fire bolt's of agony, surge from limbs that weren't the register, that weren't there and registered to a brain that's still was. The pain came and went, came and went, came and went.

Speaker 1:          02:02:12       Josh started in his seat and leaned or starting to seat and lean closer. Travis, you need me to get the nurse, nurse. I didn't say anything. I was itchy and sweating bad. He pressed a buzzer than then. Went out and got a cool cloth and laid it on my forehead. The nurse came in and upped my morphine just before I went under again. Everything that I'd always drilled into myself, rushed through my mind. Never show fear. Never let your guys see you in pain. Don't cry out. Even when I'd been lying on the ground right after the blast, I'd felt pain then, but I hadn't showed it when that I was shoved through my chaff that was chest. I was painful, but I wasn't going to complain. Then you don't let people down. You just don't, but this time the pain was so bad. It was still so bad, even with more pain killers in me now. So bad. So bad, so bad. This time I want to do the unthinkable. Two words. Rose then began to vocalize within my throat, Josh. I said, yeah, what do you need buddy? I swallowed and whispered to words.

Speaker 2:          02:03:25       I quit.

Speaker 5:          02:03:34       Yeah, not good. I uh, I don't know what I mean. Is this a lot of pain? I guess. I don't know why.

Speaker 2:          02:03:41       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:03:42       You know, you sit there any question like, am I going to be a burden on my family? Right. Why? How, you know, my wife, should she stay with me? I mean, what do I have left to offer? Um, my dollar. Am I going to be a monster when I get to see her finally and then it's like, why did I live through this? Why did you know, why not make it, not that I'm, I guess angry. I lived or at the time, oh, you know, when that was happening, I wasn't so much angry. He's just more of a question. Like, why, what, what's, what's the purpose? Why not just let me go out. My life gets, you know, 400,000 from the government and, and then she can go remarry and have somebody that's able bodied and, and live a happy life. But, uh, you know, a lot of questions or you know, when you're sitting in the hotel room or I'm in a hospital bed, you know, in a hospital room and you just got stare at the ceiling the whole time. You just never know what would think in the military. It's easy. Everything laid out for you. This is our mission. This is our plan is what we're going to do is how we're going to get it done there. It's just all unknown.

Speaker 1:          02:04:32       And that pain, like from missing limbs, it sounds freaking, oh yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       I mean it was, I guess spike getting drove through my heel, uh, fingernails getting just ripped off and then see it and it was just, it was bad. What causes that? Uh, well, I mean a lot of it is phantom limb pain. So your nerves try to find where your hands and your feet are. And if they can't find it, they try to redirect and keep trying to find it. So it's just one excruciating, you know, zap to another and then they, uh, in, you're probably gonna talk, they had like experimental, um, things, they try it on me cause it was so bad. And after the second one, they tried, um, I was like, oh, I feel a little better. And then the doctor like was all excited. Then I was like, oh no, the pain's back. And I went, you know, got all yelling out in pain and stuff.

Speaker 4:          02:05:20       And he just, he actually cried. He felt so bad because it was to the point where they've got to find some cure or I'm going to be so, um, um, just in the agony. Yeah. Agony. Or I'll be so used to the medication, um, that the doses are going to get to the point where I'm just gonna Odi on him, you know, because I'm going to be so, so, uh, a customer, I can't think of the word right now. It's killing me. Uh, like you're talking to me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. My tolerance would be so high that I'm just going to end up Odeon. Damn.

Speaker 1:          02:05:55       Of course. I was kind of like, you know, you're wondering where you get your sense of humor. You're telling your dad what happened and you're like, I stepped on a mine, went flying through the air. I did a one 80. It was crazy. Well, Travis, my dad said, the important question is, did you look good doing it?

Speaker 4:          02:06:11       Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think I did.

Speaker 1:          02:06:15       Yeah. Um, and meanwhile, Kelsey, she, she, you know, you've been voice in some of these concerns like about, hey, can I even be a good dad now can, I'm not going to be a burden. You're kind of telling Josh some of those things and she told or he told Kelsey and here we go back to the book. My brother told me that Travis has nervous to see me because he doesn't know how I will react or if I will continue to love him as my husband. These worries seem so trivial to me because I will love him through sickness and health until death do us part. I did not use those words lightly when we got married. I will be biased side everyday for the rest of our lives, whether he likes it or not.

Speaker 2:          02:06:55       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:06:56       I know his natural reaction will be to push me away because of embarrassment or feelings of letting me down. But I just wish I could constantly reassure him that my love for him is unwavering.

Speaker 4:          02:07:10       Yeah. Well I mean when I saw her, I told her she should go. I said, you know, hey, you should take what we have. The house is yours, the cars are your cell mine, you know, whatever and do what you need to do. And I'll financially fund whenever I can, you know? And she was like, that's not how this works. I want the handicap parking. You know what she said? So I was like, man, you are, there's like a level of luck

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       involved when you get married. I don't care who you are. Um, oh. You know, like do, you could easily marry like Satan, you know, and I know, I know you, I know plenty of guys that have made some really bad came and call bad decisions because it's just like, oh, okay, I understand if you have this great coding thing and all that and your whatever that you can make a good decision, then that's great. But like a lot of guys in the military, you're young and you're like, you know what, we're getting married and there's just like a flip of the coin and you, you got a saint. I mean, I literally did, I'm like 17 days in person, you know what would be great. We just went to Mexico and that was how we were gonna get married and then we just got married. Yeah, let's do that. That'd be a great story for everybody. Whether it works or not. Then you scored for sure. Uh, she got lucky to have me too. Well, I didn't really pick that up, but um, okay. We'll go with it. Yeah. Moving on. Hey, I wasn't when you've saw Chloe for the first time, so you need didn't get back to Walter Reed?

Speaker 5:          02:08:31       I did, yeah. April 17th. I got back and um, the first time I got to see Kelsey wasn't that hallmark moment, you know, it's like, oh my gosh, I love you so much. It was actually, I was getting rushed in my really one of my right leg ripped open and they're like, Mrs. Mills, you're in charge of his medical history now you have to sign this piece of paper. Um, he has to get two inches of conference, right leg. We need your consent consent. And she's like, what? And she almost passes out in, they're like, Mrs. Mills. I'm like, Kelsey just signed the paper and I'm yelling, just sign the paper. It's okay. And she signs and that's the first time I got to see her. Just real quick. Yup. Go ahead and hack them up. And they went and took my leg two inches off on the right and reseal that next day is when I tell her like, you know, this isn't probably anything that you signed up for you. You can go and, you know, you're not, it's no big deal. I'm not worried about it. And she's like, nope, not how this works. We'll get through this together. And then they, you know, they induced me into this coma later on because the pain was so bad and I was getting my tolerance level built up for the pain meds. And, uh, she sat with my bed like 20 hours a day and not knowing I wasn't gonna wake up for five days, we're gonna put them out for five days.

Speaker 1:          02:09:30       So yeah. So this was crazy. Uh, reading about in the book, you, you're in such horrible, horrible pain, like undescribable pain. Is this basically an experimental thing procedure that they did on you? Yeah, I'm the second in the nation. Never have the ketamine coma in 30th in the world. And Sonic case studies on me. The ketamine coma is 600 mellow milligrams of ketamine per hour. Yeah. So it goes around the clock as well. It is based on that

Speaker 5:          02:09:59       wait and things. So I'm sure like different measurements. But, uh, they, when they did it, you go in and then it just circulates through. It's supposed to reset your brain to think where your nerves is and where they end and you know, you come out and it's just loose knit like crazy. And getting on TV is what was real life to me.

Speaker 1:          02:10:17       Yeah, no the, I'll, I'll hit some highlights from your hallucinate. Cause when you get, when you get done out of the coma, you're in a coma for five days, which is just black. Nothing, right? There's no nothing, nothing there. Then you go into hallucinations. You got um, chasing kids that stole things from, you got gangas con that you're out with Gangas con you're a swat team is coming to get you. You got you and your cousins are riding skateboards in a TV reality show. You've got yourself playing hockey in the NHL. Um, I was particularly concerned about a 50 year old go go dancer that crawled on a leash down the hallway of Walter Reed. That one made me a little bit nervous. Uh, the service dog, apparently Kramer from Seinfeld stops by. So, so you go through these massive hallucinations that that's freaking weird.

Speaker 5:          02:11:04       Yeah, I mean it got to the point where I'm getting on my tangents and they said for the first like seven days, you know it's going to be bad. Then after that it'll start to fade out. In that 10 days you should be able to tell when you're having one or not. But I remember my final, I'll come in one morning and the caps game was on the night before and I was watching it. I was like, I scored nine goals with Ovechkin vegetarian. I had a triple hat trick. He's like, oh that's, that's great. And then I thought the way I got blown up when I woke up the very first day, I thought that this guy from my hometown made a derogatory comment towards my mom, my wife, my daughter, and my buddy's not jumped in the car and chased him and went off the road and I smacked a tree and I killed my two best friends.

Speaker 5:          02:11:38       And like I made my mom and my wife like full on. Oh leaved those 100%. I told my brother and all of the story just in intently or intense as I told my wife, and he listens like, oh yeah. And everybody just going with it. And so I try to like argue with me and they're like, we're just gonna go with this. And I called them my buddy's a message and I'm like, I am so I, I hope you're not dead. And then I finally came out of his nation and I realized what happened to my brother. And I walked back in. I was like, Hey man, thanks you dick is, well, I didn't want to tell you any different when I was like, yeah, no, I understand.

Speaker 1:          02:12:06       You know, that's like, don't text when you're drunk or whatever. Yeah. Don't call people leave messages and when you're on seven day hallucinate.

Speaker 5:          02:12:13       Yeah. Trips. And I only left two messages, but they're two of my best friends. So it was cool. And both them was, I'm sorry I killed Judah, the hey man over on you. I think I killed you. And, uh, and then I got to a point where I get to tell what was going on. So like I started having another one, um, and I was like, oh, that's hallucination. And then finally I get to a point I was playing with people, like Josh was in my room and I was like, Josh, he goes, what? He goes, I see dead people. I said, what? You're serious? I'm like, no, I'm just kidding. I was like, okay. And that's our looking at the ceiling. I was like, oh, they're all around me. He's like, w w where, where? I'm like, oh my gosh, Josh Turner Ward. And I like jabbed him.

Speaker 5:          02:12:47       So I started messing people once I got the hang of it. Oh, that's awesome. Uh, and that kind of like did it though, right? Yeah. Yeah. So I did about five more months of pain pills. Um, and then finally, like in October, I was home for Thanksgiving in North Carolina at my house at Fort Bragg. And I was just like, you know what, Kelsey came, I was, I don't want him anymore. I'm done. Just like, you can't just quit these. And I said, no, I really, I'm done. So I was like five days of pain and then now, no medication, nothing. I'm good to go. So the ketamine coma and my documentary, you know, it says I wouldn't do it again, but that was five months after the fact. I was still like doing pain pills and stuff or four months after the fact I guess, cause they're in September. Um, but looking back like that was the best, the best thing for me to get me past the, you know, the pain part and then onto my recovery was a second person that ever

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       had that done, I guess in the nation. That's crazy. Yeah. Um, either there's a great talking about your kind of transition mentally going back to the book back in normal days. I love the challenge. The quest to succeed in the army has always been a challenge for me. My situation now as a quadruple amputee held out the same sort of dare to succeed. Sure. If I could have changed things, I wouldn't have been in this situation, but I couldn't change things. Being a quadruple amputee was my new reality. I could quit for good. I could shut myself off from the world. I could will myself to die, or I could fight forward and keep on living legit. Well, I mean, it came down to a choice at the end of the day. Um, I was still here and my wife's gonna say by my side, my daughter, who I think's gonna think I'm a monster, still laughs.

Speaker 4:          02:14:19       The snuggles up with me and you know, I mean, when she first saw me, I thought, she's gonna be really afraid. But then short arms, short legs, fuzzy chest, I looked like a teddy bear. He's like, oh no, we're totally, you know, but this one can talk. Yeah, cool. In their active, I've never been stern with my mom. I did write my mom's nose one time, the whole different story. Karate. I know my dad and me were slap boxing in the kitchen, which meant I was 17 my dad was trying to mess with me, but if I slapped back, you'd be like, Dude, you can take me. And I'm like, no, brother. We were just playing. But he slapped me. My Mom's behind me. And I caught the back of my head and the scariest day of my life, um, you don't make her mad and, but anyway, so I was only started one time, my mom, I woke up, you know, and I suppose to get all the rest I could and I said, where's Chloe at?

Speaker 4:          02:14:59       She was like, oh, they already came to visit, but you were sleeping. I was like, don't ever let me sleep through that again. That's the whole reason that I'm able to still keep functioning. It's because of my daughter and you know, uh, being there and my wife. But you know, the mental part was the worst at four o'clock to eight o'clock at night, I can have the lights on in my, in my apartment, something to do with, I thought it was like the operating table. I start sweating real bad. I just, I mean now I'm fine, but it was the first, I don't know, probably five to six months. I was just like, no lights at this time. It's quiet out work and things like that. And Man, I started watching like I watched a video of you as you are training, as you are now relearning everything.

Speaker 4:          02:15:33       I never really understood when people say, Oh, you got to read, you got to relearn to walk and you've got to realize, and I didn't really make sense of it, but it's really clear to see when you watch your progression, what that looked like. Like how you are clearly relearning how to walk. Like I never understood that. But when you watch the videos and the progression that you made, you can see that that's what it looks like when you first stood up. I'm like, Oh yeah, it looks like he's learning how to Walker. And sure enough you got better and better and it's pretty amazing. And, and uh, two things you're going to find out. When I was going through my, uh, recovery, the first thing I learned how to walk with my daughter. We're just kind of cool. They got me little short legs and I was stumbling around and she was stumbling around and we're holding hands. And the next thing you found out, my love for Philly cheese steaks because I do less workouts and stuff like that. The Gym, you know, as you go. But I went from two 50 to one 40 and I was real skinny and then all of a sudden I started getting fatter and fatter and fatter because the Lyrica and the medication and I was just like, oh, I love Philly cheese steaks. So I'm trying to work on that

Speaker 5:          02:16:30       now. But my progression as I got better, I got fat or too embarrassing. And you got a visit from a guy named Todd nicely [inaudible] and that must have helped out a lot. Uh, my competitive edge did. He walked in and on his fake legs and to fake arms and he first thing out of his mouth was, hey man, welcome to the club. I was like, I don't be in your club. Is it kind of late now, don't you think? And I looked at myself and I said, right, you got me there? And uh, as you walked over and said, you want a ginger ale and you heard me wrong. And he went over to the counter or the sink in our neath. The sink was, was a 12 pack of Ginger Ale. I got hooked on it, like crack at the hospital. I got off it now, but either way, he bends down on one knee, bends down on his other knee, reaches out with his fake hand, gets it out, pops the top, his other arm and walks over and hands and he goes, here you go.

Speaker 5:          02:17:15       I'm like, oh no. I was asking if you wanted one, but before I had the full sentence out, I said, how'd you do that? He's like, Hey man, I'm Todd and I'm the second ever welcomed the club. You're the fourth, a quadruple amputee to make it back home. You're going to be fine. I live in Missouri with my wife. I drive, I have a boat, I do whatever I want. I walk. It just takes time. And uh, he's like, I'll even work out with you tomorrow. You know, this is like, I'm still thinking I'm an hallucination mode. This is like maybe eight, nine days after my elders, my, uh, ketamine coma, and he's like, I'll work out with you tomorrow. So the doctors come in and I'm like, Hey, I got to work out today. And they're like, you can't work out. Yeah. And I was like, no, no, seriously, I've been in, I'm going to work out with Todd nicely.

Speaker 5:          02:17:52       He said, I can work out at one o'clock. And they're like, well, you're not ready. And I had to let him know, I was like, I don't know what you don't get, buddy. I'm working out today. And he said, I'll think about it. So I call them every half hour, four hour straight to find set. I could. And I went and met Todd and Todd did a workout and I laid on my stomach with the pelvis, a pat [inaudible] are under my stomach or whatever. So that stretched my pelvis muscle back out and he'd pat on the back and I fell asleep. 20 minutes. Best workout I've ever done. But, um, I started my recovery that day. And then as far as the physical, as easy as, you know, I like the physical challenge. The mental was the hardest part for me. I mean, bar none. It was, it was the worst.

Speaker 5:          02:18:27       You know, I couldn't look at myself in the mirror for a while there because I didn't like what I saw. You don't see, you might, my arm's gone. The scars, um, just the overall message that I was and I'm thinking now is going to be a burden and all that. So it just, that's just how it went. So the more capable you got, the more comfortable you got in your new skin. Yeah. Well, I've found out that they let you go for one hour and then a physical therapy in the one hour of occupational therapy and then they let me do another one and another one. It turned into four hours of, of each. So eight hours put in eight hours a day at the gym in my recovery. Well at the gym and occupational therapy, learning how to use my hands, how to wash myself again, how to dress myself again, uh, learn how to drive, learned how to do all that stuff. But it took 19 months of at Walter Reed, 13 months in paperwork was after that to get out. But government, uh, and you, you, um,

Speaker 5:          02:19:25       you eventually went and met your guys when they came though. That's awesome. I did, I set some goals. Um, when I was in the hospital, my birthday, I called my life, my mom and dad and I was basically really short. Hey guys was up and find love you. Bye. That's all I wanted to say. I didn't want to talk and have a conversation and go over what happened to me. Um, I kept it very short, but I told my brother and I said, I have to call my guys in my unit. You need to find the number to my strong point and let me talk to them. So there's a pitcher going around where I had a baseball cap or no, I was out on patrol and I had sleeves rolled up. And a helmet off. Sunglasses. I mean everything out of standards as they, as you know, they have standards or whatever.

Speaker 5:          02:20:03       And I got ahold of my sergeant major, I said, sergeant major, I'm so sorry. I understand if you had to take my rank, I should have been out of uniform. I do apologize. And now the pictures go in public and he's like, you're crazy dude. Like just to get better. You're fine. And then I got ahold of my guys and I told them guys, I'm fine. I'll be okay and I'll be there when you get back from Afghanistan. I'll be there at the, you know, the ramp to give you guys a hug on my tall legs. And it took me a while. I got my tall legs that morning when they got back. I had to work out three hours today and then the tall legs don't bend, but like that wasn't wearing now, but there they make me at least six foot tall. Well you can't take those legs.

Speaker 5:          02:20:36       Homeless. She can stand up when you fall down. So the whole day the therapist's walks up and says stressful and they knock you down and you're like, what the hell? That's not a trustful I supposed to catch me. I supposed to close my eyes and trust you're gonna catch it. And they're like, that's the catch. You've got to get yourself back up. Therapists are great. No, I had, I had two of the best therapists, uh, that, that you could ask for. Now I'm carrying and Joe and that got me back to where I was at, but I did meet my guys and the first, one of the first people I got to hug us, doc Bateson, you know, and say, hey man, thanks for all you did.

Speaker 1:          02:21:02       And then you end up doing a five k five k run.

Speaker 5:          02:21:06       So [inaudible] got another goal. Yeah. So Todd nicely came in and when he met me, he had four firefighters also for telling the towers, five k to do in New York City. And they also, they partner with Gary Sneeze and they build houses and things like that for guys that have been through traumatic injuries. And they were like, hey, we're going to have a five k in September where we're going and I'll, we'll push you. I'm like, I'll walk it. They're like, wow, yeah, but we'll push you. It's no big deal. And I was like, no, you don't understand. Like I'm just gonna walk it. And like, well you don't have legs yet, but if you do walk it, that's cool. So I went up to New York City after my daughter's birthday the day after and walk the five k, uh, I came out of the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel Thinking, okay, I'm going to sit down now.

Speaker 5:          02:21:41       Like, I'm tired, my back hurts. I've got a mile, you know, 1.2 miles or something to go my right leg. I had completely rubbed raw bleeding inside my socket and I was like, it's good. I've, I've met a goal, I've walked over to, you know, two miles now. And, uh, I came out of the tunnel there, 343 firefighters with banners around their neck for nine 11. I thought, Jeez, okay, well if those guys and gals can go up down this flight of stairs and then ultimately die, um, you know, trying to save lives, I can finish this. So I did, I was sore, it was bad, but I didn't finish it.

Speaker 1:          02:22:11       And then, um, eventually you're like you said you're driving now you went out and did like mountain biking and skiing and all this other kind of just getting after it basically for better or for of a better term.

Speaker 5:          02:22:26       Um, and then you, and then you retire, you retire from the, from the army and, and what's your next move? Your next move is you figured out you're going to get a house and you're gonna move to, I had to move to Maine. My wife is from Maine originally. Uh, the heat doesn't do well with amputees cause your blood circulates faster. You, it comes back warmer when you really see it from your body's head, hands and feet. So I'm missing, you know, four of the five and then my legs are capped off. So if I wear pants or for wear shorts, it's the same. There's no air hitting a third of my body. And uh, yeah. So we, we decided we're going to move to Maine. Um, we didn't start a nonprofit to help with care packages at first and then we grew it to the retreat center that we have here in Maine.

Speaker 5:          02:23:05       And, um, really through my work at Walter Reed, when I was at Walter Reed, I was such an upbeat person as the same person as before the blast. I was still going in and having Casha Fridays cause it made people annoyed, but other people loved it. Having watched Friday Kesha Fridays I'd go put my, take my phone, I turn on cash on Pandora and we just rock out. And uh, the reason I unfortunately saw videos of youth like dancing, which cannot be on scene, apparently burned into your retina. You're welcome. But, uh, you know, they started to asked me if I'd meet people upstairs and it started out, hey, you know, Travis, we have a guy upstairs, I can't tell you his name or his room number, but if you could talk to them, really help, he's not in 41 and he's not in 43, but if you can find him, you know, and I'm not a marine, so, you know, obviously I'm smart enough to find that there's number 42, I don't eat crayons.

Speaker 5:          02:23:53       Um, but anyways, so I, uh, would go up and talk to him. Then that turned into like, hey, we have PFC Johnson, he's missing two legs. Um, his mom, his mother in law and his two kids are here. Can you go see him? I told him you'd be up around this time. And, uh, that's how the book got started and my documentary got started. And then the foundation was just cause all the nonprofits at Walter Reed doing great things. Kelsey and I wanted to give back some way, shape or form. And this is how we've decided that we can get back the best. Yeah. So, um, what, tell tell us more about the foundation. So the Travis Mills Foundation was started really just for care packages overseas and then I went out to Colorado or how to go downhill mountain biking and doing things. And then I realized that Walter Reed does a great job of taking the service member out there.

Speaker 5:          02:24:36       The only thing that the government, uh, doesn't lack, but because of the funds have to go to the soldiers. They don't get to bring all the families like my wife got to go cause I needed assistance and things. But a lot of the guys that could take care of themselves couldn't bring their loved ones and that's fine. That's okay. But we thought we could do something in that, in that space. My whole reason for getting better, it was my wife and my daughter easily. So we started bringing families out. We did it for one week of a year and we brought families out and show them how to do things, adaptively Kayak and canoe and things. And then we did another one and it went so well. We thought, well, we should buy a property. So we bought a property, it's supposed to be a $500,000 project.

Speaker 5:          02:25:12       Now it's a $3 million project. Uh, we did our first week of program, or I mean your first year programs. This year we did seven weeks, 56 families and we bring them up. Uh, we host eight families per week up to 40 people and we show them how to do things. We have a place on the water for kayaking and canoeing and tubing and boating and we just, um, the horseback riding and archery and there's all these activities of ropes course and we just say, you know what? I understand what you're going through. I understand it can get tough. Here's a network of people that are just like you. Whether you live in Chicago, in the inner city, or you live in the plains and Montana, reach out, understand that these families are going through the same thing. Um, feel comfortable when you come here that you can fall out of a kayak and nobody's going to freak out.

Speaker 5:          02:25:51       They're going to understand what you're going through. And it's just as much of a, a place for the loved ones. You know, the wives that can talk to other wives or our spouses and the kids can run around and see the, you know, what my dad has one leg missing and one arm, but this dad has two legs missing. And that's pretty cool because they know what we're going through. And after our first year of operations and running, it was such a great success. We're going to do strategic partnerships with other nonprofits that share our mission and they'll donate what it costs for a week and they'll run their own uh, retreats up here as well. So we're talking to with gold star member families as well as PTSD and Tbi. Cause right now I focus on limb loss or parallelization, but this hopefully will run 40 45 weeks out of the year.

Speaker 5:          02:26:33       It's all donation based. And the cool thing is like as the president and the six other board members I do have, we don't take a dime, we never will. We're auditing ourselves right now. So we got on the CFC, the combined federal campaign and it's all about giving back. So it's been really rewarding and fulfilling and I'm, I'm glad to be out there helping these families cope with their situation and tell them that there's other people out there like you keep going, never lived life on the sidelines and it most importantly never give up and never quit.

Speaker 1:          02:27:00       If people want to help this organization, what's the best way for them to do that?

Speaker 5:          02:27:04       Visit the website, Travis mills.org. It has all the information on the foundation is wasted. Donate online. There's ways to do volunteer options. We had people fly in just to volunteer for the week and help us out. And there's also ways to do corporate sponsorships. We had Wayfair come in, donate all the furniture, new balance came in donated to us and things like that. So we're growing, um, we believe in our mission. We know we can do this and there's other things we want to get accomplished out here. We need to build a multipurpose center. Uh, we have a pool going in and things like that, but it's all about giving back and, and, uh, the mindset of the service member that we're trying to host and the family,

Speaker 1:          02:27:43       the book tough as they come. That's what we read today. It's a, it's a great book. I read was small chunks of it. Um, yeah, you can pick that up, uh, anywhere where they sell books. And what about the documentary?

Speaker 5:          02:27:58       So the documentary, it's called Travis, a soldier's story. It was done in 2014 and it was actually a unveiled the Gi film festival. And um, we took first place and 55 short films. Uh, I got to meet Marcus and Melanie and the trail at night. It was really, really great to meet them. And now Netflix is signed to on for a two year run. So we got on Netflix in May, so if anyone wants to watch that, it's on Netflix. It's called Travis soldier story. Um, and it just tells the whole story. It just has iPhone footage of everything that Kelsey and I went through. Yes. And the two medics. Cool. The two Max saved my life. I actually are reenacting you getting blown up and the two guys get hurt are in the documentary as well. Yeah. And my brother in law saw people that were there or in the documentary?

Speaker 3:          02:28:36       No, between the book and watching the documentary and you get to see the faces and everything. It's really, uh, it's really cool to real powerful. And, um, what about social media? How's your social media presence? Mister popular? It's not yours

Speaker 5:          02:28:51       by any means. Uh, W we're about 60,000 in some strong on our Facebook page. I do little videos. Uh, my daughter learned how to tie her shoes the other day. We taught her in the morning and you know, by like we talked at like 7:00 AM by nine o'clock. She's tying it by herself, giving an intro to tying your shoes online. But just SSG, Travis mills is my page. If you want to check it out, share my story that, that really helps us out.

Speaker 3:          02:29:11       And it's Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. You're on all three. S S, g Travis mills. That's, that's where you can find it. Um, yeah. You know, you, you put the, the last thing in the book, like the last line in the book, you say to live in freedom, to go forward, to love your family, to make something of your life, to never ever give up, to never quit.

Speaker 2:          02:29:38       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:29:38       That's success. And Yeah, obviously I'm, in my opinion, if, if never giving up and never quitting is the definition of success that I think you're the most successful person I've ever met in my life, brother for real. Well, I appreciate that. I just,

Speaker 5:          02:29:57       we realized that people that depend on you, the people that went into all this and the lives that are lost. I mean, you've had a lot of buddies. I'm sure they didn't make it back home. Um, my situation is not, not life ending. My situation is just, I got a couple more steps in the morning, put my legs on Palmyra Amman and take my daughter. Tomorrow is actually my daughter's orientation at school. I get to take her, my wife and I just had a baby. Um, and I named, I named our little boy after my two medics, his named Dax, Dax, after Daniel Alexander for the medics that saved my life. So thankful to still be here, uh, through all the smoke in the dirt and the dust. Uh, it's all settled now and, um, I'm living life to the fullest and doing the best I can to make sure that people understand life goes on and to never ever give up and never quit.

Speaker 5:          02:30:40       Anything else? Any closing thoughts? I mean, I just obviously want to thank everybody went into this. I mean, from my unit on the ground, I know I was a heavy guy, you know, walk around, wait was 400 pounds. So I'd get, you know, with all my gear on and all that to get me out of there was great. Uh, this medical staff, doctors, nurses, um, physical therapists, occupational therapists, everybody, uh, obviously my family that went into it. I want to say thanks for being there with my side, my beautiful wife and my wonderful children, um, for, you know, really accepting what happened and moving forward in life and just, uh, you know, thereby no, you know, you can't always affect your, your situation you find yourself in, but you always can affect your attitude. And that's, that's where I find the most, uh, I guess the most realization in my situation. I can't always, if I drop something on my hand, you know, I can't pick it up right away or I have to do something weird and get mad about it because getting mad doesn't, I'm getting mad, doesn't do anything. So I always try to keep my head two positive and keep pushing forward. But thanks for having me. Also, I want to thank you for having me on here. Both the gentleman, I didn't look at you very much. Oh, sorry. I know we talked about this earlier, but he said not, you said not to.

Speaker 3:          02:31:39       Yeah. Try not to, that's it's at your discretion for sure. I've got to Redo this then so I can look at you more than you. Okay. But perfect. Perfect. Yeah. Hey man, thanks for coming on. Um, of course. Thank you for your service to this great nation, not only as a soldier and a leader on the battlefield, but for your continued service that you're doing today for veterans and also for the, the gift that I think you give everybody that hears about you or comes and contacts you with you in any way. And that is just a living example of grit and of determination and of will.

Speaker 2:          02:32:26       And

Speaker 3:          02:32:28       I, I just think you're the absolute model of what it means and what people can accomplish.

Speaker 2:          02:32:39       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:32:39       If we do, as you say, and that is to go forward, never give up and never ever quit.

Speaker 3:          02:32:47       Thanks for coming on, Brian. Thanks for having me. And after a little administrative break, Travis has left the building pretty damn awesome. Yeah. To have him on, man. Yeah. Um, yeah. Any and every excuse that a person might have as a human being just got destroyed. Yeah. Yeah. And he really kind of illustrated how hard it got spread the time when you, like when he said, oh, I quit in the hospital. Yeah. And it's Kinda like, it makes just kind of when you're around them now and you see just how he is, it kind of really brings to light how good he is now. Yeah. You know, and, and he couldn't at that moment in time. And when people get into that darkness, they don't see, they, they can't, they can't see the future. They can't see that things are going to get better. They can't see, you know, for him at that point in time, there's no way it was going to get good. Yeah. You know, so yeah. That's very true. Very true. Yeah. Another interesting things that when you see again where he's like concerned about his men and even when he said I quit, he was concerned about his wife. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:34:18       And like that was the significant element, just totally selfless person. Awesome. Um, well speaking of

Speaker 6:          02:34:38       being awesome. Yeah. Echo Charles, you're awesome. We think we can talk about some awesome American made stuff. That's a good idea. I like where you're going with this origin origin mean.com but yeah, origin, that's the brand. So what is origin were in league with origin? I liked the expression in league with, by the way, I might've told you that before. Yeah, it's a good way of putting it. Yeah. So this is straight up. The Best American made apparel in the world. You can, you don't have to say the best American made apparel. You can say it's the best apparel in the world and it's American made. Yeah. Is that subjective? I guess it's kind of subjective, but if you say it's the best American made, well I guess it all technically might be on a, no. Either way is dope. Yeah. And it's all made in America. But here's the thing about made in America, I guess, I don't know, I could be wrong about this part, but technically you could be like, yeah, they, they sewed these, I don't know, pants or whatever, you know, in America and be like, Hey, where'd you get the material? Oh, well, you know, we got it from somewhere else, not in America, which I guess is cool. Technically was made. It was crafted but not here. So you figure what like let's say a cotton pants, right? You get the material from America, but how do you make the material, the actual cotton where it's cotton come from? You grow it. I used to have a cotton like trees, like a bunch of them by the way. I'm quiet nonetheless. So where do they get, where does origin get that? Cotton America.

Speaker 6:          02:36:26       What about the seeds to plant the cotton? They're from America for sure. So straight up from the ground. The earth. From the seeds to the pants that you get in the event of you getting pants. Yeah, the way there's other stuff. There's geese and now owns a good one. The geese, if you're into Jujitsu. Nonetheless, the pants that I got, the joggers, he was asking me, how do you like those? And you know the new joggers, they're kind of like, they have a different shape than the old school sweatpants. So I was like, okay. You know, and I looked into those. I was telling Pete this story where I ordered some ironically from overseas, I ordered them from overseas. They looked pretty good, so I ordered them. Didn't come in. By the way, this was about a year and a half ago. Still didn't come in by the way, but I looked into it.

Speaker 6:          02:37:16       I was like, whatever. It is, probably not for me. Small Attic, you know, it's a sign one of those deals. Either way I get pizza once. I'm like, all right, cool. I'm going to try these. I put them on surprisingly legitimate as far as the look goes. Cool. It's me pee even said that. I'm like, I look good in them, which is a lot cause I just kind of met Pete in person over the past week. Anyway, good stuff. Just saying it's good stuff. And again, all made in America. All of it. Uh, some geese on there, some cool rash guards, the George Washington Rash Garden. Then I feel like we're ready for that one to come back. So yeah. So Pete should, yeah, Jude have that one. Yeah. Nonetheless. Origin main.com and when I say main, it's the state Maine. So origin m m m e, I n e.com. That's a good one. The best one really when it comes down to it. Also Jocko has some supplements,

Speaker 6:          02:38:13       Krill oil, which we need and joint warfare. So really this is like a full on like joint cause Krill oil, Omega threes four. You're going first of all, yeah. Then join warfare. It's like, cause there's a bunch of things regardless of what you, you think. Yeah. Crew oil joints, boom. Good. It's, there's more to it than that. Just like wow. Like glucosomine could. It was all like basically all the stuff that you have been taking for years. You said, you know what, let me come over with my own Jocko formula. Then we have it now. Boom. Have it now. Two products, right. Super curled joint warfare. That's the one that's the kit. That's the new kit. As far as kids go also, those are also an origin main.com by the way. Yeah. Yeah. Origin main.com also on it, so you know, we've been, we're on a trip right now in the event of people not knowing that we're on a trip to Maine. I didn't bring the kettlebells.

Speaker 2:          02:39:14       Okay.

Speaker 6:          02:39:15       I thought that that, that might've been too much. Plus, you know, to check on Kelly, they give you 50 pounds, right in your luggage. My kettle bells one you hit a bump more than 50 pounds nonetheless. 88 pounds. Yeah. In your case, minus 62. Okay. The Werewolf Times 224. Boom. Math on point. There was a guy at the camp that we went to that brought the kettle bells, the 70, whatever one. The guerilla one from on it. The cool one. I didn't, I didn't work out with them though. I was gonna I want to do, I intended to anyway, those gorilla and Werewolf kettlebells that I'm talking about, these are the cool kettlebells there from on it. Those are

Speaker 6:          02:40:01       all kettlebells are good really. But if you want that level up of coolness, um, yeah, I get those ones on it.com/jocko. Get it jump ropes on there. The bunch of cool fitness stuff. If you're lagging in your, which I do. Sometimes I lag in my work. Not In lag like physically, but um, interest wise, you know you get kind of bored, not you. You don't get bored, Huh? No. You just like go out. Doesn't matter. Right. It doesn't even register board or not. Yeah. Execution is happening to know what it's about. Yeah. Well some of us we get kind of bored and it's not that we're getting bored so we're not going to do it. We're looking for something like, Oh yeah, let me try this new thing, some new hotness in regards to workouts. Can you not say new hotness anymore? This podcast will Smith's it and one of the, one of them I thought it was cool.

Speaker 6:          02:40:49       It doesn't like certify it for the podcast. I know Bri. I figured I'd try it out though. Just know that it's been tried. It failed next and rejected, huh? Gotcha. If you want some new cool stuff to do in regards to a workout. Hey Man, look, audit has all these one, they have battle ropes in Macy's in cool set and they have cool videos on there. By the way, don't get addicted to the website. Spin appropriate amounts of time on the website. Not Too much. Remember how you're talking about like you know when you watch a video on youtube and then another one pops up? Yeah, no, six of them pop up. Yeah. All all formulated for you. Especially picked watch out for that Weird Youtube Munchkins that are like saying, I know what talent likes. Yeah, that's actually, you want to see another street fight to octa psycho.

Speaker 6:          02:41:34       Anyway, just watch out for that. Aren't on the website on the Onnit website because they videos are real interesting. But they're about workouts though. A lot of them. So it's kind of, it's kind of a catch 22 video about working out. Does not replace working out though. No, no, not at all. Check and you got to get after it for sure, but a lot of options on there anyway on it.com/chocolate that's the one right there. Also. You know what though? In this camp. So some guys came to the camp, they brought this 200 pound bag bag of, he said it was a sandbag, but it's like gravel and essentially, and the challenge is to pick it up over your shoulder, 200 pounds. So even that really, I mean, that's not that easy. 200 by the way, when they're explaining it to me, it was Mike Gerard, Brian Victor, they were exploring, explain it to me. Well, while they're explaining it to me, I'm thinking, okay, I know what 150 pound dumbbell feels like when you lift it up.

Speaker 6:          02:42:44       And I'm thinking, could I get that? And that has a handle and balanced by the way. So I'm like, shoot, do I though, man, I don't know if I could do that. Could I? Could I do that? And then they're like, oh yeah, you know, like I've done it. And it's like, okay, so he can be done. Like it's, it's obviously not like this thing, you need years of practice or whatever. So I was like, but man, I don't know. And then sure enough. So it's, yeah. When I went and did it, it was like it was hard. I failed the first one I brought you bring it up, you kind bring it onto your lap. 200 pounds, man. That's not like, it's like you know how you say when you, when you pick up a a a person and they're just dead weight similar to that. Anyway, boom. Failed the first time they're cheering me on. Thanks for that by the way guys. That helped me and then the second time I did it it was, it was good. One of the high points. Anyway, that was just a side note. Also, just a bunch of people don't have to ask me. Yeah, I did not participate in the challenge. I have an injured rib. That was that. Yeah. You've been real happy about that are still not out of the sheet on your face man.

Speaker 6:          02:43:47       Yeah, the ribs almost healed. Thanks Andy. That was Andy. Andy. Andy did that to my ribs in a way, and this is, I think you paid a bigger price than me, but you messed up my ribbon in identical way a few months ago. Oh, you were gonna get a submission on me and then you hurt yourself. No, I was trying, I was escaping a submission. So essentially the same situation, but instead this time you got the rib injury instead of the guy that you're trying to tap out. So yeah, that's really in a way, good for you. You know, and I hope we've all learned something from this whole thing today anyway, also when you buy this book and you will and should tough as they come, tough as they come. Travis Mills, get it through our website. That's a good way to support. I have a little section, we have a little section books from the podcast.

And I said, absolutely, it really does. And I said, well, like how much? And I said, well, it's basically the way I could describe it. It's basically the way I could describe it. Small action, big reaction. So Yup. You're very right on that one. Yes. Yep. You know, I just had a feeling from the beginning that that was, that's a good way to put it.

Speaker 6:          02:45:31       And it is really also subscribe to the podcast. It's a good way to support stitcher, iTunes, Google play, all these ones that provide plot, uh, podcasts, um, just seems, you know, it seemed like something that everyone probably has done already, but you know, if you haven't subscribed to that one, that's a good one. If you're in the mood, leave a review. That's a good one. Some good reviews on there already and thank you guys for doing that. Very colorful. Would you say colorful?

Speaker 6:          02:46:27       There's other things that come from the youtube channel yet that are not on the podcast. Subscribe. Yes. Whether it's a little augmented videos that you make with your creative, um, spin on them. Yeah. There's just straight excerpts. Right. And then there's deleted scenes. Yeah. Deleted scenes. I think I'll put some more on there. I, there's a few, you know what, when you kind of go through and I, and I want, you know, when I edited it right, so really the edit, the audio editing process is pretty simple. You cut off the beginning, you'll cut off the end, you faded in, you faded out, done. That's it. Easy. Yeah. But the parts of that I cut off. There's some, some nuggets in there. Interesting stuff. And you know when you're in the, in the moment I'm talking to you, it's just regular. We're just talking and whatever.

Speaker 6:          02:47:16       Maybe we're laughing, maybe not. But when you kind of go back and listen to it, it's kind of funny. Anyway, I'll put some on some of those on there too. So yeah, if you subscribe to the Youtube Channel you can watch those. Those are cool. The excerpts or just kinda like, um, you know, sharable, smaller nuggets of Jocko wisdom, which is cool. I mean, you know, if you don't want to listen to the whole podcast just for the thing. In fact, in fact there was a couple of people where they're like, yeah, I listened to those. They, the guy at the camp, he was like, yeah, I listen to those excerpts like almost every day. Yeah. Cause they're like, yeah, there's a lot of them in there now too. By the way. Also Jocko has a store, it's called Jocko store, Jocko store.com. There's some shirts on there if you want to support.

Speaker 6:          02:47:58       So I'm not saying by shirt, I'm not saying buy a hat. Got Hats on. They're now snap back. Snapped back. My bad. I thought they were affected was wrong. You know what the Echo thought it was? Flex fit. Trucker hats don't exist yet. They don't listen to have those in the world doesn't need them. Yeah, it almost doesn't make sense. Yeah. Well maybe, I dunno. I for real thought they're flexible. But you know what? I looked into it and I realized that the um, the reason that I thought they're flexible is because some new hats I'm coming out with, oh, maybe in a few weeks they're like, there are different style of hat and their flex fit. They look dope too, by the way. I'll show them to you one day. Cool. Um, so yeah, I'm not saying, Hey, I'm not saying, Hey, buy my shirt, my rash guard or whatever. I'm saying, go in the store, Jocko store, look on their, so check out the items and if you like something, get something from hoodies on there. Some women's stuff, some patches, which are cool. I've seen a few of those on people's backpacks. Actually. They look on a dope. I'm going to, I'm probably pulling on my backpack. Um, and you know from others letting us all know, sometimes

Speaker 1:          02:49:08       you just think about loud. Yeah. I'm curious about that. We will all be looking for,

Speaker 6:          02:49:14       I'll show it to you when it's done. Anyway, Jocko. store.com. That's a good way. Also psychological warfare who we just talking to them. Oh Pete? Yeah. Where? Okay. Basically psycholo psychological warfare. What is that? It is an album with tracks Jocko checks where in your campaign against weakness meanings. If you're, if you have goals, like, okay, so I listen to Jordan Peterson and he kind of, he has this thing, I'm not gonna go like too much into it, but he has this thing where it's like, okay, why I don't, why don't people get what they want? And so because, and one of the reasons it's because they just don't know what that is. And we kind of don't even if you say, I want to get better, better in what Jujitsu? Cause you can do one pushup a day and you're technically better technically. So it's like what do you mean better and better?

Speaker 6:          02:50:06       How? Whatever, whatever. So anyway, back to this psychological, if you want to, I don't know, lose weight. You want to wake up earlier and be more disciplined in these specific ways and all this stuff. You want to clean up your diet to clean up your diet. You've got to avoid junk food. All this stuff. Junk food. You get distracted by short term payoffs, right? With junk food because junk, the whole idea of junk food is short term pay off over longterm payoff, good diet, longterm payoff, bad diet, short term path. Anyway, if you get tempted by weakness, you listened to the psychological warfare album or just a track or whatever. So look, you waking up early in the morning to four 30 every day. That's what I'm doing from now on that one day when you're kind of tired and the alarm goes off and you're tempted or compelled to press the snooze it or just stay in bed, I'll wake up later, I'll wake up at at noon just saying some people wake up at noon, sometimes play this track called get up and get after it. I guarantee you won't wake up at noon. You'll wake up at the assigned time assigned by yourself. By the way, 100% success rate on that. If you fail, if you listen to this and you fail at your little thing. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what to say, but that's a good one. Psychological warfare. Jocko Willink. Look for it. Look into it. Also

Speaker 3:          02:52:23       it got a little bump the other day. I don't know. I think, uh, like in social media I put something out and it got a little bump and all of a sudden the delivery dates of people that just ordered it got pushed back. So I don't know.
