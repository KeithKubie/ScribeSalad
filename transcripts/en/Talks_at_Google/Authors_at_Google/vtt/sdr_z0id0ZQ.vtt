00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.730
&gt;&gt;Cliff: Welcome to another talks at Google.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.050
Today we are very thrilled to talk about a
topic of central importance to the 2012 election,

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.860
in particular of that of America's continued
presence on the world stage and the impact

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.910
of things such as the looming debt crisis.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.700
Today we're thrilled to host Michael Moran.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.940
He's speaking to us today about his book which
is called THE RECKONING: Debt, Democracy,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.800
and the Future of American Power.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.590
He chronicles how debt and political indecision
coupled with emerging technologies is shifting

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.700
the global political landscape.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.650
Now Michael is the Director and Editor-in-Chief
of Renaissance: Insights and he's authored

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.640
numerous opinion pieces of foreign policy
analyses for the likes of Slate and MSNBC

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.460
and he's written for other foreign press sites
throughout his career.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.960
We'll have a microphone for Q and A in the
back so please make sure to use that during

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.420
the last part of our talk.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.440
And without further ado please join me in
welcoming Michael to Google.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.440
Thanks.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.440
[applause]

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.920
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: Thank you Cliff and thanks
everybody for taking time out of a beautiful

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.920
day.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.420
I know what it's like; I used to live in Seattle.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.250
I worked for a company up there you may have
heard of, on their campus at least, for msnbc.com

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.350
during the launch phase which was just a fascinating
experience for a guy who was essentially a

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.160
journalist at that point.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.440
But I know what this weather does to crowds
like this so I don't feel embarrassed about

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.750
all the empty chairs so.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.380
I'm honored to be here.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.020
Google is a leading intellectual organization
in the world and I don't confine that to the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.290
tech sector.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.720
I've been pleased to get to know Jared Cohen
a little bit.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.480
I was the head of editorial, digital editorial,
at the Council on Foreign Relations for a

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:57.020
period a couple years back and I got to know
Jared through his work at CFR and he's a great

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.440
proselytizing evangelist for the changes that
technology's bringing to the world and particularly

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.440
foreign policy.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.390
So I'm very happy to be here.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.891
I thought I'd start today by trying to focus
a bit beyond the political season that we

00:02:14.891 --> 00:02:19.489
have here 'cause I think inevitably we're
gonna end up there; it's gonna funnel our

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:25.329
conversation in that direction in part because
American electoral cycle which doesn't ever

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:33.199
seem to end now produces such a small opportunity
for a recently elected President to do anything

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:37.559
farsighted before they have to start running
for office again or at least start help their

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:41.469
party retain the mid-term election advantage.

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:46.400
Obama of course was, that small window was
completely gone in his case.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.519
I think it's fair to say he was handed the
largest pile of steamy dooky any President

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.139
ever encountered, including Roosevelt because
after all Roosevelt knew there was a Depression

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:57.330
when he ran for President.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.959
Obama, it seemed to dawn on everybody sometime
between his election and his inauguration

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.849
that these were some serious problems.

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:11.379
I had the great pleasure of working for years
with Nouriel Roubini, a guy who had not been

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:19.109
surprised by this and subsequently having
predicted what was going to happen in the

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.650
mortgage market here first and then the contagion
that led to what's now being called the Great

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.420
Recession.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.150
He was kind of the skunk at the picnic from
roughly the middle of 2005 when he made this

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.109
prediction until it actually came true, and
now he's just widely resented and hated for

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.739
being right.

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:43.829
But having worked closely with Nouriel I got
to see what he does and how he gauges individual

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:44.829
economies.

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.739
I mean his real talent is in macro-assessment
of large economic units, whether they're economies

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.970
or sectors or markets.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.909
And he took the same approach for every economy
whether it was Borneo or the United States;

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.430
essentially the balance sheet approach.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.199
If your balance sheet is out of whack something's
eventually gonna go wrong.

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:08.879
This was widely considered heresy right up
until 2008 in some quarters and even today

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:13.889
in many quarters, that you would apply the
same standards to a developing economy that

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:19.870
you would to an advanced economy; what I now
call the submerging economies.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:26.660
I think Nouriel was proven right obviously
in a somewhat infamous way and it started

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:38.240
me thinking about the various tendons and
synapses that connect this macroeconomic thought

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.939
to geopolitics.

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:47.560
I started worrying about this primarily because
I think I was so absolutely privileged to

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:54.680
be posted abroad as a U.S. foreign correspondent
during what I think as the apex of U.S. influence.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.110
It was right after the Wall came down, I was
there when Germany reunited, I was in various

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.490
Communist countries as the Communist governments
fell in the 90's and thought to myself before

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.460
I had children, "My children will grow up
in a better world," and that lasted until

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.229
I watched the planes go into the Trade Center.

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:20.729
We always manage to destroy these kind of
moments of Utopia somehow.

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:26.030
But the U.S. was in a position at that point,
before 9/11, where literally a pack of Marlboro

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.280
cigarettes and a passport and you could get
to the Presidential palace.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.000
People just wanted to see someone who had
an audience in the United States because the

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.949
assessment was that even if the changes were
wrenching, even if the changes were resented

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:46.689
by the old elites and even resisted, somehow
in our kinda big, dumb dog way we had, without

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:53.050
killing millions of people with nuclear weapons,
essentially won the Cold War.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.069
How we did it we'll get different analyses
of that; the Right tends to think it was the

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:04.500
Reagan arms buildup, it usually doesn't mention
how Carter started it; the Left tends to think

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.759
that it was soft power, rock and roll, blue
jeans.

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:09.600
I think there's a lot of both in there.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.780
But the fact is we had a great deal of good
will, there was a great swelling of admiration

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.210
for what we had accomplished in a relatively
bloodless fashion, relatively, obviously there

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.020
were a lot of exceptions to that.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:30.249
Our reaction to 9/11 began a process of unraveling
of that esteem, that global esteem.

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:35.000
I think most of the world understood why we
went into Afghanistan.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.909
Iraq was a different story and as it turned
out when our primary motivation was unveiled

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:48.720
as false at best and deceptive at worst, I
think that was a real problem for the rest

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.690
of the world which was compounded by the fact
that we reelected the guy that did it.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.979
I mean in the eyes of the rest of the world,
and this is something I've spent my life trying

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:02.930
to understand, that was this cardinal sin,
not the war itself, was the reelection of

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:09.560
the President who had misled the country and
our closest allies into that war.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.780
And then to drive the global economy off a
cliff was kind of the coup de grace wasn't

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.780
it?

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:21.259
And you can't say that that was a mistake,
I mean we being, we Americans left and right

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:26.969
from Ronald Reagan to Bill Clinton, signed
up for the deregulatory band wagon that ultimately

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:30.259
went off that cliff.

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:35.210
Astoundingly today we still have not come
to terms with how this happened; there's a

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:39.229
surprisingly vigorous debate over whether
government actually caused this.

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:43.090
It's astounding to me, I mean it's like blaming
the Swedes and the Swiss for World War II

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.919
because they didn't stop it.

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:49.620
I mean okay you can blame the League of Nations
for not walking in but certainly they didn't

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.530
cause it, they were just absent at their post.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:58.199
This is the argument that seems to have purchase
on a good minority of this country, maybe

00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:01.770
40, 45 percent and it's scary.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:09.060
This goes hand in hand with an impression
we get from looking at the town hall meetings,

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:14.530
etcetera, the moments when the central government
figures from Congressman to Presidents have

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:19.580
interaction with actual human beings instead
of flaks and press.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:25.319
And I remember one in particular was a Republican
Congressman in South Carolina who was assailed

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:30.479
by one of his constituents because he wanted
to reform Medicare and the guy stood up and

00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:37.370
said, you may have seen this some of you,
"Keep your government hands off my Medicare!"

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.000
That encapsulates the dysfunction right there.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.370
I mean most of Americans don't understand
what our government is, they don't understand

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:51.290
what their tax money does, and the line between
government benefits and benefits for other

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:54.300
people is very blurry.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:58.149
Somebody once said, "Big government is the
government that gives money away to other

00:08:58.149 --> 00:08:59.149
people.

00:08:59.149 --> 00:09:01.250
Small government is the one that gives it
to me."

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:02.250
[laughter]

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.250
Right?

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:04.250
[pause]

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:08.730
Let's broaden that out though and talk about
the U.S. place in the world.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.959
So we have a branding problem.

00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:19.311
We are now running around in modest recovery
mode economically kind of expecting the world

00:09:19.311 --> 00:09:23.400
to welcome us back as the leader.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.730
American leadership is taken for granted because
we are exceptional.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:35.170
And this takes on various tones of kind of
messianic tones depending on where you are

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.279
in the political spectrum, but pretty much
all Americans starting in second grade are

00:09:38.279 --> 00:09:43.100
taught that some great power is pushing us
forward to lead the world so that everybody

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:51.040
someday can have a Carvel in their backyard
or least access to the Internet which isn't

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.820
a bad thing; there's a lot of good and a lot
of bad in that.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.040
But the exceptionalist myth goes hand in hand
overseas with something that has been the

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:04.880
totem for the foreign policy community in
the U.S. since World War II which is stability.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.029
So think about that word for a minute, stability's
an important thing.

00:10:09.029 --> 00:10:14.740
For servers obviously, it's nice to have stable
servers; in your emotional life, I'm still

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.250
seeking it.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:24.440
But stability in foreign policy in economic
terms in the global economy is the lever of

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.870
a country that benefits from the status quo.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:32.241
Status quo powers love stability 'cause things
continue to get better for them but it does

00:10:32.241 --> 00:10:37.790
freeze a lot of the rest of the world out
of potential improvements in their lot.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:43.399
The United States is now devoted as vigorously
as ever if you look at the comments of the

00:10:43.399 --> 00:10:48.149
State Department, whether you go back to Bush's
term in office or look at the Hilary Clinton

00:10:48.149 --> 00:10:52.560
State Department, to this term stability,
we want stability.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.040
And yet stability is exactly what we don't
have in the modern world; this is a world

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.709
profoundly in transition.

00:10:59.709 --> 00:11:05.839
So the United States is essentially pursuing
a policy which bakes in brittleness which

00:11:05.839 --> 00:11:13.139
will become unsustainable as we continue to
do things we've done since 1945 militarily

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:18.940
essentially attempting to keep the balance
of power in Europe and Asia and in other sub-regions

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.240
of the world from getting out of whack.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:29.310
We do this by suppressing the need for national
governments in those regions to take responsibility

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:31.220
for their own security.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:38.760
Now during the period post '45 to let's say
1999-2000 we could afford to do that.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:43.709
As Michael Mandelbaum says, "The cost of doing
these things were essentially rounding errors

00:11:43.709 --> 00:11:44.740
in our budget.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:49.339
We didn't notice, it was the cost of doing
business as the world's Superman."

00:11:49.339 --> 00:11:54.680
We can't afford that anymore and it's becoming
clearer and clearer to those who feel repressed

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.750
by it.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:02.150
Minorities within our allies feel they should
start taking more responsibility; some in

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:10.100
Japan, some in Taiwan, South Korea, certainly
Israel is diverging from our vision for them

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.160
pretty significantly.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.380
More importantly though you're seeing it in
the American political debate for the first

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:22.500
time; the Libya mission was a very interesting
debate; it ultimately came down to the last

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:27.870
desperate cry of the anti-war movement everywhere
which is the War Powers Act which Republican

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:32.290
or Democrat the President regards as irrelevant
and unconstitutional; it's the first thing

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:37.480
I think they tell them when they win the office,
"By the way that thing doesn't matter."

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.750
But before that the argument from left and
right was about money.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:46.740
It was the first time in my life that I can
remember a proposed American military adventure

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:53.470
being debated in terms of what it would cost
us; the cost benefit analysis to things we

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.050
could be doing with that money here versus
there.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:03.100
An even more profound example of this coming
brittleness was what happened to Georgia in

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.269
2008.

00:13:04.269 --> 00:13:09.500
Georgia is a country like Israel and Taiwan
and many others which has been, which essentially

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:15.690
had been told quietly without a formal treaty
that, "Don't worry we've got your back.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.300
Don't worry nothin' bad's gonna happen to
you.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:22.440
You'll be in NATO someday as a matter of fact."

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:27.949
When things hit the fan it turned out that
that was all talk.

00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:36.079
In Georgia the cost to the United States was
relatively minimal; it readjusted U.S. views

00:13:36.079 --> 00:13:41.389
of Russia a bit, but it was a reality check
that I don't believe filtered far enough into

00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:43.800
the brain of the United States.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:48.920
You gotta wonder at some point what it is
we would sacrifice to defend South Korea and

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.889
Taiwan?

00:13:50.889 --> 00:13:57.730
And yet we have issued absolute blanket security
guarantees to these countries, both of which

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:03.760
are completely capable of building the types
of military forces and taking the kind of

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:10.310
steps, more importantly diplomatically, to
adjust the security environment in their regions.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:16.069
Again I think we are sustaining an unsustainable
status quo in all of these regions; in Europe

00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:20.890
it's absurd that we have, I mean the number
of bases in Germany is still astounding.

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:28.589
There's a brand new ski lodge completed in
2003 for the hard pressed American troops

00:14:28.589 --> 00:14:30.230
and their families to take vacations.

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:34.970
Now I don't begrudge them that, but why not
send them to Shimane?

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:39.029
[laughs] Do we have to build a U.S. military
ski base at Garmisch?

00:14:39.029 --> 00:14:43.830
I mean essentially what we did; it's a beautiful
facility, it's a wonderful facility but it

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:50.960
cost something like $67 million to build in
a period, this is 15 years after the Berlin

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.560
Wall came down, in Germany which is a country
that can certainly afford to deal with its

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.730
own issues.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:15:01.040
So a lot of these issues I think have been,
as Michael Mandelbaum said, rounding errors,

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:06.290
they just weren't there they were part of
this netherworld of foreign policy that didn't

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:10.290
really show up on the American radar screen
until there was a war.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:13.399
Well for the last decade there've been two
of them.

00:15:13.399 --> 00:15:21.750
Even that has had some trouble penetrating,
we've done these wars rather small really

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:26.860
in relative terms, there's been no draft,
many of us know someone who's been touched

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:32.829
by these wars, but by and large they have
not been front and center in the political

00:15:32.829 --> 00:15:35.459
debate since John Kerry was defeated.

00:15:35.459 --> 00:15:39.529
When was the last time we really had a debate
about Iraq in this country?

00:15:39.529 --> 00:15:40.529
Alright.

00:15:40.529 --> 00:15:45.350
Now we're out I guess it's forgotten.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:51.829
If you do, however, begin to think about the
cumulative effect of these things, the effect

00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:58.100
that this has had on America's global reputation,
on our soft power even which remains very

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:03.709
potent, certainly we're the most important
force in the world in terms of our intellectual

00:16:03.709 --> 00:16:08.220
capital, our cultural capital; we're still
the place that immigrants by and large seek

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:14.579
to come to for an education and in many cases
to start their lives as entrepreneurs and

00:16:14.579 --> 00:16:15.579
raise families.

00:16:15.579 --> 00:16:18.889
That's all great but these things too can
be squandered and they can go away fairly

00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:25.839
quickly if we continue down a road that doesn't
recognize that we should be essentially declaring

00:16:25.839 --> 00:16:30.769
some form of victory on the 20th century and
welcoming the emerging powers into a world

00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:33.519
that we, ecosystem that we created.

00:16:33.519 --> 00:16:39.029
We enabled the emergence of these powers in
many ways but we do not have the psychological

00:16:39.029 --> 00:16:46.569
capacity to get past the thin skinned, defensive,
declining empire syndrome that we seem to

00:16:46.569 --> 00:16:47.920
have fallen into.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:53.900
And I find this astounding really; it's not
necessary, we don't have to be in this position.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:17:01.079
Our problems relative to those of the bricks,
relative to those of rest of the G7 are solvable.

00:17:01.079 --> 00:17:06.420
They're political problems they're not demographic
problems, they're not problems of imperial

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:12.040
overreach which is essentially what the European
Union is or monetary constipation you might

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.910
call it, there's a bunch of ways you could
describe that, but essentially they've got

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:20.200
this corset they've created for themselves
that they can't get out of.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:25.900
Our problems are in essence that we're about
two or three backroom deals away from solving

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.510
them I think.

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:33.400
And there unfortunately we come to politics.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:40.780
At the moment my own feeling is that failure
will be a wonderful thing for those who pursue

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.450
the wrong policies in the United States because
it seems in this current environment the only

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:50.020
thing we can possibly grasp is failure.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:57.090
I mean abject failure of our macroeconomic
policies in 2008 brought some realization

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:59.720
that we needed to change a bit.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:04.830
The downgrading of the debt last year didn't
do anything, but I think a couple more episodes

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:08.500
of that will cause real pain in the United
States and at that point these conversations

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.310
will have to be had.

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:18.830
So I'm on the record here if you look Democrat/Republican
right now I'm pretty disappointed in the Obama

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:24.050
Administration primarily because I think they
should have put down a marker early on that

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:31.750
drove home again and again what they had inherited
and lowered the expectations of some kind.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:35.380
They should have dismissed out of hand the
idea that we were gonna bounce back.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:41.820
This is a balance sheet recession; historically
this means years and years and years of sluggish

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:49.130
growth and indicators, and macroeconomic indicators
that don't necessarily reflect the real pain

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.310
in the economy.

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:55.460
For instance, the unemployment rate doesn't
show seven or eight extra percent who have

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.800
been discouraged and they're out of the labor
market.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:03.470
The Obama Administration took the high road
as is its wont and they're paying for it now

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:07.720
because now the problems have been hung around
its neck.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:11.780
That's too bad, but that's a self inflicted
wound as far as I'm concerned.

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:18.010
The other thing that I'm disappointed with
is that when the country gets into this situation,

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:25.560
a situation where somebody's got to demand
sacrifice of all across political spectrum,

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:32.600
it helps to have developed a figure of moral
authority in the center.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:37.860
At various times in the last century I think
Franklin Roosevelt was that person at one

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:38.860
point.

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.710
I think even Reagan was that person at one
point regardless of what you think of his

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:42.710
politics.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:47.320
When he talked after the Challenger blew up,
when he talked about Iran Contra and even

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:52.340
falsely said he knew nothing about it, people
believed him because he was that figure, he

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:56.990
had developed, he had cultivated that figure,
that reputation.

00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:03.100
And like it or not we are, we still live in
this bizarrely paternalistic world where our

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:07.120
country looks to the President to have that
moral authority.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:13.630
And when he doesn't have it they see it and
it makes the Presidency enormously less effective

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:18.070
and it makes every effort by the President
to be effective look like scheming, tactical

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:20.470
pettiness.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:27.030
And I think because of the gridlock in Congress
you're seeing in the American political system

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:30.860
hyperactivity in the Executive and in the
Supreme Court.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:34.830
And I don't think there's a particular evil
intent in the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:41.210
has been landed with a number of issues which
should be decided in Congress.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:45.940
Many of them are political issues that Congress
can't decide and so they punt to the non-elected

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:51.790
branch of government where at least the political
fallout doesn't cost them their jobs.

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:55.350
So they have really nothing to lose to push
the ball forward one way or another.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:59.670
In some ways you could argue either way would
be better than allowing these debates to go

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:03.630
on and debilitating our, the larger macro
politics.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:08.640
So I don't wanna get too deeply into electoral
politics but I'd love to take some questions

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.720
on it if you have some.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:18.790
I think the basic conceit of this book though
is I fear that the brittleness that we are

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:23.320
encouraging in American foreign policy will
lead to something akin to a Lehman Brothers

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.890
moment in geopolitical terms.

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:30.910
And by that I mean we should be planning the
unraveling of American influence around the

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:37.210
world, we should be figuring out who the responsible
parties are, where are the absent institutions

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:44.570
that need to be developed before U.S. influence
begins to draw back and the shoreline and

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:50.690
all of its little conflicts that are centuries
old bubble up again.

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.220
These things should be thought through.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:58.580
If this happens in an uncontrolled way, once
it begins to fall apart you'll never get back

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.810
out in front of it again.

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:06.290
And I don't like the British Empire analogies
but there is one that I do like which is in

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:13.230
the course of about a month in Asia in 1941,
the country that by and large set the agenda

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:21.030
in Asia for 350 years, the British, had lost
a battle cruiser and a cruiser in the day

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:26.170
after Pearl Harbor which were the totem of
their power in the region and then lost Singapore

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:29.110
which was the capital of their power in the
region about a month late2r.

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:33.290
That was it, they never recovered, British
influence in Asia never recovered.

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:35.530
And ultimately what did it lead to?

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:42.820
It led to a desperate defensive clinging on,
a rear guard battle in Malaya, a selling out

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:47.900
of Hong Kong years after it should have happened
when the British would have had some better

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:53.970
bargaining position to defend the rights of
the colony; in essence they threw the colony

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:54.970
to the wolves.

00:22:54.970 --> 00:23:01.030
I fear that the United States is doing its
allies no favor by allowing Israel, for instance,

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:05.490
to ignore the geopolitical changes around
it as if nothing's happening, as if it doesn't

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:08.620
affect their security calculations; that's
an absurdity.

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:13.400
Similarly with Taiwan, which at least shows
some signs of making these hedges; Taiwan

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.890
is clearly opening up economically to the
mainland.

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:21.720
I fear that that kind of relationship with
both South Korea, Taiwan, to some extent with

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:27.170
Japan, is not helping these countries deal
with the century that's to come where the

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:34.090
American guarantee is not a blanket guarantee
and will be, mathematically speaking, just

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:38.350
a diminishing guarantee.

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:39.350
That's it for now.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:45.610
I wanted to open it up to questions and I
hope you'll take a deeper look at the book.

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:46.610
[pause]

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:47.610
[applause]

00:23:47.610 --> 00:24:01.070
&gt;&gt;male #1: So you say that we're two or three
backroom deals away from solving the problems

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:02.070
and the problems are political.

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:04.380
What has changed?

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:07.000
Why doesn't politics work anymore?

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.530
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: That's a very good question.

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:11.590
Why doesn't politics work anymore?

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:19.400
I think the primary obstacle right now is
that there are more than one Republican parties.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:26.530
There are two and possibly different dominant,
not dominant, competing forces within that

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:32.100
party which have prevented the leadership
of that party from being able to enforce what's

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.880
called the whip on key votes.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:42.910
So let's give a simple example: last year
during the run up to the absurd circus that

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:51.480
we called the budget ceiling debates, President
Obama actually conceded a historic point to

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:55.920
the Republicans who had been saying since
the New Deal that the promises we were making

00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:00.640
to our elderly would ultimately come back
to haunt us in terms of being unsustainable

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.700
economically.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:08.200
They were broadly speaking, macro economically
speaking, correct; we have allowed those promises

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.730
to grow beyond our means to fund them.

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.020
Now what did the Republicans do?

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:20.660
Boehner who was the chief negotiator, he's
an old golf playing, country club, Chamber

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:24.960
of Commerce guy, he saw that for what it was.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:29.140
He started making, he started down the road
to having the grand bargain; they started

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:35.920
talking like, it was funny to watch, I covered
the Reagan/Gorbachev talks in Reykjavik in

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.150
Iceland in late, I was very young.

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:44.220
But it was nuclear talks and Reagan and Gorbachev
started talking about things like eliminating

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:49.100
nuclear weapons, you could see the faces of
the aides on both sides, "Oh my God, they

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.100
might do it."

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:54.220
And they started to try to divide the two
leaders and they ultimately did prevent that

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.990
deal from happening.

00:25:55.990 --> 00:26:01.330
And one of the more sentient things Reagan
said before he kind of devolved into Alzheimer's

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:06.470
was that he regretted deeply listening to
his aides in that case 'cause he thought they

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:09.020
could have cut nuclear weapons much more deeply.

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:13.690
I had the same feeling when I saw that Obama/Boehner
thing goin' on particularly on the Republican

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:15.220
side though.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:20.850
It was clear the Republican, the Tea Party
aspect of the Republican side, was not gonna

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:27.520
go for any deal that would ultimately allow
President Obama to claim some kind of victory

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:32.890
or to point back at the moment in his campaign
where he said he was post-partisan.

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:36.220
It was not gonna happen, they weren't gonna
get Clinton-ed.

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:43.680
And that's essentially I think the fear that
the younger, more fiery, nativist, anti-tax

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:48.200
forces on the Republican side feared and it
cost them a historic moment.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:52.750
I mean I think actually the effect would have
been that the Republicans would have something

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:58.890
to run on this year had they been able to
affect some kind of deal that let's say how

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:03.070
do you do this in the backroom, it's very
difficult, certainly no one party can do this

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:06.480
because it'll never be elected again, but
you have to have a deal that essentially says,

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:10.770
"If you were born after 1965 your benefits
will be this, if you're born after 1975, da,

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:15.360
da, da," and then you means test it for the
rich because the rich are easy to kill.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:22.620
And basically, politically speaking, and basically
you have the foundation of an economically

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:27.870
viable program that continues into the future
without cutting everybody out and it doesn't

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:30.550
hit a cliff at some point.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:37.090
But that conversation is not possible and
in some ways this echoes the Israeli/Palestinian

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:38.750
dilemma right now.

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:42.410
The conversation Israel needs to have with
the Palestinians is very difficult right now

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:47.540
too because Hamas and Fatah are a lot like
the Republican party, they hate each other

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.530
as much as they hate the Israelis.

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:54.520
So it's a very difficult foundation for a
cogent negotiation.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.280
I think that's part of it.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:04.010
Deeper problems include the, I would call
it the institutionalization of gerrymandering

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:10.160
in this country where districts that are always
going to be skewed toward one side or another

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.890
have become almost impermeable and uncontestable.

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:18.470
Another good example I think is this mid-term
election.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:22.070
I mean you have to look at the pattern of
mid-term elections here; people just don't

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:24.980
show up at mid-term elections and they're
a disaster.

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:30.820
It's an automatic punt to some radical force
that decides to mobilize during that cycle

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:33.970
and it skews our politics terribly.

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:38.360
Frankly I don't see the argument against doin'
away with 'em and just going to a concerted

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:43.960
system except that would have to win two-thirds
of the states and the Senate etcetera; it'd

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:44.960
be a very difficult thing.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:50.710
But in logical terms the mid-term election
is a disaster; it causes the permanent campaign.

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:55.380
&gt;&gt;female #1: You talked about the cost of
the myth of American exceptionalism and how

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:59.561
that's a real barrier to political discourse
and that's, I mean that's a problem that we

00:28:59.561 --> 00:29:00.670
have in our borders.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:03.670
How do we solve that problem?

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:08.760
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: You know since World War
II there've been a lot of studies about educational

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:15.570
progress mostly focusing on developing nations
in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:22.200
And one of the things that over time has become
very clear is that the most cost effective

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:30.400
way to raise what the economists would call
the human capital of a nation is to target

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:35.880
early childhood and early primary school learning.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:45.400
The test cases are usually taken by macroeconomic
experts to prove this point are the different

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:49.900
ways that post-Colonial Asian countries and
post-Colonial African countries dealt with

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.330
this issue.

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:57.860
Post-Colonial Africa which had no universities,
in some cases no professional class at all

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:02.430
because of the depth of Colonialism there,
threw enormous amounts of money into creating

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:10.580
universities and none, virtually none in relative
terms, into primary education and thus had

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:12.050
lost generations.

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:19.850
You find yourself, I mean I teach undergraduates
okay, you find if there's a five year old

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:25.730
who can't begin to, if you fail to teach a
kid to begin to read at five and the kid still

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:29.800
can't read at ten, that kid's lost forever;
that kid's not gonna catch up in high school,

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.460
not in American public high school especially.

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:36.220
So you need to make sure that the foundation
for learning is there.

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:40.270
I think that's the beginning and these are
not, some of these problems are not back room

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:47.380
deals, some of these problems are generational
changes in both our psychological self image,

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:50.860
the idea that it's okay to kick around the
continent sized country, we don't have to

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:54.110
be everywhere all the time and poking our
nose into everybody's business; there are

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:59.940
other people with bigger, I thought the lead
from behind in Libya was wonderful; it's not

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:03.290
our backyard, right?

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:10.420
It's an asterisk in the international oil
market forces; let the Europeans do it.

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:16.490
We should, unfortunately we have to supply
all the intelligence, all the heavy transport,

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:23.390
and much of the refueling, etcetera, and all
the, seriously they ran out of I think JDAM

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:27.590
bombs at some point and we had to restock
those too, but that's part of the problem.

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:33.260
So I mean I think that, again to get back
to your original point, the domestic priorities

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:40.200
of the country need to start learning from
history instead of allowing political rhetoric

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.980
to drive things.

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:48.340
One more thing I would say about that very
quickly: corporations as you know, probably

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:55.570
Google and Microsoft are at the top of the
list are sitting on gargantuan piles of cash.

00:31:55.570 --> 00:32:00.910
As much as the U.S. household sector needs
to be deleveraged, corporate sector needs

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:06.670
to be re-leveraged; tax policy needs to change
to force incentives on corporate America to

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:10.790
spend that money either on job creation or
something else.

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:18.400
I mean it should be, I'm not a fan of punitive
tax levels but I don't think as currently

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:24.210
structured there is a great deal of incentive
for company that worries about the ultimate

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:29.010
stability of the economy after 2008 to spend
down some of these war chests and that would

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:34.020
be very welcome injections of stimulus into
the economy.

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.020
Yes.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.670
&gt;&gt;male #2: So back to domestic politics.

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:40.580
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: Yeah, it's, I hear ya.

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:45.920
&gt;&gt;male #2: So it used to be in the 50's that
there were some Republicans that were more

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:51.130
liberal and some Democrats who were more conservative
than they were, and we don't have that anymore.

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:56.100
You said something about the institutionalization
of gerrymandering but what I think you mean

00:32:56.100 --> 00:33:01.260
is that we've reached a point in society where
people can now pretty much live wherever they

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:04.720
want and do whatever they want and so they
tend to move to places where there are other

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:05.800
people like them.

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:10.710
And so the Bay Area becomes known as a liberal
place and so it attracts more liberals and

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:15.330
Boulder, Colorado becomes known as a conservative
place and attracts more conservatives and

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:17.079
this gets reflected in the people that we
elect not because the districts are necessarily

00:33:17.079 --> 00:33:25.060
bad, although it might be in some cases, but
because they're just simply more one-sided

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:26.060
to begin with.

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:34.010
And so we wind up electing more polarized
people to Congress and now our Congress is

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:40.540
more polarized than it has been since about
the 1850's when I think a duel once broke

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:46.010
out on the floor of the House of Representatives
between a couple of House members.

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:52.540
And that all ended in a Civil War that killed
two million people and caused death and destruction

00:33:52.540 --> 00:34:00.150
all across our country and I can only wonder
if a similar crisis won't occur simply because

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:06.450
we have the same situation and no way to depolarize.

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:09.649
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: Yeah, I take your point.

00:34:09.649 --> 00:34:12.839
I'm not that gloomy I don't think.

00:34:12.839 --> 00:34:18.639
I think even though I worked for Dr. Doom
I'm not mini-Doom.

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:25.120
I think my sense of it is that when I said
institutionalized gerrymandering I mean that

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:31.179
it's actually engineered by state legislatures
for very partisan reasons and they have been

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:34.440
allowed to get away with it because the Supreme
Court has essentially given them a pass to

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.379
do it.

00:34:36.379 --> 00:34:46.409
I also think that atomization of our media,
largely due to new media, has destroyed some

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:50.919
of the few places where we used to go for
consensual opinion making.

00:34:50.919 --> 00:34:56.470
For instance, the evening news cast which
now seem absurdly vanilla to us and I'm sure

00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:59.880
none of you watch NBC Nightly News or any
of those type of shows.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:07.359
But they had their value, it was a kind of
central town hall where you could disagree

00:35:07.359 --> 00:35:11.289
with the take that was being given but you
would never be spoon fed the same thing every

00:35:11.289 --> 00:35:15.500
day on the thought that this would encourage
you to come back next day.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:21.230
See one of the things I think media has a
lot to answer for is what I call the Al Jazeera,

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:25.839
Roger Ailes theory of media which is, I'm
not sure which one learned from the other,

00:35:25.839 --> 00:35:29.730
I think Ailes learned from Al Jazeera, "If
you tell 'em what they wanna hear they're

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:31.269
gonna come back tomorrow."

00:35:31.269 --> 00:35:36.470
So in Al Jazeera's case it included telling
the truth because their competitors were these

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:40.380
inert state broadcasters who were basically
propaganda mills.

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:46.680
In Fox News' case Roger Ailes, because he's
a fellow traveler of this segment of the audience,

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.440
felt that there's 38 percent of the American
public who can't stand the liberal media;

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:55.460
38 percent's worth it, that's an advertising
budget right there, let's talk to them.

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:57.049
And so they do.

00:35:57.049 --> 00:36:02.740
But imposing that, that was a very alien model
on American media when it was first, when

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:08.869
it first arrived from England frankly and
it's not alien in Britain, I mean the finest

00:36:08.869 --> 00:36:15.650
papers in Britain are very partisan, The Guardian,
The Telegraph, on the two ends of the spectrum;

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:18.869
they don't make any apologies for it.

00:36:18.869 --> 00:36:22.769
But I do believe that that's another part
of what's happened is that we have this echo

00:36:22.769 --> 00:36:29.660
chamber that we've created with all the benefits
that I embrace with the Internet and social

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:34.859
media, it's also doing damage to social cohesion
I think.

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:35.859
[pause]

00:36:35.859 --> 00:36:42.599
&gt;&gt;male #3: You spoke about domestic policy
and human capital and preschool education,

00:36:42.599 --> 00:36:50.720
and my wife works in, she's a professor and
she's seeing money just rain out of college

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:55.769
institutions and simultaneously a tremendous
amount of money going towards the incarceration

00:36:55.769 --> 00:36:57.599
of people in the United States.

00:36:57.599 --> 00:37:03.059
And I'm wondering if you could speak about
the human capital and debt in human capital

00:37:03.059 --> 00:37:06.150
in relationship to incarceration.

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:15.470
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: Yeah, I mean it gets very
creepily impersonal when we start saying human

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:22.720
capital, but it is true that every human being
that either dies an early death or is encouraged

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:27.950
to or forced to work outside the mainstream
economy in some kind of black market or criminal

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:33.529
enterprise or if they're felons and they lose
the right to vote and the right to access

00:37:33.529 --> 00:37:38.789
usually that also goes hand in hand with access
to decent jobs because no one wants to hire

00:37:38.789 --> 00:37:39.789
a felon.

00:37:39.789 --> 00:37:44.960
These are enormously important factors in
economic growth; you lose a unit of economic

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:51.350
productivity in economic terms for the life
of that person and yet you still have to support

00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:55.960
that person at a public hospital, you still
have to educate their children, I mean it's

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:58.049
a real loss to society.

00:37:58.049 --> 00:38:05.170
And again I go back to early childhood, I
mean things that existed only five to ten

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:12.009
years ago, Head Start programs, free breakfast
in schools in poor areas for kids, these things

00:38:12.009 --> 00:38:15.490
have been eviscerated, they're just not there
anymore.

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:24.029
And to make the kind of priority decisions
we've made are indefensible to me given the

00:38:24.029 --> 00:38:28.630
data that exists on the different, and again
I say Africa and Asia, Asia I didn't finish

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:29.760
that thought maybe.

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:34.460
Asia put a lot of its money into primary and
secondary schooling and look what happened

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:36.140
to Asia.

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:39.880
Interestingly, and I'm talkin' the company
line now but I'm doin' it 'cause I drank that

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:45.269
Kool-Aid, I believe this, Africa will grow
faster than any continent in the world over

00:38:45.269 --> 00:38:50.549
the next 10 years in part because this has
reversed, this pattern has reversed.

00:38:50.549 --> 00:38:56.960
Africa has a tier of about 12 to 13 nations
including some of the largest ones like Nigeria

00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:04.029
and Kenya that are growing at seven to eight
percent a year and a lot of improvement; there's

00:39:04.029 --> 00:39:05.799
tons of room for improvement too.

00:39:05.799 --> 00:39:10.099
But if you look at where Asia was in 1980
and you look at where Africa is today there's

00:39:10.099 --> 00:39:16.670
some interesting parallels and it's being
noticed not just by NGO's and the World Bank

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:22.480
and the IMF, but by China and Brazil and India's
sovereign wealth funds and by big Americana

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:26.800
and British and European capitalists who are
pouring money into projects they never would

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.390
have looked at before.

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:29.740
So it's a very interesting story.

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:30.740
Yes.

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:34.340
&gt;&gt;male #4: I'm gonna keep you ping ponging
between domestic and international things

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:35.340
–

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:36.340
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: [chuckles]

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:37.340
&gt;&gt;male #4: I guess.

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.340
But --

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:39.340
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: It's my fault actually so.

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:43.349
&gt;&gt;male #4: on the international front, I walked
in a little late so I don't know if you talked

00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:46.609
about this already, but you talked about how
we're overreached and it would be good if

00:39:46.609 --> 00:39:50.450
we were thinking about how unwind things in
a controlled manner.

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:53.240
Why do you think we don't do that?

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:57.920
Like is that inertia, is that vested interests
that wanna keep things the way they are?

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.950
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: No this is the psychological
part of the story.

00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:04.849
We are exceptional remember; so being exceptionally
in denial is part of that.

00:40:04.849 --> 00:40:09.529
&gt;&gt;male #4: Right, so if we're too proud to
retract how do we fix that?

00:40:09.529 --> 00:40:14.339
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: Again I hate to say this
but failure is a wonderful teacher.

00:40:14.339 --> 00:40:18.730
And we didn't learn from Georgia 'cause it's
not relevant enough; we didn't learn from

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:23.970
Iraq 'cause everybody just dumps on George
W. Bush now, it's all him.

00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:26.920
Interestingly something like 60 percent of
the country was in favor of that war.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:30.720
If you ask somebody today, at a room full
of Americans, you think 60 percent of the

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.119
hands are gonna go up?

00:40:32.119 --> 00:40:37.119
There's nothing worse than being duped, people
hate that.

00:40:37.119 --> 00:40:43.809
We just haven't had our comeuppance frankly
and I hope we never do, but we will ultimately

00:40:43.809 --> 00:40:50.640
if we continue to sleepwalk in the direction
of we're still the hegemon, we're still setting

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:56.490
the agendas, we're able to force results that
are beneficial to us and not beneficial to

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:57.839
others; these things are gonna come unwound.

00:40:57.839 --> 00:41:00.990
&gt;&gt;male #4: So just from my understanding of
history, where this has happened in the past

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:08.319
it hasn't really been good for those countries,
like no country has ever failed on a massive

00:41:08.319 --> 00:41:13.832
scale and bounced back in any reasonable timeline
or reasonable way that I can think of.

00:41:13.832 --> 00:41:16.749
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: Yeah, I mean well the Russians
claim that they're doing it.

00:41:16.749 --> 00:41:17.749
[chuckles]

00:41:17.749 --> 00:41:19.210
&gt;&gt;male #4: After 20 or 30 very, very painful
years.

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:21.240
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: Yeah, and that's the thing
the pain is there --

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:23.450
&gt;&gt;male #4: And China took centuries.

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:27.180
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: I had a, or you could argue
the Japanese maybe --

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:28.180
&gt;&gt;male #4: Right.

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:31.930
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: but that's another again,
making these types of analogies they're such

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:37.510
eccentricities of economics and regional,
geographical, and demographic stuff and cultural

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:39.329
issues, it's very difficult.

00:41:39.329 --> 00:41:44.210
But I would say I got a question last night,
or two nights ago at Seattle World Affairs

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:48.710
Council along these lines offering the idea
that the British were a good example of how

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:52.480
it's done right and the person had a suspiciously
British accent.

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:53.480
[laughter]

00:41:53.480 --> 00:42:02.339
And just to take that example, well the British
first of all for 15 to 20 years after World

00:42:02.339 --> 00:42:08.019
War II were still on rations, food rations,
I mean there were some food rations in the

00:42:08.019 --> 00:42:10.450
early 60's.

00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:14.849
They de-industrialized at an enormous pace
and it still shows up in the relative strength

00:42:14.849 --> 00:42:21.910
of British industry which was once obviously
the king and not that long ago in many industries;

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:26.170
manufacturing's about eight percent of British
GDP, that's unbelievably low.

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:29.170
In the United States it's 12 percent.

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:33.690
And 12 percent, and again these are relative
terms, 12 percent in the United States is

00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:40.109
about five Great Britain's, so it's a huge
sector compared to what's happened to Britain.

00:42:40.109 --> 00:42:46.269
On top of that if you look around the world
at the problems that haunted the 20th century

00:42:46.269 --> 00:42:51.579
and now I don't wanna sound like my father's
son, he was born in Ireland and he was no

00:42:51.579 --> 00:42:57.390
fan of anything British, but I worked at the
BBC and I rejected that nonsense.

00:42:57.390 --> 00:43:02.630
But if you look around the world in the 20th
century at South Africa, at the problems in

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:10.319
Northern Ireland, at Palestine in particular,
Kashmir, a lot of these things were the result

00:43:10.319 --> 00:43:14.799
of the unraveling in an uncontrolled manner
of an empire that was arrogant enough to think

00:43:14.799 --> 00:43:16.099
they could keep it all together.

00:43:16.099 --> 00:43:24.519
They left time bombs everywhere, not even
getting into Africa; absolutely arbitrarily

00:43:24.519 --> 00:43:29.599
drawn borders that still haunt those countries.

00:43:29.599 --> 00:43:37.130
Nigeria should be on paper a super power and
a brick; it may well get there but it has

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:43.519
really difficult ethnic and cultural problems,
religious divide.

00:43:43.519 --> 00:43:50.529
And that is very much a part of the British
creation of that particular colony.

00:43:50.529 --> 00:43:56.730
So I think to argue that this is doable in
an uncontrolled way and then it'll all work

00:43:56.730 --> 00:43:57.990
out is kinda silly.

00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:04.530
[chuckles] And I think the United States just
doesn't look at itself as affected by things

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:09.140
like gravity and things like history.

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:13.609
We are exceptional, we float above these things
because, some part of our electorate thinks

00:44:13.609 --> 00:44:18.690
it's because God has ordained us to be so
and others just think that, "Well we are the

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:25.080
ultimate expression of science and knowledge
and democracy and therefore clearly, in evolutionary

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:26.990
terms, we're destined to be that."

00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:32.140
So whichever way you get there a great number
of us, and a shocking number of the smart

00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:35.099
ones, think this and I just don't feel that.

00:44:35.099 --> 00:44:37.249
I feel like that gravity exists.

00:44:37.249 --> 00:44:41.470
I'm getting older it reminds me every day.

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:43.020
[laughter]

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:44.559
[pause]

00:44:44.559 --> 00:44:46.109
Yes.

00:44:46.109 --> 00:44:58.710
&gt;&gt;male #5: This may sound a little flippant
a way of phrasing but is the average IQ of

00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:00.279
this country decreasing?

00:45:00.279 --> 00:45:03.980
Or put another way, why aren't the smart people
in charge anymore?

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:05.450
Why don't the rest of us listen to smart people
like who write these books?

00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:06.450
Do we resent the smart people [inaudible]?

00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:10.770
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: There's a couple of different
currents, I'm gettin' a little out of my depth

00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:14.859
here talkin' about smart people, but there
are a few currents at work here.

00:45:14.859 --> 00:45:22.770
I think there's a very profound anti-intellectualism
that took hold during the years prior to Ronald

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:26.549
Reagan's election that really kind of got
super charged during the 80's.

00:45:26.549 --> 00:45:34.160
Whereas, but it was really prevalent also
in the Democratic party during the 60's where

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:39.839
pointy-headed liberals were dismissed, the
far left, the people who don't like the Viet

00:45:39.839 --> 00:45:45.349
Nam War were dismissed by the Johnson wing
and the Humphrey wing, Humphrey that's unfair,

00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:48.279
Johnson of the Democratic Party.

00:45:48.279 --> 00:45:54.260
I think though that was really, this long
period in the wilderness that the Republican

00:45:54.260 --> 00:46:02.430
Party spent after Roosevelt's electoral victory,
their real victory during that long period

00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:09.890
up until Richard Nixon's election was Dwight
Eisenhower who was about as non-partisan a

00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:12.010
Republican or Democrat as you'll ever see.

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:17.039
I mean he had basically been the man who saved
humanity as far as that generation was concerned;

00:46:17.039 --> 00:46:23.040
he was the General who beat Hitler and he
wasn't particularly ideological.

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:31.380
So I think that what you see in the intellectual
impact, the impact of that history has had

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:35.900
on the Republican party is that it has empowered
ignorance in a lot of ways.

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:40.150
And I always used to joke that the eleventh
Bill of Right is the right to be ignorant,

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:44.040
it's the one we exercise the most freely here.

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:49.109
But it is, you're allowed to be completely
stupid here and say things, "It's my right

00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:50.970
to say that, isn't it?"

00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:54.240
It's very hard to cross a line in this country
anymore.

00:46:54.240 --> 00:47:03.269
The other side I think though is you get into
the very scary territory of the bell curve

00:47:03.269 --> 00:47:10.190
where some ideological figures will argue
that actually it's immigration that is deteriorating

00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:16.259
our intellectual base, or it's an attack on
the what used to be thought of as the cultural

00:47:16.259 --> 00:47:24.480
norms in the United States which is the kind
of culture war take on it, or the increasing

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:30.480
self perpetuation of the elite left or right
in the United States to the detriment of the

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:34.390
middle class and below; that I actually do
believe is true.

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:39.930
And I wish I had, I couldn't find the chart
that I saw the other day, I was gonna put

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:48.160
it up here, but it is a relatively uncontroversial
fact that since about 1960 the middle classes

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:54.059
in this country have lost ground versus the
not even the one percent, that's just a slogan,

00:47:54.059 --> 00:47:57.900
the one percent of course, I think that would
be true anywhere, but they've lost ground

00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:05.670
vis-a-vis those who make over $200,000 a year,
who I don't regard as middle class I'm sorry,

00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:07.690
that's a pretty good salary.

00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:12.349
Everybody here seems to think they're middle
class in this country which is a great, both

00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:16.460
a victory for democracy, but it's an absurdity
too.

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:23.289
I think, the way I describe this I think the
middle class has had its boiling frog moment

00:48:23.289 --> 00:48:28.619
in this latest financial crisis because the
bubble economy first of the tech boom and

00:48:28.619 --> 00:48:37.880
then of the real estate bubble, it absolutely
shielded from view the extent to which actual,

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:43.190
real income and real disposable income for
hard working two income families had continued

00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:48.990
to decline during this period while the top
end had skyrocketed and taxes for those people

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:50.470
came way down.

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:56.599
And this was all supposed to be redistributed
in a magical trickle and that magical trickle

00:48:56.599 --> 00:49:02.099
I can imagine, I've seen some fountains like
that in swimming pools, it doesn't happen.

00:49:02.099 --> 00:49:06.489
I just don't see it happening and I think
that the middle class is waking up to that

00:49:06.489 --> 00:49:10.869
and I think that is what you're seeing in
the Tea Party if you take your question and

00:49:10.869 --> 00:49:18.480
then apply that to the anger that it legitimately
engenders, the Tea Party is essentially angry

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:25.789
about that; they're not expressing it intelligently
but neither frankly is Occupy Wall Street.

00:49:25.789 --> 00:49:29.900
They're angry at something very similar and
their prescriptions are absurd.

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:36.829
They're wonderful theater and they're great
kids I met a lot of them, but there's no viable

00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:38.599
prescription there for fixing any of it.

00:49:38.599 --> 00:49:44.099
&gt;&gt;male #6: So I first of all have sort of
a comment on something, the collapse of the

00:49:44.099 --> 00:49:47.369
British Empire saying that a lot of places
failed.

00:49:47.369 --> 00:49:48.400
I'm not British just in case --

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:49.400
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: That's alright.

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:50.400
[laughter]

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:51.400
I love the British.

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:57.299
&gt;&gt;male #6: but a number of places I think
kind of pulled out and things are pretty bad

00:49:57.299 --> 00:49:58.299
there.

00:49:58.299 --> 00:50:00.960
On the other hand, on the other side of the
equation there's not a lot of countries where

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:05.260
they've also pulled out on good terms and
those countries are very stable.

00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:09.759
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: Give me a few examples, I'd
like to, just so we're on the same page.

00:50:09.759 --> 00:50:11.069
&gt;&gt;male #6: Australia, New Zealand, Canada.

00:50:11.069 --> 00:50:12.069
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: Yeah.

00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:13.069
&gt;&gt;male #6: Um --

00:50:13.069 --> 00:50:14.849
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: But these are plantations.

00:50:14.849 --> 00:50:16.289
[laughter]

00:50:16.289 --> 00:50:20.470
I mean in the classical sense of the word
the way that Northern Ireland was a Protestant

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:27.680
plantation and we are a, to some extent, a
plantation; the Native population was either

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.970
denuded or not there.

00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:31.530
&gt;&gt;male #6: Yeah, yeah the Natives are kind
of wiped out so it looks like transplanting

00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:36.960
a whole, the whole culture [inaudible] en
masse.

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:40.900
I'm just kind of pointing out that it's just
sort of, it's kind of gone both ways and it

00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:41.900
depended on sort of what --

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:43.420
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: Yeah, I agree with that.

00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:48.089
&gt;&gt;male #6: the situation they're left with--
and to me it seems that the differences, not

00:50:48.089 --> 00:50:52.809
just the cultures, but also the intent when
they left.

00:50:52.809 --> 00:51:01.490
Some places they left sort of like Earl Grey
here we've got nothing more we can strip mine

00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:05.489
in the countries and other places, "Well we
wanna leave people who will like us in the

00:51:05.489 --> 00:51:08.259
future, people like us."

00:51:08.259 --> 00:51:10.840
That's just kind of comment.

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:16.430
The question I had was with Africa you're
saying you think that it's gonna grow there.

00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:17.430
Are they improving their primary/secondary
education?

00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:18.430
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: In Africa?

00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:19.430
&gt;&gt;male #6: Yeah.

00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:20.430
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: Yes they are actually.

00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:21.430
&gt;&gt;male #6: Okay so they're finally making
that switch?

00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:22.430
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: Yes.

00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:25.099
And this is a bit of a counter intuitive opinion
on my part but I think one of the reasons

00:51:25.099 --> 00:51:33.270
that that has happened is because, well the
research is beginning to dawn on even the

00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:37.819
most doctrinaire social engineers at the World
Bank and IMF that there are certain things

00:51:37.819 --> 00:51:40.420
that work some places that don't work others.

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:45.630
The other thing though, and more profound
thing I think, is the existence now of alternative

00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:50.241
ways for these countries to fund projects;
they don't have to go to the IMF and the World

00:51:50.241 --> 00:51:55.839
Bank or expect aid from Europe, the EU, or
the United States to cover things.

00:51:55.839 --> 00:52:01.749
There are sovereign wealth funds and that
has been an enormous change, not always for

00:52:01.749 --> 00:52:03.170
the good.

00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:07.499
And the backlash will, it's gonna be a process
of learning.

00:52:07.499 --> 00:52:14.170
China's investments, for instance, in Zambia
were done under terrible terms for Zambia

00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:18.319
in terms of negotiating terms 'cause Zambia
was getting rolled essentially.

00:52:18.319 --> 00:52:22.519
But China put a lot of money into Zambia,
built a lot of infrastructure, but did it

00:52:22.519 --> 00:52:24.109
with Chinese labor.

00:52:24.109 --> 00:52:29.960
And ultimately the Zambians elected an anti-Chinese
[chuckles] president recently who has abrogated

00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:35.720
some of the terms of those agreements and
so China is feeling the pain of having over

00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:36.940
played its hand.

00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:42.799
So I think this is gonna be a process that
as these governments mature and their economies

00:52:42.799 --> 00:52:47.630
mature, and this is an important fact too,
a lot of this we tend to think of Africa as

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:51.819
an extractive play, these are just commodity
plays, they have either got diamonds or gold

00:52:51.819 --> 00:52:53.920
or bauxite or oil.

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:59.559
But an interesting fact is that the Nigerian
economy today is only 18 percent of GDP is

00:52:59.559 --> 00:53:03.640
the oil industry and that's a big change from
the 1960's.

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:10.380
They have a very fast growing consumer and
manufacturing sectors, they've got a very

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:16.559
surprisingly cogent and reforming banking
sector even though all of us have gotten "Mrs.

00:53:16.559 --> 00:53:18.700
Sanai Ebacha's" email.

00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:22.829
That's a branding problem that will be with
Nigeria for a long time just as the genocide

00:53:22.829 --> 00:53:28.529
in Rwanda will haunt them for years not only
in the kind of moral sense but in terms of

00:53:28.529 --> 00:53:34.500
its ability to go into the world and be branded
something other than the site of a genocide.

00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:39.940
This is something I thought I'd bring up here
actually: I was talking to a Rwandan diplomat

00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:45.099
in Washington a few weeks ago and he said,
"Michael how do I get somebody to write about

00:53:45.099 --> 00:53:48.319
Rwanda when it's not about the genocide?"

00:53:48.319 --> 00:53:53.580
And this is a problem that I'm glad Rwanda
finally has, they've moved on and they're

00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:59.540
growing and they have a pretty good stable
economy, governance issues but -- And I said,

00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:03.900
"Well let me do something," and I looked,
I put my iPhone up and I typed Rwanda and

00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:09.740
Google very helpfully suggested, before I
even got to the D, "Rwanda Genocide."

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:12.369
[laughs] Now that's a branding issue.

00:54:12.369 --> 00:54:15.720
I don't know whether they need to appeal directly
to you guys, but I thought that was kind of

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:16.720
interesting.

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:17.720
[laughter]

00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:18.720
Yes.

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:23.509
&gt;&gt;male #7: If we continue to that gravity
doesn't apply to us and we're arrogant and

00:54:23.509 --> 00:54:29.160
sort of missing opportunities to right the
ship if you will, if after the Great Recession

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:35.329
the backroom deal falls apart and we reject
things like Simpson-Bowles that are bipartisan,

00:54:35.329 --> 00:54:39.950
your book's called THE RECKONING, are we going
to boil like the frog or is there is scenario

00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:50.770
in which you see that could happen to us that
there's change for the good and we get out

00:54:50.770 --> 00:54:51.770
of this somehow, we get off the decline?

00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:54.900
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: Well there are, when you
talk about the future you often find in the

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:58.410
future that you were wrong and I hope not
to be that person.

00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:03.029
But so let's take the most conservative possible
view of the United States.

00:55:03.029 --> 00:55:07.499
Let's say the United States miraculously grows
at Mitt Romney's four percent a year over

00:55:07.499 --> 00:55:13.710
the next three decades; we'd be astoundingly
exceptional.

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:18.849
And let's say that China either implodes of
its own internal contradictions, which is

00:55:18.849 --> 00:55:27.289
not a completely impossible scenario, or the
demands of labor, environmental distress,

00:55:27.289 --> 00:55:32.859
and transportation costs ultimately diminish
the value of putting plants there to the extent

00:55:32.859 --> 00:55:37.309
that China just becomes another big manufacturing
power and is not overwhelmingly advantaged

00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:44.180
and essentially their currency begins to float
and things -- all of those things can help

00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:45.369
balance the world a bit.

00:55:45.369 --> 00:55:49.040
I mean I don't think manufacturing in the
United States is dead, I think some of the

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:58.770
factors I just cited will help keep the type
of manufacturing that we're good at, aerospace,

00:55:58.770 --> 00:56:05.849
high end environmental technology, technology
at large, that type of manufacturing is going

00:56:05.849 --> 00:56:11.229
to be thriving here I think because of all
the factors I just said.

00:56:11.229 --> 00:56:17.849
The reckoning essentially though is the moment
when if we have not come to terms with the

00:56:17.849 --> 00:56:23.240
structural, unsustainable deficit spending
that we have now, and it's really not the

00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:28.339
deficit it's the national debt, before the
rest of the world creates a vehicle for their

00:56:28.339 --> 00:56:34.500
sovereign wealth funds to invest in to rival
the Treasury Bill, because that's what's keeping

00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:36.019
us alive right now.

00:56:36.019 --> 00:56:40.680
The T-Bill is a magical thing because we have
two oceans on either side of us and because

00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:46.499
we have a relatively good, we had a perfect
record until last year, a relatively good

00:56:46.499 --> 00:56:52.490
record of honoring our debts this is the place
to park enormous amounts of money when you

00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:56.049
don't know quite what do with 'em because
if you bring 'em home you'll cause unbelievable

00:56:56.049 --> 00:56:57.349
inflation.

00:56:57.349 --> 00:57:04.309
So that's how we are able to borrow enormous
sums of money for our deficits.

00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:09.160
After last year we were downgraded quite rightfully;
the markets didn't react because they knew

00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:11.410
there was no alternative for these countries.

00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:17.650
But you gotta know that in Kuala Lumpur and
Beijing and even Berlin and London there are

00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:22.180
people figuring out what that alternative
is, it's not clearly the Euro.

00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:28.830
But there is a thing called the, I'm spacing
it now, there are other vehicles that could

00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:33.989
potentially, without actually raising another
country's currency to that level, there are

00:57:33.989 --> 00:57:40.329
other vehicles that could serve as global
reserve currencies.

00:57:40.329 --> 00:57:45.520
And I think you're gonna see as these countries
emerge a great appetite because of the way

00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:50.779
we've conducted our monetary and fiscal policies
here, a great appetite for doing that and

00:57:50.779 --> 00:57:52.640
that's when the reckoning happens.

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:54.580
What does that mean?

00:57:54.580 --> 00:58:01.599
If that happens and if T-Bills suddenly cannot
retain their advantage, the cost of our borrowing

00:58:01.599 --> 00:58:03.670
begins to rise.

00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:09.490
Currently we spend about as much on our interest
as we spend to fund the U.S. Navy every year,

00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:11.499
that's the size of the interest payment now.

00:58:11.499 --> 00:58:19.309
If it were to go two or three points up you're
getting at the good credit card rate levels

00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:23.019
at that point, you've got a problem because
we can't pay that down.

00:58:23.019 --> 00:58:26.739
It becomes the size of the Pentagon's budget.

00:58:26.739 --> 00:58:31.529
And this gets worse, the global markets tend
to follow the herd.

00:58:31.529 --> 00:58:37.470
We could see a situation where we begin as
Greece and Portugal did and as Spain and Italy

00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:43.109
may, we being to lose control of our economic
sovereignty and the decisions about whether

00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:46.810
to build a bridge or whether to build a new
class of aircraft carriers or whether to invest

00:58:46.810 --> 00:58:52.680
in education versus some scientific research
become, there are other people at the table

00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:56.849
now making those 'cause they say, "No, no,
no pay the debts first."

00:58:56.849 --> 00:59:01.410
And we've been doing that for years to countries
all over the world through our block on the

00:59:01.410 --> 00:59:04.510
IMF and World Bank; it could be quite a comeuppance
for us.

00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:10.650
And I think that's a very dark and minority
scenario, I don't think we'll allow it to

00:59:10.650 --> 00:59:16.460
get there but it's not impossible and it certainly
-- a great example of this historically when

00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:24.339
the Israelis, the French, and the British
attacked Suez in 1956 Eisenhower was in office.

00:59:24.339 --> 00:59:28.390
He was pissed off for a variety of reasons:
one the Hungarian rising was going on and

00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:33.099
he had other things to do and he wasn't told
about it, number two.

00:59:33.099 --> 00:59:37.420
And so he immediately called the British and
he said, "We're gonna take all our money out

00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:40.789
of Pound Sterling tomorrow."

00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:44.479
It's over for the British if they do that
and rather than see that happen, now this

00:59:44.479 --> 00:59:51.200
is there are very few written pieces of evidence
to suggest this happened but there are plenty

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:56.089
of historical pieces of evidence that paint
that picture, essentially the British pulled

00:59:56.089 --> 01:00:00.760
out the next day, the war was over and Egypt
kept the Canal.

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:03.920
That's essentially what happened there.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:08.559
And that high type of leverage has been used
in the past against French, against the Germans,

01:00:08.559 --> 01:00:14.470
and it will be used against us ultimately
if we're not realistic about this.

01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:19.779
And again I don't think these are unsolvable
problem, I think they are but it requires

01:00:19.779 --> 01:00:26.349
a mea culpa from both parties and a decision
to take on the political heat together to

01:00:26.349 --> 01:00:28.150
fix this.

01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:30.070
Interestingly it's happening in Italy right
now.

01:00:30.070 --> 01:00:31.070
What do they have?

01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:36.950
They have a government, a non-partisan government,
imagine that here, who would you appoint?

01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:42.099
I think Sergey Brin would be out because of
his birth but there would be some kind of

01:00:42.099 --> 01:00:45.749
panel of elder types who would clean this
mess up.

01:00:45.749 --> 01:00:49.400
Felix Rohatyn did it for New York City in
the 70's.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:53.989
I don't wanna get there, we wanna elect a
government, there's beauty in democracy, but

01:00:53.989 --> 01:00:55.220
we need it to work.

01:00:55.220 --> 01:01:00.809
&gt;&gt;male #4: I don't know how much more time
we have but one more question I'd like to

01:01:00.809 --> 01:01:01.809
ask.

01:01:01.809 --> 01:01:07.039
What's your take on the fact that we seem
to have conflicting economic theories and

01:01:07.039 --> 01:01:12.759
nobody will admit that they're right or wrong
in this country to the extent of you've got

01:01:12.759 --> 01:01:16.799
both the Ron Paulians of the world who seem
to be getting this bigger mass of people who

01:01:16.799 --> 01:01:18.000
say, "Oh we should go back on a gold standard."

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.829
And there's another class of people that says,
"What are you insane, like this was disproven

01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:23.079
80 years ago."

01:01:23.079 --> 01:01:28.359
And if we can't even get agreement over this
sorts of things how do we figure out some

01:01:28.359 --> 01:01:30.789
of these international economic problems like
this?

01:01:30.789 --> 01:01:37.300
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: Well I think, not to be redundant,
but I think early childhood education would

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:39.009
be a good start.

01:01:39.009 --> 01:01:44.049
I think one of the problems is that the average
person has over the years hoped that they're

01:01:44.049 --> 01:01:53.880
electing people who have some clue about economics
and are on their behalf making educated decisions

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:54.880
about things like this.

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:58.999
And unfortunately that seems to be less and
less true in part because the world is much

01:01:58.999 --> 01:02:03.750
more complicated than it used to be and a
legal education doesn't prepare you for macroeconomic

01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:05.210
dilemmas.

01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:09.289
And most of our Congressmen and even our Presidents
are Yale trained lawyers.

01:02:09.289 --> 01:02:14.119
Let's face it the Presidents tend to be Yale
or Harvard lawyers, the Congressmen tend to

01:02:14.119 --> 01:02:20.029
be either small businessmen, which is at least
some brush with reality, or they're lawyers.

01:02:20.029 --> 01:02:25.119
And God I love lawyers but it doesn't give
you a rounded world view, you have to go get

01:02:25.119 --> 01:02:26.710
that separately.

01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:30.069
So I think part of the problem is education.

01:02:30.069 --> 01:02:37.519
The other part though I really believe is
that economics is not a science okay?

01:02:37.519 --> 01:02:43.950
I came up through journalism; journalism is
not a profession it's a trade, it's like landscaping.

01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:47.579
You can learn it best by hangin' around with
people who do it well.

01:02:47.579 --> 01:02:52.340
Yes you can go to Columbia J School; I was
a fellow there, it's wonderful, but it's a

01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:57.829
luxury, it's a luxury item, it's a networking
club for people who wanna meet important editors

01:02:57.829 --> 01:03:00.829
and get jobs after their year at Columbia
J School.

01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:05.789
I'm not sure other than the wonderful philosophical
opportunity to discuss it, I'm not sure it

01:03:05.789 --> 01:03:11.749
really is teaching you how to be a journalist,
that's a very kind of trade oriented thing.

01:03:11.749 --> 01:03:18.880
Similarly I think that theory in economics
is a very malleable thing, it's a debate more

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:22.499
than a profession, more than a science sorry,
a debate more than a science.

01:03:22.499 --> 01:03:32.009
And the Right has been tremendously good at
creating a kind of faith based economics that

01:03:32.009 --> 01:03:43.579
is laden in inspiring liberty rooted dogma;
that to take on is to challenge some of the

01:03:43.579 --> 01:03:46.910
basic narrative of the United States itself.

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:52.549
And that has created a school of American
economics that I think feels as though they

01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:59.229
are pursuing and advancing a higher cause
by distorting and by simplifying to the point

01:03:59.229 --> 01:04:03.660
what the average person thinks that tax cuts
will ultimately, for the rich, will ultimately

01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:07.680
benefit them though they will never get anywhere
near that bracket.

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:10.470
So I really feel that that's true.

01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:22.390
On the other side doctrinaire Keynesian economics
is also often akin to a religion and can be

01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:29.810
very, very constraining, though I'd say it's
been less wrong than, to pick on somebody,

01:04:29.810 --> 01:04:30.910
John Taylor of Stanford.

01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:32.260
That's where I would be on that.

01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:33.260
[pause]

01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:34.719
&gt;&gt;Cliff: That was a great speech.

01:04:34.719 --> 01:04:37.200
Thank you for stopping by Michael.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:39.259
&gt;&gt;Michael Moran: Well thanks everybody.

01:04:39.259 --> 01:04:39.669
[applause]
