Building Games for

00:06:14.023 --> 00:06:16.023
the Google Assistant,

00:06:24.768 --> 00:06:27.762
May 10, 2018.  

00:17:47.008 --> 00:17:49.008
Building Games for

00:18:08.871 --> 00:18:10.871
Building Games for Google

Building Games for Google 
Assistant

00:29:00.466 --> 00:29:02.466
good morning, everyone!

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:07.241
Thank you for coming so bright 
and early at this 8:30 and thank

00:29:07.242 --> 00:29:11.731
you for those watching along.
  We're so excited to have you 

00:29:11.732 --> 00:29:13.732
here 

00:29:15.064 --> 00:29:17.064
because in the next 40 minutes 
you will 

00:29:19.126 --> 00:29:21.587
be experts in Building Games for
Google Assistant.  We'll discuss

00:29:21.588 --> 00:29:24.235
why we are serious about Play 
and why you should be too.

00:29:27.934 --> 00:29:29.560
And who is excited to play these
games, and we'll get into tips 

00:29:29.561 --> 00:29:33.647
of how, with words, Pixels, 
sounds, the code to make it 

00:29:33.648 --> 00:29:35.648
happen.

00:29:36.714 --> 00:29:38.148
Lastly, what you can do to be 
found on the Google Assistant.

00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:41.612
  Before I go any further, I'll 
introduce myself, I'm Thushan 

00:29:43.442 --> 00:29:45.878
Amarasiriwardena, I'm a product 
manager for fun and delight on 

00:29:45.879 --> 00:29:47.879
the Google Assistant.

00:29:49.734 --> 00:29:52.584
I'm joined by Andy, he's also 
fun, he's our team's creative 

00:29:52.585 --> 00:29:54.585
lead.

00:29:56.047 --> 00:29:58.937
Ralfi, he's our product manager 
on dialogue flow.  While he 

00:29:58.938 --> 00:30:00.938
doesn't have fun in the 

00:30:02.821 --> 00:30:04.821
title, I guarantee to you he's 
fun!

00:30:07.117 --> 00:30:09.117
We're a really big team of 
writers, 

00:30:10.382 --> 00:30:12.382
engineers,  designers, sound 
engineers 

00:30:14.492 --> 00:30:16.492
that drive the personality and 
delight of the Google Assistant.

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.198
This team crafts how we respond 
to lots of queries like tell me 

00:30:20.199 --> 00:30:24.498
a joke to how are you doing and 
surprisingly popular one, which 

00:30:24.499 --> 00:30:28.173
is hey,  Google, I love you!  
People say that!

00:30:30.211 --> 00:30:32.099
The reason we do this, you know,
you think of the Google 

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.100
Assistant, everyone 

00:30:35.387 --> 00:30:36.199
thinks it is about getting 
things done and that's 

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.200
absolutely true.

00:30:39.668 --> 00:30:42.107
We're here to make your life 
easier, but we're also here to 

00:30:42.108 --> 00:30:44.108
make it a lot 

00:30:46.252 --> 00:30:48.516
more fun too and that's our 
slogan for the team.

00:30:53.855 --> 00:30:57.927
We build apps like trivia game 
called Are you Feeling  Lucky.  

00:30:57.928 --> 00:30:59.556
The reason we do this, is that 
we can learn how to make the 

00:30:59.557 --> 00:31:04.495
games and make sure that the 
APIs that you need exist so it 

00:31:04.496 --> 00:31:06.496
that you can go build them.

00:31:08.706 --> 00:31:10.328
We also build templates and we 
worked with buzz feed recently 

00:31:10.329 --> 00:31:15.669
to bring them on board to the 
Google Assistant and where you 

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:17.506
can find out what dessert -- all
of the fun quizzes they have on 

00:31:17.507 --> 00:31:19.507
the site, 

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:22.570
now you can play through the 
Google Assistant.

00:31:25.458 --> 00:31:27.458
We also work with awesome 
startups 

00:31:29.566 --> 00:31:31.566
like Volley that made a game 
called King 

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:34.842
for a Day, one of the first that
run on the Smart Displays you 

00:31:34.843 --> 00:31:39.155
have seen around and we're 
excited to show you those apps. 

00:31:39.156 --> 00:31:42.042
For example, they run on the 
smart display right here and 

00:31:42.043 --> 00:31:44.043
they soon will be 

00:31:47.143 --> 00:31:48.769
running on phones and TVs.  We 
have tried to make it easy for 

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:53.237
you.  Rest assured, all of the 
awesome Google actions you have 

00:31:53.238 --> 00:31:58.587
built can get upgraded with 
ease, with technologies that 

00:31:58.588 --> 00:32:00.634
you're familiar with, HDML5 to 
make that happen.

00:32:04.914 --> 00:32:07.377
I'm sure many of you are like us
where when you were a kid you 

00:32:07.378 --> 00:32:09.378
wanted a talking robot.

00:32:12.634 --> 00:32:14.634
I always wanted Optimus 
capitol-based prime and now we 

00:32:17.124 --> 00:32:19.124
have

00:32:20.493 --> 00:32:21.729
S prime and now we have it, 
Google Assistant.  That's good 

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:23.730
for us.  This is a favorite 
chart.

00:32:26.421 --> 00:32:28.421
Each curve is the adoption curve
of new technologies over time.

00:32:31.143 --> 00:32:33.580
As you see, each one gets 
sharper and has higher 

00:32:33.581 --> 00:32:38.490
adaptation rates as we get 
closer to where we are now.  

00:32:38.491 --> 00:32:40.124
Then you look at us, smart 
speakers.  While it is small 

00:32:40.125 --> 00:32:44.596
right  now, that curve is the 
sharpest of them all.  People 

00:32:44.597 --> 00:32:46.597
are running to these devices 

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:51.530
and adding it to their homes 
around the world.

00:32:51.985 --> 00:32:53.224
You probably think of the Google
Assistant as primarily coming 

00:32:53.225 --> 00:32:55.225
through 

00:32:56.311 --> 00:32:58.140
these, the Google homes and tons
made by third parties and that's

00:32:58.141 --> 00:33:02.852
definitely the way to think of 
us.   We want you to think of it

00:33:02.853 --> 00:33:05.718
as it is more than those 
devices.   The assistant is 

00:33:05.719 --> 00:33:07.964
everywhere, on the kitchen, on 
the Smart Displays, in the 

00:33:11.415 --> 00:33:13.890
living room on TVs and most 
importantly, it is on the go, it

00:33:13.891 --> 00:33:16.539
is in millions and millions of 
people's pockets on their 

00:33:16.742 --> 00:33:22.247
phones.  We think that's an 
opportunity to reach users in a 

00:33:22.248 --> 00:33:24.700
variety of modes, in a variety 
of places and we believe it is a

00:33:26.536 --> 00:33:29.171
new type of play.  We call it 
conversational play.

00:33:32.244 --> 00:33:34.745
While we feel we're in the black
and white film era of this, 

00:33:34.746 --> 00:33:39.708
we're still learning how to go 
build the games.  We do know a 

00:33:39.709 --> 00:33:41.709
couple of things.

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:45.203
When we look at who our users 
are, we're seeing patterns of 

00:33:45.204 --> 00:33:47.204
who they are.

00:33:49.128 --> 00:33:51.128
They're millennials, they're 
families 

00:33:53.485 --> 00:33:55.485
and kids, perfect game players.

00:33:57.575 --> 00:33:59.575
We also want to highlight this, 
this 

00:34:01.076 --> 00:34:03.319
is Angry Birds rise to fame.  
What's important to note, it 

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.320
took a 

00:34:06.405 --> 00:34:08.405
while before Angry Birds became 
one of 

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:11.759
the seminal games on touch 
screens.  Smart phones were 

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.760
released and it took 

00:34:14.808 --> 00:34:16.808
about two years before Angry 
Birds came 

00:34:19.495 --> 00:34:22.739
out and riseed.  This is where 
we are right now.  Smart 

00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:24.777
speakers have been out for a 
while, there is an inflection 

00:34:24.778 --> 00:34:29.901
point we believe will happen 
particularly around play.  We're

00:34:29.902 --> 00:34:32.581
down there, and we believe that 
one of you, many of you, 

00:34:32.582 --> 00:34:34.582
hopefully all 

00:34:36.097 --> 00:34:38.097
of you, will be on that curve 
coming up.

00:34:40.257 --> 00:34:42.490
So I'll hand this off to Andy 
who will talk about building 

00:34:42.491 --> 00:34:44.491
Blocks of play.

00:34:46.335 --> 00:34:52.526
&gt;&gt; Andy:  All right.  Thank you.
  I'm Andy.  I'm also officially

00:34:52.527 --> 00:34:57.009
fun!  What I would like to do is
talk to you about the building 

00:34:57.010 --> 00:35:00.906
Blocks of great conversational 
game play.  There's going to be 

00:35:00.907 --> 00:35:02.907
unique challenges that make 
designing conversational games 

00:35:06.191 --> 00:35:09.246
very different than your 
console, PC or mobile games.  

00:35:09.247 --> 00:35:11.731
Here are some of the principles 
that our team uses to delivering

00:35:11.732 --> 00:35:13.732
engaging 

00:35:14.992 --> 00:35:17.224
experiences that users love.
  First, we need to create the 

00:35:17.225 --> 00:35:19.878
universe.  Think of some of your
favorite games, 

00:35:22.941 --> 00:35:24.941
what are the worlds that they 
transport you to?

00:35:27.667 --> 00:35:29.278
Some old school favorites, Dark 
Castle,ers Space Quest and 

00:35:29.279 --> 00:35:32.773
Zelda.  There is an oaker 
strayings of elements through 

00:35:32.774 --> 00:35:37.289
the backgrounds, characters, the
story, the sound, they all work 

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:39.533
together.  They often rely on 
visuals to bring 

00:35:42.821 --> 00:35:45.074
this world to life.  Now with 
conversational games we don't 

00:35:47.742 --> 00:35:49.371
always have those elements to 
work with.  We have to look for 

00:35:49.372 --> 00:35:52.446
inspiration elsewhere.  One of 
the places that we can look, it 

00:35:54.687 --> 00:35:57.582
is the oral story telling 
techniques that go back hundreds

00:35:57.583 --> 00:35:59.583
of years.

00:36:00.659 --> 00:36:02.659
A simple story starting phrase, 
once 

00:36:03.776 --> 00:36:05.027
upon a time, it sets the stage 
in fairy tales, tables and 

00:36:05.028 --> 00:36:07.028
myths.

00:36:09.336 --> 00:36:10.976
The origins date back past the 
1400s and they're pretty much 

00:36:10.977 --> 00:36:12.977
universal.

00:36:14.037 --> 00:36:15.898
You can find equivalents in 
dozens of languages, things like

00:36:15.899 --> 00:36:17.899
a long time ago, 

00:36:20.608 --> 00:36:23.280
there once lived, so for uses to
create our universe, we need to 

00:36:23.281 --> 00:36:26.533
set the stage just like once 
upon a time does for fairy 

00:36:26.534 --> 00:36:28.601
tales.  It doesn't need to be 
much, it does 

00:36:31.648 --> 00:36:33.502
help users understand the world 
they're in.  Here is a quick 

00:36:33.503 --> 00:36:38.016
example.   If you ask the 
assistant what should I be for 

00:36:38.017 --> 00:36:40.754
Halloween, it is going to go 
through a series of questions 

00:36:40.755 --> 00:36:45.021
and help you decide a silly 
costume to wear when you go  

00:36:45.022 --> 00:36:48.294
trick-or-treating.  Here are two
approaches on bringing the 

00:36:48.295 --> 00:36:50.295
player into the game.

00:36:51.353 --> 00:36:54.625
Let's listen to the first one.
  Welcome to the Halloween 

00:36:54.626 --> 00:36:56.626
costume quiz, answer these five 
questions to find out 

00:36:58.917 --> 00:37:00.917
what you should be for Halloween
this year.

00:37:01.569 --> 00:37:03.802
&gt;&gt; Andy:  That technically does 
the job, it brings the user in a

00:37:03.803 --> 00:37:07.675
little bit.  It also at least 
gives feedback to threat users 

00:37:07.676 --> 00:37:09.676
know that they entered the right
game.  I think we can do more.

00:37:12.784 --> 00:37:14.784
Now let's listen to this second 
option.

00:37:15.439 --> 00:37:17.439
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm so glad you asked.

00:37:18.481 --> 00:37:20.481
I don't want to tout my own horn
but 

00:37:21.765 --> 00:37:23.595
I'm -- toot my own horn but I'm 
kind of as expert.

00:37:23.596 --> 00:37:26.450
&gt;&gt; Trick-or-treat.
  &gt;&gt; Nice costumes, great use of

00:37:26.451 --> 00:37:28.451
burlap.  Here you go.
  &gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:37:28.504 --> 00:37:31.405
&gt;&gt; Run along, have fun.    I 
need to help someone now.

00:37:31.808 --> 00:37:35.269
&gt;&gt; Bye.  Okay.  Let me assess 
your costume interests with a 

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:39.329
few questions.  Are you ready?
  &gt;&gt; Listen to how that second 

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:43.822
version really starts to set the
stage and more importantly, it 

00:37:43.823 --> 00:37:45.823
gets users excited about 

00:37:48.679 --> 00:37:51.779
playing the game.
  The other thing we really need

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:53.780
to do 

00:37:54.825 --> 00:37:57.499
is to kind of look on ways to 
layer in sound design.  It is 

00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.500
such a critical element, 

00:38:00.619 --> 00:38:03.489
especially since we have fewer 
elements to work with.  We have 

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:06.559
to look at ways to paint this 
audio world.   This can be done 

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:09.405
in a couple of ways.  One, 
through the background, music, 

00:38:11.847 --> 00:38:14.121
atmosphere, really helping to 
create that whole affect, or we 

00:38:14.122 --> 00:38:17.984
can also use it as a foreground 
element.   Maybe wanting to use 

00:38:17.985 --> 00:38:22.132
it as a way to give feedback to 
the user that they have done 

00:38:22.133 --> 00:38:25.019
something write or wrong or we 
want to use it to empathize key 

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.020
moments of delight or dialogue.

00:38:30.396 --> 00:38:32.626
To illustrate this point, the 
Google Assistant has a  poem for

00:38:32.627 --> 00:38:37.142
you, our loving audience.  It is
titled bikes and kick stands.  

00:38:37.143 --> 00:38:40.634
Let's listen to this.
  &gt;&gt; Thank you for humoring.  

00:38:40.635 --> 00:38:42.509
Give me a few seconds to write 
it down.  You're like a bike and

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:46.647
I'm like the kick stand, lean on
me, friend, when it is time to 

00:38:46.648 --> 00:38:49.488
make plans whether you're 
searching for info, trying to 

00:38:49.489 --> 00:38:51.489
spell sha 

00:38:54.586 --> 00:38:56.029
toe, looking for necessities or 
others, I will always reply.

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:58.467
&gt;&gt; Pretty good.  Let's hear it 
with sound layered in.

00:39:00.528 --> 00:39:02.528
&gt;&gt; Thanks for humoring me, just 
give 

00:39:04.003 --> 00:39:06.003
me a few seconds to write it 
down.

00:39:07.667 --> 00:39:10.743
You're like a bike and I'm like 
the kick stand.  Lean on me, 

00:39:10.744 --> 00:39:13.638
friend, when it is time to make 
plans.   Whether you're 

00:39:13.639 --> 00:39:15.900
searching for info, trying to 
spell sha toe, looking for 

00:39:17.972 --> 00:39:19.972
recipes or other necessities, if
you 

00:39:22.085 --> 00:39:25.083
have any questions, I'll always 
reply.  

00:39:35.915 --> 00:39:37.739
.
  We'll later on show you how to

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:39.781
add the love in your dialogue.

00:39:42.883 --> 00:39:44.093
Another thing to consider, how 
to use sound to let  users 

00:39:44.094 --> 00:39:46.765
focus.  This is helpful in 
multiplayer experience.

00:39:51.249 --> 00:39:53.249
In our game are you feeling 
lucky 

00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:56.310
users are given names, since you
have 6 

00:39:57.436 --> 00:39:59.283
players at a time, we found 
through research that users may 

00:39:59.284 --> 00:40:02.120
forget when it is time to 
answer.  To help get users to 

00:40:02.121 --> 00:40:04.121
focus we pair them with audio 
queues.

00:40:07.472 --> 00:40:12.367
Let's listen to how that works. 
  Okay.  Just so everybody is 

00:40:12.368 --> 00:40:14.368
straight, I'll give you your 
names again.

00:40:20.802 --> 00:40:22.802
They are Nibbler, scooter, 
freestyle, puddles.

00:40:23.453 --> 00:40:25.683
&gt;&gt; This can be a great way to 
just kind of associate that 

00:40:25.684 --> 00:40:27.929
audio queue with that name, 
bring users back and it is 

00:40:29.341 --> 00:40:31.185
something that you may want to 
consider as you're developing 

00:40:31.186 --> 00:40:33.186
games too, how to 

00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:38.109
use audio queues to get users to
focus.

00:40:39.209 --> 00:40:41.241
Now our next principle, it is to
keep it simple.

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:47.569
Conversations, they're 
inherently linear.  It is really

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:51.421
easy to move forward and it is 
much harder to move back.  We 

00:40:51.422 --> 00:40:54.732
can't ask users to hold too much
in their heads.  Here are a few 

00:40:54.733 --> 00:40:57.421
ways that you can keep things 
simple.

00:41:01.303 --> 00:41:03.556
The first, use a consistent 
structure.  Familiarity is going

00:41:03.557 --> 00:41:07.840
to make people feel more 
comfortable.  The more we have 

00:41:07.841 --> 00:41:10.688
deviations, it is going to 
increase the cognitive load of 

00:41:13.752 --> 00:41:15.992
the player and a higher level of
confusion or possibly errors.

00:41:19.313 --> 00:41:21.769
Imagine this, we're in a quiz, 
here are just two different 

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:23.770
questions, pretty 

00:41:27.061 --> 00:41:29.061
similar in structure.

00:41:31.171 --> 00:41:36.099
Now we restate that question, we
follow-up with the options.  We 

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.152
still kind of vary the language 
a little bit.  We see the 

00:41:38.153 --> 00:41:39.976
structure is very consistent.  
So as the player   goes through 

00:41:39.977 --> 00:41:43.446
the experience, they're now 
going to know what to expect, 

00:41:43.447 --> 00:41:45.447
allowing them to focus 

00:41:46.729 --> 00:41:48.729
on the content and not the game 
mechanics.

00:41:50.003 --> 00:41:51.037
As we push the boundaries of 
conversational game play, you 

00:41:51.038 --> 00:41:54.733
may want to change the 
structure.  Maybe you want to 

00:41:54.734 --> 00:41:57.818
have a bonus round, something 
like that.  That's going to be 

00:41:57.819 --> 00:42:00.719
okay as long as you take the 
time and teach the users that 

00:42:02.939 --> 00:42:04.988
this portion of the game is 
going to be  different.  You're 

00:42:04.989 --> 00:42:07.624
going to need to ultimately 
weigh is that worth it, is it 

00:42:07.625 --> 00:42:12.954
worth it to take that time to 
explain it even though it may 

00:42:12.955 --> 00:42:14.955
slow the pace down a little bit.

00:42:16.654 --> 00:42:18.497
Another simple thing to keep in 
mind, when you list out the 

00:42:18.498 --> 00:42:22.396
choices for a player, just make 
sure you follow-up with the 

00:42:22.397 --> 00:42:25.057
exact order.  If you look at 
this, would you rather 

00:42:28.098 --> 00:42:30.337
travel on a tiny plane or surf 
board, we follow-up with plane 

00:42:30.338 --> 00:42:32.382
and then surfboard.  Sometimes 
it is easy to switch those 

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:38.390
around but keep it consistent.  
.

00:42:39.822 --> 00:42:42.476
The next principle is to keep 
players engaged.  We don't want 

00:42:42.477 --> 00:42:44.498
the games to feel like a 
lecture.

00:42:52.257 --> 00:42:54.257
It is easy for players to get 
distracted.

00:42:55.519 --> 00:42:56.320
A way to do that is analyze the 
player experience through the 

00:42:56.321 --> 00:43:00.627
game.  If you came from the game
world you may be familiar with 

00:43:00.628 --> 00:43:02.628
the player interest curve, it is
a way to represent the 

00:43:04.704 --> 00:43:07.372
highlights and the  lowlights of
a player's experience.  This is 

00:43:07.373 --> 00:43:09.421
going to be similar to kind of 
creating user journey maps if 

00:43:09.422 --> 00:43:11.422
you're familiar with product 
designs and some 

00:43:14.139 --> 00:43:16.038
of that, it is similar types of 
concepts.  You will simply watch

00:43:16.039 --> 00:43:20.533
players playing your game and 
you will notice kind of key  

00:43:20.534 --> 00:43:22.772
milestones, watch the reactions,
are they cringing, excited, you 

00:43:22.773 --> 00:43:26.434
will start to plot this.  As you
do this, you're going to 

00:43:29.488 --> 00:43:31.726
generate the patterns, as the 
patterns happen, you will want 

00:43:31.727 --> 00:43:34.603
to make sure that the curve is 
up.  Looking at a graph like 

00:43:34.604 --> 00:43:38.280
this, this is a bit of a 
concern.  You see it starts off 

00:43:38.281 --> 00:43:41.732
with a great intro, and ends 
with an outcome and the middle, 

00:43:41.733 --> 00:43:43.733
it sags a bit.

00:43:45.425 --> 00:43:47.425
We don't want that to happen.

00:43:48.699 --> 00:43:51.579
One way to keep players engaged,
it is to make the player part of

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:54.836
the conversation.  You know your
experience will be directed by 

00:43:54.837 --> 00:43:58.909
the dialogue.  We want to make 
sure that we're always talking 

00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:00.910
with the player and not at the 
player.

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:04.220
You can do this by creating 
digestible chunks.

00:44:06.911 --> 00:44:08.939
You find moments for your player
to participate.

00:44:11.383 --> 00:44:13.623
The other thing we can do, 
respond contactually whenever 

00:44:13.624 --> 00:44:17.078
possible.  Craft the dialogue 
based on that  player's 

00:44:17.079 --> 00:44:21.956
response.  Imagine here, the 
player is asked if they would 

00:44:21.957 --> 00:44:25.423
rather play with a unicorn or a 
dragon.  Here we have a very 

00:44:25.424 --> 00:44:27.424
generic response.

00:44:28.471 --> 00:44:30.471
This could be something for any 
of the questions.

00:44:32.786 --> 00:44:34.428
However, in this example, we're 
able to respond to something 

00:44:34.429 --> 00:44:37.507
that's not just a bit more 
delightful but it makes the game

00:44:37.508 --> 00:44:39.781
feel smarter.  It is providing 
simple feedback to the 

00:44:45.446 --> 00:44:47.446
user that the game understands 
what they said.

00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:51.561
Now as we move to more visual 
experiences, Smart Displays, 

00:44:51.562 --> 00:44:53.562
what we 

00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.320
want to do is avoid transcribing
word 

00:44:59.578 --> 00:45:01.578
for word all of the dialogue.

00:45:03.495 --> 00:45:05.320
We had mentioned the buzz feed 
quiz and this is an example, on 

00:45:05.321 --> 00:45:07.321
the right, 

00:45:09.638 --> 00:45:11.264
this is the TTS, this is the 
output.  On the left is the 

00:45:11.265 --> 00:45:15.352
experience itself.   You can see
we're not just using the screen 

00:45:15.353 --> 00:45:18.257
to throw all of that text in, we
want to simplify it, move the 

00:45:18.258 --> 00:45:21.728
user forrd with a, we want to 
use the screen to create that 

00:45:21.729 --> 00:45:25.182
universe.   We want to make sure
there is opportunities to 

00:45:25.183 --> 00:45:27.183
increase the brand and create 
more of an emotional connection 

00:45:28.453 --> 00:45:30.453
with the user.

00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:34.570
Don't transcribe your text word 
for word.

00:45:36.051 --> 00:45:38.304
Another way to keep players 
engaged, is to have a great 

00:45:38.305 --> 00:45:42.613
pay-off.  Our user's time, it is
very valuable and there is a lot

00:45:42.614 --> 00:45:46.934
of competition for it.  We have 
to make sure that we award them 

00:45:46.935 --> 00:45:48.935
forgetting to the end.  If you 
remember that interest curve we 

00:45:50.195 --> 00:45:53.061
were showing before, it ended on
the high note.  You guys as game

00:45:53.062 --> 00:45:55.062
designers are going 

00:45:57.184 --> 00:45:59.184
to figure out what that pay-off 
is going to be.

00:46:00.283 --> 00:46:05.763
  The last principle, it is to 
always be play testing.   In the

00:46:05.764 --> 00:46:08.224
game industry this is nothing 
new.  We know it will help 

00:46:08.225 --> 00:46:10.225
increase quality, 

00:46:12.517 --> 00:46:14.950
we know it will help find bugs, 
basic design flaws.  We also 

00:46:14.951 --> 00:46:16.951
know that engagement is going 

00:46:18.616 --> 00:46:20.450
to drop off if the game feels 
broken.  We expect that errors 

00:46:20.451 --> 00:46:24.745
will happen.  Especially with 
conversational games, we know 

00:46:24.746 --> 00:46:26.746
that players will respond with 
anything.

00:46:28.012 --> 00:46:30.882
The environment may be polluted,
full of background noise.  We 

00:46:30.883 --> 00:46:32.537
definitely got a bit of that in 
the sandbox and you can kind of 

00:46:32.538 --> 00:46:35.593
hear all of the people around, 
you know, there is going to be 

00:46:35.594 --> 00:46:39.687
situations like that if you're 
at a party and it may be tough. 

00:46:39.688 --> 00:46:41.688
You have to anticipate some of 
that.

00:46:42.944 --> 00:46:44.944
We know players may forget what 
to do next.

00:46:46.199 --> 00:46:48.199
A few common errors we see are 
things 

00:46:49.249 --> 00:46:50.873
like no input errors where the 
assistant hasn't detected a 

00:46:50.874 --> 00:46:55.418
response at all.  We see things 
like no match errors where the 

00:46:55.419 --> 00:46:58.266
assistant can't understand the 
reply and we also get false 

00:46:58.267 --> 00:47:00.267
accept errors.

00:47:01.516 --> 00:47:04.355
This may be where the assistant 
misunderstands the user and 

00:47:04.356 --> 00:47:06.198
moves along anyway.
  Here is a few things we can do

00:47:06.199 --> 00:47:08.199
to 

00:47:10.729 --> 00:47:13.198
minimize the errors and maximize
the fun.  One, start with your 

00:47:13.199 --> 00:47:15.199
concept and you 

00:47:17.074 --> 00:47:19.503
can do this in a very low way.  
Have a user, players, read the 

00:47:19.504 --> 00:47:23.890
script of kind of the happy 
path, essentially the ideal path

00:47:23.891 --> 00:47:27.155
of the game play.  You need to 
make sure that the game play is 

00:47:27.156 --> 00:47:29.393
actually fun.  If the happy path
isn't happy, then it 

00:47:34.033 --> 00:47:36.033
may be time to look at ways to 
it

00:47:38.235 --> 00:47:40.926
iterate on it.  The other thing 
we do, we test with our eyes 

00:47:40.927 --> 00:47:42.995
closed.  These are 
conversational games and we 

00:47:44.439 --> 00:47:47.367
start with designing for voice 
only.  We do this with a working

00:47:47.368 --> 00:47:49.368
prototype so things like 
dialogue flow or you can do 

00:47:51.832 --> 00:47:53.482
this as a wizard of Oz technique
where a team member may 

00:47:53.483 --> 00:47:55.719
stimulate the response of the 
system and you ever it set up in

00:47:58.359 --> 00:47:59.784
the controlled environment.
  This is a great way to test 

00:47:59.785 --> 00:48:02.484
the content, the pacing and the 
complexity 

00:48:06.333 --> 00:48:08.333
of the game mechanics.

00:48:11.359 --> 00:48:13.359
The last suggestion here, it is 
to 

00:48:15.242 --> 00:48:18.727
test with a range of audiences. 
Not the primary demographic.  

00:48:18.728 --> 00:48:21.409
Watch the parents play with it, 
parents play with it, they may 

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:25.310
bubble up issues of the 
comprehension, complexity of the

00:48:25.311 --> 00:48:28.173
dialogue and may discover that 
some words are hard to say.

00:48:31.021 --> 00:48:33.274
To wrap up really quick, some of
the basic building Blocks that 

00:48:33.275 --> 00:48:35.275
our team uses 

00:48:36.561 --> 00:48:38.561
are create the universe, keep it
simple, 

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.040
keep users engaged and 
consistently play test.

00:48:45.676 --> 00:48:47.676
I'll hand it over now.

00:48:51.134 --> 00:48:54.415
&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone.  I'm also 
fun!

00:48:56.263 --> 00:48:58.494
Now that we're equipped with the
expert tips from Andy, let's 

00:48:58.495 --> 00:49:01.357
dive into how we can actually 
implement all of this.

00:49:03.394 --> 00:49:04.832
Good news, starting is really 
simple.  We're working really 

00:49:04.833 --> 00:49:08.732
hard on developing tools and 
capabilities to make it easier 

00:49:08.733 --> 00:49:10.733
for you to focus on what 

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.127
you do the best, developing 
games.  At a high level, 

00:49:14.128 --> 00:49:16.128
developing actionless 

00:49:17.247 --> 00:49:19.498
for Google has three main 
components, this applies to any 

00:49:19.499 --> 00:49:22.356
action, games or non-games.  The
first, you have to build the 

00:49:24.579 --> 00:49:27.063
dialogue flows and then you need
to connect the flow to the game 

00:49:27.064 --> 00:49:29.064
logic and 

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:33.232
lastly, you need to publish your
actions to Google Assistant.  

00:49:33.233 --> 00:49:35.233
For the rest of this talk, I'll 
focus 

00:49:37.717 --> 00:49:39.747
on dialogue flow, our industrial
leading it creation program and 

00:49:39.748 --> 00:49:41.994
actions on Google console, a 
tool that you publish 

00:49:47.493 --> 00:49:49.528
the actions to Google Assistant.
  Dialogue flow is a tool that 

00:49:49.529 --> 00:49:53.793
makes it easy to build 
conversational flows extracting 

00:49:53.794 --> 00:49:56.651
meaning from dialogues, applying
machine learning to the training

00:49:56.652 --> 00:49:58.652
Examples that you provide.

00:50:00.522 --> 00:50:02.522
Let me show you how it works.

00:50:03.771 --> 00:50:05.407
Imagine you say the following 
sentence:  Send three dragons to

00:50:05.408 --> 00:50:07.408
edge lend immediately.

00:50:10.323 --> 00:50:12.323
Attack with green flames for 
five hours.

00:50:14.617 --> 00:50:16.243
Dialogue flow, this is about 
game term, not about user asking

00:50:16.244 --> 00:50:22.990
for help, trying to exit the 
game, it is about game term.  It

00:50:22.991 --> 00:50:26.443
identifies important concepts 
within the dialogue.  It 

00:50:26.444 --> 00:50:28.444
understands common concepts like

00:50:31.556 --> 00:50:33.384
numbers, countries, colors, and 
examine extract specific 

00:50:33.385 --> 00:50:35.385
comments on the game 

00:50:40.492 --> 00:50:42.155
like characters, weapons and is 
understanding time, when you say

00:50:42.156 --> 00:50:44.618
five hours, it resolves it from 
the time that 

00:50:48.116 --> 00:50:50.116
the sentence was authored to 
five hours later.

00:50:52.814 --> 00:50:54.814
The cool thing about dialogue 
flow, it 

00:50:58.155 --> 00:51:01.206
comes with built-in  
internalization support.  With a

00:51:01.207 --> 00:51:03.848
click, you can transcribe that 
into a other language.  If you 

00:51:03.849 --> 00:51:06.694
want to learn more, you can go 
to a session at 3:30 on Stage 2.

00:51:06.695 --> 00:51:11.579
  Now that you have built the 
action, it is time to test.   Up

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:13.580
until now, you could only test 
the 

00:51:17.098 --> 00:51:18.324
actions using your own developer
account on devices aassociated 

00:51:18.325 --> 00:51:20.325
with that.

00:51:21.368 --> 00:51:23.368
We released a new feature 
allowing you 

00:51:26.828 --> 00:51:29.116
to share your actions with other
users.  This is good for testing

00:51:29.117 --> 00:51:33.255
and design and development 
phase.  There are no policy 

00:51:33.256 --> 00:51:35.256
reviews and that's the quickest 
way to get to the testers 

00:51:38.911 --> 00:51:42.894
and get feedback and it erate.  
The beta release is for games 

00:51:42.895 --> 00:51:47.380
ready to launch, it goes through
full review process, it is to 

00:51:47.381 --> 00:51:49.225
find bugs and issues and 
ultimately we want you to 

00:51:49.226 --> 00:51:51.226
produce 

00:51:53.104 --> 00:51:55.104
the best game possible.

00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:00.317
After you build, test, publish 
you're effectively part of the 

00:52:00.318 --> 00:52:03.758
Google ecosystem.  You should 
make the most out of that.  The 

00:52:03.759 --> 00:52:06.652
easiest way to do that is 
account linking and allowing 

00:52:06.653 --> 00:52:08.696
your users to use their own 
Google accounts to play your 

00:52:10.519 --> 00:52:12.519
games or they can link the 
Google 

00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:15.605
account to your account 
management system.

00:52:19.882 --> 00:52:22.565
To set up account linking, go to
the linking console and you can 

00:52:22.566 --> 00:52:26.659
define what permissions you plan
to ask from user and these 

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:28.379
permissions are defined as 
scopes.  For example, we can ask

00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:31.242
for access to user  contacts, 
calendar, photos, other 

00:52:35.147 --> 00:52:37.147
Google services that they may be
using.

00:52:37.796 --> 00:52:39.796
From a user perspective, they go

00:52:41.483 --> 00:52:43.483
through the familiar Google flow
to use 

00:52:44.738 --> 00:52:49.243
their own Google account or link
that to the gaming account.  

00:52:49.244 --> 00:52:51.244
Creating this experience as a 

00:52:52.503 --> 00:52:55.371
developer is fairly simple, just
literally two lines of code and 

00:52:55.372 --> 00:52:59.706
use the sign in help function to
request the sign-in.  Once you 

00:52:59.707 --> 00:53:02.968
do that, you need to handle the 
user's response.  If the user 

00:53:02.969 --> 00:53:07.255
goes through the authentication 
flow successfully, you receive 

00:53:07.256 --> 00:53:09.709
an access token to use to access
the resources that you asked 

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:11.539
permission for.
  If something goes wrong, you 

00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:13.540
need to 

00:53:19.053 --> 00:53:21.969
acknowledge it, and gracefully 
exit.  A key to Google Assistant

00:53:21.970 --> 00:53:23.970
is the fact 

00:53:25.894 --> 00:53:27.894
it is available in various 
mobilities 

00:53:30.574 --> 00:53:32.605
and actions on Google IEs gives 
you control on handling the 

00:53:32.606 --> 00:53:34.685
interaction types.
  We'll quickly go over the 

00:53:34.686 --> 00:53:38.365
different interaction types.   
The first one, what we call 

00:53:38.366 --> 00:53:41.017
voice only.  You can think of 
the smart speakers 

00:53:44.695 --> 00:53:48.371
and the whole interaction is 
voice space, input and output.  

00:53:48.372 --> 00:53:51.034
The second interaction, voice 
forward, these are smart 

00:53:51.035 --> 00:53:53.265
speakers you see in the sandbox 
area.  Here, again, the primary 

00:53:53.266 --> 00:53:55.266
mode of 

00:53:56.753 --> 00:53:58.783
instruction is voice and has 
with visuals when necessary.

00:54:03.277 --> 00:54:04.898
The third interaction model is  
intermodal, think of the phone, 

00:54:04.899 --> 00:54:06.899
here you 

00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:12.245
have conversation and visuals 
enter visuals inter mixed, you 

00:54:12.246 --> 00:54:14.272
go back and forth.
  The last one, it is visual 

00:54:14.273 --> 00:54:16.273
only.

00:54:18.154 --> 00:54:20.805
You think of the phone on mute 
as an example.  Here there is no

00:54:20.806 --> 00:54:22.806
audio input or 

00:54:24.251 --> 00:54:26.251
output, it is all about visual 
and text.

00:54:26.938 --> 00:54:29.586
Let's go through an example.  
Let's say that a user is playing

00:54:29.587 --> 00:54:32.233
your game on a smart speaker and
then you 

00:54:36.733 --> 00:54:40.630
want to show them the image of 
their new monster evolved.  We 

00:54:40.631 --> 00:54:42.631
define the image here.

00:54:44.501 --> 00:54:47.345
The first thing we need to do, 
we need to check if the device 

00:54:47.346 --> 00:54:50.011
the player is playing the game 
on has a capability to show an 

00:54:50.012 --> 00:54:52.012
image.

00:54:53.883 --> 00:54:56.333
This capability is defined as 
screen output.  If the device 

00:54:56.334 --> 00:55:00.226
has the capability, great.  We 
show the image.  In our example,

00:55:00.227 --> 00:55:03.285
the player is playing on a smart
speaker which doesn't have that 

00:55:03.286 --> 00:55:05.286
capability.

00:55:08.162 --> 00:55:10.186
What we do, we ask the user to 
switch the device to one that 

00:55:10.187 --> 00:55:13.637
has this capability.  We do this
with the function called new 

00:55:13.638 --> 00:55:18.153
surface.  With he define what 
capability we're looking for, in

00:55:18.154 --> 00:55:20.798
this case, screen output and we 
give the context to the user on 

00:55:22.631 --> 00:55:24.631
the smart speaker they're 
extracting 

00:55:26.093 --> 00:55:28.327
with to see the evolved monster 
go to the phone.  Then we send 

00:55:28.328 --> 00:55:33.243
the notification to the device 
we want to take the user to.  In

00:55:33.244 --> 00:55:35.244
this example we say see how the 

00:55:36.303 --> 00:55:38.303
monster has evolved and they 
continue 

00:55:39.776 --> 00:55:42.237
the interaction on the phone.
  The final step as a developer 

00:55:42.238 --> 00:55:44.238
is to 

00:55:47.545 --> 00:55:49.809
manage the flow, and it is to 
handle the response off the user

00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:53.933
for the new resurface phone, if 
the user accepts the prompt, 

00:55:53.934 --> 00:55:55.934
moves to this new capable device
and you simply show the image.

00:55:58.608 --> 00:56:00.431
If they don't, you just need to 
gracefully exit and acknowledge 

00:56:00.432 --> 00:56:02.432
that you 

00:56:04.855 --> 00:56:08.021
won't be able to show the image.
  Once the game actions start to

00:56:08.022 --> 00:56:12.516
get traction, you need to think 
about reengagement.  We have 

00:56:12.517 --> 00:56:14.517
multiple ways in the platform 

00:56:16.846 --> 00:56:18.690
to help you reEngage with your 
users.  We literally have a 

00:56:18.691 --> 00:56:20.691
section called 

00:56:22.336 --> 00:56:24.993
user engagement on the action 
console.   There you can push 

00:56:24.994 --> 00:56:30.318
notifications, routines, data 
updates and suggestions.  If you

00:56:30.319 --> 00:56:32.319
push notifications, you will be 

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.648
allowed to send notifications to
the users.  Obviously the users 

00:56:36.649 --> 00:56:39.087
need to provide consent.  This 
is a powerful tool.

00:56:43.575 --> 00:56:46.011
It needs to be used thoughtfully
and sparingly.  You of think of 

00:56:46.012 --> 00:56:48.450
routines as actions come 
together.  We have something 

00:56:48.451 --> 00:56:53.548
like I'm home routine, where you
can bundle a bunch of apps you 

00:56:53.549 --> 00:56:56.395
want to trigger and if you say 
hey, Google, I'm home, you may 

00:56:56.396 --> 00:57:01.113
have Google turn on the lights, 
adjust the thermostat, tell you 

00:57:01.114 --> 00:57:03.114
a joke maybe and 

00:57:05.022 --> 00:57:07.022
start your favorite play list.  
This is similar.

00:57:10.358 --> 00:57:11.989
You set up a daily notification 
that reoccurs every day at the 

00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:16.671
set time.  The user experience 
for daily routines and daily 

00:57:16.672 --> 00:57:18.672
updates and routines is that 

00:57:19.768 --> 00:57:22.003
after the users Engage with your
app and exit they will see a 

00:57:22.004 --> 00:57:24.238
suggestion prompting them to add
your action to 

00:57:27.331 --> 00:57:29.331
daily updates or routines.

00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:32.261
Routines may not be that 
suitable for gaming vertical but

00:57:32.262 --> 00:57:35.105
something you think about.  I'll
just focus on the daily updates 

00:57:37.987 --> 00:57:40.441
for now.
  This is what you will see, 

00:57:40.442 --> 00:57:42.442
what the 

00:57:43.927 --> 00:57:46.369
users will see if you opt into 
the daily updates.  After the 

00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:49.216
user, as the interaction, there 
is a chip that says you want me 

00:57:49.217 --> 00:57:54.985
to send in this case jokes 
daily, if the user opts in, 

00:57:54.986 --> 00:57:56.623
Google will guide the user 
through setting the time of the 

00:57:56.624 --> 00:58:00.706
day when they want to receive 
the daily update.  From this 

00:58:00.707 --> 00:58:02.707
point on, as a developer, we 

00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:06.630
need to do two things.  First, 
you need to handle the daily 

00:58:08.251 --> 00:58:10.907
response to the daily update 
flow.  If the user goes through 

00:58:10.908 --> 00:58:12.908
the flow successfully, you 
acknowledge that, if 

00:58:16.633 --> 00:58:19.281
not, again, you need to 
gracefully exit.  The second 

00:58:19.282 --> 00:58:21.282
step, you need to define what 
you actually want to do when the

00:58:22.579 --> 00:58:24.579
daily trigger arrives.

00:58:27.513 --> 00:58:29.513
Here we set the trigger to the 
update intent.

00:58:31.606 --> 00:58:34.267
The best example, the update 
intent would just send a new 

00:58:34.268 --> 00:58:36.268
job.

00:58:37.548 --> 00:58:39.596
Ultimately, this is what the 
users will see.

00:58:47.135 --> 00:58:48.348
Lastly, I would like to talk 
about monetization options for 

00:58:48.349 --> 00:58:50.349
the game.

00:58:51.612 --> 00:58:53.612
We just announced the digital 
goods 

00:58:55.724 --> 00:58:57.362
API that allows you to use the 
Google play ininterest framework

00:58:57.363 --> 00:59:02.055
structure building on the 
earlier launch this year where 

00:59:02.056 --> 00:59:03.883
you could use your existing play
entitlements with assistant 

00:59:03.884 --> 00:59:05.884
actions.

00:59:07.137 --> 00:59:09.137
For example, if you bought an 
audio 

00:59:10.836 --> 00:59:12.836
book or purchased a monster in 
the game, 

00:59:14.289 --> 00:59:16.934
you could actually use it in 
Google Assistant.  What digital 

00:59:16.935 --> 00:59:19.577
goods API does, it makes the 
rethe verse also true.

00:59:23.601 --> 00:59:25.764
If you have a Tran action 
transaction, the same 

00:59:25.765 --> 00:59:27.765
entitlement is used in the 
Android app.

00:59:31.066 --> 00:59:33.096
Let's go through an example from
the partners in head space to 

00:59:33.097 --> 00:59:36.773
show you how this could work on 
a smart display.  For those of 

00:59:36.774 --> 00:59:38.774
you that don't know about 

00:59:40.068 --> 00:59:42.068
head space, they're a company 
that built 

00:59:43.127 --> 00:59:45.127
products on guided meditation.

00:59:47.406 --> 00:59:49.406
So let's say that the session is
over 

00:59:50.833 --> 00:59:52.833
and head space offers the option
to subscribe.

00:59:55.556 --> 00:59:57.556
The user responds with an intent
to subscribe.

01:00:00.659 --> 01:00:01.903
The action shows available 
options in a curated, visual 

01:00:01.904 --> 01:00:04.140
way.  The user picks an option 
and it is 

01:00:07.221 --> 01:00:09.648
handed over to the checkout 
flow.  Here if you enable the 

01:00:09.649 --> 01:00:14.981
account linking and the user has
account credentials stored with 

01:00:14.982 --> 01:00:16.982
Google, the check out will 

01:00:18.096 --> 01:00:19.950
be very seamless, a single tap, 
a command, you will have the 

01:00:19.951 --> 01:00:21.951
proven 

01:00:23.328 --> 01:00:24.770
content that can be reused on 
the assistant and on Android 

01:00:24.771 --> 01:00:26.771
apps.

01:00:28.468 --> 01:00:30.314
With that, I'll hand it back and
we'll talk about implementing 

01:00:30.315 --> 01:00:33.222
some best practices in the 
games.

01:00:36.227 --> 01:00:38.227
&gt;&gt; THUSHAN AMARASIRIWARDENA: 

01:00:41.009 --> 01:00:42.231
Now we'll pump it up.
  You remember back when Andy 

01:00:42.232 --> 01:00:45.079
was talking, we showed the 
difference of what the sound 

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:47.080
design can do.

01:00:48.536 --> 01:00:50.536
The devices really rely on 
music, 

01:00:52.278 --> 01:00:54.313
sound affects and voice.  We 
have some technology that we 

01:00:54.314 --> 01:01:01.245
wanted to showcase that can help
you pump it up quite a bit.  You

01:01:01.246 --> 01:01:04.094
could, for example, record tons 
and tons of lines with a voice 

01:01:04.095 --> 01:01:08.589
actor and get a sound engineer 
to add sound affects and make 

01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:11.444
some beautiful audio, or you 
could use this technology called

01:01:15.274 --> 01:01:17.797
SSML which is which allows you 
to do it in realtime 

01:01:20.851 --> 01:01:22.851
in code and it also allows you 
to put variables along the way.

01:01:26.961 --> 01:01:28.961
We have this static poem, it 
says 

01:01:30.361 --> 01:01:32.361
thank you for humoring me, you 
can add personalization and yet 

01:01:32.362 --> 01:01:34.399
have the dynamic sound affects 
and all.

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:37.072
Here is the script.  We'll start
pumping it up.

01:01:40.561 --> 01:01:42.561
SSML is just like HTML but you 
add 

01:01:44.022 --> 01:01:45.910
tags, you wrap it in a tag and 
you put paragraph tags when you 

01:01:45.911 --> 01:01:47.947
have each line and then you can 
start doing things like 

01:01:51.028 --> 01:01:53.028
adding sound affects and it is a
simple 

01:01:56.337 --> 01:01:59.035
audio URL from the server.  
There's more than just text and 

01:01:59.036 --> 01:02:01.938
sound affects, there's sound 
layering and that's what we'll 

01:02:01.939 --> 01:02:05.825
talk about here.  We have a tag 
called media.  What media does, 

01:02:05.826 --> 01:02:07.826
it allows you to 

01:02:08.903 --> 01:02:11.752
essentially make two multiple 
tracks and layer them together. 

01:02:11.753 --> 01:02:16.646
This is our first track here.  
We'll call it poem.  It will 

01:02:16.647 --> 01:02:20.153
start one second in and you will
see why in a second.  We have 

01:02:20.154 --> 01:02:22.154
another sound affect and we'll 

01:02:23.603 --> 01:02:25.603
put a dramatic pause.

01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:31.408
We work on our music loop.  We 
call it music.  We can control 

01:02:31.409 --> 01:02:34.300
how many times it loops through.
You set the sound Level if we 

01:02:34.301 --> 01:02:36.301
want it 

01:02:37.586 --> 01:02:39.586
to fade in or fade out and then 
we use 

01:02:40.654 --> 01:02:42.686
that name from earlier when the 
poem ends let's run it for 

01:02:42.687 --> 01:02:44.687
another second and 

01:02:46.545 --> 01:02:48.545
then we have the music loop 
itself.

01:02:50.619 --> 01:02:52.619
Altogether, we wrap it in what 
we have 

01:02:53.656 --> 01:02:55.656
as another tag, par, it is 
running both tracks together.

01:02:59.566 --> 01:03:01.566
What I showed you here, it is a

01:03:03.133 --> 01:03:04.548
you truncated version of the 
humor.

01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:06.549
&gt;&gt; Thongs for humoring me, give 
me a 

01:03:07.964 --> 01:03:09.964
few seconds to

01:03:12.508 --> 01:03:15.492
Thanks for humoring me --
  &gt;&gt; We have the music, the 

01:03:15.493 --> 01:03:17.922
sound affect -- we have the 
plans.

01:03:19.777 --> 01:03:21.598
&gt;&gt; Looking for recipes, other 
necessities, if you have any 

01:03:21.599 --> 01:03:25.301
questions, I'll always reply.
  &gt;&gt; THUSHAN AMARASIRIWARDENA: 

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:27.302
That fade out.

01:03:30.413 --> 01:03:32.848
It is all done in code.  The 
other big thing to leave you 

01:03:32.849 --> 01:03:37.192
with, it is if you make 
something and no one hears it, 

01:03:37.193 --> 01:03:39.876
not only is that a punch in the 
gut, but you're wondering what 

01:03:39.877 --> 01:03:42.309
you can do to make that happen.

01:03:46.174 --> 01:03:48.205
We want to tell you that very, 
very soon we'll be opening up 

01:03:48.206 --> 01:03:50.206
hey Google, 

01:03:51.469 --> 01:03:53.469
let's play a game to all 
developers.

01:03:54.518 --> 01:03:55.941
This is called a built and 
intent, there are other talks 

01:03:55.942 --> 01:03:57.942
about it t register your app for
it.

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:05.705
Consider it the App Store of 
games on the Google Assistant.  

01:04:05.706 --> 01:04:07.944
When someone says play a game, 
which is what a lot of the users

01:04:07.945 --> 01:04:09.945
are  doing, 

01:04:11.042 --> 01:04:12.463
they'll get a list of the games 
available, and this works on the

01:04:12.464 --> 01:04:14.464
Smart 

01:04:16.981 --> 01:04:18.981
Displays, phones, smart 
speakers.

01:04:20.846 --> 01:04:23.579
To make that happen, we have a 
little homework for you.  Go 

01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:26.255
back into the actions on Google 
console and fill out all of the 

01:04:26.256 --> 01:04:28.256
metadata.

01:04:30.109 --> 01:04:32.144
That's what we use to look at 
your app, know what it is about 

01:04:32.145 --> 01:04:34.991
and feature it with users.  Make
sure you have beautiful icons 

01:04:34.992 --> 01:04:36.992
and 

01:04:38.851 --> 01:04:40.851
the descriptions are great 
there.

01:04:41.087 --> 01:04:43.087
I'm going to tell you a little 
secret.

01:04:44.375 --> 01:04:46.402
We don't  usually talk about how
we rank things but I want to 

01:04:46.403 --> 01:04:48.403
highlight this.

01:04:50.095 --> 01:04:52.727
This is how we look for quality.
Straight-up quality, be it -- it

01:04:55.610 --> 01:04:58.044
sounds great, the game play is 
great and users love it, rate 

01:04:58.045 --> 01:05:00.909
it, we're looking for long 
sessions and games that have 

01:05:03.751 --> 01:05:06.190
people coming back for more and 
more.  We're looking for games 

01:05:06.191 --> 01:05:08.437
that map to the core 
demographics, millennials, 

01:05:09.898 --> 01:05:11.552
families and kids and we're 
looking for games that aren't 

01:05:11.553 --> 01:05:13.553
like the others around there.

01:05:15.018 --> 01:05:19.492
We want to offer our users a 
wide variety of games.  If you 

01:05:19.493 --> 01:05:21.535
can update your apps regularly 
and feature the new tech like 

01:05:21.536 --> 01:05:23.536
jumping on the Smart Displays, 
that gives you a 

01:05:27.455 --> 01:05:29.455
great shot of getting in front 
of users.

01:05:31.937 --> 01:05:33.937
We want to leave you with one 
last note.

01:05:35.222 --> 01:05:37.222
I think many of you have been on
the 

01:05:39.813 --> 01:05:40.623
touch screen revolution of 
making apps and we think there 

01:05:40.624 --> 01:05:42.927
is an opportunity very similar 
here with the smart 

01:05:45.998 --> 01:05:48.280
speakers and digital assistants.
On behalf of the dialogue flow, 

01:05:48.281 --> 01:05:52.365
the action on Google team, 
assistant, we know that it is 

01:05:52.366 --> 01:05:54.366
hard, but we're here for you.

01:05:55.815 --> 01:05:59.712
We want to see you succeed.  We 
would love to hear from you.  

01:05:59.713 --> 01:06:01.961
I'm going to show you our email 
addresses later.  We think there

01:06:01.962 --> 01:06:07.113
is an opportunity to become the 
household name of conversation 

01:06:07.114 --> 01:06:09.114
and play and games and we 

01:06:10.187 --> 01:06:12.187
want it to be you, all of you.
  Thank you so much.

01:06:15.094 --> 01:06:16.325
Please leave us feedback, take a
snapshot of the email addresses,

01:06:16.326 --> 01:06:18.326
we 

01:06:19.375 --> 01:06:21.375
would love to hear from you be 
it new 

01:06:22.488 --> 01:06:23.850
tech or questions on how to use 
it and apps that you're making, 

01:06:23.851 --> 01:06:25.851
we would love to play with them.

01:06:28.865 --> 01:06:29.484
Thank you so much and we can't 
wait to play your games!

01:10:49.537 --> 01:10:51.537
Sites for the Modern Web

01:21:14.137 --> 01:21:16.137
Sites for 

01:21:17.142 --> 01:21:19.142
the Modern Web

01:23:59.937 --> 01:24:01.769
.
  &gt;&gt; Hello, everyone!  Thank you

01:24:01.770 --> 01:24:03.770
for being here!

01:24:04.819 --> 01:24:07.646
We're excited to speak with you 
about how e-commerce can take 

01:24:07.647 --> 01:24:09.686
advantage of the new next 
generation tools we have worked 

01:24:12.608 --> 01:24:15.500
on to build effective websites. 
I work on partnerships for 

01:24:15.501 --> 01:24:17.501
mobile web 

01:24:19.581 --> 01:24:22.226
technologies like accelerated 
mobile pages or amp or PWA.

01:24:25.607 --> 01:24:28.452
  &gt;&gt; I'm a developer advocate 
for web and Chrome.

01:24:30.337 --> 01:24:32.188
&gt;&gt; We're on day three, you have 
heard what Google is up to this 

01:24:32.189 --> 01:24:34.189
week from 

01:24:37.491 --> 01:24:39.929
driverless cars to the assistant
to the latest on the Android 

01:24:39.930 --> 01:24:41.930
platform.

01:24:42.934 --> 01:24:48.371
Connectiveity is what brings 
this together.  You can ask 

01:24:48.372 --> 01:24:50.032
about the baseball score, 
message friends or ask Google to

01:24:50.033 --> 01:24:53.922
play music.  An important thing 
we do, connecting people to 

01:24:53.923 --> 01:24:55.923
goods and services that they 

01:24:57.186 --> 01:24:58.205
want to buy and connect 
businesses to a new customer 

01:24:58.206 --> 01:25:01.454
base.  Our goal at Google is to 
bridge the gap between users 

01:25:01.455 --> 01:25:04.698
that want to know something or 
find something and the companies

01:25:04.699 --> 01:25:06.699
that have the information 
they're looking for.

01:25:08.588 --> 01:25:10.588
We do that with a variety of 
services, 

01:25:11.653 --> 01:25:13.653
including some that are listed 
here.

01:25:14.290 --> 01:25:16.140
Our bread and butter remains the
open web, the greatest content 

01:25:16.141 --> 01:25:19.594
discovery platform that's ever 
existed.  The open web doesn't 

01:25:19.595 --> 01:25:24.549
always live in browsers, web 
views on a phone but powers much

01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:26.605
of the content that drives 
surfaces like Search and 

01:25:26.606 --> 01:25:32.512
Assistant.  Why the web?  It is 
free.  It is  open.  Anyone is 

01:25:32.513 --> 01:25:35.354
open to come make their mark on 
the web.   Most importantly, the

01:25:35.355 --> 01:25:40.460
reach is enormous.  There are 5 
billion devices connected to the

01:25:40.461 --> 01:25:43.565
open web, and that number is 
growing at a steady rate.

01:25:45.202 --> 01:25:47.430
In e-commerce specifically, 
there is a massive amount of 

01:25:47.431 --> 01:25:49.431
business taking place online.

01:25:52.119 --> 01:25:54.567
Majority of user time on resale 
happens on the web both desktop 

01:25:54.568 --> 01:25:58.047
and mobile.  In that category, 
with he know mobile is growing 

01:25:58.048 --> 01:26:02.148
at a steady rate.   We know that
while we love apps at Google not

01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:05.017
every user will download new 
apps in a given month.  If 

01:26:05.018 --> 01:26:06.662
you're able to get a user to 
download the app, great, 

01:26:06.663 --> 01:26:10.954
continue to focus on building 
the best experience for loyal 

01:26:10.955 --> 01:26:13.006
users who have your app and 
working on a download strategy 

01:26:13.007 --> 01:26:15.007
for the 

01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:18.915
apps on Android and iOS but the 
reality is that most new users 

01:26:18.916 --> 01:26:22.575
come in via the web and you make
that a killer experience for 

01:26:22.576 --> 01:26:25.433
them so that they Engage with 
the brand and come back again 

01:26:25.434 --> 01:26:28.326
and again.  That ultimately may 
lead to them downloading the 

01:26:28.327 --> 01:26:31.796
app.  The web gives you an 
opportunity to reach a huge new 

01:26:31.797 --> 01:26:35.265
user base and that's why we love
it for the commerce space.

01:26:37.099 --> 01:26:39.126
However, as great as the web is 
for facilitating an open 

01:26:39.127 --> 01:26:43.623
dialogue and ensuring a level 
playing field exists for anyone 

01:26:43.624 --> 01:26:45.624
who wants to publish content and
as great as it is for allowing 

01:26:47.289 --> 01:26:48.918
brands to reach audiences they 
never could  have, there are 

01:26:48.919 --> 01:26:52.385
challenges that place the future
of the open mobile web in an 

01:26:52.386 --> 01:26:56.646
uncertain place.  The essence of
that challenge, it is engagement

01:26:56.647 --> 01:26:58.647
and capabilities which to date 
have not been on par with the 

01:26:59.919 --> 01:27:02.599
engagement and capabilities of 
apps.  You get great 

01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:04.600
unparalleled reach with the web 
but a lot of the time the 

01:27:06.864 --> 01:27:08.292
engagement isn't where you would
like to see it.

01:27:08.293 --> 01:27:10.589
That's changing.  The tools that
allow you to have great 

01:27:13.042 --> 01:27:14.466
engagement on the mobile web 
exists and over the next 30 

01:27:14.467 --> 01:27:16.711
minutes we'll talk about 
building the technology in the 

01:27:16.712 --> 01:27:19.351
web presence today.  The 
ultimate goal is to improve 

01:27:21.384 --> 01:27:23.384
engagement on the web so it 
meets or 

01:27:25.603 --> 01:27:27.603
exceeds that of

01:27:30.505 --> 01:27:32.505
native apps and keeping 
everything that the web has.

01:27:33.593 --> 01:27:35.990
We'll keep the reach, staggering
engagement, in theory, a perfect

01:27:35.991 --> 01:27:39.099
world.  In practice, the web has
a lot of issues and it is a tall

01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:41.751
order to combat all of the 
problems.  We're approaching the

01:27:41.752 --> 01:27:44.798
challenge head on and there is a
lot going on.  You see a few 

01:27:44.799 --> 01:27:47.287
examples here.  Scrolling is not
responsive, pages 

01:27:50.534 --> 01:27:52.534
load slowly, content bounces 
around when 

01:27:54.398 --> 01:27:56.480
late images or ads pop in and it
doesn't work well offline or on 

01:27:56.481 --> 01:27:59.927
flakey connections.  On top of 
that, while  technologies exist 

01:27:59.928 --> 01:28:01.954
to improve the performance and 
engagement of websites we have 

01:28:01.955 --> 01:28:05.229
not always made it easy for 
developers to take advantage of 

01:28:05.230 --> 01:28:09.777
the solutions so they're not 
always put into practice.  We 

01:28:09.778 --> 01:28:11.203
know at times these solutions 
can be complex, and they're 

01:28:11.204 --> 01:28:14.458
changing a lot, there is an 
awareness issue of the latest 

01:28:14.459 --> 01:28:16.459
best practices.

01:28:17.564 --> 01:28:18.787
Overall, that makes it difficult
to understand with the return on

01:28:18.788 --> 01:28:22.860
the development investment will 
be or what the ROI is in terms 

01:28:22.861 --> 01:28:27.380
of dollars.   We want to clear 
up that confusion today.  

01:28:27.381 --> 01:28:28.421
Enabling some of the new web 
technologies could have a had 

01:28:28.422 --> 01:28:31.302
meaningful impact for the 
business.  Poor performance has 

01:28:31.303 --> 01:28:33.303
real life 

01:28:34.707 --> 01:28:36.721
containers queenses, as you see,
over 50% of users bounce from a 

01:28:36.722 --> 01:28:40.218
site that takes more than 3 
seconds to load and 79% of them 

01:28:40.219 --> 01:28:43.268
will abandon that site if they 
find it difficult to use.  In 

01:28:43.269 --> 01:28:45.269
terms of revenue, we have seen 
that 

01:28:46.938 --> 01:28:48.979
there is a 7% drop in total 
revenue for everyone second 

01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:51.622
delay that every user  faces, it
is a had major user.  Users are 

01:28:51.623 --> 01:28:53.655
not finding what they want, 
either because of a page not 

01:28:53.656 --> 01:28:55.656
loading or 

01:28:57.515 --> 01:28:59.964
the experience after load was 
less than stellar and they're 

01:28:59.965 --> 01:29:03.216
leaving sites sooner than they 
otherwise would have.  It is a 

01:29:03.217 --> 01:29:04.855
huge missed growth opportunity. 
Loss revenue that affects the 

01:29:04.856 --> 01:29:07.526
growth of the business is 
obviously important but not the 

01:29:07.527 --> 01:29:09.632
only factor here.  This slide 
runs through a bunch of 

01:29:11.464 --> 01:29:13.130
experiences that brings stress 
to people and they include 

01:29:13.131 --> 01:29:15.131
waiting online in a 

01:29:16.183 --> 01:29:18.473
retail store, watching the 
melodramatic TV show, standing 

01:29:18.474 --> 01:29:22.384
on the edge of a virtual cliff, 
watching a horror movie and 

01:29:22.385 --> 01:29:24.233
experiencing mobile delays.  
That's  correct, somehow the 

01:29:24.234 --> 01:29:27.703
level of stress caused by mobile
delays was comparable but 

01:29:27.704 --> 01:29:29.704
slightly worse than watching a 
horror movie and it is only 

01:29:32.592 --> 01:29:34.013
surpassed by of all things 
solving a math problem which is 

01:29:34.014 --> 01:29:36.014
not an experience 

01:29:37.687 --> 01:29:39.687
anyone wants to give to users of
their site.

01:29:40.133 --> 01:29:42.566
So you have the business that's 
operating on tight margins to 

01:29:42.567 --> 01:29:47.256
begin with, needing to capture 
every dollar it can.  You have 

01:29:47.257 --> 01:29:49.480
users who when they come to the 
slow site are in need of the 

01:29:49.481 --> 01:29:51.481
serious zen.  How do we reduce 
stress?

01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:56.025
Meditation, massage, mindfulness
is great but may be difficult to

01:29:56.026 --> 01:29:58.026
impart on shoppers of your site.

01:30:00.495 --> 01:30:02.370
We can focus on what we can 
actually control, improving the 

01:30:02.371 --> 01:30:05.637
overall performance UX and the 
general experience ever visiting

01:30:05.638 --> 01:30:07.638
any commerce 

01:30:09.058 --> 01:30:12.981
site to begin with.
  Before we dive into that 

01:30:12.982 --> 01:30:15.204
though, we wanted to take a 
moment to clear up the terms 

01:30:15.205 --> 01:30:17.205
involved.

01:30:19.498 --> 01:30:23.562
Specifically, AMP and PA.  We 
have seen confusion here.  Some 

01:30:23.563 --> 01:30:27.637
people have been thinking that 
actually it is AMP versus PA.  

01:30:27.638 --> 01:30:29.867
That's actually understandable 
both terms came about at the 

01:30:29.868 --> 01:30:33.997
same sort of time, they're both 
web related and like Adam said, 

01:30:33.998 --> 01:30:36.645
we have thrown new stuff at you 
all the time, it could be hard 

01:30:36.646 --> 01:30:38.646
to differentiate those.  Let's 
clear it up.

01:30:40.949 --> 01:30:43.809
It is not AMP versus PA, these 
are not exclusive choices, 

01:30:43.810 --> 01:30:48.467
they're complimentary approaches
when developing for the web.  It

01:30:48.468 --> 01:30:50.468
is not AMP versus PA, but AMP 
and PA together.

01:30:52.938 --> 01:30:54.938
Let's take a refresher on the 

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:57.950
relationship then

01:30:59.305 --> 01:31:01.971
.  Let's start with AMP or 
accelerated mobile pages.  AMP 

01:31:01.972 --> 01:31:03.972
is an Open Source project that 
began a few years ago to combat 

01:31:05.436 --> 01:31:06.451
performance issues on the web 
and there are two aspects to 

01:31:06.452 --> 01:31:09.497
this.
  First, AMP is a Library of 

01:31:09.498 --> 01:31:14.991
Components on HTML specifically 
designed for performance.  

01:31:14.992 --> 01:31:16.808
Second, the AMP format mandates 
a number of rules on pages that 

01:31:16.809 --> 01:31:21.388
are again focused on maintaining
performance but also on enabling

01:31:21.389 --> 01:31:23.389
cashing and this 

01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:27.477
ability to cache and serve 
remotely enables platforms 

01:31:27.478 --> 01:31:29.478
serving AMPs to rendser them 
effectively.

01:31:31.605 --> 01:31:33.605
If that's the technical aspect, 
the 

01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:37.756
business benefit is this is 15 
engineers looking at issues on 

01:31:37.757 --> 01:31:40.602
the site leaving your engineers 
free to focus on the features 

01:31:40.603 --> 01:31:46.096
you're focused on.  The end 
result, when you combine these, 

01:31:46.097 --> 01:31:47.928
AMP content loads for a user on 
average average in a half 

01:31:47.929 --> 01:31:51.839
second.  An additional piece of 
AMP to consider, some of the 

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:53.840
architectural choices to make 
when adopting the technology.

01:31:56.736 --> 01:31:59.206
The most widely used pattern at 
the moment creating a separate 

01:31:59.207 --> 01:32:01.207
page using 

01:32:03.294 --> 01:32:05.516
amp and linking it against the 
HTML-page the same way you 

01:32:05.517 --> 01:32:07.517
maintain multiple translations.

01:32:09.001 --> 01:32:10.830
At link versions, you are served
on Search, Twitter, Bing, 

01:32:10.831 --> 01:32:12.831
anything 

01:32:15.050 --> 01:32:17.540
platforms that link to the AMP 
content.  This  allows you to 

01:32:17.541 --> 01:32:21.001
get in the platform and you have
two versions of the site 

01:32:21.002 --> 01:32:23.045
introducing extra overhead.  
Like I said before, AMP is a 

01:32:23.046 --> 01:32:28.357
framework of components and if 
you can use those components to 

01:32:28.358 --> 01:32:31.601
perform an effective webpage, 
residents those the requirements

01:32:31.602 --> 01:32:34.446
for your webpage any way.  If 
AMP is working for you, an entry

01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:38.114
point for some user, you may 
want to think about using it as 

01:32:38.115 --> 01:32:41.367
a front end framework for all of
the users.  This approach is 

01:32:41.368 --> 01:32:43.368
gaining popularity in 

01:32:44.615 --> 01:32:46.615
a variety of sites that have 
done it, including trip.

01:32:49.049 --> 01:32:50.786
com which you see there, they 
serve over 300 million users in 

01:32:50.787 --> 01:32:52.787
13 languages and they just 
launched a new site that's 

01:32:54.864 --> 01:32:56.864
built entirely in AMP.

01:32:58.123 --> 01:33:00.123
So if AMP is a concrete library 
and 

01:33:01.201 --> 01:33:03.201
platform, you can think of PA as
the 

01:33:04.461 --> 01:33:06.461
overarching methodology behind 
all of this.

01:33:07.325 --> 01:33:09.325
Hopefully you have seen these 
four pillars before.

01:33:11.822 --> 01:33:12.620
I want to try to cement this in 
your minuted now.  These are 

01:33:12.621 --> 01:33:14.621
things we really want you to 

01:33:15.684 --> 01:33:18.355
consider when you're developing 
for the open web.  Fast is up 

01:33:18.356 --> 01:33:20.599
there, that's a goal that we 
share with AMP, performance 

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:23.269
really does need to be built in 
from the start.

01:33:25.094 --> 01:33:28.749
Next up, integrated.  Integrated
means a more app like experience

01:33:28.750 --> 01:33:31.597
with the website.  It should 
feel like it belongs on the 

01:33:31.804 --> 01:33:33.804
device.

01:33:34.872 --> 01:33:36.894
That means it is open on window 
or could have icons on the home 

01:33:36.895 --> 01:33:41.170
screen or desktop and reliable, 
that means that you can give me 

01:33:41.171 --> 01:33:43.252
an intelligent experience 
regardless of my network 

01:33:43.621 --> 01:33:45.621
connectivity state.

01:33:46.665 --> 01:33:48.665
No more  browser error pages.

01:33:49.723 --> 01:33:54.189
Finally, all of these build to 
create engaging experiences.  

01:33:54.190 --> 01:33:56.257
That means notifications when I 
need them, content that I can 

01:33:56.258 --> 01:34:01.563
trust just to display when I ask
for it.  All of that is wrapped 

01:34:01.564 --> 01:34:03.564
up in the UI 

01:34:06.663 --> 01:34:08.663
that feels familiar and at home 
on my device.

01:34:08.896 --> 01:34:11.344
So we have talked about what AMP
is and PA is, it is pattern to 

01:34:11.345 --> 01:34:15.421
note that several different 
patterns exist for combining AMP

01:34:15.422 --> 01:34:17.454
and PA or for just using one or 
the other and we'll get into 

01:34:17.455 --> 01:34:19.455
that in a little bit.

01:34:21.349 --> 01:34:23.163
To start, here is a classic user
journey funnel and we'll use amp

01:34:23.164 --> 01:34:27.253
at the top in the acquisition 
and browsing portion of a user's

01:34:27.254 --> 01:34:29.965
journey and on PA on the bottom 
of the funnel.  When a user 

01:34:29.966 --> 01:34:31.966
looks to convert and had when a 
business is then aiming to build

01:34:33.433 --> 01:34:35.433
them in a loyal customer through
retention and reengagement.

01:34:36.682 --> 01:34:38.304
This is a bit of an over 
simplification of the two 

01:34:38.305 --> 01:34:42.789
concepts.  What I want to give 
you here, a way to frame these 

01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:44.790
ideas in terms of where the 

01:34:50.347 --> 01:34:52.347
strengths will give you the 
bigger ROI.

01:34:53.797 --> 01:34:55.017
In broad terms, AMP gives you 
the easy development path for 

01:34:55.018 --> 01:34:57.458
fast sites, that strength will 
will give you the most value at 

01:34:57.459 --> 01:35:00.548
the top of the funnel.  As you 
progress through the funnel, the

01:35:00.549 --> 01:35:03.631
user is no longer browsing.   
They have made a decision.  The 

01:35:03.632 --> 01:35:06.291
priorities are evolving.   Here 
you want the PA pillars of 

01:35:08.733 --> 01:35:10.347
integration and reliability to 
ensure the conversion portion of

01:35:10.348 --> 01:35:14.629
the funnel provides the best 
experience possible so you can 

01:35:14.630 --> 01:35:16.630
build that one happy transaction

01:35:18.118 --> 01:35:20.350
into a repeat customer.
  Let's start with the first 

01:35:20.351 --> 01:35:23.215
step in any e-commerce journey. 
Acquisition of a new user via 

01:35:23.216 --> 01:35:25.216
entry 

01:35:26.674 --> 01:35:28.698
points to the site we'll show 
you what AMP looks like in 

01:35:28.699 --> 01:35:32.398
practice and success some sites 
are seeing and we'll dive into 

01:35:32.399 --> 01:35:34.399
the tech you can use to 
customize the pages.

01:35:35.468 --> 01:35:36.508
What matters most at the 
beginning, speed and 

01:35:36.509 --> 01:35:39.398
performance.  In this series it 
will show why.

01:35:46.307 --> 01:35:48.337
On the left is the non-AMP 
version and on the right, you 

01:35:48.338 --> 01:35:50.776
have the AMP version.  When 
properly implemented, the user 

01:35:50.777 --> 01:35:54.644
on the AMP page completes the 
transaction before the non-AMP 

01:35:54.645 --> 01:35:58.318
user gets to fully view the 
first page.  Why is speed so 

01:35:58.319 --> 01:36:01.591
important in this first 
discovery phase?  It is this 

01:36:01.592 --> 01:36:03.011
point where you really 
differentiate yourself and the 

01:36:03.012 --> 01:36:06.519
competition.  If I'm looking for
particular brand off camera, I'm

01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:08.954
looking through a list of 
suppliers all selling the same, 

01:36:09.783 --> 01:36:14.107
similar products.   If I tap on 
one of the options, it doesn't 

01:36:14.108 --> 01:36:16.967
load immediately, I may not wait
around.  I'm probably just going

01:36:16.968 --> 01:36:18.995
on to the next site.
  The reality is, most sites are

01:36:18.996 --> 01:36:21.244
not that fast.  If you have a 
super fast site upon 

01:36:24.336 --> 01:36:26.336
load, it can make you stand out.

01:36:27.377 --> 01:36:28.812
We have seen tons of sites do 
this in the commerce space, we 

01:36:28.813 --> 01:36:32.087
have three examples from three 
top sites from around the world,

01:36:32.088 --> 01:36:36.419
we want to point out when we say
e-commerce here, we don't just 

01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:38.459
mean retail but travel and other
transactions and verticals as 

01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:40.460
well.

01:36:45.194 --> 01:36:47.217
The fist, from a larger company 
in Brazil, Magazine Luiza and we

01:36:47.218 --> 01:36:51.750
have an example from price line,
global travel site serving 1.

01:36:56.023 --> 01:36:58.908
5 million active daily users and
they just delivered AMP for many

01:36:58.909 --> 01:37:03.799
sites and they're growing that 
to other content as well.  

01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:05.800
Finally, we see an example from 
flip 

01:37:07.675 --> 01:37:09.535
card, the India travel brand no 
stranger to performance boosting

01:37:09.536 --> 01:37:12.836
as they were the first site to 
launch a PA.  When we talk about

01:37:12.837 --> 01:37:16.186
entry points we want to make 
sure people understand the point

01:37:16.187 --> 01:37:19.879
of entry is not limited to 
reflecteds from Google.  There 

01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:21.880
are over a dozen top platforms 

01:37:23.555 --> 01:37:26.473
that link to AMP pages.  The 
fastest version of an AMP page 

01:37:29.154 --> 01:37:30.776
will load when a cache is 
involved, whether it is or had 

01:37:30.777 --> 01:37:33.062
not, these mean a faster 
experience for your content when

01:37:35.538 --> 01:37:37.538
users find it.

01:37:39.834 --> 01:37:42.113
Where a cache is involved, we 
see this truly coming in play.

01:37:45.978 --> 01:37:47.609
Google has a cache wherever they
link and this connect to AMPs 

01:37:47.610 --> 01:37:51.331
and the early results are 
promising.  As you see here from

01:37:51.332 --> 01:37:53.332
the experience of 

01:37:54.991 --> 01:37:56.991
the online retailer

01:37:58.003 --> 01:37:59.066
, AMP pages are faster which 
means increasedded conversions 

01:37:59.067 --> 01:38:03.339
and we're working on a beta to 
bring the power to PLAs and 

01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:05.340
we're excited to announce that 

01:38:08.396 --> 01:38:10.396
two of the top landing page  
providers,

01:38:13.901 --> 01:38:15.901
ers, instApage and others are 
doing this.

01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:23.372
And others are Alpha testing 
before rolling out completely.  

01:38:23.373 --> 01:38:25.814
As far as results overall, here 
are some metrics that sites are 

01:38:25.815 --> 01:38:27.815
seeing.

01:38:29.230 --> 01:38:34.016
Me e-commerce.
  E-commerce merchants are 

01:38:34.017 --> 01:38:36.017
seeing increases in revenue 
following the 

01:38:39.110 --> 01:38:41.110
deployment of AMP and Twitter is
seeing 

01:38:42.568 --> 01:38:45.016
decreased page load abandonment 
and the express here, it is all 

01:38:45.017 --> 01:38:47.060
built in AMP so they're not 
using the paired approach we 

01:38:48.473 --> 01:38:49.904
referenced a few minutes ago for
the mobile version of the 

01:38:49.905 --> 01:38:52.354
website they still have a had 
separate desktop version and 

01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:55.653
given the strong implementation 
and success they're seeing, 

01:38:55.654 --> 01:38:59.710
we'll use them as a reference 
implementation in slides to 

01:38:59.711 --> 01:39:03.569
come.  .
  Now that we have talked about 

01:39:03.570 --> 01:39:07.447
AMP leveraging speed, let's dive
into technology that allows you 

01:39:07.448 --> 01:39:09.448
to customize 

01:39:11.467 --> 01:39:13.467
your AMPs and bridge together a

01:39:15.233 --> 01:39:17.233
together an AMP and PA.
  &gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:39:18.287 --> 01:39:20.538
We have created our fast entry 
point, and that's  grabbed our 

01:39:20.539 --> 01:39:23.572
potential customer's interest.  
There are a few more steps to 

01:39:23.573 --> 01:39:27.241
turn that into a purchase.  When
I land on a site, I don't come 

01:39:28.468 --> 01:39:30.468
with an exact product in mind.

01:39:31.552 --> 01:39:33.796
I come with a problem that I 
want to solve.  Maybe I'm 

01:39:33.797 --> 01:39:36.040
thinking it is time to replace 
my old sofa or perhaps I'm 

01:39:38.676 --> 01:39:42.793
thinking of getting some shirts 
that aren't just black or gray. 

01:39:42.794 --> 01:39:47.470
I'm  not.  If I was, what I 
would need is a way of narrowing

01:39:47.471 --> 01:39:49.471
down that wider selection 

01:39:50.943 --> 01:39:52.943
to the end product.

01:39:55.225 --> 01:39:57.691
As mentioned, we'll look at Ali 
and what they're doing.  Here 

01:39:57.692 --> 01:39:59.947
you see the filtering and 
sorting, we see the dropdown 

01:39:59.948 --> 01:40:03.805
there that let's me sort by 
price and we can see the 

01:40:03.806 --> 01:40:07.312
side-bar coming  outletting me 
filter by color.  Let's see how 

01:40:07.313 --> 01:40:11.401
we can create some of these 
components in AMP.  Starting 

01:40:11.402 --> 01:40:13.648
with filtering, you can see in 
this simplified Example there 

01:40:13.649 --> 01:40:16.495
are two main components.  We 
have got the list of products we

01:40:18.122 --> 01:40:21.006
want to display at the bottom 
and we have the controls to 

01:40:21.007 --> 01:40:23.467
filter them at the top.
  Let's look at that AMP list 

01:40:23.468 --> 01:40:25.468
tag first.

01:40:28.609 --> 01:40:32.513
The source attribute here is 
specifying a JSON endpoint.  

01:40:32.514 --> 01:40:34.136
That first source attribute is 
the default full list of 

01:40:34.137 --> 01:40:36.774
products.  The second source 
attribute is in square brackets.

01:40:38.833 --> 01:40:42.174
That's because we're using the 
functionality of AMP bind here. 

01:40:42.175 --> 01:40:45.086
The brackets tell us that we 
want to bind the value of the 

01:40:45.087 --> 01:40:48.447
list source variable to the 
source attribute and that means 

01:40:48.448 --> 01:40:50.448
when list source changes, 

01:40:52.167 --> 01:40:53.995
we're going to update our list.
  Now we need to provide UI to 

01:40:53.996 --> 01:40:55.996
allow the user to change that 
variable.

01:40:59.478 --> 01:41:01.922
Since AMP is still HTML we can 
use the stand controls here.  

01:41:01.923 --> 01:41:04.587
You have the radio button to 
toggle the color.  You can see 

01:41:04.588 --> 01:41:06.588
that I have populated the 

01:41:08.242 --> 01:41:09.677
on attribute, this is a 
convention for creating an event

01:41:09.678 --> 01:41:13.759
listener.  I'm listening for the
change event.  When I get there,

01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:17.620
I'm going to update list source 
to include yellow if the option 

01:41:17.621 --> 01:41:20.865
is checked.  That's it.  If the 
color -- if I select color in 

01:41:21.876 --> 01:41:24.147
the form, that updates the 
variable and the list will re.

01:41:24.351 --> 01:41:28.826
  Let's generalize that pattern.
What you do here, you set up the

01:41:28.827 --> 01:41:33.541
list for a dynamic source and 
then you add form controls to 

01:41:33.542 --> 01:41:36.997
update the source.  It is 
simple.  It is flexible.  

01:41:36.998 --> 01:41:39.842
Hopefully to improve that, I'll 
show you a couple of other 

01:41:39.843 --> 01:41:41.843
applications of this.

01:41:43.931 --> 01:41:45.765
If be jump over to sorting them 
we have the same lists on the 

01:41:45.766 --> 01:41:50.644
bottom and top.  The difference 
here, instead of alternating the

01:41:50.645 --> 01:41:53.083
path on the variable I had 
before, I'm pulling out the 

01:41:53.084 --> 01:41:55.765
event value and dropping that 
straight into the GET parameter.

01:41:58.439 --> 01:42:00.276
Here if we want to add a new 
option like sort by rating, then

01:42:00.277 --> 01:42:04.357
all we have to do is support it 
on our endpoint and then we just

01:42:04.358 --> 01:42:09.036
add that option into the form 
and it is going to work.

01:42:11.696 --> 01:42:13.523
It is not just static controls 
either.  We can use the same 

01:42:13.524 --> 01:42:18.010
functionality to take a value 
that the user types and pass 

01:42:18.011 --> 01:42:20.011
that along to our back end.

01:42:23.507 --> 01:42:25.340
You see here AirBnB 
experimenting on this for 

01:42:25.341 --> 01:42:28.798
Autosuggest on destinations.   
We'll look at this.  We're not 

01:42:28.799 --> 01:42:30.834
making use of the change event 
here, users may be typing faster

01:42:32.456 --> 01:42:34.456
than the service is returning 
results.

01:42:35.571 --> 01:42:37.604
Instead, we're making use of the
input debounced event and that 

01:42:37.605 --> 01:42:41.711
allows us to smooth that input 
out a little bit.  Then you have

01:42:41.712 --> 01:42:43.712
the familiar pattern.

01:42:46.020 --> 01:42:48.252
You type the query, it is in the
GET parameter, we have the 

01:42:48.253 --> 01:42:50.253
results.

01:42:52.806 --> 01:42:53.578
Finally then, the configuration 
of that list isn't always based 

01:42:53.579 --> 01:42:55.579
on user 

01:42:57.550 --> 01:42:59.550
input, but actually user 
context.

01:43:04.349 --> 01:43:04.926
In this example from the aptly 
named AMP by example.com we're 

01:43:04.927 --> 01:43:06.943
showing geo location.  Behind 
the scenes we're doing a geoip 

01:43:06.944 --> 01:43:08.983
look up on the server.  It is 
not precise location but general

01:43:08.984 --> 01:43:12.655
user area.  This is perfect for 
doing something like listing 

01:43:12.656 --> 01:43:15.313
nearby stores for product 
collection.  The touch I like 

01:43:15.314 --> 01:43:17.336
here, it is the dummy items 
beforehand so that we can see 

01:43:18.567 --> 01:43:20.567
something as the content is 
loading.

01:43:25.064 --> 01:43:27.499
Let's see how that is done.
  The call goes to the server 

01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:31.178
and you use the placeholder 
attribute.  At the bottom we're 

01:43:31.179 --> 01:43:33.823
using that to show that dummy 
item.  When the request comes 

01:43:33.824 --> 01:43:37.488
back, we're repliesing that with
the populated template and to 

01:43:37.489 --> 01:43:41.822
the user it looks like a smooth 
transition in.  Also, for a 

01:43:41.823 --> 01:43:43.823
bonus material, we 

01:43:46.161 --> 01:43:47.591
recently announced AMP geo 
letting you do location at the 

01:43:47.592 --> 01:43:50.261
country level which is useful 
for doing things like price 

01:43:53.925 --> 01:43:56.986
formatting or delivery options.
  Okay.  We'll take a breather. 

01:43:56.987 --> 01:43:59.005
We made it through the first 
stage of our funnel.  The one 

01:43:59.006 --> 01:44:01.006
thing we really want you to take
away from this section is that 

01:44:03.584 --> 01:44:05.426
speed is key for acquisition but
that doesn't mean you need to 

01:44:05.427 --> 01:44:07.427
sacrifice rich content as well.

01:44:10.295 --> 01:44:12.295
That simple pathway can let you 

01:44:14.165 --> 01:44:16.165
combine the speedy display of 
cached 

01:44:18.259 --> 01:44:20.496
content with Larrying in of 
personalized -- layering in of 

01:44:20.497 --> 01:44:22.570
data.
  &gt;&gt; Now we go and find the 

01:44:22.571 --> 01:44:26.657
product I want, we buy it.   The
steps I want to examine here 

01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:33.169
then, add to cart.  We'll stick 
here and see how they built this

01:44:33.170 --> 01:44:35.170
in-page experience with AMP.

01:44:36.439 --> 01:44:38.064
First we're going to need a 
structure to store the product 

01:44:38.065 --> 01:44:40.503
we want to add to the basket.  
We have populated that with the 

01:44:40.504 --> 01:44:43.157
data we know already.  That's 
the country  name, the price 

01:44:46.566 --> 01:44:48.565
formatting, the quantity, we 
have the null placeholders which

01:44:48.566 --> 01:44:51.923
are for the additional options 
that we'll configure in the 

01:44:51.924 --> 01:44:53.924
page.
  When these AMP fill in the 

01:44:55.788 --> 01:44:57.820
placeholders, when the user taps
on that size, we map that into 

01:44:57.821 --> 01:45:02.098
the data structure.  We also are
mapping it back to an element on

01:45:02.099 --> 01:45:04.099
the screen so that the user 

01:45:05.561 --> 01:45:07.561
has visual feedback that 
something has happened.

01:45:08.837 --> 01:45:11.278
We'll use AMP bind to map the 
product properties into the 

01:45:11.279 --> 01:45:14.746
hidden inputs of the add to cart
form.  Finally, the additional 

01:45:14.747 --> 01:45:16.747
ingredient 

01:45:18.462 --> 01:45:20.462
here, it is the action attribute
which 

01:45:21.763 --> 01:45:22.596
again is AMP convention for 
allowing the in-page form 

01:45:22.597 --> 01:45:27.682
request.  Now when the response 
comes back we can upgrade the 

01:45:27.683 --> 01:45:29.683
page and configure the message.

01:45:32.578 --> 01:45:34.202
So we have done add to cart with
in-page interactions in AMP 

01:45:34.203 --> 01:45:37.090
setting a high bar for speed.  
What happens when I make the 

01:45:38.517 --> 01:45:40.990
transition off of AMP?  If we 
present the user with a slow 

01:45:43.219 --> 01:45:45.255
spinner, we're burning all of 
that good will we built up in 

01:45:45.256 --> 01:45:47.921
the first stage.  Instead, while
we know we're making a 

01:45:50.571 --> 01:45:53.015
transition maybe from cache to 
hosted, from AMP to the wider PA

01:45:53.016 --> 01:45:56.078
world, we don't want the user to
know that.  We want it to feel 

01:45:56.079 --> 01:45:58.758
like a seamless consistent 
progression.

01:46:03.003 --> 01:46:05.003
Conveniently, that's a perfect 
segue 

01:46:07.478 --> 01:46:09.478
for progressive web apps, a 
service 

01:46:11.654 --> 01:46:12.672
worker can act like what caching
proxy service and that means we 

01:46:12.673 --> 01:46:14.673
can go ahead 

01:46:16.136 --> 01:46:18.136
and warm-up that cache before 
the user gets there.

01:46:20.637 --> 01:46:21.876
In our AMP content we make use 
of the AMP tag to start this 

01:46:21.877 --> 01:46:26.376
process.  We're providing the 
service worker location and a 

01:46:26.377 --> 01:46:28.377
frame on the domain because the 
service worker can only be 

01:46:29.484 --> 01:46:31.484
installed from the domain.  When
the install starts, we're ready 

01:46:33.751 --> 01:46:36.614
to start prepping that content. 
To show you a super simple base 

01:46:36.615 --> 01:46:41.121
here, and so in here, what we're
doing, we're doing the install 

01:46:41.122 --> 01:46:43.358
step, caching what I call the 
site furniture, so that stuff 

01:46:46.417 --> 01:46:48.910
like your fonts, header images, 
so on, and then we have a fetch 

01:46:48.911 --> 01:46:54.023
handler, when the user taps to 
go to the new page, that kicks 

01:46:54.024 --> 01:46:56.024
in and starts to use the cache 
content, this is a very tip of 

01:46:58.315 --> 01:47:00.761
what you can do so I highly 
recommend checking out the work 

01:47:00.762 --> 01:47:02.762
box library to get 

01:47:04.410 --> 01:47:06.410
production patterns to make use 
of here.

01:47:07.271 --> 01:47:09.098
We focused a lot on the fast 
pillar from our principle.   

01:47:09.099 --> 01:47:13.403
That's fine.  It is not the 
whole story.  Caching solves 

01:47:13.404 --> 01:47:15.838
some of the problems for 
browsing and not changes like 

01:47:15.839 --> 01:47:20.341
add to cart.  We don't want the 
user dropping out of this 

01:47:20.342 --> 01:47:24.237
critical stage just because the 
connection drops.  This was a 

01:47:24.238 --> 01:47:26.330
problem that one of the real 
pioneers of the commerce on the 

01:47:26.331 --> 01:47:28.331
web 

01:47:31.141 --> 01:47:33.141
set out to solve.  EBay is the

01:47:35.850 --> 01:47:37.997
online marketplace to find 1.1 
billion listings and they sell 

01:47:37.998 --> 01:47:39.998
over $23 billion of transactions
just in the 

01:47:43.086 --> 01:47:44.791
first quarter of this year 
alone.   Reliability is core to 

01:47:44.792 --> 01:47:47.640
that experience for them.  They 
have been working to enable 

01:47:47.641 --> 01:47:51.531
their add to cart button to work
offline.  I really love this use

01:47:51.532 --> 01:47:55.404
case.  It is not about trying to
make the entire site work 

01:47:55.405 --> 01:47:59.889
offline or do some crazy user 
experience.  They picked a 

01:47:59.890 --> 01:48:01.890
critical part of their 

01:48:03.150 --> 01:48:05.438
user journey and focused on 
making that reliable, solving a 

01:48:05.439 --> 01:48:07.439
real business problem.  That's 
the key.

01:48:10.355 --> 01:48:12.355
Don't think of offline and 
online as 

01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:15.458
binary states but think of 
robust independent add to cart, 

01:48:15.459 --> 01:48:18.416
that's not as catchy for putting
on a slide.

01:48:25.331 --> 01:48:27.331
So really what happens here, oh

01:48:31.087 --> 01:48:33.719
's   bay simplifies this 
experience.  I press it, they 

01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:35.720
take care of the rest.

01:48:37.244 --> 01:48:38.867
First, the default behavior, if 
I tap add to cart and the 

01:48:38.868 --> 01:48:42.740
connection is 23409 there, the 
request fails and drops out.  

01:48:42.741 --> 01:48:44.741
What do we need to do?

01:48:45.885 --> 01:48:47.322
Instead, when that request 
fails, we're going to capture 

01:48:47.323 --> 01:48:52.425
the details that we need to send
it again and save them.  When we

01:48:52.426 --> 01:48:54.426
reconnect, we retrieve that 

01:48:55.474 --> 01:48:57.474
data, recreate our request and 
send it.  Simple enough concept.

01:49:00.775 --> 01:49:03.257
Let's dive into a little code.
  First, let's go back to the 

01:49:03.258 --> 01:49:05.258
fetch handler again.

01:49:06.722 --> 01:49:08.151
I'm intercepting the add to cart
requests.  Always be specific 

01:49:08.152 --> 01:49:10.152
when doing something like this.

01:49:12.596 --> 01:49:14.596
You don't want unintended side 
effects interfering with other 

01:49:14.693 --> 01:49:16.324
requests from the.
  A.  Next, we fire off the 

01:49:16.325 --> 01:49:21.219
request.  If it succeeds, great,
we have nothing else to do.  

01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:26.308
However, if it fails, we want to
pull out the request details.  I

01:49:26.309 --> 01:49:28.156
have cloned the request, the 
body is read and you can only 

01:49:28.157 --> 01:49:30.605
reread it once.   I'm using the 
local forage library to 

01:49:33.658 --> 01:49:35.901
give a simple key value store 
and the current time stamp is my

01:49:35.902 --> 01:49:37.902
key and I'm 

01:49:38.952 --> 01:49:41.190
saving the request body.  Now we
have saved the request, we want 

01:49:43.429 --> 01:49:45.664
the matching functionality to 
retrieve that as well.   In this

01:49:45.665 --> 01:49:49.944
function, back in my compliant 
logic, I'm iterating through the

01:49:49.945 --> 01:49:51.567
existing increase and using this
time stamp to filter out the 

01:49:51.568 --> 01:49:54.825
ones from the last ten minutes. 
I don't want to randomly add 

01:49:54.826 --> 01:49:56.826
things to 

01:49:57.869 --> 01:50:00.115
the user cart hours later.
  I'm using that save data to 

01:50:00.116 --> 01:50:04.849
just build a new post request 
for the same add to cart action 

01:50:04.850 --> 01:50:08.929
and send it.   Finally, I have 
attached this function to listen

01:50:08.930 --> 01:50:10.965
for the online event in the 
browser and that means when the 

01:50:12.981 --> 01:50:14.830
page registers online again it 
will kick in and attempt to send

01:50:14.831 --> 01:50:16.831
all of those requests.

01:50:18.944 --> 01:50:21.175
You should also be hooking up in
other places as well such as 

01:50:21.176 --> 01:50:25.462
payload or service worker 
application.  For bonus content 

01:50:25.463 --> 01:50:27.463
as well, look at the background 
sync API for what you may be 

01:50:30.554 --> 01:50:32.196
able to do to assist in the 
future.

01:50:32.197 --> 01:50:34.634
Briefly then, because we have 
worked hard to get the user this

01:50:34.635 --> 01:50:36.635
far, we should probably take 
some money from them.

01:50:40.354 --> 01:50:41.600
That said, Adam and I have 
already crammed too much content

01:50:41.601 --> 01:50:44.469
in this talk.  We the want to 
shout out to some of the other 

01:50:44.470 --> 01:50:46.730
talks that are doing this.  In 
fact, directly after this, on 

01:50:46.731 --> 01:50:48.731
Stage 7 there is a Google pay 
best practices 

01:50:51.628 --> 01:50:53.628
talk if you want to keep the 
e-commerce theme going.

01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:56.366
With that, we're on to the home 
straight.  Let's look at what 

01:50:56.367 --> 01:50:59.670
the we can do after the sale to 
try to turn this person into a 

01:50:59.671 --> 01:51:03.747
repeat customer.  To have repeat
customers, they'll need to have 

01:51:03.748 --> 01:51:05.986
a way of actually getting back 
to us and add to home screen is 

01:51:05.987 --> 01:51:09.902
a way to do this.  It is super 
easy to implement.  It is not 

01:51:09.903 --> 01:51:12.134
always relevant.  The home 
screen is for daily quick 

01:51:15.406 --> 01:51:17.247
access and if you have an 
airline, a furniture company, 

01:51:17.248 --> 01:51:19.274
success for you is not measured 
in daily active users.

01:51:22.317 --> 01:51:24.357
The purchase patterns are 
seasonal or periodic.  What if 

01:51:24.358 --> 01:51:27.252
you can give me something 
personal instead.  Let's say I 

01:51:27.253 --> 01:51:29.253
have ordered that new sofa, on 
the order confirmation page you 

01:51:30.743 --> 01:51:32.795
can give me an option to track 
the order.  When I tap that, 

01:51:32.796 --> 01:51:34.796
I'll be prompted to add the 
order to my home screen.

01:51:37.721 --> 01:51:39.550
Let's look at how to make that 
happen.  On the confirmation 

01:51:39.551 --> 01:51:43.267
page we're linking to the 
manifest.  In this case, it is 

01:51:43.268 --> 01:51:45.268
not a static file, it is a 
dynamic resource.

01:51:49.377 --> 01:51:51.377
We'll populate it with a custom 
name, image, URL, so on.

01:51:53.717 --> 01:51:55.350
We don't want to randomly 
trigger this screen prompt, we 

01:51:55.351 --> 01:51:59.468
only want to do it in response 
to the button.  This is 

01:51:59.469 --> 01:52:01.469
something to add on all of the 
pages to ensure that you are 

01:52:03.133 --> 01:52:05.997
intercepting the app to home 
screen event.  We capture the 

01:52:05.998 --> 01:52:10.269
before install event and prevent
it from showing and retrigger it

01:52:10.270 --> 01:52:12.270
for the listener for the track 
order button.

01:52:12.526 --> 01:52:14.750
That's it.
  Now I have it right there on 

01:52:14.751 --> 01:52:18.638
the home screen and it is not 
the home page of the furniture 

01:52:18.639 --> 01:52:22.517
site but going to the current 
status of my order.  The benefit

01:52:22.518 --> 01:52:25.434
here, when my order is done you 
can maybe just show me a message

01:52:25.435 --> 01:52:27.435
saying it is fine for me to 

01:52:28.919 --> 01:52:30.759
delete the icon now or you can 
show me additional products and 

01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:32.760
perhaps I should 

01:52:34.085 --> 01:52:36.085
get that matching coffee table 
as well.

01:52:36.524 --> 01:52:38.391
Any way, if you do this, you 
need a way of measuring the 

01:52:38.392 --> 01:52:42.670
success and there are three 
places to check.  First, let's 

01:52:42.671 --> 01:52:45.928
revisit where we're triggering 
that prompt.  It is not 

01:52:45.929 --> 01:52:48.375
justifier and forget here.  We 
can expand the result of the 

01:52:48.376 --> 01:52:52.866
prompt.  In this case I'm firing
a Google analytic event for the 

01:52:52.867 --> 01:52:56.771
install and dismissed events.  
Next up, you can use the unique 

01:52:59.238 --> 01:53:00.463
location for your start URL that
will only be used by the 

01:53:00.464 --> 01:53:05.743
manifest.  Again, I just added 
Google analytics campaign 

01:53:05.744 --> 01:53:07.744
parameters on the end of the 
URL.

01:53:08.417 --> 01:53:10.245
For the final signal we'll make 
use of this display standalone 

01:53:10.246 --> 01:53:12.246
property and 

01:53:17.859 --> 01:53:17.920
that's what's causing the app to
launch in its own window without

01:53:17.921 --> 01:53:19.921
the browser controls and turns 
out that this can be 

01:53:22.873 --> 01:53:24.109
matched with the media query.   
Here we're using match media to 

01:53:24.110 --> 01:53:26.110
detect standalone mode and 
trigger 

01:53:28.948 --> 01:53:31.013
another analytic event.  This is
important because users may deep

01:53:31.014 --> 01:53:35.280
link in the web app and they're 
not triggering a launch from the

01:53:31.014 --> 01:53:33.432
home screen.  There you go.   
With these three signals, you 

01:53:33.433 --> 01:53:35.433
are now 

01:53:37.296 --> 01:53:39.296
measuring installs, launches, 
usage for the app.

01:53:41.389 --> 01:53:44.269
Since I mentioned other things 
with the app, I want to end with

01:53:46.297 --> 01:53:49.168
notifications, I'm not showing 
code, that's the easy parted.  

01:53:49.169 --> 01:53:50.827
Potentially it is even too easy 
because I keep hitting sites 

01:53:50.828 --> 01:53:54.725
that as soon as you land on the 
domain ask you for the 

01:53:54.726 --> 01:53:56.782
notification permission.  This 
is spammy behavior which hurts 

01:53:57.828 --> 01:54:02.706
the ecosystem.  When I say hurts
the ecosystem, I mean, it hurts 

01:54:02.707 --> 01:54:05.612
you as developers because we 
start making it harder to use 

01:54:05.613 --> 01:54:07.613
these features.

01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:10.519
I want to be able to get useful 
push notifications, and to do 

01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:12.798
that, I need all of you to 
really champion the best 

01:54:14.232 --> 01:54:15.857
practices here.
  So I want you to make sure 

01:54:15.858 --> 01:54:21.206
that every notification you send
satisfies these three things, 

01:54:21.207 --> 01:54:24.085
who, it should be personal 
information to me, my delivery 

01:54:24.086 --> 01:54:28.382
or a sale on an item I'm 
watching.  Then what, as in 

01:54:28.383 --> 01:54:32.292
what's actually happened, if you
can give me everything I need 

01:54:32.293 --> 01:54:35.138
concisely in the notification I 
may not even need to tap it.  

01:54:35.139 --> 01:54:39.654
When?  That means sending them 
at appropriate times and 

01:54:39.655 --> 01:54:41.889
expiring them when no longer 
needed.  What's that look like 

01:54:41.890 --> 01:54:44.936
when you pull it altogether?  It
looks like this.

01:54:46.782 --> 01:54:47.799
It is personal to me, it gives 
me enough information to act 

01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:51.304
without tapping, that 5-minutes 
warning was worth interrupting 

01:54:51.305 --> 01:54:55.992
me.  If that's the case, I 
better head over there so I can 

01:54:55.993 --> 01:54:57.993
relax on the new sofa and 

01:55:00.846 --> 01:55:02.846
I'll hand it back over to Adam.
  &gt;&gt; Adam:  Thank you.

01:55:06.176 --> 01:55:06.798
Using the service worker and 
building a PA means an uptick in

01:55:06.799 --> 01:55:10.270
business metrics just like we 
saw early earlier with AMP.  In 

01:55:10.271 --> 01:55:11.911
Starbucks for example, they 
launched a PA last year and they

01:55:11.912 --> 01:55:16.395
have seen the daily and monthly 
active users in this format 

01:55:16.396 --> 01:55:21.285
double.  That's the full funnel 
going from acquisition via super

01:55:21.286 --> 01:55:24.141
fast entry pages using AMP to 
converting and retaining users 

01:55:24.142 --> 01:55:27.608
via PA.   We have talked a lot 
about how the technologies work 

01:55:27.609 --> 01:55:30.068
separately and we want to 
highlight that they can work 

01:55:30.069 --> 01:55:32.100
together and there are different
patterns to do so.

01:55:35.185 --> 01:55:36.869
After all, in the case of both 
AMP and PA we're talking about 

01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:41.138
web pages.  The two technologies
are complimentary ways of 

01:55:41.139 --> 01:55:43.139
achieving different goals, each 

01:55:46.439 --> 01:55:48.439
with their own strengths and 
challenges.

01:55:50.083 --> 01:55:52.987
When they're combined, you enjoy
the benefits of both, AMP and PA

01:55:52.988 --> 01:55:55.627
givens you a feature-rich 
experience that stays and starts

01:55:55.628 --> 01:55:57.628
fast.

01:56:00.395 --> 01:56:01.825
The first example here, 1-800 
flowers delivering flowers angus

01:56:01.826 --> 01:56:03.826
to 150 

01:56:05.117 --> 01:56:06.947
countries around the globe 
linking AMP pages serving as an 

01:56:06.948 --> 01:56:08.948
entry point in the site to a PA.

01:56:10.438 --> 01:56:12.077
Within that PA they are 
leveraging the Google sign on as

01:56:12.078 --> 01:56:15.125
an identity solution and they're
allowing users to check out via 

01:56:15.126 --> 01:56:17.126
Google pay.

01:56:18.383 --> 01:56:20.832
It is a great example of 
utilizing AMP and PA together 

01:56:20.833 --> 01:56:22.873
but several pieces of the mobile
web toolkit and in early 

01:56:26.536 --> 01:56:29.426
testing, they showed 150% 
conversion increase with the PA.

01:56:33.863 --> 01:56:35.863
Shop clues, a

01:56:37.174 --> 01:56:39.174
leader in India launched an app 
in PA 

01:56:40.857 --> 01:56:43.092
last year and similar to 1-80 
flowers, they're using this as 

01:56:43.093 --> 01:56:45.731
entry points and linking to a 
PA.  The framework helped them 

01:56:45.732 --> 01:56:49.794
see an increase in conversions, 
Roo reduction in load time and 

01:56:49.795 --> 01:56:51.795
reduction in bounce rate.

01:56:55.255 --> 01:56:57.255
The pattern of linking to the

01:56:58.612 --> 01:56:59.859
AMPs into a PA is not the only 
solution.  There is another one 

01:56:59.860 --> 01:57:02.733
that's starting to emerge, you 
use the two together in the same

01:57:02.734 --> 01:57:07.293
document.  When a user visits 
such a page through an AMP cache

01:57:07.294 --> 01:57:08.714
they get the AMP page, when 
continuing the journey on the 

01:57:08.715 --> 01:57:13.248
site origin they get the full 
AMP and PA experience, including

01:57:13.249 --> 01:57:16.319
the speed and turn key use of 
AMP and extended capabilities of

01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:21.015
PA.   The simplest first step to
do this is what we showed  

01:57:21.016 --> 01:57:23.016
earlier, just to add a 

01:57:24.283 --> 01:57:27.146
service workinger with basic 
caching to an existing page.  

01:57:27.147 --> 01:57:29.250
With that, you can layer on 
others as you like and that 

01:57:29.251 --> 01:57:33.479
includes push notifications, 
advanced caching and offline 

01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:36.127
support and add to home screen 
prompt.   Annual the alternate 

01:57:36.128 --> 01:57:38.128
pattern is to 

01:57:39.814 --> 01:57:42.070
use this for an AMP function 
which is then function pages.  

01:57:42.071 --> 01:57:43.472
This can be a little more 
complex and it may require a 

01:57:43.473 --> 01:57:45.473
little more work to make it 
work.

01:57:46.923 --> 01:57:49.996
We have seen some sites do so 
including carve.com, an online 

01:57:49.997 --> 01:57:55.131
retailer making phone cases and 
the global car brand BMW.  A 

01:57:55.132 --> 01:57:57.389
benefit from either pattern, on 
top of speed and performance is 

01:57:57.390 --> 01:58:02.702
that they simply build on any 
investment you made with AMP and

01:58:02.703 --> 01:58:05.143
you use that work.
  That's about it.  We have 

01:58:05.144 --> 01:58:07.646
learned a few things today.   
How to start fast with the AMP 

01:58:07.647 --> 01:58:09.680
pages and stay fast with the PA.

01:58:12.890 --> 01:58:14.890
You can successful

01:58:16.166 --> 01:58:20.903
ly combine.  We have talked 
about AMP pages and sending 

01:58:20.904 --> 01:58:22.904
notifications via the web to the
users.

01:58:24.820 --> 01:58:27.272
We talked about service worker 
and AMP custom library and 

01:58:27.273 --> 01:58:29.729
companies seeing success with 
the formats and some seeing 

01:58:31.568 --> 01:58:33.632
success by combining the formats
together.  The bottom line is, 

01:58:33.633 --> 01:58:38.391
we know the web has amazing 
reach and the tools now exist to

01:58:38.392 --> 01:58:40.392
help ensure the capabilities 

01:58:42.699 --> 01:58:44.750
with and the web has engagement 
and profitability as well.  

01:58:44.751 --> 01:58:46.751
Check out the documentation on 
the 

01:58:48.622 --> 01:58:49.838
websites or stick around to ask 
questions and we'll be here and 

01:58:49.839 --> 01:58:53.154
then be in the sandbox  later.  
We can't wait to see what you 

01:58:53.155 --> 01:58:57.655
build.  Thank you.  

02:11:20.353 --> 02:11:22.353
How AMP Has Evolved Beyond Web 
Pages

02:16:18.847 --> 02:16:20.847
How AMP Has Evolved Beyond Web 
Pages

02:24:06.614 --> 02:24:09.690
.
  &gt;&gt; Good morning!  How is 

02:24:09.691 --> 02:24:11.691
everyone doing?

02:24:13.098 --> 02:24:16.037
(Vamsee  Jasti) and I'm a 
software engineer.

02:24:17.264 --> 02:24:19.264
We have a lot to cover.  Let's 
go.

02:24:22.997 --> 02:24:26.469
  &gt;&gt; VAMSEE JASTI: The web used 
to look like this, made up of 

02:24:26.470 --> 02:24:29.111
destinations that people 
remembered and went to.   

02:24:29.112 --> 02:24:30.731
However, the web is 
transitioning to a 

02:24:30.732 --> 02:24:32.732
post-destination era.

02:24:34.849 --> 02:24:37.024
Users' browser plans changed on 
the web because of social, 

02:24:37.025 --> 02:24:39.025
mobile and search 

02:24:40.237 --> 02:24:41.693
which means that users finding 
content across all sorts of 

02:24:41.694 --> 02:24:43.694
devices and 

02:24:45.390 --> 02:24:47.234
platforms like aggregators, chat
apps, social websites and search

02:24:47.235 --> 02:24:49.235
and many others.

02:24:51.099 --> 02:24:53.099
With AMP we saw an opportunity 
to help 

02:24:54.150 --> 02:24:55.811
developers have their 
experiences and content 

02:24:55.812 --> 02:24:57.440
transition to this 
post-destination era and today 

02:24:57.441 --> 02:25:02.129
we're going to tell you how.
  For those of you that haven't 

02:25:02.130 --> 02:25:05.825
heard of AMP, it is an Open 
Source web development framework

02:25:05.826 --> 02:25:10.735
making it super easy to build 
excellent web pages.  With AMP 

02:25:10.736 --> 02:25:12.736
it is hard to make web pages 

02:25:14.819 --> 02:25:17.486
that are slow, not impossible 
but hard.  When we launched AMP 

02:25:17.487 --> 02:25:19.139
we want to ensure that 
developers have full control 

02:25:19.140 --> 02:25:21.608
over the brand so we provide 
support for 

02:25:25.323 --> 02:25:27.167
custom CSS and we want to ensure
that AMP developers are able to 

02:25:27.168 --> 02:25:29.168
make revenue 

02:25:31.219 --> 02:25:33.675
off of these AMP pages and we 
provided support and robust 

02:25:33.676 --> 02:25:36.120
paywall support.
  Since its launch, more than 3 

02:25:36.121 --> 02:25:40.187
years ago, AMP is fully 
transitioned from a platform 

02:25:40.188 --> 02:25:43.061
that was mostly meant for static
web pages to one that gives 

02:25:44.679 --> 02:25:46.748
developers flexibility to build 
interactive dynamic experiences.

02:25:49.188 --> 02:25:51.435
Developers can build pages with 
wish lists, interactive product 

02:25:54.089 --> 02:25:56.750
customizations, filtering, 
sorting, you name it.  

02:25:56.751 --> 02:25:58.751
Therefore, a number of 
e-commerce 

02:26:00.461 --> 02:26:02.721
publishers including the one 
here from AliExpress are 

02:26:02.722 --> 02:26:04.825
transitioning the entire sites 
to AMP.

02:26:08.145 --> 02:26:09.118
Adding all of this new 
capability, the AMP teamworks 

02:26:09.119 --> 02:26:11.119
really hard to ensure that the 
performance of the page and 

02:26:12.207 --> 02:26:14.207
sites remain still great.

02:26:16.476 --> 02:26:19.147
For example, the speed of an AMP
page is less than a second from 

02:26:19.148 --> 02:26:22.418
the search corpus.  This talk is
not about performance.

02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:29.320
This talk is about how AMP can 
help 

02:26:30.790 --> 02:26:32.871
you content and experience 
creators build for the  

02:26:32.872 --> 02:26:34.872
post-destination era.  How do 
you do that?

02:26:36.962 --> 02:26:38.962
You ensure that the content and 

02:26:40.374 --> 02:26:42.374
experiences work

02:26:44.301 --> 02:26:46.301
well when embedded in 
aggregators.

02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:49.360
AMP was built for embeddablety 
since day one.

02:26:51.236 --> 02:26:53.081
Fun fact, before it was called 
AMP it was PCUs or portable 

02:26:53.082 --> 02:26:55.082
content units which 

02:26:56.782 --> 02:27:00.082
were supposed to be widgets that
lived everywhere on the web.  

02:27:00.083 --> 02:27:01.717
Spoiler alert, we think you 
should build your experiences 

02:27:01.718 --> 02:27:06.641
with AMP because the principles 
that AMP is built on top of 

02:27:06.642 --> 02:27:09.897
lends itself really well for  
embeddablety.  Before we look at

02:27:09.898 --> 02:27:14.394
the principles, I would like to 
give a preview on the products 

02:27:14.395 --> 02:27:16.054
AMP has fueled that were 
previously not possible in the 

02:27:16.055 --> 02:27:20.740
context of embeddablety.   With 
AMP for email, we'll see how AMP

02:27:22.805 --> 02:27:24.805
is fundamentally changing email 
to make 

02:27:25.872 --> 02:27:27.872
it more realtime and dynamic.

02:27:28.951 --> 02:27:32.418
No more leaving email to get 
things done.  

02:27:35.490 --> 02:27:36.928
With AMP HTML ads we'll show you
how everything is more secure 

02:27:36.929 --> 02:27:38.929
and performing.

02:27:40.005 --> 02:27:41.625
With actions we'll show you how 
AMP is helping getting things 

02:27:41.626 --> 02:27:44.116
done on the web with a few taps.

02:27:47.625 --> 02:27:50.108
With zero-click AMP we can see 
how to get to content for users 

02:27:50.109 --> 02:27:54.618
before they even ask for it.  
Yes.  Yes!  We'll see how AMP is

02:27:54.619 --> 02:27:57.873
going to help users get to 
things even before they ask for 

02:27:57.874 --> 02:28:02.170
it.  Last, one more thing, 
regrettably, you'll have -- 

02:28:02.171 --> 02:28:04.171
you'll wait until the end to 
find out about it.

02:28:06.684 --> 02:28:08.684
Now I would like to invite you 
to tell 

02:28:10.837 --> 02:28:12.837
us about the principles beyond 
why AMP 

02:28:14.306 --> 02:28:16.306
is great and a good fit for  
post-destination experiences.

02:28:19.435 --> 02:28:23.321
  &gt;&gt; Thank you.
  Before we look at the AMP 

02:28:23.322 --> 02:28:25.322
principles 

02:28:26.619 --> 02:28:29.063
we should look at issues the 
wait this works on the web 

02:28:29.064 --> 02:28:31.967
today, from there we'll get a 
better understanding of why AMP 

02:28:31.968 --> 02:28:33.968
is 

02:28:35.040 --> 02:28:37.040
great for embeddablety.

02:28:40.932 --> 02:28:42.353
Current technologies like i 
frames and web views have three 

02:28:42.354 --> 02:28:44.354
major issues, 

02:28:53.880 --> 02:28:58.013
they're not performance perform 
plant, secure or functional.  

02:28:53.880 --> 02:28:55.880
Let's look at them one by one.

02:28:59.843 --> 02:28:59.858
First, performance, there is no 
guarantee that embedded page 

02:28:59.859 --> 02:29:02.080
would be perform performant so a
host is likely to have the 

02:29:02.081 --> 02:29:04.081
embedded content to create a 

02:29:07.143 --> 02:29:08.880
faster user experience since 
Java script is -- not it mention

02:29:08.881 --> 02:29:10.881
the privacy 

02:29:12.330 --> 02:29:14.330
of making user data in this 
scenarios.

02:29:15.591 --> 02:29:20.315
Next, embedded page may bring 
security issues to the host.  We

02:29:20.316 --> 02:29:22.962
know that scripts bringsor 
brings all kinds of security 

02:29:22.963 --> 02:29:24.963
hosts, even if 

02:29:26.018 --> 02:29:28.018
properly sandboxed within i 
frame 

02:29:29.466 --> 02:29:31.466
unknown Java script can install 
malware 

02:29:32.726 --> 02:29:36.031
or bit coins without user 
permission in the background.  

02:29:36.032 --> 02:29:38.032
Technologies like feature policy
may 

02:29:40.303 --> 02:29:43.176
be able to solve this by 
allowing the host to selectively

02:29:43.177 --> 02:29:45.177
enable and disable 

02:29:46.635 --> 02:29:48.681
uses of various process features
and APIs but unfortunately it is

02:29:48.682 --> 02:29:50.682
not available today.

02:29:53.769 --> 02:29:56.052
Of course, a page can cling to 
the host that it is safe to 

02:29:56.053 --> 02:29:58.053
embed.

02:29:59.337 --> 02:30:01.337
There is no way to guarantee  
that.

02:30:02.833 --> 02:30:04.667
Finally, since there is no 
communication between the host 

02:30:04.668 --> 02:30:06.668
and the 

02:30:08.980 --> 02:30:11.828
embedded page, the host has to 
treat it as a black box veerly 

02:30:11.829 --> 02:30:13.829
restricting 

02:30:16.725 --> 02:30:18.725
product experience that builds 
with 

02:30:19.785 --> 02:30:22.021
communications built on a 
standardized protocol.  As shown

02:30:22.022 --> 02:30:24.022
here, the embedded page will 

02:30:27.146 --> 02:30:29.146
not be able to know when you 
have user 

02:30:31.449 --> 02:30:33.486
not even with the native 
observer API supported because 

02:30:33.487 --> 02:30:35.522
it is sandboxing across the 
domain i  frame.

02:30:39.376 --> 02:30:41.624
Because of this, basic features 
like video autoplay or 

02:30:41.625 --> 02:30:44.501
viewablety tracking are not 
available.

02:30:46.967 --> 02:30:48.967
We have briefly talked about the

02:30:50.425 --> 02:30:52.425
concerns and issues with the 
embedded technologies today.

02:30:54.512 --> 02:30:56.756
With that in mind, let's now 
take a look at the AMP principle

02:30:56.757 --> 02:30:59.204
that provides excellent support 
to embeddablety and 

02:31:04.768 --> 02:31:05.801
why many hosts have chosen AMP 
as the technology for 

02:31:05.802 --> 02:31:10.124
embeddablety.  We'll cover the 
principles in three parts and 

02:31:10.125 --> 02:31:12.125
the first is  privacy-preserved 
prerenderring.

02:31:14.611 --> 02:31:16.895
That's a tongue twister.
  Apart from the performance 

02:31:16.896 --> 02:31:18.896
benefit to 

02:31:20.159 --> 02:31:22.610
you by using the AMP library, 
host can further optimize and 

02:31:22.611 --> 02:31:24.611
provide instant 

02:31:25.902 --> 02:31:29.154
loading experience by 
prerenderring AMP documents.   

02:31:29.155 --> 02:31:31.155
Prerendering here is referring 
to the 

02:31:32.231 --> 02:31:34.231
host downloading and rendering 
documents 

02:31:35.692 --> 02:31:38.359
before a user explicitly 
expressed their intent.  As you 

02:31:38.360 --> 02:31:40.360
see from the demo here, instant 

02:31:42.444 --> 02:31:44.519
loading is clearly experiencing 
what the user will love.

02:31:47.992 --> 02:31:50.649
Despite a great user experience 
that prerenderring provides you,

02:31:50.650 --> 02:31:55.735
it ends up using a lot of 
bandwidth and CPU.  That's the 

02:31:55.736 --> 02:31:58.620
reason why host won't just 
normally go ahead and prerender 

02:31:58.621 --> 02:32:00.621
many 

02:32:01.623 --> 02:32:03.754
embedded documents.  Documents 
on the other hand are 

02:32:07.586 --> 02:32:08.693
optimized to only render 
light-weighted resources that is

02:32:08.694 --> 02:32:11.762
above the folder.  Let's take a 
look at the code here.

02:32:17.117 --> 02:32:19.117
Here you will find AMP will 
calculate 

02:32:20.833 --> 02:32:22.833
a prerender rectangle and will 
only load 

02:32:24.380 --> 02:32:26.845
resources within the rectangle 
and it will be the first view 

02:32:26.846 --> 02:32:29.100
port.  This can be over ridden 
by the host to 

02:32:33.587 --> 02:32:36.240
customize the size based on real
product needs.  Next you will 

02:32:36.241 --> 02:32:38.241
find apart from the 

02:32:41.360 --> 02:32:43.668
first port restrictions and also
delays loading of happy weighted

02:32:43.669 --> 02:32:45.669
resources in 

02:32:47.694 --> 02:32:49.727
terms of CPU after the-page is 
visible.  The fact that AMP 

02:32:49.728 --> 02:32:51.728
documents only rendered 
light-weighted resources that 

02:32:53.212 --> 02:32:55.212
are above the folder that help 
to 

02:32:58.128 --> 02:33:00.128
minimize the usage of CPU and 
bandwidth 

02:33:01.618 --> 02:33:03.661
allowing the host to prerender 
the AMP HTML documents more 

02:33:03.662 --> 02:33:06.562
aggressively compared to regular
HTML documents.

02:33:09.608 --> 02:33:12.091
Because of this, there's a much 
higher chance that instant 

02:33:12.092 --> 02:33:14.092
loading experience is delivered 
and the user can see the 

02:33:19.092 --> 02:33:20.317
content the moment they want it.
  I believe some of the 

02:33:20.318 --> 02:33:22.318
audiences have 

02:33:23.824 --> 02:33:25.245
noticed a big challenge with 
prerenderring, and that's how to

02:33:25.246 --> 02:33:29.924
protect user data -- user 
privacy.  If this is unclear to 

02:33:29.925 --> 02:33:32.810
you, I would like to explain the
issue behind.

02:33:37.076 --> 02:33:38.915
Prerendering requires 
downloading the document before 

02:33:38.916 --> 02:33:41.404
user clicks, otherwise instant 
loading is not possible 

02:33:43.699 --> 02:33:45.699
especially on mobile  devices.

02:33:47.191 --> 02:33:49.251
This means that the owner of the
page that's been prefetched may 

02:33:49.252 --> 02:33:51.252
be able to 

02:33:54.205 --> 02:33:56.032
set a cookie and then later on 
target your ad based on that 

02:33:56.033 --> 02:33:58.033
cookie even though you never 
ended up on that page.

02:34:01.341 --> 02:34:03.795
Apart from that, rendering 
documents beforehand makes it 

02:34:03.796 --> 02:34:05.796
possible to fire 

02:34:06.868 --> 02:34:08.868
tracking Pixel before the page 
view.

02:34:10.205 --> 02:34:12.205
Luckily AMP documents counts 
what 

02:34:13.697 --> 02:34:15.697
privacy preserved prerenderring 
support built in from day one.

02:34:18.999 --> 02:34:20.999
To protect user privacy, 
trackers and 

02:34:22.460 --> 02:34:24.082
analytics must be delayed until 
the user has explicitly 

02:34:24.083 --> 02:34:26.083
expressed their intent to 

02:34:28.366 --> 02:34:30.827
see the document, AMP controls 
this with a a centralized 

02:34:30.828 --> 02:34:32.828
resource manager and 

02:34:34.129 --> 02:34:36.793
this manager blocks all 
components and services that 

02:34:36.794 --> 02:34:38.794
make external requests before 
page view.

02:34:40.483 --> 02:34:42.483
For example, the AMP Pixel and 
AMP 

02:34:43.795 --> 02:34:45.795
analytic component are blocked.

02:34:48.091 --> 02:34:50.329
The AMP cache adds additional 
privacy protection on top of 

02:34:50.330 --> 02:34:52.330
that as mentioned 

02:34:53.636 --> 02:34:55.636
before, AMP cache is an 
important part 

02:34:57.724 --> 02:34:59.362
of the AMP ecosystem, it is the 
proxy based account delivery 

02:34:59.363 --> 02:35:04.477
network for delivering valid 
documents only.  One of its 

02:35:04.478 --> 02:35:07.347
major purpose is to allowing AMP
documents to be preloaded 

02:35:10.233 --> 02:35:12.692
efficiently and safely.  With 
prefetch requests going to the 

02:35:14.951 --> 02:35:16.770
AMP cache, page owner won't be 
aware of the requests and then 

02:35:16.771 --> 02:35:18.771
won't be able to 

02:35:21.298 --> 02:35:23.298
set cookies before user 
expressed their interests.

02:35:24.994 --> 02:35:27.641
We have talked about security, 
we have talked about privacy, 

02:35:27.642 --> 02:35:31.508
next let's talk about security 
and why host can safely embed 

02:35:31.509 --> 02:35:34.186
AMP pages.  There are two ways 
to think of security.

02:35:37.275 --> 02:35:39.275
One, from the perspective of the

02:35:40.534 --> 02:35:42.825
embedded page, and the other one
from the content that's trying 

02:35:42.826 --> 02:35:45.883
to embed content.  We'll be 
focusing on another one 

02:35:49.102 --> 02:35:50.318
today, after all if a page isn't
guaranteed to be safe, the host 

02:35:50.319 --> 02:35:54.880
won't embed it.  So what's the 
mechanism here that 

02:35:57.957 --> 02:35:59.992
makes a host to be able to trust
an embedded AMP page.

02:36:03.889 --> 02:36:06.127
May I present you the AMP 
validator.  The AMP validator 

02:36:06.128 --> 02:36:08.128
makes it possible 

02:36:10.437 --> 02:36:13.295
for a host to verify that an 
embedded page is guaranteed AMP 

02:36:13.296 --> 02:36:15.296
and has no security 
vulnerabilities.

02:36:16.777 --> 02:36:18.624
Here is an example of the online
version of the AMP validator 

02:36:18.625 --> 02:36:20.625
tool.

02:36:22.934 --> 02:36:25.389
This tool creates a common 
agreement that both the content 

02:36:25.390 --> 02:36:27.390
creator and host 

02:36:30.324 --> 02:36:31.529
can both agree upon for secure 
embedding.  Problem solved, 

02:36:31.530 --> 02:36:33.530
right?

02:36:34.851 --> 02:36:40.347
Well, not  exactly.  Realtime 
validation can be very expensive

02:36:40.348 --> 02:36:42.787
and not practical.  The host 
made a better way to verify 

02:36:47.045 --> 02:36:50.154
the validity of an AMP document 
much faster.  Cache provides the

02:36:50.155 --> 02:36:54.645
answer here.  The host can 
deliver documents from the AMP 

02:36:54.646 --> 02:36:56.646
cache without realtime 

02:36:58.305 --> 02:37:00.305
validation since AMP cache will 
only 

02:37:01.762 --> 02:37:04.668
extract valid documents.
  This is the end of the story 

02:37:04.669 --> 02:37:06.669
if AMP is 

02:37:08.573 --> 02:37:10.842
only designed for fully-formed 
web pages, but with these 

02:37:10.843 --> 02:37:13.069
features and capabilities, AMP 
can be used to work 

02:37:16.570 --> 02:37:18.570
across multiple contacts and 
with each 

02:37:21.529 --> 02:37:25.647
individual context AMP supports 
a unique spec and validator.  

02:37:25.648 --> 02:37:27.648
For example, there is a 
different spec 

02:37:29.736 --> 02:37:31.783
for AMP HTML ads versus AMP 
HTML.  We need to do this 

02:37:31.784 --> 02:37:33.784
because, for 

02:37:35.441 --> 02:37:37.441
example, the AMP i frame 
components, it 

02:37:40.536 --> 02:37:42.536
is not allowed as part of an ad 
because 

02:37:43.866 --> 02:37:46.315
it could embed  non-content in 
the ad and will use the 

02:37:46.316 --> 02:37:48.316
performance guarantees.

02:37:50.612 --> 02:37:53.459
From the two validation examples
here you can find that the same 

02:37:53.460 --> 02:37:56.310
set of HTML results in different
validation status 

02:38:00.593 --> 02:38:03.430
when different spec is being 
applied.  Last, let's talk about

02:38:03.431 --> 02:38:07.937
the interface between the host 
and the embed and the two-way 

02:38:07.938 --> 02:38:09.938
communication protocol that 

02:38:13.109 --> 02:38:15.961
helps to solve a number of 
issues.  I want to introduce 

02:38:15.962 --> 02:38:19.647
this with an example.  Let's 
look at this graph.  Say I want 

02:38:19.648 --> 02:38:22.491
a product like this.  If I go 
search for pandas, I get all 

02:38:25.759 --> 02:38:27.759
of the related articles in one 
place.

02:38:29.265 --> 02:38:31.540
This requires the host to embed 
a number of AMP documents and 

02:38:31.541 --> 02:38:33.541
place each 

02:38:35.579 --> 02:38:37.853
of them inside a full- screen i 
frame.  What is the problem 

02:38:37.854 --> 02:38:39.854
here?

02:38:41.089 --> 02:38:43.089
We know that the i frame will 
consume 

02:38:45.174 --> 02:38:47.174
all user interactions so how 
would a 

02:38:48.488 --> 02:38:50.734
user still swipe around and 
navigate between different 

02:38:50.735 --> 02:38:52.735
documents.  With AMP, this is 
possible.

02:38:55.453 --> 02:38:57.453
Let's dive deeper with some 
code.

02:38:59.772 --> 02:39:01.772
Here you will find AMP documents
will 

02:39:02.861 --> 02:39:04.861
propagate all end use events and
send the event to the host.

02:39:07.127 --> 02:39:09.162
The host can then handle this 
touch event as if it is native 

02:39:09.163 --> 02:39:14.512
touch event from the browser, 
this enables user to navigate 

02:39:14.513 --> 02:39:16.513
between different documents.

02:39:20.660 --> 02:39:22.701
Conversely, the host can inform 
this ability change event back 

02:39:22.702 --> 02:39:24.702
to the AMP 

02:39:25.783 --> 02:39:27.783
documents through the visibility
chain message.

02:39:28.835 --> 02:39:31.692
When an AMP document is 
informed, that it is visible to 

02:39:31.693 --> 02:39:33.693
user, it can then 

02:39:34.968 --> 02:39:36.968
trigger page view Pixel or start
loading 

02:39:38.470 --> 02:39:40.470
resources that's below the 
folder.

02:39:41.936 --> 02:39:43.936
The communication interface API,
it is 

02:39:45.605 --> 02:39:47.654
Open Sourced and well 
documented, and supports two-way

02:39:47.655 --> 02:39:49.655
communication like 

02:39:50.734 --> 02:39:51.955
this, the host and the AMP 
documents, they can together 

02:39:51.956 --> 02:39:57.270
bring a much better user 
experience.  For example, this 

02:39:57.271 --> 02:39:59.271
is a real product that Google is
able to build based on 

02:40:03.171 --> 02:40:05.171
this communication protocol.

02:40:07.357 --> 02:40:09.357
With these principles keep in 
mind, 

02:40:11.345 --> 02:40:13.345
let's walk through some exciting

02:40:14.735 --> 02:40:16.735
products that Google builds 
using AMP.

02:40:16.825 --> 02:40:19.476
Thank you.
  &gt;&gt; VAMSEE JASTI: Thank you.  

02:40:19.477 --> 02:40:22.322
There you have it, the 
principles behind why AMP is 

02:40:22.323 --> 02:40:24.759
great for embeddablety.  As 
promised, let's shift gears back

02:40:24.760 --> 02:40:28.252
to looking at some of the 
embedded product features that 

02:40:28.253 --> 02:40:32.353
AMP made possible.  The first 
product I want to talk about, 

02:40:32.354 --> 02:40:36.645
email.  Little has changed in 
the email spec over the past 25 

02:40:36.646 --> 02:40:41.147
years, it is a wonderful piece 
of technology that allows -- 

02:40:41.148 --> 02:40:43.148
that's critical for how people 
communicate with other people, 

02:40:44.648 --> 02:40:47.097
businesses, tools, services.  If
you're an email sender there is 

02:40:49.560 --> 02:40:52.070
little that the email receiver 
can do other than retrieve the 

02:40:52.071 --> 02:40:57.778
email as a notification.  Email 
is not actionable today.  The 

02:40:57.779 --> 02:40:59.779
web is much more dynamic than 
this, as you know.

02:41:03.099 --> 02:41:05.534
This type of realtime on the 
web, it is provided to you by 

02:41:05.535 --> 02:41:09.213
Java script and that's not 
allowed within email because of 

02:41:09.214 --> 02:41:11.214
security reasons.

02:41:12.267 --> 02:41:14.267
To tackle this, the G email 
teamworked 

02:41:17.405 --> 02:41:19.405
with the team to open an AMP for
email 

02:41:23.547 --> 02:41:25.375
making email richer and more 
powerful it is a subset 

02:41:25.376 --> 02:41:27.376
particularly focused on 
security.

02:41:28.868 --> 02:41:30.912
It is also important to note 
that there is an easy transition

02:41:30.913 --> 02:41:34.198
path from the way that email 
works today.  Email senders 

02:41:34.199 --> 02:41:36.199
already create two 

02:41:37.263 --> 02:41:39.263
versions of the email, one a 
plain text 

02:41:40.543 --> 02:41:42.600
version and second, an HTML 
version.  Senders can now create

02:41:42.601 --> 02:41:47.284
an optional third version, the 
AMP version.  This allows 

02:41:47.285 --> 02:41:50.980
senders to design their AMP part
of the emails independent of the

02:41:50.981 --> 02:41:52.981
HTML versions.

02:41:54.110 --> 02:41:55.730
So if a provider supports AMP 
for email, they'll render that 

02:41:55.731 --> 02:42:00.686
AMP version.  If not, the mail 
proker changes nothing and shows

02:42:00.687 --> 02:42:03.723
the HTML version of the email.
  Why don't we dig into the spec

02:42:03.724 --> 02:42:05.993
a bit.  The realtime nature of 
the spec is 

02:42:10.324 --> 02:42:11.739
enabled by an AMP component, AMP
list, which allows email authors

02:42:11.740 --> 02:42:15.403
to fetch realtime information 
from an endpoint.  For example, 

02:42:15.404 --> 02:42:18.073
nobody wants to see outdated 
prices of products in emails.

02:42:21.115 --> 02:42:23.585
AMP allows authors to fetch 
realtime content on their emails

02:42:23.586 --> 02:42:25.586
right before the 

02:42:26.673 --> 02:42:28.717
user is about to open the email.
The interactive nature of the 

02:42:28.718 --> 02:42:30.718
spec is 

02:42:32.407 --> 02:42:34.850
brought to you about I component
called bind allowing interactive

02:42:34.851 --> 02:42:36.851
experiences 

02:42:38.711 --> 02:42:41.575
for email using rich JSON 
expressions.  This allows you to

02:42:41.576 --> 02:42:46.708
be able to respond back to an 
invite with a single click.  

02:42:46.709 --> 02:42:48.709
We'll look at examples in 
action.

02:42:50.393 --> 02:42:52.253
The first, it is from Zillo's 
whose goal is to help shoppers 

02:42:52.254 --> 02:42:56.351
find the dream home which is 
easier if shoppers tell them 

02:42:56.352 --> 02:42:59.048
what exactly they're looking 
for.  With AMP for email, a 

02:42:59.049 --> 02:43:03.126
shopper can get from answering a
few questions to personalized 

02:43:03.127 --> 02:43:05.155
search results without ever 
leaving their  email.

02:43:08.664 --> 02:43:10.664
Let's roll the video, please.

02:43:14.017 --> 02:43:16.259
Here we are, a received an email
and you can see how I answer the

02:43:16.260 --> 02:43:18.260
questions right in line.

02:43:21.918 --> 02:43:24.309
I can pick a minimum and 
maximized price of a house, not 

02:43:24.310 --> 02:43:27.158
buying in the Bay area.  The 
number of bedrooms I'm 

02:43:27.159 --> 02:43:29.216
interested in.

02:43:34.911 --> 02:43:36.911
The type of home I want to look 
for 

02:43:39.401 --> 02:43:41.401
and yes I want to get

02:43:43.425 --> 02:43:44.661
notified and when I'm done I can
ask to see a personalized list 

02:43:44.662 --> 02:43:47.317
of houses too, I can browse, 
look at images and save them 

02:43:51.211 --> 02:43:53.044
for viewing later all without 
having to leave email.  It 

02:43:53.045 --> 02:43:55.045
returns email from a 
notification 

02:43:56.158 --> 02:43:59.635
to an application.  The next 
example I want to show you, it 

02:43:59.636 --> 02:44:01.636
is from pinterest.

02:44:03.296 --> 02:44:05.296
Let's roll the video, please.

02:44:11.942 --> 02:44:15.004
  Somebody back there is 
scrambling right now.  This  

02:44:15.005 --> 02:44:18.689
looks great.  You received an 
email from pinterest, looking 

02:44:18.690 --> 02:44:22.556
very much like the emails you 
have seen, gorgeous images.   As

02:44:22.557 --> 02:44:24.800
you notice, regular email when 
you click on it, it sends out 

02:44:24.801 --> 02:44:28.112
the pictures, you probably have 
to log in.  This is AMP for 

02:44:28.113 --> 02:44:30.113
email, you can click and view 
the recipe right there.

02:44:33.650 --> 02:44:35.075
Look at photos, comments, and if
you're not interested, you can 

02:44:35.076 --> 02:44:38.537
go back to the feed, this is all
in email.  You can check out a 

02:44:38.538 --> 02:44:42.670
different recipe, chicken taco 
sounds nice.   I'll save that 

02:44:42.671 --> 02:44:44.671
and pin it to my 

02:44:48.159 --> 02:44:50.389
dinner board right within email.
This is great for users because 

02:44:52.652 --> 02:44:54.071
they're able to discover new 
things from right within email 

02:44:54.072 --> 02:44:58.904
and great for pinterest, this 
allows pinterest to deliver a 

02:44:58.905 --> 02:45:01.282
much better experience to their 
end users.  It is no 

02:45:01.283 --> 02:45:03.283
exaggeration that AMP is 

02:45:08.157 --> 02:45:10.157
bringing a new era of email

02:45:12.535 --> 02:45:14.535
if you're a provider, we would 
love to 

02:45:16.242 --> 02:45:18.292
help you with hub and if you 
have the access, you can sign up

02:45:18.293 --> 02:45:21.542
on the links on the slide.
  Second product I want to talk 

02:45:21.543 --> 02:45:26.440
about, ads.  Ads are a thing 
that gets embedded most number 

02:45:26.441 --> 02:45:30.566
of times than anything else in 
the world.  Aside from the way 

02:45:30.567 --> 02:45:32.802
ads are implemented these days 
it is a wonderful piece of 

02:45:34.671 --> 02:45:36.671
technology allowing the ad 
creator 

02:45:38.569 --> 02:45:40.999
content to flow across the 
entire web while embedded inside

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
of hosts.

02:45:44.510 --> 02:45:46.348
Here is the problem:  With ads, 
when it comes to performance, 

02:45:46.349 --> 02:45:50.818
there is miss aligned 
incentives.  If the ad creator 

02:45:50.819 --> 02:45:55.515
is not careful, they impact the 
performance of the page and bad 

02:45:55.516 --> 02:45:56.960
behavior for an ad is not 
necessarily impacting the 

02:45:56.961 --> 02:45:59.195
creator but impacting the host 
and therefore most 

02:46:02.278 --> 02:46:03.911
likely ends up resolving in a 
bad user experience.

02:46:03.912 --> 02:46:05.912
We want to fix that.

02:46:07.537 --> 02:46:10.404
We created AMP HTML ads.  The 
way this is implemented, they're

02:46:12.060 --> 02:46:16.560
guaranteed to be fast, secure, 
performing.  AMP HTML ads are 

02:46:16.561 --> 02:46:18.561
written in HTML 

02:46:20.506 --> 02:46:22.134
entirely which means they can't 
have JS and they're verified 

02:46:22.135 --> 02:46:25.447
before delivered to a webpage.  
I won't go into all the details 

02:46:25.448 --> 02:46:27.448
about 

02:46:28.916 --> 02:46:31.598
validation and all but I'll 
leave a few links in the slides 

02:46:31.599 --> 02:46:34.488
so you can follow-up later.
  Also these ads are supposed to

02:46:34.489 --> 02:46:39.823
work on both AMP pages and 
non-AMP pages and support for 

02:46:39.824 --> 02:46:42.282
mobile apps is coming soon as 
well.  Let's take a look at what

02:46:42.283 --> 02:46:44.928
a simple HTML ad looks like.

02:46:48.590 --> 02:46:50.590
You include the top level tag 
and then 

02:46:51.851 --> 02:46:54.541
you include the ad-specific 
timeframe, a thinner version of 

02:46:54.542 --> 02:46:56.542
the main frame, and 

02:46:58.016 --> 02:47:00.016
finally, you wrap a simple AMP 
image tab with an anchor link.

02:47:02.737 --> 02:47:04.737
That's it, you have a simple ad.
That's just simple, right?

02:47:09.271 --> 02:47:11.271
Can you build timeline-based 
crazy AMP HTML ads?  You can.

02:47:13.770 --> 02:47:15.021
We're taking is one step further
and partnering with tools, 

02:47:15.022 --> 02:47:17.271
tooling companies here.
  I'm very happy to announce a 

02:47:21.373 --> 02:47:25.268
partnership with the Adobe  
Anime team, a popular tool.  The

02:47:25.269 --> 02:47:27.269
power of a tool like this, it is

02:47:29.141 --> 02:47:31.593
it allows you to do time license
line based animation ads rather 

02:47:31.594 --> 02:47:33.594
than having 

02:47:35.701 --> 02:47:37.946
to manually hard clip them in 
Java script.  The issue of 

02:47:37.947 --> 02:47:39.989
creating complicated ads, it 
takes forever to get the 

02:47:41.605 --> 02:47:44.461
positionallinging, the layering 
of the assets right but the end 

02:47:44.462 --> 02:47:46.462
results endses 

02:47:48.113 --> 02:47:50.754
up not being performing as well.
We have a quick demo on how easy

02:47:50.755 --> 02:47:53.474
it is to perform great looking 
ads that are performing.

02:47:59.931 --> 02:48:00.343
Let's switch to the laptop, 
please.

02:48:00.344 --> 02:48:03.426
Cool.  If you haven't used this,
it is straightforward.

02:48:07.712 --> 02:48:10.417
They do a really good job with 
laying things out.  This is the 

02:48:10.418 --> 02:48:13.518
timeline scrubber, the most 
important part.  We copied some 

02:48:13.519 --> 02:48:17.182
assets into here so I don't have
to start from scratch.   This 

02:48:17.183 --> 02:48:19.399
overall gives me the ability to 
kind of position things and 

02:48:19.400 --> 02:48:22.086
layer things and this looks good
to me.

02:48:25.539 --> 02:48:27.999
I'll go ahead and publish this. 
We'll see how this looks.

02:48:33.250 --> 02:48:35.275
That's a complicated ad and it 
looks great.  Wait, there is a 

02:48:35.276 --> 02:48:37.309
Google thing appearing just way 
before the make Google do it 

02:48:37.310 --> 02:48:39.310
part.  Let's fix that.

02:48:41.202 --> 02:48:45.501
Let's see how easy it is to go 
back and try to fix that.  Here 

02:48:45.502 --> 02:48:47.502
is the Google part.   I have 
spotted the key frame.

02:48:50.361 --> 02:48:52.361
I'll move the key frame out to 

02:48:54.036 --> 02:48:56.036
somewhere between the make and 
the do it part.

02:48:57.696 --> 02:48:59.696
I'm going to publish that again.

02:49:01.225 --> 02:49:03.691
Let's go back.  Refresh it.

02:49:08.976 --> 02:49:11.809
Let's see if it appears in order
now, make Google do it.  Yes!  

02:49:11.810 --> 02:49:14.524
Looking great.
  Of course, I want to make sure

02:49:14.525 --> 02:49:16.779
-- don't save it.

02:49:20.250 --> 02:49:22.250
It is actually Ava lid AMP?

02:49:24.557 --> 02:49:26.557
It is valid AMP, thinner 
runtime.

02:49:29.450 --> 02:49:31.101
It uses the AMP automated 
extension which is a wraparound 

02:49:31.102 --> 02:49:36.189
the API.  I'll prove that it is 
valid and copy that and plop 

02:49:36.190 --> 02:49:38.190
that in the validator and, 

02:49:39.276 --> 02:49:41.740
yes, that's passing too.
  So we can switch back to the 

02:49:41.741 --> 02:49:45.232
slides, please.
  That was entirely created in 

02:49:45.233 --> 02:49:47.233
an AMP 

02:49:48.908 --> 02:49:50.749
HTML without a had need for Java
script and I hope you agree 

02:49:50.750 --> 02:49:52.750
that's a complicated ad.

02:49:55.655 --> 02:49:57.655
If I can do it, anyone can do 
that.

02:49:58.095 --> 02:50:00.095
So some publishers are already 

02:50:01.561 --> 02:50:03.814
choosing to use AMP HTML ads in 
the ad campaigns they ex 

02:50:03.815 --> 02:50:05.815
compute.

02:50:12.757 --> 02:50:13.912
execute and this company, they 
had 90% lacy reduction and 32% 

02:50:13.913 --> 02:50:15.970
click through rate.  We think 
this can help you achieve 

02:50:18.211 --> 02:50:20.211
business needs and also while 
ensuring 

02:50:21.474 --> 02:50:23.474
that ads are fast, performing, 
secure on the web.

02:50:26.551 --> 02:50:28.192
You can learn more about AMP 
HTML ads on the link on the 

02:50:28.193 --> 02:50:30.225
slide.
  The next one, I want to talk 

02:50:30.226 --> 02:50:32.226
about, it is actions.

02:50:36.454 --> 02:50:38.690
It is way too hard to get things
done on the web.  Especially 

02:50:38.691 --> 02:50:41.332
things involving a credit card. 
The beauty of the web is in the 

02:50:42.960 --> 02:50:47.034
diversity of the merchants that 
can fulfill the user's needs.  

02:50:47.035 --> 02:50:49.706
For a user that discovers a 
merchant from  Google.com, the 

02:50:49.707 --> 02:50:51.535
user needs to reintroduce 
themselves to the merchant with 

02:50:51.536 --> 02:50:53.536
things 

02:50:55.484 --> 02:50:57.484
like credit card information, 
identity, this creates friction.

02:51:01.192 --> 02:51:02.617
For example, 54% of users 
abandon account registration 

02:51:02.618 --> 02:51:04.618
flows when you show them a 
registration form.

02:51:07.950 --> 02:51:09.816
33% abandon purchase flows when 
you -- when you show the credit 

02:51:09.817 --> 02:51:13.905
card entry stage.  Nobody likes 
to fill out a form.  Especially 

02:51:13.906 --> 02:51:16.135
on mobile.
  So to solve this problem, the 

02:51:16.136 --> 02:51:19.834
action team at Google worked 
with a few merchants to provide 

02:51:19.835 --> 02:51:22.292
a seamless transaction 
experience with AMP pages, 

02:51:27.641 --> 02:51:30.098
Google sign-in and sessions 
starting from the Google 

02:51:30.099 --> 02:51:32.099
assistants and Google search.

02:51:33.789 --> 02:51:36.659
AMPs tight security performance 
and communication APIs allow 

02:51:36.660 --> 02:51:38.660
Google to offer transaction 
primitives such as identity, 

02:51:41.566 --> 02:51:43.806
payments and receipts as one 
integrated package.   Actions 

02:51:43.807 --> 02:51:47.296
can also integrate with other 
Google services in the future.  

02:51:47.297 --> 02:51:49.742
For example, say I want to make 
a reservation for lunch this 

02:51:49.743 --> 02:51:52.228
afternoon.  Actions can actually
start to overlay 

02:51:55.285 --> 02:51:58.155
my Google calendar with my 
permission on top of my booking 

02:51:58.156 --> 02:52:00.156
flow reservation flow without 
ever having to share the entire 

02:52:05.615 --> 02:52:07.474
calendar with the merchant 
making such   Guarantees on 

02:52:07.475 --> 02:52:09.475
non-AMP pages is really, really 
hard.

02:52:09.746 --> 02:52:11.746
Let's look at a few demos.

02:52:14.281 --> 02:52:16.312
The first one, it is from an 
entire check out experience in 

02:52:16.313 --> 02:52:18.581
AMP using actions.  Let's switch
to my phone, please.

02:52:30.153 --> 02:52:31.585
I have been busy, I haven't 
watched avengers yet, I'll try 

02:52:31.586 --> 02:52:33.586
to book tickets for avengers.

02:52:35.891 --> 02:52:37.891
Avengers show times.

02:52:42.030 --> 02:52:45.513
Live casting, what goes wrong?  
4:00 p.m., they have a fast 

02:52:45.514 --> 02:52:47.514
checkout option with 

02:52:49.156 --> 02:52:51.156
the AMP logo, I'll click that, 
see what happens.

02:52:52.668 --> 02:52:55.108
That looks instantly and with 
this, it is a realtime seat map 

02:52:55.109 --> 02:52:57.109
so I'll select 

02:52:59.998 --> 02:53:02.027
two seats to go with my wife and
you notice Google has filled in 

02:53:02.028 --> 02:53:05.926
all of my information, the 
summary looks  great, I'll 

02:53:05.927 --> 02:53:07.927
complete purchase.  There.

02:53:10.194 --> 02:53:12.194
I have my tickets in in in my 
hand, 

02:53:14.304 --> 02:53:16.977
from deciding to go to the 
movie, tickets in hand, less 

02:53:16.978 --> 02:53:20.227
than 30 seconds, not only that, 
if I have to go back and find 

02:53:20.228 --> 02:53:22.466
it, it is on my Google account. 
Not only  that, with a single 

02:53:22.467 --> 02:53:24.467
tap I 

02:53:25.726 --> 02:53:27.726
can share my email address with 

02:53:29.396 --> 02:53:31.439
Fandango if I choose to to get 
offers and such.  Sure.   That's

02:53:31.440 --> 02:53:33.440
it!

02:53:35.532 --> 02:53:37.573
Now I'm a fandango VIP.
  We can switch back to the 

02:53:37.574 --> 02:53:39.643
slides please.  Note I never had
to pick out a form 

02:53:43.933 --> 02:53:46.816
field, type in the email, credit
card information.  AMC is also 

02:53:46.817 --> 02:53:48.817
building an experience using 
AMPs.

02:53:50.919 --> 02:53:53.565
Next, let's look at doordash 
making it really easy to order 

02:53:53.566 --> 02:53:56.063
food using AMP pages and actions
from the assistants.

02:53:59.320 --> 02:54:01.320
Let's roll the video, please.

02:54:05.074 --> 02:54:06.299
I'll let you say never too late,
never too early to order Italian

02:54:06.300 --> 02:54:08.300
food.  I did that.

02:54:09.987 --> 02:54:11.987
They have the AMP logo, I'll tap
on 

02:54:13.462 --> 02:54:15.462
that, great to get Margarita 
pizza, a 

02:54:17.957 --> 02:54:19.957
good idea, I like roasted 
garlic, and 

02:54:23.034 --> 02:54:24.482
I'll go ahead and add that to 
the order.  Never not get 

02:54:24.483 --> 02:54:27.530
dessert.  I'll add that to the 
order.  These are all AMP pages 

02:54:27.531 --> 02:54:31.662
by the way.  Then a view card.  
You check out.  Google has 

02:54:31.663 --> 02:54:33.663
filled out all of the 
information that I care about.

02:54:35.559 --> 02:54:39.238
I don't have to ever enter a 
credit card form or field.  I'll

02:54:39.239 --> 02:54:41.270
go ahead, place the order.
  That's it!

02:54:44.521 --> 02:54:46.978
Getting things done using AMP 
and actions with just a few 

02:54:46.979 --> 02:54:50.643
taps.  We can switch back to the
slides, please.

02:54:53.295 --> 02:54:56.753
So it is a window situation for 
users and merchants.   Users get

02:54:56.754 --> 02:54:58.980
a fast checkout experience 
that's Google  optimized.

02:55:02.235 --> 02:55:03.866
Pages are written in AMP, 
chances are they're performing 

02:55:03.867 --> 02:55:07.169
and they have a great user 
experience.  Users almost never 

02:55:07.170 --> 02:55:10.445
need to fill out a credit card 
form or enter any forms for that

02:55:10.446 --> 02:55:15.552
matter.  There is a single place
for all your receipts in case 

02:55:15.553 --> 02:55:18.185
you want to track where the 
order is, track the expenses in 

02:55:18.805 --> 02:55:23.694
general.  Merchants are able to 
retain full control of the UI 

02:55:23.695 --> 02:55:25.695
with the AMP pages.  They can 
build long-term relationships 

02:55:27.558 --> 02:55:29.646
with the customers and acquire 
them over the long term.

02:55:33.668 --> 02:55:35.668
Merchants get higher conversion 
rates 

02:55:38.365 --> 02:55:40.366
because of the streamline 
checkout experiences.  We have 

02:55:40.367 --> 02:55:40.476
seen greater than 20% sign in 
and greater than 2 it X 

02:55:40.477 --> 02:55:42.477
conversion up 

02:55:45.387 --> 02:55:46.405
lift when using Google pay.
  Merchants spend less time 

02:55:46.406 --> 02:55:49.375
implementing transaction 
primitives and they add unique 

02:55:49.376 --> 02:55:52.880
value.  Stay tuned to hear more 
details on this from the Google 

02:55:52.881 --> 02:55:57.388
team later this summer.
  All right folks.  The last 

02:55:57.389 --> 02:55:59.643
product I want to talk  about.  
It is how AMP is enabling some 

02:56:01.890 --> 02:56:04.371
powerful new  features, features
we're calling zero-click 

02:56:04.372 --> 02:56:08.457
experiences.  It means that in a
developer has pretty good 

02:56:08.458 --> 02:56:10.894
confidence on the thing that the
user is going to click next, why

02:56:10.895 --> 02:56:15.994
not have it ready even before 
they ask for it.  Let's look at 

02:56:15.995 --> 02:56:18.439
one such example.
  Google images is building 

02:56:18.440 --> 02:56:22.509
frictionless visual search that 
helps users go beyond the image 

02:56:22.510 --> 02:56:26.993
to your site.  Here is the 
problem.  An average webpage 

02:56:26.994 --> 02:56:30.935
takes more than 15 seconds to 
load and more than half of them 

02:56:30.936 --> 02:56:35.244
leave if the page takes more 
than 3 seconds to load.  What if

02:56:35.245 --> 02:56:37.245
we redies the cost of a click 

02:56:38.857 --> 02:56:40.857
down to 00 -- reduce the cost of
a click down to 0.

02:56:45.845 --> 02:56:46.844
This is possible with the 
privacy prerenderring.  This is 

02:56:46.845 --> 02:56:48.845
a way that the team is planning 
to solve this problem with  AMP.

02:56:50.888 --> 02:56:53.430
Let's say that I'm in the market
foreign straight -- market for 

02:56:54.847 --> 02:56:56.847
renovating my kitchen.

02:56:57.922 --> 02:57:00.547
I go to Google images and search
ideas.  Now, that's when I 

02:57:00.548 --> 02:57:02.548
search for kitchen ideas.   I 
find an image that's interesting

02:57:02.611 --> 02:57:04.611
for me.  I click on it.

02:57:07.705 --> 02:57:09.744
With AMPs privacy prerenderring,
you can prerender the webpage, 

02:57:09.745 --> 02:57:14.693
see where it is from and make it
readily available for the user 

02:57:14.694 --> 02:57:17.759
where you see that in the bottom
there.  If the user taps on the 

02:57:17.760 --> 02:57:19.760
preview, it loads instantly.

02:57:22.072 --> 02:57:24.117
When users internalize the cost 
of the click, it is down to 

02:57:24.118 --> 02:57:28.630
zero, it helps them explore the 
rich content beyond the image.  

02:57:28.631 --> 02:57:30.272
Ultimately it is great for the 
user because they're able to get

02:57:30.273 --> 02:57:34.796
inspired and look at multiple 
ideas on the web and it is great

02:57:34.797 --> 02:57:37.236
for publishers because they 
receive more traffic.

02:57:38.653 --> 02:57:41.088
That was four different 
products.  They are all using 

02:57:41.089 --> 02:57:45.599
AMP to implement the product 
features not possible before.   

02:57:45.600 --> 02:57:48.086
Now to reveal the mystery, 
right.  It is not so much an 

02:57:48.087 --> 02:57:50.087
example but a different way to 
think about AMP.

02:57:54.457 --> 02:57:56.901
We call it AMP as foundation.  
It means that no matter the 

02:57:56.902 --> 02:57:58.902
content or the experiences, 
where they live, you 

02:58:01.595 --> 02:58:04.241
can power the experiences using 
AMP, including your own 

02:58:04.242 --> 02:58:09.140
destination sites.   Let's dig 
into what an existing setup for 

02:58:09.141 --> 02:58:11.141
most publishers looks like.

02:58:12.842 --> 02:58:14.842
A lot of publishers have 
prepared AMP 

02:58:15.909 --> 02:58:17.909
pages that are across various 
platforms as on the slide.

02:58:20.195 --> 02:58:22.195
The way they know this is AMP is

02:58:24.701 --> 02:58:27.779
following the link to HTML tag 
on their non-AMP pages.  If you 

02:58:27.780 --> 02:58:29.236
haven't already produced AMP 
pages, I hope today we have 

02:58:29.237 --> 02:58:33.954
enough reasons why you should.
  So separately, a number of 

02:58:33.955 --> 02:58:35.955
publishers 

02:58:37.226 --> 02:58:39.226
also are building -- rebuilding 
websites 

02:58:40.513 --> 02:58:41.757
with PAs or progessive web apps 
to take advantage of things like

02:58:41.758 --> 02:58:43.758
push 

02:58:44.825 --> 02:58:46.450
notifications, offline 
capabilities and amazing things 

02:58:46.451 --> 02:58:49.963
you have heard about.  Where 
does AMP fit in?  You know how 

02:58:49.964 --> 02:58:51.964
we talked about AMP being 

02:58:54.022 --> 02:58:55.889
excellence for embeddablety, you
take those same AMP pages and 

02:58:55.890 --> 02:58:57.890
embed them 

02:59:01.137 --> 02:59:03.137
inside of the PA.

02:59:06.738 --> 02:59:08.790
You can use this with shadow dom
and you have the features in the

02:59:08.791 --> 02:59:10.791
shell and 

02:59:12.490 --> 02:59:14.490
have the ad content layer 
independent of that shell.

02:59:20.474 --> 02:59:21.743
This works great overall and we 
have some things that we're 

02:59:21.744 --> 02:59:25.810
continuing to fix.  We have to 
call it out on the link on the 

02:59:25.811 --> 02:59:27.811
slide.

02:59:29.885 --> 02:59:31.121
There was a super compelling 
experience built with the 

02:59:31.122 --> 02:59:33.122
pattern we're 

02:59:35.002 --> 02:59:38.389
talking about and they also won 
two awards so congratulations.  

02:59:38.390 --> 02:59:41.375
I would like to show you a video
showing the site they built for 

02:59:41.376 --> 02:59:46.293
BMW.com by embedding the pages 
inside of PWAs.  Let's roll the 

02:59:46.294 --> 02:59:48.933
video, please.
  &gt;&gt; How do you excite people 

02:59:48.934 --> 02:59:51.609
for a car brand who are not 
interested in cars at all?

02:59:54.689 --> 02:59:57.362
By listening to their needs and 
telling them stories they 

02:59:57.363 --> 02:59:59.363
actually want to hear.

03:00:01.493 --> 03:00:03.723
Data driven, entertaining, 
helpful.  For this purpose, we 

03:00:03.724 --> 03:00:05.724
have developed a 

03:00:07.440 --> 03:00:09.440
central stage, a new home for 
the BMW 

03:00:10.498 --> 03:00:12.533
brand, the all-new BMW.com.  For
a Web Ex importance just as 

03:00:14.978 --> 03:00:17.424
dynamic as the cars, we used 
Google's high-speed AMP 

03:00:17.425 --> 03:00:22.722
framework and dramatically 
increased performance and thanks

03:00:22.723 --> 03:00:24.723
to another web technology called

03:00:28.031 --> 03:00:29.863
PWA ultrasmooth full screen 
videos and the next great story,

03:00:29.864 --> 03:00:31.864
it is only a swipe away.

03:00:34.842 --> 03:00:37.483
The result, a 30% higher click 
through rate from Google search 

03:00:37.484 --> 03:00:39.484
and up to 3 

03:00:40.971 --> 03:00:43.443
times faster website loading 
compared to competitors.  A 

03:00:43.444 --> 03:00:45.444
high-performance experience that
you 

03:00:46.698 --> 03:00:48.698
would only expect from a native 
app, 

03:00:51.038 --> 03:00:52.866
and, of course, the configurator
or a local test drive are always

03:00:52.867 --> 03:00:55.329
only one click away.  The all 
new  BMW.

03:00:59.837 --> 03:01:01.837
com, the world's fastest 
automotive 

03:01:03.454 --> 03:01:05.737
marketing website.
  &gt;&gt; VAMSEE JASTI: They have 

03:01:05.738 --> 03:01:08.216
done a great job with it.   The 
site is live, you can go play 

03:01:09.861 --> 03:01:11.861
with it if you like.

03:01:14.945 --> 03:01:16.373
Today we saw use cases where AMP
is the core layer that powers 

03:01:16.374 --> 03:01:18.616
them.  There are other things 
we're not 

03:01:21.686 --> 03:01:23.686
thinking about, future use cases
in AMP 

03:01:25.352 --> 03:01:26.155
in car dashboard, Virtual 
Reality, it is really yours to 

03:01:26.156 --> 03:01:30.282
explore.  If you take away one 
thing today, it is this, the web

03:01:30.283 --> 03:01:32.283
is moving towards a 

03:01:33.365 --> 03:01:34.397
post-destination era and if 
you're a developer building 

03:01:34.398 --> 03:01:36.398
content or 

03:01:38.507 --> 03:01:40.133
experiences in the new era you 
need to build on a technology 

03:01:40.134 --> 03:01:44.654
working everywhere, not just at 
your  destinations.  AMP 

03:01:44.655 --> 03:01:46.303
delivers superior performance, 
security and standards enabling 

03:01:46.304 --> 03:01:48.304
features 

03:01:49.375 --> 03:01:51.422
that are just not possible with 
regular pages.  We can't wait to

03:01:51.423 --> 03:01:52.236
see what you build with it.
  Thank you.  

03:13:29.491 --> 03:13:31.491
UX and APIs that Developers and 
Users 

03:13:32.503 --> 03:13:34.503
Love

03:19:18.876 --> 03:19:20.876
Users 

03:19:21.882 --> 03:19:23.882
Love

03:21:41.875 --> 03:21:43.875
eye

03:22:34.902 --> 03:22:37.771
UX and APIs that Developers and 
Users 

03:22:40.774 --> 03:22:42.774
Love

03:23:59.477 --> 03:24:00.305

  &gt;&gt; DAVID EAST: Hello, 

03:24:00.306 --> 03:24:02.306
everyone!

03:24:04.396 --> 03:24:06.231
So the first rule when you come 
to a talk is make sure you're at

03:24:06.232 --> 03:24:08.232
the right talk.  I have done 
that before!

03:24:13.581 --> 03:24:14.390
This is UX and APIs -- UX and 
APIs that Developers and Users 

03:24:14.391 --> 03:24:16.391
Love.  I'm David east.

03:24:18.276 --> 03:24:20.276
I'm a developer advocate here at
Firebase.

03:24:22.360 --> 03:24:25.858
It is kind of funny that I'm 
giving this talk.  It wasn't all

03:24:25.859 --> 03:24:27.859
that long ago that my 

03:24:28.926 --> 03:24:34.026
idea of user experience was just
completely wrong.  At Google we 

03:24:34.027 --> 03:24:36.067
have lots of talented, 
motivating people that work on 

03:24:36.068 --> 03:24:38.068
user experience.

03:24:41.979 --> 03:24:43.402
We have UX researchers, UX 
designers, UX engineers and I 

03:24:43.403 --> 03:24:49.328
get to work with these people on
a lot of different occasions.  

03:24:49.329 --> 03:24:51.407
Usually at the beginning of a 
project we'll have a UX designer

03:24:51.408 --> 03:24:53.408
come and they'll make a mock.

03:24:59.709 --> 03:25:04.279
I look at the mock and say, wow,
this is pretty.  They look at me

03:25:04.280 --> 03:25:06.280
and without fail they 

03:25:09.215 --> 03:25:11.215
say I don't make things look  
pretty, I make them work well.

03:25:13.908 --> 03:25:14.312
This is my idea of user 
experience, it started to 

03:25:14.313 --> 03:25:16.313
change.

03:25:20.440 --> 03:25:22.440
I wondered if what if user 
experience 

03:25:23.486 --> 03:25:26.777
is not just about the different 
shades of blue.  I'm a 

03:25:26.778 --> 03:25:28.778
developer, I build applications 
and think of things like this.

03:25:31.287 --> 03:25:33.287
I see the app as a series of 
views, 

03:25:34.775 --> 03:25:36.775
network requests, threats and my
friends 

03:25:38.106 --> 03:25:40.106
that work in UX, they tell me 
this is 

03:25:43.640 --> 03:25:45.501
fine for your own mental model, 
but the user, they see things 

03:25:45.502 --> 03:25:47.757
differently, they don't care 
about the code that happens 

03:25:49.590 --> 03:25:54.107
behind the screen.  Everything 
for your user is a moment.  

03:25:54.108 --> 03:25:56.573
Whether they're creating an 
account for the first time, 

03:25:56.574 --> 03:25:58.574
making a payment, 

03:26:00.681 --> 03:26:02.681
writing the first post, each of 
these 

03:26:03.688 --> 03:26:06.443
things is a moment.  The 
important thing to understand 

03:26:09.118 --> 03:26:10.746
about moments, every single 
moment comes with an 

03:26:10.747 --> 03:26:12.747
expectation.

03:26:13.837 --> 03:26:15.662
We expect to be able to create 
an account without seeing a 

03:26:15.663 --> 03:26:19.365
dozen red Boxes of information 
we need to fill out.  We expect 

03:26:19.366 --> 03:26:21.366
to make a payment without it 
being painful.

03:26:24.455 --> 03:26:26.455
We want to write the first line 
with confidence.

03:26:27.559 --> 03:26:30.452
If we don't get this right, we 
can give the user a  one-star 

03:26:30.453 --> 03:26:32.453
moment.

03:26:34.756 --> 03:26:36.793
If we understand their 
expectation, we can give them 

03:26:36.794 --> 03:26:38.794
what they need and give 

03:26:40.324 --> 03:26:42.324
them a five-star moment.

03:26:43.370 --> 03:26:45.223
In order to understand what our 
user needs, we have to not just 

03:26:45.224 --> 03:26:50.954
look at the applications as a 
bunch of code, but we need to 

03:26:50.955 --> 03:26:53.390
think about our apps as a series
of moments.

03:26:56.658 --> 03:26:58.293
I'm not here today to teach you 
how to turn every single part of

03:26:58.294 --> 03:27:01.371
your app into a five-star moment
bowl because I don't know how to

03:27:01.372 --> 03:27:03.372
do that!

03:27:04.635 --> 03:27:07.111
-- mostly because I don't know 
how to do that.  I can help you 

03:27:07.112 --> 03:27:09.112
look at critical parts 

03:27:11.203 --> 03:27:15.087
of common applications and see 
how to increase those moments.  

03:27:15.088 --> 03:27:17.147
I have been working on Firebase 
for over four years now and I 

03:27:17.148 --> 03:27:19.148
have given a 

03:27:20.627 --> 03:27:22.627
lot of talks, how to use the 
Firebase 

03:27:23.705 --> 03:27:25.705
hosting, how to structure the 
data and 

03:27:28.231 --> 03:27:30.231
these are all very developer 
focused talks.

03:27:31.430 --> 03:27:34.396
If you think why we want fast 
sites, why we structure the data

03:27:34.397 --> 03:27:38.497
in a certain way, we don't do it
to feel good about ourselves -- 

03:27:38.498 --> 03:27:41.352
maybe a little bit.  We do it 
for the user.

03:27:44.431 --> 03:27:46.505
Maybe Firebase isn't just a 
development tool because we can 

03:27:46.506 --> 03:27:48.506
use it 

03:27:49.980 --> 03:27:51.863
to make a -- make moments for 
the user better and it also 

03:27:51.864 --> 03:27:53.864
means we can look at 

03:27:55.117 --> 03:27:57.385
Firebase as a UX tool.  The 
first moment I want to talk 

03:27:57.386 --> 03:27:59.386
about is onboarding.

03:28:02.797 --> 03:28:05.447
To me, onboarding is really 
interesting.  It is the first 

03:28:05.448 --> 03:28:07.448
impression the user 

03:28:08.715 --> 03:28:10.138
will have of the app and this is
a chance we can show them that 

03:28:10.139 --> 03:28:14.498
they're going to have a great 
experience, and that's not 

03:28:14.499 --> 03:28:19.193
always what happens.  We don't 
think about user's perspective 

03:28:19.194 --> 03:28:21.194
of onboarding.  You can get it 
wrong.

03:28:24.342 --> 03:28:25.562
At this point, you have the 
users' interests, they're 

03:28:25.563 --> 03:28:28.666
excited, they downloaded the 
asp, they opened it, they're 

03:28:28.667 --> 03:28:30.667
ready to see the content and 
just use it.

03:28:34.200 --> 03:28:36.200
We show them a wall.

03:28:37.252 --> 03:28:40.101
In order to keep this 
excitement, we need to onboard 

03:28:40.102 --> 03:28:42.102
them as quickly as 

03:28:43.173 --> 03:28:45.002
possible into reduced friction. 
In order to do this, we're going

03:28:45.003 --> 03:28:49.738
to have a lot of different 
features, we'll have to allow 

03:28:49.739 --> 03:28:53.823
them to log in with multiple 
different types of providers.  

03:28:53.824 --> 03:28:56.680
We'll have to show them that 
they can easily reset the 

03:28:56.681 --> 03:28:58.933
password and we also want them 
to link different accounts 

03:29:01.425 --> 03:29:02.873
because we don't want them 
logging in with one provider and

03:29:02.874 --> 03:29:06.556
coming back in, logging in with 
another and wonder why they have

03:29:06.557 --> 03:29:08.847
two different accounts.   This 
is something that Firebase 

03:29:10.063 --> 03:29:12.063
authentication does.

03:29:13.250 --> 03:29:15.470
There is multiple types of 
authentication with Google, 

03:29:15.471 --> 03:29:18.468
Facebook, Twitter

03:29:24.771 --> 03:29:26.771
, github.

03:29:28.638 --> 03:29:29.661
Rather than a a option like 
this, they may feel backed in 

03:29:29.662 --> 03:29:32.552
the corner, they say this is a 
one-star moment and they bounce.

03:29:35.639 --> 03:29:37.696
So instead, we can give them 
multiple options, log in with 

03:29:37.697 --> 03:29:39.741
Google, sign in with email, even
your phone number or 

03:29:43.013 --> 03:29:45.013
just browse as a guest.

03:29:49.411 --> 03:29:52.069
The problem here, is that one of
the most friction-filled Parts 

03:29:52.070 --> 03:29:56.972
ever creating an app is having 
to I think of a password.   The 

03:29:56.973 --> 03:29:59.057
user wants to log in with email 
and a password, not only is the 

03:29:59.058 --> 03:30:02.165
law of friction opening up the 
keyboard, entering the email, 

03:30:02.166 --> 03:30:05.683
entering the password, the user 
has to create the password in 

03:30:05.684 --> 03:30:07.309
the head, know that they're 
basically going to forget it and

03:30:07.310 --> 03:30:09.310
then 

03:30:10.790 --> 03:30:13.438
have to reset it sometimes in 
the future.   What would be 

03:30:13.439 --> 03:30:15.684
great, if we can log in a user 
without a password, what if we 

03:30:19.591 --> 03:30:21.591
take their email and have them 
create an account.

03:30:25.531 --> 03:30:27.805
Recently we released a new 
feature called passwordless 

03:30:27.806 --> 03:30:29.806
authentication.  We'll how this 
works.

03:30:36.959 --> 03:30:38.959
User enters the email, send 
link,

03:30:42.574 --> 03:30:44.257
they then go and check their 
email.  They get an email from 

03:30:44.258 --> 03:30:46.258
the app and it 

03:30:49.812 --> 03:30:51.812
comes with a sign in link so 
they tap it 

03:30:53.709 --> 03:30:54.526
and it redirects them to the app
and it automatically signs them 

03:30:54.527 --> 03:30:56.982
in.  This is a great moment for 
the user 

03:31:01.564 --> 03:31:02.789
because it is a less step, a 
less password they have to enter

03:31:02.790 --> 03:31:04.790
and we can 

03:31:05.845 --> 03:31:07.845
get them in the app much faster.

03:31:10.286 --> 03:31:14.815
This feature is available on 
Android, iOS and the web.   This

03:31:14.816 --> 03:31:16.816
is a code sample of the website.

03:31:18.527 --> 03:31:20.594
This is a Firebase instance and 
we call the method, send sign in

03:31:20.595 --> 03:31:22.595
link to 

03:31:24.079 --> 03:31:26.079
email, which takes in the user's
email 

03:31:27.552 --> 03:31:29.552
and then action code  settings, 
some configuration.

03:31:31.976 --> 03:31:36.127
This is asyncness so we await it
and set it to local storage 

03:31:36.128 --> 03:31:38.584
because we need that email 
later.  At this point, we can 

03:31:38.585 --> 03:31:40.585
prompt the user, 

03:31:42.041 --> 03:31:44.041
may, check your email.

03:31:49.775 --> 03:31:51.775
At this point, we see if they're
coming 

03:31:53.101 --> 03:31:55.122
in with this sign in link and we
can do that with help or method 

03:31:55.123 --> 03:31:57.123
from Firebase 

03:31:59.658 --> 03:32:01.687
authentication, we call it the 
sign in link and if it is a 

03:32:01.688 --> 03:32:03.688
link, we are going 

03:32:04.970 --> 03:32:06.970
to get that email that we saved 
to local storage.

03:32:09.314 --> 03:32:11.593
I want to make sure that this 
link is here if it is not, we'll

03:32:11.594 --> 03:32:13.594
prompt them 

03:32:15.065 --> 03:32:16.725
again to make sure that we have 
it because something could have 

03:32:16.726 --> 03:32:19.764
erased it from local storage, an
error could happen.  We prompt 

03:32:19.765 --> 03:32:21.813
them again to make sure we have 
it.

03:32:29.795 --> 03:32:32.041
We pass in the email and the 
link and after that point, we 

03:32:32.042 --> 03:32:34.943
clean up after ourselves because
the user is logged in.

03:32:40.683 --> 03:32:41.892
In order to provide it better  
onboarding we have to give 

03:32:41.893 --> 03:32:43.893
multiple options so that they 
feel more trust 

03:32:48.022 --> 03:32:50.504
when they log in and we reduce 
the friction and not try to pull

03:32:50.505 --> 03:32:53.585
too much from upfront.

03:32:58.280 --> 03:33:00.747
Another moment to talk about 
what happens when the app 

03:33:00.748 --> 03:33:04.430
crashes, the user is logged in, 
on boarded quickly, the next 

03:33:04.431 --> 03:33:06.431
thing you know, the app crashes.

03:33:07.747 --> 03:33:09.747
You may think that this is a 
one-star moment.

03:33:15.937 --> 03:33:18.609
This is a point in the app where
we show the user that we're 

03:33:18.610 --> 03:33:20.610
humans and that we 

03:33:22.311 --> 03:33:24.311
do make mistakes but we work to 
fix them.

03:33:25.577 --> 03:33:27.445
In order to fix things, we have 
to know where the app is 

03:33:27.446 --> 03:33:29.446
breaking and we have to properly
monitor it.

03:33:34.179 --> 03:33:38.561
This is something that crash 
lytics does well.   Once you 

03:33:38.562 --> 03:33:40.562
have this, you have a dashboard 
full of useful information and 

03:33:41.849 --> 03:33:43.849
you see the statistics which 
makes you 

03:33:45.961 --> 03:33:47.961
feel good about your app but 
when issues 

03:33:51.320 --> 03:33:53.138
occur we can see in which file 
the issue occurredded in which 

03:33:53.139 --> 03:33:56.625
line of the code and how many 
times it happened and for how 

03:33:56.626 --> 03:33:58.626
many users.

03:34:21.447 --> 03:34:22.860
When a new issue, you have a 
Cloud function trigger and you 

03:34:22.861 --> 03:34:25.324
can do something with this 
information.

03:34:32.502 --> 03:34:35.333
This this case we create the 
name and then we have a new 

03:34:35.334 --> 03:34:37.334
trigger.

03:34:40.520 --> 03:34:41.734
We get the issue information and
from here, I can do whatever I 

03:34:41.735 --> 03:34:44.994
want.   I can send this 
information to slack so I get a 

03:34:44.995 --> 03:34:46.995
notification that we're having 
an error.

03:34:49.909 --> 03:34:51.751
I can maybe send it to a Twitter
status, hey, we have a problem 

03:34:51.752 --> 03:34:54.410
but we're working on it.

03:35:04.234 --> 03:35:06.234
It is okay when we fail.  When 
you do fail, it is a way to show

03:35:09.180 --> 03:35:10.801
the user that we all are human 
and trying to fix things and it 

03:35:10.802 --> 03:35:12.802
is a way to 

03:35:16.875 --> 03:35:18.875
earn trust in the users even 
though

03:35:23.288 --> 03:35:24.719
this gives insight into the 
obvious one-star moments, you 

03:35:24.720 --> 03:35:29.064
have the crashes and it is clear
that this is not a great moment 

03:35:29.065 --> 03:35:31.065
for the user.

03:35:37.067 --> 03:35:40.367
What about the ones that lurk 
and we don't know about them?  

03:35:40.368 --> 03:35:42.368
This is usually  
performance-based.

03:35:45.039 --> 03:35:47.073
We may work on fast computers 
and we may see fast connections,

03:35:47.074 --> 03:35:49.074
but the users, 

03:35:50.134 --> 03:35:52.134
that's not always the case for 
them.

03:35:53.396 --> 03:35:55.445
We're not seeing the same 
results as they are.

03:36:03.017 --> 03:36:05.077
In this case, it is loading, 
loading, loading, man!  There 

03:36:05.078 --> 03:36:07.078
you have it!

03:36:11.674 --> 03:36:12.475
For the user, these slow loads 
are really stressful, they're 

03:36:12.476 --> 03:36:14.476
sitting there 

03:36:16.782 --> 03:36:18.782
waiting for the data to come 
back.

03:36:21.458 --> 03:36:23.906
The problem is, we don't see 
this as active but the users do,

03:36:23.907 --> 03:36:27.373
how do we know these things are 
happening, they're not happening

03:36:27.374 --> 03:36:29.374
to us.

03:36:31.147 --> 03:36:33.147
This is the case for Firebase 
performance monitoring.

03:36:35.240 --> 03:36:37.240
It allows us to set up tracing 
in our 

03:36:39.335 --> 03:36:41.771
app and see real world data from
our users.  Once you have it set

03:36:41.772 --> 03:36:46.076
up, you have all of the 
information in the dashboard.  I

03:36:46.077 --> 03:36:48.077
see traces by frequency and I 
can 

03:36:50.141 --> 03:36:53.684
see the network response latency
from different countries.   

03:36:53.685 --> 03:36:56.346
Something I noticed in this, I 
have one trace that is taking 

03:36:56.347 --> 03:36:58.347
almost 7 seconds to finish.

03:37:02.521 --> 03:37:05.180
So I go, I inspect the network 
requests happening in the app.  

03:37:05.181 --> 03:37:07.181
I notice I have the one that 
takes about 2.

03:37:10.521 --> 03:37:12.521
15 seconds to complete so I 
drill in, I 

03:37:15.433 --> 03:37:17.433
see that this is actually a 
cloud 

03:37:18.506 --> 03:37:20.506
function and it takes anywhere 
between 2 

03:37:22.387 --> 03:37:24.438
seconds to almost 5 seconds to 
complete.  Why is this 

03:37:24.439 --> 03:37:28.739
happening?  Well, this is my 
fault.  I was really excited, I 

03:37:28.740 --> 03:37:30.740
was using a 

03:37:31.820 --> 03:37:33.820
new feature from Cloud functions
called Callable functions.

03:37:35.884 --> 03:37:37.884
The way they work, it is that we
get a 

03:37:38.963 --> 03:37:43.677
function name and then we can 
create a new callable function. 

03:37:43.678 --> 03:37:45.350
The callable function takes in 
two arguments, data, which is 

03:37:45.351 --> 03:37:47.351
the data that 

03:37:48.394 --> 03:37:52.296
the function is called with by 
the user or client and content. 

03:37:52.297 --> 03:37:54.297
Context, it is useful.

03:37:56.849 --> 03:37:58.849
If the user is authenticated, we
will 

03:37:59.909 --> 03:38:02.341
get their ID, other information 
about the user.  Now that I have

03:38:02.342 --> 03:38:04.342
the ID, I can go out, 

03:38:06.870 --> 03:38:09.733
get some databased on it.  
Callable functions, they don't 

03:38:09.734 --> 03:38:12.573
stop on the server side but 
there is a client 

03:38:15.670 --> 03:38:18.124
SDK for Android, iOS and the 
web.  In this example, I'll call

03:38:18.125 --> 03:38:22.621
a  callable function by the 
function name and I can call it 

03:38:22.622 --> 03:38:25.118
with any data I need and then 
inside of the call back I can 

03:38:25.119 --> 03:38:27.119
bind that 

03:38:28.163 --> 03:38:34.122
result to a view.  
  Why is this slow?  This is a 

03:38:34.123 --> 03:38:36.123
mistake I was making.

03:38:37.882 --> 03:38:39.989
I had to get all of this data to
the view, I was making three 

03:38:39.990 --> 03:38:41.202
sequential network calls.  This 
one could take anywhere between 

03:38:41.203 --> 03:38:45.519
a half second to two seconds and
then I would make this one, 

03:38:45.520 --> 03:38:47.520
another half 

03:38:48.767 --> 03:38:50.820
second, two seconds, and then 
yet again, you could see 

03:38:50.821 --> 03:38:52.821
sometimes this will take 

03:38:53.859 --> 03:38:56.744
almost 7 seconds.  I decided to 
trace this and fix it so 

03:39:00.032 --> 03:39:02.032
I create a custom trace and 
start it.

03:39:03.739 --> 03:39:05.630
Then I aggregated the three  
calls into one on the server 

03:39:05.631 --> 03:39:08.685
side so now rather than waiting 
for three calls I'm waiting for 

03:39:08.686 --> 03:39:10.686
one.

03:39:11.943 --> 03:39:13.983
This might be a little faster, 
but it is still about a half 

03:39:13.984 --> 03:39:15.984
second to two seconds which I 
wouldn't call that 

03:39:19.504 --> 03:39:22.357
really a 5-star moment, kind of 
a 3-star moment and the reason 

03:39:22.358 --> 03:39:24.358
why, the reason 

03:39:25.431 --> 03:39:27.431
why it takes this long, your 
user may be 

03:39:28.515 --> 03:39:29.723
somewhere else on the other side
of the world than where the 

03:39:29.724 --> 03:39:31.724
server is located.

03:39:33.850 --> 03:39:35.850
The user is on the slow network,
it 

03:39:37.557 --> 03:39:40.450
occurs latency getting to the 
server and back.  This is 

03:39:40.451 --> 03:39:44.491
something that you can solve 
with Firebase hosting.  

03:39:44.492 --> 03:39:46.492
Traditionally, you may think 
Firebase 

03:39:48.198 --> 03:39:51.052
hosting as just the way to serve
websites.  When you think 

03:39:51.053 --> 03:39:53.521
outside of the box, you can use 
Cloud functions and Firebase 

03:39:57.794 --> 03:40:00.873
hosting together to create 
really fast rest APIs.  Because 

03:40:00.874 --> 03:40:02.720
with Firebase hosting, it is 
backed by a content delivery 

03:40:02.721 --> 03:40:07.069
network which means that we have
an entire network of  servers 

03:40:07.070 --> 03:40:09.512
all around the world so that 
when the user needs a piece of 

03:40:11.749 --> 03:40:13.749
data, they're not traveling 
across the 

03:40:15.669 --> 03:40:17.669
world, they're going right up 
the street.

03:40:19.192 --> 03:40:21.450
The server code for this, I 
swish from using a callable 

03:40:21.451 --> 03:40:23.451
function to an on 

03:40:25.176 --> 03:40:27.176
request function to control the 
response.

03:40:28.637 --> 03:40:30.659
So I set a cache control header 
and it tells the server how long

03:40:30.660 --> 03:40:32.660
we'll cache 

03:40:34.733 --> 03:40:36.733
this on the network, and then I 
can 

03:40:38.189 --> 03:40:40.189
decode the token with the 

03:40:43.287 --> 03:40:45.130
fire-businessed admin SDK and 
now the Firebase hosting then 

03:40:45.131 --> 03:40:47.384
talks to Cloud functions.  I set
up this configuration file where

03:40:50.107 --> 03:40:52.107
I just set up a server rewrite 
and I say 

03:40:54.404 --> 03:40:59.102
whenever you see this path call 
this Cloud function.  I write 

03:40:59.103 --> 03:41:01.103
Firebase deploy from the command
line.

03:41:04.130 --> 03:41:10.906
The rest API is available to the
world for use.  I  refactorred 

03:41:10.907 --> 03:41:12.907
the app and I just now call -- I
make a network request out to 

03:41:15.603 --> 03:41:19.079
the domain, I wondered just how 
fast is this now.  I waited a 

03:41:19.080 --> 03:41:21.080
day, and I went back to the 
dashboard.

03:41:22.558 --> 03:41:25.016
I filtered within the last 24 
hours and I saw that my network 

03:41:25.017 --> 03:41:27.017
requests went 

03:41:28.901 --> 03:41:30.952
from almost 7 seconds down to 68
milliseconds.

03:41:35.658 --> 03:41:37.298
That's how fast it loads from a 
cold start the app -- with a 

03:41:37.299 --> 03:41:43.226
cold start of the app, the data 
load, it feels almost instant.  

03:41:43.227 --> 03:41:45.227
This is what the user expects.

03:41:46.491 --> 03:41:48.491
They expect to load the app and 
see 

03:41:50.013 --> 03:41:52.013
the data immediately.

03:41:53.893 --> 03:41:55.736
In order to give a user great 
moments we need to be able to 

03:41:55.737 --> 03:42:00.242
monitor real performance, not 
just worry about -- not just 

03:42:00.243 --> 03:42:02.486
look at the performance we see 
when we develop but the 

03:42:02.487 --> 03:42:04.487
performance that 

03:42:05.763 --> 03:42:07.763
happens in the wild.

03:42:10.477 --> 03:42:12.477
Now my favorite moments is 
handling offline situations.

03:42:14.638 --> 03:42:15.850
When your user loves the app, 
they'll bring it everywhere with

03:42:15.851 --> 03:42:20.634
them.  They bring it camping, 
they take it on the  plane.  

03:42:20.635 --> 03:42:23.087
They bring it to their friend's 
house that has bad cellular 

03:42:23.088 --> 03:42:25.336
service and really flakey wi-fi 
and despite these 

03:42:29.467 --> 03:42:31.330
circumstances, we still want to 
give the user a great moment 

03:42:31.331 --> 03:42:33.331
even when we don't have the 
connection.

03:42:35.258 --> 03:42:38.118
That's not really what happens 
in a lot of the apps we build or

03:42:38.119 --> 03:42:40.119
download.  We want to use it, 
don't have the 

03:42:42.607 --> 03:42:44.607
connection, we have a UI saying 
sorry, 

03:42:47.175 --> 03:42:48.645
find a connection, use this app 
later.

03:42:48.646 --> 03:42:51.693
This isn't what the user is 
looking for.  The user 

03:42:51.694 --> 03:42:53.316
downloaded the app to use it to 
view the content and if we're 

03:42:53.317 --> 03:42:55.317
not able to provide them with an
offline 

03:42:59.499 --> 03:43:01.391
experience it is a disappointing
moment and we don't want to just

03:43:01.392 --> 03:43:05.476
build read only apps offline, we
want them to be functional, we 

03:43:05.477 --> 03:43:07.477
want to provide as much 

03:43:09.357 --> 03:43:11.357
experience without a connection 
as we can with a connection.

03:43:13.607 --> 03:43:15.866
The problem with doing this, it 
is when we build the apps, we 

03:43:15.867 --> 03:43:17.935
have to split everything up when
it comes to data retrievable.

03:43:21.694 --> 03:43:23.706
We'll have an offline cache of 
data for when the user is 

03:43:23.707 --> 03:43:25.707
offline and then 

03:43:26.757 --> 03:43:28.757
back online, we make network 
requests 

03:43:29.759 --> 03:43:31.759
and

03:43:34.349 --> 03:43:36.406
sync that with an offline cache.
It is difficult to architect in 

03:43:36.407 --> 03:43:40.974
your app and online, you think 
about it on the offline stage, 

03:43:40.975 --> 03:43:43.421
online, easy to create bugs and 
easy to get confused.

03:43:45.279 --> 03:43:47.279
This is my favorite part of 
using cloud fire store.

03:43:49.584 --> 03:43:51.584
The cloud firestore, it is a 
document 

03:43:52.707 --> 03:43:54.740
database that's  scalable, has 
simple -- has a simple 

03:43:54.741 --> 03:43:56.983
collection of data and allows 
you to do powerful queries.

03:44:00.868 --> 03:44:02.868
My favorite part, it is how easy
it is 

03:44:03.925 --> 03:44:06.784
to build offline ready 
applications.  This is an app I 

03:44:06.785 --> 03:44:09.061
made, it is a PWA and I use this
app, this camera app online 

03:44:12.108 --> 03:44:14.108
just as I can offline and I save
data 

03:44:18.484 --> 03:44:21.354
and it goes to my weird selfie 
feed.  All I have to do to 

03:44:21.355 --> 03:44:23.355
enable  offline, 

03:44:24.774 --> 03:44:27.368
it is on the web, I just call an
enable persistence anden o 

03:44:27.369 --> 03:44:29.577
Android, iOS, it is enable by 
default.

03:44:33.495 --> 03:44:35.734
But now when we're offline we 
have a new responsibility to the

03:44:35.735 --> 03:44:40.208
user.   Behavior offline can be 
different than behavior online. 

03:44:40.209 --> 03:44:42.209
We have to build a UI that 
guides the 

03:44:45.520 --> 03:44:50.629
user to make correct decisions.
  I have all these pictures, I 

03:44:50.630 --> 03:44:54.142
don't know if any of these 
pictures are synced with the 

03:44:54.143 --> 03:44:56.178
server.  I don't know if I can 
delete them, 

03:44:59.649 --> 03:45:01.649
what, or if anyone else can see 
them.

03:45:06.478 --> 03:45:08.710
I can use cloud firestore to 
help me out here.  I'll create a

03:45:08.711 --> 03:45:12.860
document reference.  I go to the
city's collection, I grab the 

03:45:12.861 --> 03:45:15.100
document of San Francisco.  I 
add a snapshot.

03:45:18.787 --> 03:45:20.787
Every single time this document 

03:45:21.864 --> 03:45:26.413
updates, this snapshot will fire
with the on event listener.  

03:45:26.414 --> 03:45:28.668
Using this data snapshot I can 
go in, get the metadata of the 

03:45:28.669 --> 03:45:31.142
object and see if it has any 
pending rights.

03:45:34.189 --> 03:45:36.189
If it has pending rights, then I
know 

03:45:37.280 --> 03:45:39.537
that this is local-only data, 
and if it doesn't, I know it was

03:45:39.538 --> 03:45:41.538
synced with the server.

03:45:44.909 --> 03:45:47.578
Using this, I can change mine UI
and I can add capacity to my -- 

03:45:47.579 --> 03:45:49.828
to the images so that the user 
can see that they are 

03:45:53.098 --> 03:45:55.098
not synced yet and when it 
changes, they 

03:45:57.372 --> 03:45:59.372
know that the data is now backed
up.

03:46:01.292 --> 03:46:03.128
This is great because we're 
giving the user proper guidance,

03:46:03.129 --> 03:46:05.585
we're giving them an offline 
experience and we're letting 

03:46:07.220 --> 03:46:09.465
them know what's happening while
we're offline.

03:46:17.228 --> 03:46:18.446
A lot of the topics I have 
covered are about bringing 

03:46:18.447 --> 03:46:20.447
expectations, 

03:46:22.134 --> 03:46:24.426
understanding the users' 
expectations and you want to 

03:46:24.427 --> 03:46:29.543
meet the users expectations and 
every now and then you go beyond

03:46:29.544 --> 03:46:31.544
the expectations and surprise 

03:46:32.798 --> 03:46:34.798
the user.

03:46:36.072 --> 03:46:38.559
Not that long ago, I bought a 
house.  The interesting thing 

03:46:38.560 --> 03:46:40.560
about buying a 

03:46:42.831 --> 03:46:44.831
house, once you buy it, 
everything breaks!

03:46:46.094 --> 03:46:48.745
So my hot water heater broke 
pretty much the first week I 

03:46:48.746 --> 03:46:52.305
moved into my house and I had 
someone to come out and take a 

03:46:52.306 --> 03:46:55.817
look at it.  I noticed when 
they're inspecting my hot water 

03:46:55.818 --> 03:46:57.818
heater that they were taking a 

03:46:58.905 --> 03:47:00.953
picture of it with a custom app 
the company built so I asked 

03:47:00.954 --> 03:47:06.284
them, I said hey, is this useful
for you?  It is surprising, he 

03:47:06.285 --> 03:47:09.175
looked at me and said no, it is 
not.  In the past before I had 

03:47:09.176 --> 03:47:12.433
this app I wrote down this 
manufacturer and the serial 

03:47:12.434 --> 03:47:14.270
number of the hot water heater 
and I was done, now I have to 

03:47:14.271 --> 03:47:16.736
open the app, take a picture and
I still have to 

03:47:20.433 --> 03:47:22.433
write down the same information 
as before.

03:47:24.501 --> 03:47:26.395
I kind of thought this is a 
moment where we're not meeting 

03:47:26.396 --> 03:47:30.106
these user expectations and 
we're making things a little 

03:47:30.107 --> 03:47:34.181
more difficult.  When he left, I
went upstairs, I got to work

03:47:37.883 --> 03:47:40.178
I built a little app using ML 
kit.  We launch ML kit at the 

03:47:40.179 --> 03:47:44.702
beginning of -- at the beginning
of this week and ML kit is a 

03:47:44.703 --> 03:47:47.152
tool to bring machine learning 
to mobile devices.

03:47:51.914 --> 03:47:53.914
So I created a vision text 
detector, 

03:47:55.771 --> 03:47:58.232
and then I grabbed a UI image 
from the view, and then I 

03:47:58.233 --> 03:48:01.103
converted it to a vision image 
and using that, I was able 

03:48:04.668 --> 03:48:06.668
to detect any text that was in 
this photo.

03:48:08.973 --> 03:48:10.973
In case you thought that this 
wasn't a 

03:48:12.894 --> 03:48:17.410
real story, this is me.  I'll go
back here.  Can we roll the 

03:48:17.411 --> 03:48:19.411
video?

03:48:21.916 --> 03:48:23.916
This is me in my basement, 
scanning 

03:48:25.587 --> 03:48:27.408
the serial code number of my hot
water heater.  You can see that 

03:48:27.409 --> 03:48:32.188
in realtime I'm picking up the 
text, and then once I see the 

03:48:32.189 --> 03:48:34.220
code is right, you take the 
picture and then I didn't have 

03:48:34.221 --> 03:48:36.221
to write this information down 
and I get the picture 

03:48:41.486 --> 03:48:43.486
and the serial code number all 
at once.

03:48:43.723 --> 03:48:45.723
Can we roll forward?

03:48:48.013 --> 03:48:52.724
This is what the user wanted.   
They don't want two steps.  They

03:48:52.725 --> 03:48:54.725
wanted to have the picture and 

03:48:56.025 --> 03:48:58.441
the serial code number, and this
is something that's going to 

03:48:58.442 --> 03:49:01.726
happen for the user multiple 
times a day.  While it is small,

03:49:01.727 --> 03:49:03.973
it has this larger impact and it
just makes their lives a 

03:49:08.190 --> 03:49:10.190
bit easier in this unexpected 
way.

03:49:11.942 --> 03:49:13.942
Throughout all of this process, 
I 

03:49:16.517 --> 03:49:19.391
thought to myself UX is not 
about fonts, layouts, not about 

03:49:19.392 --> 03:49:22.273
what color of blue you pick.  
User experience, it is about the

03:49:24.311 --> 03:49:26.311
moment that a user goes through 
it and 

03:49:28.481 --> 03:49:30.720
in order to really give the user
a 5-star moment, we have to 

03:49:30.721 --> 03:49:34.858
think about their moment and 
think about the developer tools 

03:49:34.859 --> 03:49:36.859
as a way to create 

03:49:37.942 --> 03:49:39.942
better moments for the users.

03:49:42.433 --> 03:49:44.656
So your feedback for this talk, 
it is really important.  I know 

03:49:44.657 --> 03:49:46.704
you probably heard this in every
single session, but if you have 

03:49:51.908 --> 03:49:55.440
any feedback, visit the I/O app 
and leave that.  It I'll be at 

03:49:55.441 --> 03:49:57.441
the Firebase tent after this.

03:49:58.528 --> 03:50:00.367
If you want to stop by, ask any 
questions, take an offline 

03:50:00.368 --> 03:50:03.248
selfie, I'll be available!  
Thank you so much for coming 

03:50:03.249 --> 03:50:05.249
out!

03:56:14.709 --> 03:56:15.515
Opportunities, Challenges &amp; 
Strategies to Develop AI for 

03:56:15.516 --> 03:56:17.516
Everyone

04:03:11.338 --> 04:03:14.224
Opportunities, Challenges &amp; 
Strategies 

04:03:17.232 --> 04:03:19.232
to Develop AI for Everyone

04:19:48.599 --> 04:19:50.674
Opportunities, Challenges &amp; 
Strategies 

04:19:53.679 --> 04:19:55.679
to Develop AI for Everyone

04:24:05.824 --> 04:24:07.824
all right!

04:24:10.299 --> 04:24:12.299
Thank you for coming.

04:24:22.383 --> 04:24:24.383
Part of Google brain, leader in 
the pair 

04:24:27.428 --> 04:24:29.428
initiative, people  +AI 
research.

04:24:35.497 --> 04:24:37.497
Here to my side, we have Rejen 
Sheth, 

04:24:40.999 --> 04:24:42.019
director of Cloud management, 
and we have Daphne Luong and Jon

04:24:42.020 --> 04:24:44.020
Platt, 

04:24:46.297 --> 04:24:48.297
director of applied science in 
Google ai.

04:24:49.754 --> 04:24:51.871
Today we'll talk about 
opportunities, challenges and 

04:24:51.872 --> 04:24:53.941
strategies to develop AI for 
everyone.

04:24:55.767 --> 04:24:58.411
If you could please, I would 
love for each of you to just 

04:24:58.412 --> 04:25:00.412
talk briefly about 

04:25:04.478 --> 04:25:06.342
what do you do at Google.
  &gt;&gt; RAJEN SHETH: I run the 

04:25:06.343 --> 04:25:08.343
product team for Cloud AI.

04:25:10.265 --> 04:25:12.709
What we're doing, within Google 
Cloud we're trying to figure out

04:25:12.710 --> 04:25:14.710
how to bring 

04:25:17.022 --> 04:25:19.466
the best of AI to developers and
to enterprises.  How we give 

04:25:19.467 --> 04:25:24.161
developers a great platform to 
build on and how do we take the 

04:25:24.162 --> 04:25:26.162
best of Google's AI to make it 
so 

04:25:29.725 --> 04:25:31.725
that they're available as 
services for developers.

04:25:36.450 --> 04:25:38.450
&gt;&gt; DAPHNE LUONG: I work in 
Google AI 

04:25:39.718 --> 04:25:41.718
in the natural language 
understanding.

04:25:44.185 --> 04:25:45.233
&gt;&gt; JON PLATT: I help run the 
applied science within Google 

04:25:45.234 --> 04:25:47.234
AI.

04:25:49.500 --> 04:25:51.791
We're super excited by all the 
opportunities in science related

04:25:51.792 --> 04:25:55.684
to things like biology or 
physics and believe that 

04:25:55.685 --> 04:25:58.131
computer science, especially 
machine learning in AI can 

04:25:59.137 --> 04:26:01.137
accelerate that.

04:26:02.416 --> 04:26:04.416
That's what my work does.
  &gt;&gt; FERNANDA VIEGAS: Thank you.

04:26:05.280 --> 04:26:07.710
A thing that's inspiring to me, 
about this panel, about a lot of

04:26:07.711 --> 04:26:09.711
the themes 

04:26:12.840 --> 04:26:14.840
going on at I/O this year is AI 
for everyone.

04:26:16.090 --> 04:26:18.090
I know in pair, one of the main 

04:26:19.359 --> 04:26:21.630
research themes we have is how 
do you design human-centered AI 

04:26:21.631 --> 04:26:25.699
technology?  How do you start 
with a user in mind and then 

04:26:25.700 --> 04:26:30.172
design machine learning 
technology that fits with that. 

04:26:30.173 --> 04:26:32.173
One of the things I would love 
to ask 

04:26:33.228 --> 04:26:35.228
each of you to talk about a 
little bit 

04:26:37.093 --> 04:26:39.937
is what does AI for everyone 
mean to you?

04:26:40.550 --> 04:26:42.550
&gt;&gt; RAJEN SHETH: For me it is how
do 

04:26:43.813 --> 04:26:46.879
you make AI easy and useful for 
people that want to use it.  I 

04:26:46.880 --> 04:26:49.723
think there are two big problems
that we're seeing right now with

04:26:49.724 --> 04:26:51.724
AI.

04:26:53.177 --> 04:26:55.833
One, that there isn't as much 
skill out there or as much 

04:26:55.834 --> 04:26:57.834
knowledge about how 

04:26:58.895 --> 04:27:00.944
to build AI models, especially 
deep learning as there should 

04:27:00.945 --> 04:27:06.282
be.  We're trying to both build 
tools for that, and to make it 

04:27:06.283 --> 04:27:08.283
so that more people 

04:27:11.789 --> 04:27:13.825
can access AI, but then also can
learn about -- learn about AI 

04:27:13.826 --> 04:27:17.691
and figure out how to use that.
  What we're finding, for 

04:27:17.692 --> 04:27:21.808
example, there are probably in 
the tens of thousands of people 

04:27:21.809 --> 04:27:23.809
out there that know how to use 

04:27:26.284 --> 04:27:29.137
deep learning, a couple of an 
order of a million data 

04:27:29.138 --> 04:27:31.580
scientists and there are 21 
million developers, how do we 

04:27:31.581 --> 04:27:33.581
make AI accessible by the 
developers.

04:27:36.894 --> 04:27:38.894
The second part, usefulness, how
do we make AI useful.

04:27:41.806 --> 04:27:43.456
How do we go for businesses 
beyond where they not only do 

04:27:43.457 --> 04:27:45.480
cool things but do things that 
are useful and actually 

04:27:48.994 --> 04:27:50.833
are vital to the business.
  &gt;&gt; DAPHNE LUONG: To me, 

04:27:50.834 --> 04:27:52.834
getting 

04:27:56.540 --> 04:27:57.551
everyone involved and aware so 
that algorithms have 

04:27:57.552 --> 04:28:00.630
representations for all of the 
users.  On the data side, it 

04:28:00.631 --> 04:28:02.656
means that when you have the 
data that's representative 

04:28:06.505 --> 04:28:08.971
of all our users.
  &gt;&gt; JON PLATT: For me, it is 

04:28:08.972 --> 04:28:13.245
getting the benefits of AI to a 
large part of society across the

04:28:13.246 --> 04:28:17.325
world.  We look for leverage 
points.  We're not trying to get

04:28:17.326 --> 04:28:21.415
everybody in the world to use AI
but to have the fruits of what 

04:28:21.416 --> 04:28:23.416
AI can provide.

04:28:25.921 --> 04:28:27.746
If we can find the leverage 
points, where a local 

04:28:27.747 --> 04:28:29.567
application of AI can really 
help the whole world, that's 

04:28:29.568 --> 04:28:32.422
what we're looking for.  That's 
why I'm super excited about 

04:28:34.064 --> 04:28:37.541
applying AI and machine learning
to problems and science.   You 

04:28:37.542 --> 04:28:39.981
know, science can lead to 
breakthrough technologies.

04:28:41.392 --> 04:28:43.392
&gt;&gt; FERNANDA VIEGAS: I think one 
of the 

04:28:44.501 --> 04:28:46.525
interesting it things here for 
this panel and theme, each of 

04:28:46.526 --> 04:28:51.873
you is coming from a very 
different perspective.  I think 

04:28:51.874 --> 04:28:53.874
of it you coming from the 

04:28:55.722 --> 04:28:58.192
product/business side of things,
Daphne, you're helping build the

04:28:58.193 --> 04:29:00.635
fundamental blocks like the 
data, the fundamental 

04:29:04.306 --> 04:29:06.306
data creation blocks for doing 
this 

04:29:08.382 --> 04:29:11.239
technology, Jon, you're coming 
from a research perspective, how

04:29:11.240 --> 04:29:13.240
do we enable scientists and 
science at large.

04:29:15.303 --> 04:29:16.960
A thing that comes up, whenever 
we talk about AI, when we talk 

04:29:16.961 --> 04:29:18.961
about 

04:29:22.363 --> 04:29:26.361
machine learning, it is this 
notion of representation.  I 

04:29:26.362 --> 04:29:27.375
want to start at the beginning 
of that, I want to talk about 

04:29:27.376 --> 04:29:30.024
data.  Daphne, I was really 
excited when I heard that you 

04:29:30.025 --> 04:29:32.025
were going to be part of this 
panel.

04:29:35.121 --> 04:29:37.972
I think about you as the data 
czar of Google.  Your work is a 

04:29:37.973 --> 04:29:39.973
lot about creating 

04:29:42.859 --> 04:29:46.176
better ways to scale up for 
instance how do we gather data? 

04:29:46.177 --> 04:29:48.396
How do we do it in an insightful
way.  A thing that I would love 

04:29:48.397 --> 04:29:50.397
for you to 

04:29:51.461 --> 04:29:54.134
talk about, a little bit, the 
representation of datasets at 

04:29:54.135 --> 04:29:56.135
Google.

04:29:58.213 --> 04:30:00.213
What's that look like today?

04:30:02.497 --> 04:30:04.497
&gt;&gt; DAPHNE LUONG: Having 
meaningful and 

04:30:05.560 --> 04:30:08.409
systematic correctly calibrated 
labeled data at scale is really 

04:30:08.410 --> 04:30:11.896
crucial for machine learning.  
From a representation 

04:30:11.897 --> 04:30:15.350
perspective, some of the 
datasets out there, they're not 

04:30:15.351 --> 04:30:18.200
well-balanced.   For example, if
you look at Wikipedia 

04:30:23.514 --> 04:30:24.492
data, right, the he components 
is mentioned so much more than 

04:30:24.493 --> 04:30:27.011
she.  Inside of Google we have a
lot of data.

04:30:30.105 --> 04:30:32.105
An example set that I want to 
talk 

04:30:34.372 --> 04:30:36.372
about, it is the audio dataset 
that we Open Sourced last year.

04:30:38.874 --> 04:30:40.874
The datasets had 2.

04:30:42.936 --> 04:30:44.936
1 million video with 8.

04:30:48.649 --> 04:30:51.133
5K hours of audio, but then we 
had about 500 classes of sound. 

04:30:51.134 --> 04:30:53.772
That's interesting.  You have 
sounds from speech, music, 

04:30:59.287 --> 04:31:01.287
all the way to engine sounds or 
burping 

04:31:02.288 --> 04:31:06.211
or gurgeling, from that 
perspective, it is important to 

04:31:06.212 --> 04:31:08.212
have audio and sound from the 
world.

04:31:11.298 --> 04:31:12.363
From having sounds from kids in 
India, China, very different 

04:31:12.364 --> 04:31:14.364
from the U.S.

04:31:15.834 --> 04:31:16.241
We think about that when we make
the datasets.

04:31:16.242 --> 04:31:18.690
&gt;&gt; FERNANDA VIEGAS: Yeah.  When 
I became aware of all the 

04:31:20.320 --> 04:31:23.198
different Open Sourced datasets 
that we have put out, I was 

04:31:23.199 --> 04:31:25.199
really -- it is 

04:31:26.879 --> 04:31:28.879
really exciting to see audio, 
video tags 

04:31:30.735 --> 04:31:32.735
to translation, you have all of 
those.

04:31:35.180 --> 04:31:37.503
Whenever you talk about data and
machine learning you're talking 

04:31:37.504 --> 04:31:39.504
about challenges.  A thing you 
started to touch on a bit, 

04:31:42.837 --> 04:31:44.837
I want to pull it out more is 
the notion 

04:31:46.697 --> 04:31:48.697
of representation, making sure 
that the 

04:31:50.376 --> 04:31:52.230
dataset has good representation 
from different users, different 

04:31:52.231 --> 04:31:54.231
communities, and that's a hard 
thing to do.

04:31:57.527 --> 04:31:59.360
I'm curious what are we at 
Google doing about that?  How 

04:31:59.361 --> 04:32:02.825
are you thinking about that?
  &gt;&gt; DAPHNE LUONG: You know, 

04:32:02.826 --> 04:32:04.826
Google 

04:32:06.689 --> 04:32:08.713
users and  communities, right, 
they have been generous donating

04:32:08.714 --> 04:32:10.714
data, so forth, 

04:32:12.799 --> 04:32:14.208
to make the product better and 
an example is Google guy, how 

04:32:14.209 --> 04:32:18.758
many of you have used that in 
the audience?  Right.  On the 

04:32:18.759 --> 04:32:21.229
data front, we're also doing o 
something very similar, we have 

04:32:21.230 --> 04:32:26.120
a crowdsource app which is an 
app and on the web, and right 

04:32:26.121 --> 04:32:30.917
now, since the last two years, 
we actually have had 2 million 

04:32:30.918 --> 04:32:33.163
users donating to the app from 
all over the world, actually 232

04:32:35.201 --> 04:32:38.646
countries, that's a lot of 
different people!  Right?  We 

04:32:38.647 --> 04:32:40.675
have 200 million donations from 
people answering questions all 

04:32:40.676 --> 04:32:42.676
the way 

04:32:45.973 --> 04:32:48.610
from hey, can you see this sign 
from the street in Indonesia 

04:32:48.611 --> 04:32:51.444
versus how do you finish this 
sentence?  What's the sentiment 

04:32:51.445 --> 04:32:56.737
of this sentence in Hindi?  
There is all of that data.  The 

04:32:56.738 --> 04:32:59.988
data, it actually helps us make 
product better.  It helps people

04:32:59.989 --> 04:33:01.989
navigate streets where 

04:33:06.551 --> 04:33:09.199
there is no sign from landmark, 
Marcking the keyboard more 

04:33:09.200 --> 04:33:11.200
accessible as 

04:33:12.857 --> 04:33:14.485
well as making heavy detailed 
label sets.  That's really 

04:33:14.486 --> 04:33:17.539
important.  If you don't have 
the crowdsource app, please 

04:33:17.540 --> 04:33:21.245
download it!
  &gt;&gt; FERNANDA VIEGAS: Great.  

04:33:21.246 --> 04:33:23.246
Thank you.

04:33:24.298 --> 04:33:25.727
A thing about audio that I had 
never thought about until I read

04:33:25.728 --> 04:33:27.728
this, it is 

04:33:29.012 --> 04:33:31.855
that there is a huge discrepancy
between even voices of adults 

04:33:31.856 --> 04:33:36.345
versus children and children -- 
it is -- so you have to think 

04:33:36.346 --> 04:33:38.985
about many, many different 
dimensions of diversity.

04:33:43.460 --> 04:33:45.460
&gt;&gt; DAPHNE LUONG: From the app, 
we have 

04:33:49.559 --> 04:33:51.195
user-initiated groups in 35 
countries and I'm really excited

04:33:51.196 --> 04:33:53.638
about the whole contributions.
  &gt;&gt; FERNANDA VIEGAS: Awesome.

04:33:57.324 --> 04:33:59.360
Now moving on a little bit from 
data, one of the  things, 

04:33:59.361 --> 04:34:01.361
whenever we talk 

04:34:03.252 --> 04:34:05.691
about AI for everyone, one of 
the first questions that comes 

04:34:05.692 --> 04:34:07.692
to mind is how do 

04:34:10.167 --> 04:34:12.167
we make AI accessible and better
for our users?

04:34:16.485 --> 04:34:18.485
Rajen Sheth, I'll turn to you, 
since 

04:34:19.942 --> 04:34:22.787
you are helping lead these 
services on Cloud, right, how do

04:34:22.788 --> 04:34:25.642
you think about designing these 
ML tools so that they're 

04:34:29.325 --> 04:34:31.325
easy for users to use.

04:34:33.408 --> 04:34:35.430
Then a segue question there too,
if you can talk about the 

04:34:35.431 --> 04:34:37.431
difficulties 

04:34:38.484 --> 04:34:40.733
you're starting to see, what are
the patterns where users are 

04:34:40.734 --> 04:34:41.950
getting stuck?
  &gt;&gt; RAJEN SHETH: A great 

04:34:41.951 --> 04:34:44.599
question.
  There are two big parts of 

04:34:44.600 --> 04:34:49.066
that.  One, how do we make it 
easy for people to create models

04:34:49.067 --> 04:34:51.912
and the second part, how do we 
make sure that the models are 

04:34:55.163 --> 04:34:56.784
fair or not biased, are really 
serving the purpose in the right

04:34:56.785 --> 04:35:01.470
way.  It is very easy for people
to just take what they have been

04:35:01.471 --> 04:35:03.471
doing manually 

04:35:05.349 --> 04:35:07.416
and end up encoding into a 
model.  On one part of it, what 

04:35:07.417 --> 04:35:10.253
we're doing, we're providing a 
variety of tools.   One of the 

04:35:10.254 --> 04:35:12.254
more interesting things 

04:35:13.317 --> 04:35:15.317
we're working on, it is Cloud 
auto ML.

04:35:16.381 --> 04:35:18.610
Cloud auto ML is a way by which 
you can give the dataset and 

04:35:18.611 --> 04:35:23.494
then we'll use machine learning 
to create a machine learning 

04:35:23.495 --> 04:35:25.495
model for that dataset.  The 
first area we're doing this with

04:35:28.161 --> 04:35:29.991
is image recognition where you  
give us a set of images that are

04:35:29.992 --> 04:35:32.238
labeled and we'll give you a 
highly accurate model 

04:35:38.138 --> 04:35:40.375
on top of that to predict for 
images.   That's really helped 

04:35:40.376 --> 04:35:44.391
this expand.  We have 15,000 
people that have signed up for 

04:35:44.392 --> 04:35:48.517
access to that.  We're seeing 
amazing use cases, everything 

04:35:48.518 --> 04:35:51.359
from really large companies to 
very small companies who are 

04:35:51.360 --> 04:35:55.187
doing things around, for 
example, helping farmers manage 

04:35:55.188 --> 04:35:57.649
their field or helping track 
litter and making sure that they

04:36:00.901 --> 04:36:02.136
track litter back to the 
producers.

04:36:02.137 --> 04:36:04.196
&gt;&gt; FERNANDA VIEGAS: How much 
technical expertise do I as a 

04:36:04.197 --> 04:36:06.197
user need to have if 

04:36:08.614 --> 04:36:11.736
I want to use auto ML?
  &gt;&gt; RAJEN SHETH: Great 

04:36:11.737 --> 04:36:13.737
question, we're 

04:36:15.391 --> 04:36:17.391
trying to limit it to limited or
no use to use it.

04:36:19.048 --> 04:36:21.290
Same as photos, you up load the 
pictures, label them, we're 

04:36:21.291 --> 04:36:23.291
integrating 

04:36:25.954 --> 04:36:28.420
with a lot of serviceses that 
Daphne's team is using to have 

04:36:28.421 --> 04:36:32.534
us label it and hit train and we
create a model for you.  That 

04:36:32.535 --> 04:36:35.607
said, getting the right dataset,
it is the key part.  Even if you

04:36:35.608 --> 04:36:37.842
don't have to create the model, 
you have to create the right 

04:36:37.843 --> 04:36:42.537
dataset.  Atlanta we're trying 
to provide tools to make sure 

04:36:42.538 --> 04:36:44.538
that people are able to create 
the right dataset and figure out

04:36:45.802 --> 04:36:47.802
if there are flaws in the 
dataset.

04:36:48.853 --> 04:36:50.486
On the other side of this, 
around bias, we're trying to 

04:36:50.487 --> 04:36:54.758
figure out tools around that and
also help advise customers with 

04:36:54.759 --> 04:36:59.031
best practices to make sure that
the dataset that they're putting

04:36:59.032 --> 04:37:01.032
in can actually produce the 

04:37:03.103 --> 04:37:04.122
right results.
  &gt;&gt; FERNANDA VIEGAS: Data 

04:37:04.123 --> 04:37:06.123
continues to 

04:37:07.129 --> 04:37:09.463
be a bottle neck.
  &gt;&gt; RAJEN SHETH: It is the 

04:37:09.464 --> 04:37:11.920
foundation of this.  If you have
the wrong data you have 

04:37:15.028 --> 04:37:16.454
the wrong results.
  &gt;&gt; FERNANDA VIEGAS: Jon, one 

04:37:16.455 --> 04:37:20.725
of the things, as you have all 
been seeing, diversity, 

04:37:20.726 --> 04:37:23.590
diversity in datasets, also how 
do you create the experiences 

04:37:23.591 --> 04:37:26.074
for users who are not themselves
machine 

04:37:29.125 --> 04:37:31.152
learning experts to be able to 
use the technology.  I'm also 

04:37:31.153 --> 04:37:33.153
curious to hear from you 

04:37:35.650 --> 04:37:37.482
about diversity and 
representation.  On the side of 

04:37:37.483 --> 04:37:40.562
machine learning developers and 
researchers.  The reason I'm 

04:37:40.563 --> 04:37:42.563
looking at you, you're working 
with scientists.

04:37:45.669 --> 04:37:48.660
These are people who are going 
to be potentially

04:37:53.047 --> 04:37:54.670
meeting custom models, Puching 
the envelopes sometimes and they

04:37:54.671 --> 04:37:56.671
may not be themselves machine 
learning experts.

04:37:58.943 --> 04:37:59.965
I'm curious about your thoughts 
there.

04:37:59.966 --> 04:38:02.407
&gt;&gt; JON PLATT: Right.  Science is
getting to be increasingly 

04:38:06.470 --> 04:38:09.120
data driven, a lot of scientists
like  physicists toes geologists

04:38:09.121 --> 04:38:13.994
to biologists, they do their job
by gathering large amounts of 

04:38:13.995 --> 04:38:18.263
data.  They're getting into data
science.  There is a big 

04:38:18.264 --> 04:38:20.731
opportunity right now for them 
to use machine learning to make 

04:38:23.986 --> 04:38:25.986
themselves be much more 
productive.

04:38:26.024 --> 04:38:27.641
The way I look at it, it is kind
of like giving the scientist 

04:38:27.642 --> 04:38:29.642
thousands of 

04:38:31.484 --> 04:38:33.484
undergraduate assistance

04:38:34.750 --> 04:38:36.376
looking at slides if you can 
examine the slides themselves, 

04:38:36.377 --> 04:38:41.286
you have thousands of assistance
look at it with you.  That's an 

04:38:41.287 --> 04:38:43.126
example.
  I don't think I answered the 

04:38:43.127 --> 04:38:45.127
question.

04:38:47.014 --> 04:38:49.064
I'm excited that we can build 
kind of models to help 

04:38:49.065 --> 04:38:51.065
scientists do specific 

04:38:52.120 --> 04:38:54.967
things to help accelerate their 
research.  We actually 

04:38:54.968 --> 04:38:56.995
collaborate with scientists to 
build these kinds of models.

04:39:00.097 --> 04:39:01.300
I don't know if that answers 
your question.

04:39:01.301 --> 04:39:03.301
&gt;&gt; FERNANDA VIEGAS: What kind of
scientists are you working with?

04:39:03.973 --> 04:39:07.242
  &gt;&gt; JON PLATT: Well, applied 
science people, there is a bunch

04:39:07.243 --> 04:39:09.243
of us working 

04:39:10.696 --> 04:39:16.587
with biomedical research trying 
to understand the core research 

04:39:16.588 --> 04:39:20.645
ever disease, regenerative 
diseases, there are a bunch of 

04:39:20.646 --> 04:39:22.271
us working on climate and 
energy, we're working with TIA 

04:39:22.272 --> 04:39:27.151
technologies trying to figure 
out if we can make fusion 

04:39:27.152 --> 04:39:29.152
energy, make it commercially 
relevant.

04:39:30.412 --> 04:39:32.650
We span across biology, physics,
chemistry, we work with people 

04:39:32.651 --> 04:39:34.651
that 

04:39:36.326 --> 04:39:38.326
simulate quantum chemistry.

04:39:40.195 --> 04:39:41.011
&gt;&gt; FERNANDA VIEGAS: I guess the 
same question I asked Rajen 

04:39:41.012 --> 04:39:43.884
Sheth, I would ask you, what do 
you see as the biggest 

04:39:45.780 --> 04:39:49.853
difficulties for scientists to 
do this kind of work today?  Are

04:39:49.854 --> 04:39:52.106
there patterns?  Data, 
understanding how to put 

04:39:53.124 --> 04:39:57.188
together models?  Is it -- what 
do you see?

04:39:57.988 --> 04:40:00.229
&gt;&gt; JON PLATT: They generally 
don't want to build models 

04:40:00.230 --> 04:40:04.520
themselves.  There is an 
increasing crossover between 

04:40:04.521 --> 04:40:06.521
scientists and computer 
scientists.

04:40:09.822 --> 04:40:11.233
I think they would prefer to 
have a productivity tool, in 

04:40:11.234 --> 04:40:13.671
other words could they get -- 
can we help them build a 

04:40:17.132 --> 04:40:18.759
productivity tool for their own 
research and either they can try

04:40:18.760 --> 04:40:23.026
to build it themselves if they 
know machine learning or we can 

04:40:23.027 --> 04:40:24.261
help  them.
  &gt;&gt; FERNANDA VIEGAS: Along 

04:40:24.262 --> 04:40:26.262
those lines, 

04:40:27.739 --> 04:40:29.739
a thing that I have been very 
excited 

04:40:33.847 --> 04:40:36.284
about, a few months ago folks in
Pair in collaboration with 

04:40:36.285 --> 04:40:38.285
others at Google 

04:40:39.739 --> 04:40:41.739
launched cancer  flow.js.

04:40:43.198 --> 04:40:44.814
This is really significant in 
the sense that what we were 

04:40:44.815 --> 04:40:47.463
talking about in terms of 
Democratizing the technology 

04:40:51.142 --> 04:40:53.167
and bringing machine learning to
the web, right, tenser flow.

04:40:56.403 --> 04:40:58.877
js speaks the native language of
the web, speaks Java script, so 

04:40:58.878 --> 04:41:00.878
now you have 

04:41:04.348 --> 04:41:06.528
a whole new set of developers 
who can start to take advantage 

04:41:06.529 --> 04:41:08.529
TensorFlow this technology.

04:41:09.828 --> 04:41:11.828
We already are starting to see 
some interesting  applications.

04:41:15.520 --> 04:41:17.548
For instance, one developer who 
decided to create, to train a 

04:41:17.549 --> 04:41:19.549
model 

04:41:21.424 --> 04:41:24.065
based on his web camera to make 
the mouse move in different 

04:41:24.066 --> 04:41:27.324
directions just by where he was 
looking.  If he looked up, the 

04:41:27.325 --> 04:41:29.358
mouse would go   up.  If he 
looked down, the mouse would go 

04:41:29.359 --> 04:41:31.591
down.  The reason he did that, 
because he was 

04:41:35.665 --> 04:41:37.665
trying to help a friend who had 
suffered 

04:41:40.338 --> 04:41:42.366
a stroke and became a 
paraplegic, that to me,  again, 

04:41:42.367 --> 04:41:44.367
starts to talk about this 

04:41:46.659 --> 04:41:48.737
possibility of bringing the 
technology into your -- what do 

04:41:48.738 --> 04:41:50.738
you need, how can 

04:41:53.216 --> 04:41:55.216
you train these models, for your

04:41:58.106 --> 04:42:00.106
specific purposes.

04:42:01.763 --> 04:42:03.792
A thing I think as we talk about
Democratizing the technology, as

04:42:03.793 --> 04:42:06.449
we talk about bringing it to 
everybody, one of 

04:42:10.113 --> 04:42:12.113
the things I think we at Google 
are very 

04:42:14.012 --> 04:42:15.860
mindful of is that we have to do
that with insight and 

04:42:15.861 --> 04:42:17.861
responsibility.  Right.

04:42:20.344 --> 04:42:22.344
You want to be thinking ahead.

04:42:25.449 --> 04:42:27.449
A question I have is since you 
are 

04:42:31.366 --> 04:42:33.813
providing this service, right, 
what happens if you have bad 

04:42:33.814 --> 04:42:35.814
actors trying to 

04:42:38.849 --> 04:42:41.347
use your service and what 
safeguards can you provide?

04:42:42.209 --> 04:42:44.428
&gt;&gt; RAJEN SHETH: A great question
that's very top of mind for us.

04:42:44.429 --> 04:42:49.966
  As we see more people use AI, 
we want to make sure that we're 

04:42:49.967 --> 04:42:51.967
providing those 

04:42:53.624 --> 04:42:55.624
safeguards whether it is kind of

04:42:56.885 --> 04:42:58.885
safeguards or best practices to 
make 

04:43:00.338 --> 04:43:02.178
sure that is the event is used 
in the right way.  On one hand, 

04:43:02.179 --> 04:43:04.179
if you ever the Open Source 
technologies, it is hard to 

04:43:05.658 --> 04:43:07.526
prevent people from doing bad 
things if they want to do bad 

04:43:07.527 --> 04:43:09.676
things.  An advantage we have 
with Cloud, we can.

04:43:13.330 --> 04:43:15.185
We can put in this terms of 
services and acceptable use 

04:43:15.186 --> 04:43:17.186
policies, things like that to 
make sure people are not using 

04:43:18.072 --> 04:43:23.377
this in the right way.  I think 
one thing we're discovering with

04:43:23.378 --> 04:43:25.601
AI, it is that we have to 
rethink that.  It is not an 

04:43:25.602 --> 04:43:28.245
infrastructure technology 
anymore.  We have to rethink the

04:43:28.246 --> 04:43:30.246
uses.

04:43:31.518 --> 04:43:33.518
That's something that we're 
doing quite a bit.

04:43:34.644 --> 04:43:36.644
Another thing that worries me 
too.

04:43:37.922 --> 04:43:39.922
Beyond just bad actors, people 

04:43:41.988 --> 04:43:43.213
unintentionally doing things 
that might be bad and not even 

04:43:43.214 --> 04:43:46.466
knowing they are.  It goes back 
to things we talked about with 

04:43:46.467 --> 04:43:49.918
bias and fairness.  In a lot of 
cases, people aren't intending 

04:43:49.919 --> 04:43:52.146
to create something that's 
biased but they end up creating 

04:43:53.802 --> 04:43:57.070
something that's biased because 
of the data coming in.  That's 

04:43:57.071 --> 04:43:59.071
another area we're looking at a 
bit.

04:44:00.319 --> 04:44:02.319
How do we help people out there,
our 

04:44:04.421 --> 04:44:06.256
customers, developers, how do we
help them have the tools that we

04:44:06.257 --> 04:44:08.257
can do this 

04:44:09.299 --> 04:44:10.940
well as such as they're not 
intentionally creating bad 

04:44:10.941 --> 04:44:12.362
moments.
  &gt;&gt; DAPHNE LUONG: Alongside 

04:44:12.363 --> 04:44:17.032
tooling, right, I think it is 
also important to get people 

04:44:17.033 --> 04:44:19.033
trained all the way from the 

04:44:20.301 --> 04:44:21.927
beginning end-to-end, really 
mindful of the data diversity, 

04:44:21.928 --> 04:44:23.928
what you need for data.

04:44:26.563 --> 04:44:28.563
We train

04:44:34.243 --> 04:44:36.243
an an notator and others to 
understand 

04:44:37.890 --> 04:44:39.752
about best data, best practices 
in machine learning.

04:44:39.753 --> 04:44:41.172
&gt;&gt; FERNANDA VIEGAS: Absolutely.
  &gt;&gt; JON PLATT: I usually think 

04:44:41.173 --> 04:44:43.173
about this from the research 
perspective 

04:44:45.857 --> 04:44:48.959
because I'm a researcher, we 
write and publish papers.  We 

04:44:48.960 --> 04:44:51.461
have to think very carefully 
about when we write a paper, the

04:44:51.462 --> 04:44:53.896
intent is to have a positive 
impact on the world.

04:44:58.153 --> 04:44:59.991
So before we release the paper, 
we say is this going to have a 

04:44:59.992 --> 04:45:01.992
positive impact on the world or 
not?

04:45:05.279 --> 04:45:07.512
We can't always predict, there 
will be unintended consequences 

04:45:07.513 --> 04:45:09.513
of releasing technology.

04:45:11.208 --> 04:45:13.208
We try to, you know, do the best
we can.

04:45:14.660 --> 04:45:16.660
We generally have a bias towards

04:45:17.743 --> 04:45:19.585
openness because it is just 
generally we have the prior -- 

04:45:19.586 --> 04:45:21.819
it is better to share the 
technologies.

04:45:23.043 --> 04:45:25.043
&gt;&gt; FERNANDA VIEGAS: As a 
researcher 

04:45:27.517 --> 04:45:29.517
myself, I love the ethos of just

04:45:30.530 --> 04:45:32.530
publishing and Open Sourcing and
I have never been 

04:45:36.558 --> 04:45:38.401
in a field like this before 
where the whole idea is that you

04:45:38.402 --> 04:45:40.402
publish as soon 

04:45:41.649 --> 04:45:44.081
as you have a finding, and then 
you submit to a conference.  I 

04:45:44.082 --> 04:45:46.082
had never seen that before.  I 
think it is wonderful.

04:45:49.596 --> 04:45:52.242
It means that the field 
progresses much faster.

04:45:55.101 --> 04:45:57.137
I want to come back to one point
that we were talking about, the 

04:45:57.138 --> 04:45:59.138
notion of 

04:46:00.758 --> 04:46:04.527
there may be unintended 
consequences even with the best 

04:46:04.528 --> 04:46:07.403
of intentions, you may not know 
that your data is bias or that 

04:46:07.404 --> 04:46:09.404
there may 

04:46:10.408 --> 04:46:13.329
be something, one thought that I
love to 

04:46:18.617 --> 04:46:20.617
put out, this notion that 
building tools 

04:46:22.892 --> 04:46:25.742
so that people can inspect the 
data and also opening up the 

04:46:25.743 --> 04:46:30.248
community of people who inspect 
these things.  In pair, for 

04:46:30.249 --> 04:46:32.249
instance, one of the 

04:46:33.871 --> 04:46:34.483
things we have been doing, 
building tools, visualization 

04:46:34.484 --> 04:46:36.484
tools that 

04:46:39.552 --> 04:46:40.990
visualize the entire dataset and
allows you to see that this is 

04:46:40.991 --> 04:46:42.991
the shape of the the  data, this
is the distribution, 

04:46:46.502 --> 04:46:48.502
this is what female data points 
look 

04:46:50.174 --> 04:46:52.174
like or male data points.

04:46:53.433 --> 04:46:55.433
What this means, because it is 
this 

04:46:57.088 --> 04:46:59.116
kind of user interface where 
they experience the 

04:46:59.117 --> 04:47:03.389
visualization, it means not only
developers can look at this.  It

04:47:03.390 --> 04:47:05.390
means that product managers can 
look at this.

04:47:09.573 --> 04:47:11.700
Executives, different 
stakeholders can have a 

04:47:14.360 --> 04:47:16.197
conversation, sit together, oh, 
I don't know, I saw something 

04:47:16.198 --> 04:47:18.198
strange in the dataset, what do 
you think will happen 

04:47:20.715 --> 04:47:22.715
when we facet it by this 
dimension here.

04:47:23.773 --> 04:47:25.773
I would love to hear a little 
bit of 

04:47:27.434 --> 04:47:29.434
your thoughts on the importance 
of 

04:47:30.692 --> 04:47:32.719
broadening the conversation 
around doing AI for everyone so 

04:47:32.720 --> 04:47:34.720
that it is not a 

04:47:36.216 --> 04:47:38.647
conversation that is happening 
only amongst developers, 

04:47:38.648 --> 04:47:40.648
obviously the 

04:47:42.718 --> 04:47:44.552
developers are super important 
but it is a conversation that 

04:47:44.553 --> 04:47:46.553
needs to happen with 

04:47:49.243 --> 04:47:50.257
a broader set of stakeholders.
  &gt;&gt; RAJEN SHETH: A thought on 

04:47:50.258 --> 04:47:53.706
that, it is interesting, in the 
previous conversation, you 

04:47:53.707 --> 04:47:57.988
talked about how rapidly this is
going.  A way I usually start 

04:47:57.989 --> 04:48:00.464
out the presentations to 
customers, the first 

04:48:03.499 --> 04:48:08.204
slide I show a picture of, the  
mosaic browser from 1994.  My 

04:48:08.205 --> 04:48:10.845
point with it, all of us, you 
know, we remember back to what 

04:48:10.846 --> 04:48:15.523
that was, and before that point,
the Internet had been around for

04:48:15.524 --> 04:48:17.747
a very long time before that 
point.  that was when the 

04:48:17.748 --> 04:48:19.979
Internet started to go out to 
many more people for many more 

04:48:19.980 --> 04:48:24.030
things.  You start to see 
everything from checking sports 

04:48:24.031 --> 04:48:26.031
scores all the way the 

04:48:28.321 --> 04:48:30.552
through the eCommerce, all kinds
of things, it opened up 

04:48:30.553 --> 04:48:32.579
possibilities and questions.  
Also questions where there 

04:48:32.580 --> 04:48:35.650
needed to be more tools.  Tools 
to make it easier and tools to 

04:48:36.258 --> 04:48:38.258
make things safe.

04:48:39.719 --> 04:48:43.394
I think we're at 1994,ish we're 
at that point for AI right now. 

04:48:43.395 --> 04:48:45.452
It is used for years and years 
and years, and now it is used in

04:48:45.453 --> 04:48:47.453
many, many more ways.

04:48:51.363 --> 04:48:53.002
I think we need to think about 
new problems that are starting 

04:48:53.003 --> 04:48:55.845
to come up every single day, and
new technologies 

04:48:59.141 --> 04:49:01.168
are coming out every single day.
We're going to think about that,

04:49:01.169 --> 04:49:03.403
not just as a developer 
community and then 

04:49:06.429 --> 04:49:08.429
in coordination with how it is 
used and 

04:49:11.312 --> 04:49:12.729
the people it is affecting.
  &gt;&gt; JON PLATT: We were just 

04:49:12.730 --> 04:49:16.852
talking about the first spam 
detector before we came up in 

04:49:16.853 --> 04:49:18.853
1997.

04:49:20.104 --> 04:49:22.104
That -- I remember the first 
small 

04:49:23.350 --> 04:49:25.350
email that was sent in the 80s 
so it is 

04:49:26.409 --> 04:49:28.409
as new problems come up, you 
need new 

04:49:30.093 --> 04:49:31.516
tools to kind of help fight the 
problem.

04:49:31.517 --> 04:49:33.764
&gt;&gt; RAJEN SHETH: For a long time 
you didn't need a spam detector 

04:49:33.765 --> 04:49:38.036
and then all of a sudden you 
did, you had to have tools to be

04:49:38.037 --> 04:49:39.052
able to work with it.
  &gt;&gt; FERNANDA VIEGAS: Another 

04:49:39.053 --> 04:49:43.554
thing, another aspect of this, 
of broadening the conversation, 

04:49:43.555 --> 04:49:49.042
especially when talking about 
products also, it is this notion

04:49:49.043 --> 04:49:51.698
of having in the same room your 
technical team, your design 

04:49:51.699 --> 04:49:53.699
team, for 

04:49:54.746 --> 04:49:57.181
instance, and the PMs, so forth.
A thing that we're doing at 

04:49:57.182 --> 04:49:59.182
Google, it 

04:50:02.296 --> 04:50:04.296
is finding ways of involving the

04:50:05.567 --> 04:50:07.567
designers, the UXers from the 
beginning 

04:50:08.820 --> 04:50:10.864
and educating them around 
machine learning as a design 

04:50:10.865 --> 04:50:12.865
material.

04:50:14.529 --> 04:50:16.358
How do you think about that as 
little as the material you'll 

04:50:16.359 --> 04:50:17.989
design with.
  If you think about it, it is a

04:50:17.990 --> 04:50:19.990
very challenging material.

04:50:22.056 --> 04:50:24.489
It is something that each person
in a product may have a slightly

04:50:24.490 --> 04:50:27.348
different user experience.  My 
experience may be very different

04:50:27.956 --> 04:50:32.841
from yours.  Certain things may 
be automated in different ways 

04:50:32.842 --> 04:50:34.842
for different people at 
different times.

04:50:38.576 --> 04:50:39.391
It makes the UX, the user 
interaction, much more 

04:50:39.392 --> 04:50:41.392
challenging.

04:50:42.471 --> 04:50:45.341
That space becomes a lot bigger.
So again, when we're talking 

04:50:45.342 --> 04:50:47.342
about AI 

04:50:48.819 --> 04:50:50.849
for everyone, it really means 
this conversation that needs to 

04:50:50.850 --> 04:50:52.850
happen 

04:50:55.125 --> 04:50:57.996
between multiple parties.
  A thing I have to come back to

04:50:57.997 --> 04:50:59.997
before 

04:51:01.242 --> 04:51:06.334
we run out of time, John, it is 
this notion of science.  One of 

04:51:06.335 --> 04:51:08.335
the things that I think there's 

04:51:10.265 --> 04:51:12.291
a lot of excitement around, it 
is that machine learning could 

04:51:12.292 --> 04:51:14.719
be a new paradigm for 
scientists.

04:51:18.808 --> 04:51:20.808
That finally we could solve 
certain 

04:51:22.284 --> 04:51:24.284
very complex scientific problems
using these new tools.

04:51:27.603 --> 04:51:29.603
I'm curious about your thoughts 
as why 

04:51:31.666 --> 04:51:33.666
is it that AI makes such a 
difference in 

04:51:34.725 --> 04:51:36.974
these very complex spaces.
  &gt;&gt; JON PLATT: That's an 

04:51:36.975 --> 04:51:38.975
excellent question.

04:51:40.050 --> 04:51:42.050
Right now the current State of 
AI and 

04:51:44.317 --> 04:51:46.317
machine learning, it is still 
very 

04:51:48.589 --> 04:51:49.844
perceptible, we're good at 
looking at images, listening to 

04:51:49.845 --> 04:51:53.294
sounds.  You can imagine as I 
said before, I would like to 

04:51:53.295 --> 04:51:55.295
talk about these thousands of 
undergraduates, they would be 

04:51:58.595 --> 04:52:01.227
listening, looking at the data 
and that's a great productivity 

04:52:01.228 --> 04:52:06.546
term for science.  In the long 
run, people are starting to 

04:52:06.547 --> 04:52:08.547
research into this, but in the 
long 

04:52:11.472 --> 04:52:13.499
run, what we really want is 
something where the algorithm, 

04:52:13.500 --> 04:52:18.177
the machine learning, it tries 
to find out what caused what.  

04:52:18.178 --> 04:52:21.021
It is  very, very early in 
research but that's almost the 

04:52:21.022 --> 04:52:23.022
essence of a scientific model 
explains, you know, 

04:52:28.350 --> 04:52:29.975
this caused that and you can 
extrapolate if you know what the

04:52:29.976 --> 04:52:31.976
model is.

04:52:33.222 --> 04:52:35.222
That's the long term trend for 
AI but we're not there yet.

04:52:37.727 --> 04:52:39.727
We don't -- our models don't 
really 

04:52:43.179 --> 04:52:44.866
understand causation yet yet.
  &gt;&gt; FERNANDA VIEGAS: We had a 

04:52:44.867 --> 04:52:46.917
visiting scientist in our group 
in cambridge.

04:52:50.389 --> 04:52:52.634
He's an earthquake scientist, 
he's a professor at Harvard and 

04:52:52.635 --> 04:52:54.635
he came and spent half a year 
with us.

04:52:57.735 --> 04:52:59.163
A thing I thought of that was 
incredibly inspiring about what 

04:52:59.164 --> 04:53:01.164
he was 

04:53:02.619 --> 04:53:04.043
doing, obviously as an 
earthquake scientist you want to

04:53:04.044 --> 04:53:06.087
predict earthquakes, it is 
incredibly hard.

04:53:09.166 --> 04:53:11.166
We can't don't it well, yet.

04:53:13.028 --> 04:53:14.248
The thing that he was able to 
do, I don't know anything about 

04:53:14.249 --> 04:53:16.249
earthquake science, he explained
to me this is the 

04:53:20.986 --> 04:53:23.383
kind of science that lives in 
HPC high performance computing.

04:53:27.020 --> 04:53:29.020
Huge, huge computers that will 
spend 

04:53:33.355 --> 04:53:35.355
entire weeks doing very, very

04:53:36.866 --> 04:53:39.100
gnarly  compilations, trying to 
simulate where an aftershock 

04:53:39.101 --> 04:53:42.384
happens after an earthquake 
quake, something that people in 

04:53:42.385 --> 04:53:45.430
California should care a lot 
about, I'm sure you do.

04:53:47.857 --> 04:53:49.857
Imagine something that takes a 
week 

04:53:52.376 --> 04:53:54.376
running on huge computers, okay,
he was 

04:53:57.461 --> 04:53:59.461
able to get these kinds of 
simulation 

04:54:01.957 --> 04:54:04.599
results that were just as good 
using a simple neural net, it 

04:54:04.600 --> 04:54:06.600
was so simple, the neural net 
was so simple that it was the 

04:54:09.726 --> 04:54:12.367
kind of neural net where you 
could count the neurons was how 

04:54:12.368 --> 04:54:14.368
simple it was.

04:54:15.633 --> 04:54:17.457
One, he was stunned, and 
incredibly happy because it 

04:54:17.458 --> 04:54:19.703
meant that he wouldn't have to 
wait a whole week and using a 

04:54:21.732 --> 04:54:24.371
ton of computer power to do the 
same kind of simulations he was 

04:54:24.372 --> 04:54:27.053
doing.
  Then, so that in itself was a 

04:54:27.054 --> 04:54:29.088
win, then the deeper question, 
and one of the 

04:54:34.636 --> 04:54:36.636
things that gives me a lot of 
excitement 

04:54:38.497 --> 04:54:39.926
is what exactly was this neural 
net figuring out about the 

04:54:39.927 --> 04:54:41.927
physics of the 

04:54:43.817 --> 04:54:45.817
earth that we haven't figured 
out yet.

04:54:48.294 --> 04:54:50.294
Again, if we can interpret what 
this 

04:54:51.355 --> 04:54:53.802
is doing, what this neural net 
is doing, if we learn from it, 

04:54:53.803 --> 04:54:58.716
could we become better 
scientists ourselves?  You're 

04:54:58.717 --> 04:55:00.741
starting to see this in science,
starting to see this in 

04:55:03.597 --> 04:55:05.597
medicine, so for instance, the 
brain 

04:55:07.222 --> 04:55:09.222
work with diabetic

04:55:10.736 --> 04:55:12.736
retinopathy where the image is 
looking 

04:55:15.183 --> 04:55:17.183
at the back of the eyes, the 
fundus and 

04:55:19.417 --> 04:55:21.417
they're not only able to 
understand 

04:55:22.834 --> 04:55:24.834
whether or not you have the 
diabetic 

04:55:25.920 --> 04:55:27.920
retinopathy, but they're also 
able to do 

04:55:29.371 --> 04:55:31.371
things like understand the 
gender of the 

04:55:33.843 --> 04:55:35.843
patient and the cardiovascular 
risk, the 

04:55:39.130 --> 04:55:41.158
cardiovascular disease risk, 
things that doctors themselves 

04:55:41.159 --> 04:55:43.159
couldn't necessarily see in 
these images.

04:55:45.417 --> 04:55:47.417
Part of the race now is to 
understand 

04:55:49.506 --> 04:55:51.506
what are the systems learning 
that we couldn't learn.

04:55:53.197 --> 04:55:54.825
Could we be better doctors, 
scientists, right, by using this

04:55:54.826 --> 04:55:56.826
kind of -- can we learn back?

04:56:01.194 --> 04:56:03.194
Can we listen back from these 
machines.

04:56:05.475 --> 04:56:08.530
  We have a few more minutes to 
go.  I have a few more 

04:56:08.531 --> 04:56:10.776
questions.
  What are you seeing of the 

04:56:10.777 --> 04:56:12.777
ability of 

04:56:13.822 --> 04:56:15.822
AI to really help businesses?

04:56:16.883 --> 04:56:19.715
I'm curious on what have been 
the most successful cases, but 

04:56:19.716 --> 04:56:21.794
also some of the most 
surprising, you're like I didn't

04:56:23.616 --> 04:56:25.446
know we could do AI for this?
  &gt;&gt; RAJEN SHETH: There are a 

04:56:25.447 --> 04:56:27.447
bunch of things we have seen.

04:56:30.147 --> 04:56:32.183
There are definitely certain 
industries further  ahead, tech 

04:56:34.011 --> 04:56:35.466
industry, there is a lot being 
used, financial services, there 

04:56:35.467 --> 04:56:39.334
is a lot being used.  There are 
many emerging use cases which I 

04:56:39.335 --> 04:56:41.578
think are pretty amazing.  Some 
of the examples we have seen, 

04:56:43.605 --> 04:56:46.466
like on the manufacturing line, 
can you use vision to figure out

04:56:46.467 --> 04:56:49.752
if a part is okay or not?  If a 
tire coming down the factory 

04:56:49.753 --> 04:56:54.867
line is going to be a good tire 
or it might actually bare risk 

04:56:54.868 --> 04:56:56.868
to the person, those 

04:56:58.109 --> 04:57:00.109
kinds of things, things that 
we're seeing.

04:57:01.770 --> 04:57:04.641
Retail, another case, how do you
make it so that you make the use

04:57:04.642 --> 04:57:06.914
of the ex persons together t an 
example, we use 

04:57:10.788 --> 04:57:13.026
auto ML with Disney, my son is a
massive lightning Mcqueen fan 

04:57:13.027 --> 04:57:15.473
from  Cars.  I'm sure many of 
you have kids or 

04:57:19.963 --> 04:57:21.963
family members that are big 
Disney fans.

04:57:24.231 --> 04:57:25.852
He has an appetite for Disney 
stuff and the stuff with 

04:57:25.853 --> 04:57:27.896
lightning Mcqueen, with the 
technology we have developed, 

04:57:30.774 --> 04:57:33.000
you can search on Disney's -- on
shop Disney for everything with 

04:57:33.001 --> 04:57:35.001
lightning 

04:57:36.480 --> 04:57:37.901
Mcqueen on it, whether or not it
says it in the description or 

04:57:37.902 --> 04:57:39.902
not, they can do it by visual 
inspection.

04:57:41.766 --> 04:57:43.395
Those are things that are 
interesting use cases.  We're 

04:57:43.396 --> 04:57:46.443
starting to see that.
  A thing that I think is 

04:57:46.444 --> 04:57:50.500
important though, we need to get
businesses to a point where 

04:57:50.501 --> 04:57:53.370
they're not thinking about hey, 
I'm using AI to do this, but 

04:57:53.371 --> 04:57:58.261
where the users are  feeling 
magic and it doesn't matter if 

04:57:58.262 --> 04:58:00.262
it is AI behind the 

04:58:02.541 --> 04:58:04.775
covers or not and that's why the
things we have done with Google 

04:58:04.776 --> 04:58:08.423
photos, it is incredible, it is 
not about AI but the user 

04:58:08.424 --> 04:58:10.508
experience.
  &gt;&gt; FERNANDA VIEGAS: Awesome.

04:58:11.522 --> 04:58:15.192
  We talk about the challenges, 
some of the strategies.

04:58:18.445 --> 04:58:20.470
I want to end on the 
opportunities.  We talked about 

04:58:20.471 --> 04:58:22.713
some opportunities also.  I want
to end on that note, on the 

04:58:22.714 --> 04:58:24.714
opportunities.

04:58:28.205 --> 04:58:30.205
In the last year we have seen AI
being 

04:58:31.463 --> 04:58:35.115
applied to various domains in 
really interesting ways.  You 

04:58:35.116 --> 04:58:37.164
have medicine, science, you have
farming, right, we talked about 

04:58:37.165 --> 04:58:39.165
some of those examples.

04:58:42.258 --> 04:58:44.512
I would love to hear from each 
one of you what opportunities 

04:58:44.513 --> 04:58:46.513
are you excited 

04:58:47.784 --> 04:58:49.219
about for the next however many 
years.

04:58:49.220 --> 04:58:51.220
You want to start?
  &gt;&gt; JON PLATT: Okay.

04:58:53.483 --> 04:58:54.502
You mentioned biomedical 
research, I can't talk about 

04:58:54.503 --> 04:58:58.973
that!  Let me talk about another
project I find really exciting 

04:58:58.974 --> 04:59:01.005
which I mentioned before, which 
is we're actually working 

04:59:05.473 --> 04:59:07.321
to see if we can get a fusion 
energy to be a real commercial 

04:59:07.322 --> 04:59:09.322
source of energy in 

04:59:12.362 --> 04:59:14.362
order to displaces to fossil 
fuels and right now we're 

04:59:20.166 --> 04:59:22.166
flooding the atmosphere with 
carbon 

04:59:23.248 --> 04:59:25.937
deoxide and we're using machine 
learning and we're trying to 

04:59:25.938 --> 04:59:27.938
optimize 

04:59:29.185 --> 04:59:31.230
the experiments, helping them 
design the experiments and using

04:59:31.231 --> 04:59:35.730
methods to actually help them 
debug the plasma inside of the 

04:59:35.731 --> 04:59:37.731
machine so the goal, it is 

04:59:38.802 --> 04:59:41.056
going to be trying to make this 
plasma about as hot as the 

04:59:41.057 --> 04:59:43.057
center of the sun 

04:59:44.107 --> 04:59:45.552
and if we can do that, we can 
measure its heat loss rate and 

04:59:45.553 --> 04:59:51.054
see if we can actually get to 
commercially relevant fusion 

04:59:51.055 --> 04:59:52.473
which would revolutionize the 
world.

04:59:52.474 --> 04:59:54.929
&gt;&gt; FERNANDA VIEGAS: When can we 
expect that?

04:59:55.778 --> 04:59:57.778
&gt;&gt; JON PLATT: Well, I don't want
to promise anything.

04:59:59.250 --> 05:00:01.909
We'll have good scientific 
results I think in 2019.  We 

05:00:01.910 --> 05:00:03.329
won't have what they call break 
even fusion then, but we'll have

05:00:03.330 --> 05:00:05.981
very solid results predicting 
the heat loss rate.

05:00:09.227 --> 05:00:11.227
We'll know a lot more in about a
year.

05:00:11.871 --> 05:00:15.756
&gt;&gt; FERNANDA VIEGAS: Awesome.  
  &gt;&gt; DAPHNE LUONG: I'm excited 

05:00:15.757 --> 05:00:17.757
about two things.

05:00:19.229 --> 05:00:21.229
The first, really we'll continue
to 

05:00:23.718 --> 05:00:25.718
work with the crowdsource 
contributors 

05:00:27.199 --> 05:00:29.226
that built globally diverse 
dataset that not a single 

05:00:29.227 --> 05:00:31.874
company could build by itself 
but actually leveraging everyone

05:00:34.959 --> 05:00:37.015
who is passionate about 
representing their part of the 

05:00:37.016 --> 05:00:41.702
world to create dataset to Open 
Source to use by everyone and 

05:00:41.703 --> 05:00:43.703
then similarly for machine 
learning, since I do a lot of 

05:00:46.994 --> 05:00:48.620
volunteering outside of work, we
have social entrepreneurs around

05:00:48.621 --> 05:00:50.621
the world, I 

05:00:53.939 --> 05:00:55.939
really want to see that ML 
available for 

05:00:56.992 --> 05:00:58.992
non-profits, you know, to do 
sort of air 

05:01:03.927 --> 05:01:06.791
quality models, maybe using 
translate to make books 

05:01:06.792 --> 05:01:08.792
available for thousands of 

05:01:10.331 --> 05:01:11.139
different languages and for 
mother tongues, it I'm excited 

05:01:11.140 --> 05:01:13.140
about that, looking forward to 
that.

05:01:13.777 --> 05:01:15.395
&gt;&gt; RAJEN SHETH: Two things I'm 
passionate about, one healthcare

05:01:15.396 --> 05:01:19.076
and the other is education.  
Healthcare, just this idea like 

05:01:19.077 --> 05:01:21.077
you 

05:01:22.546 --> 05:01:24.371
talked about, being able to use 
AI to do easterly disease 

05:01:24.372 --> 05:01:25.593
detection, you have an 
incredible somebody impact on 

05:01:25.594 --> 05:01:27.594
one human 

05:01:30.475 --> 05:01:31.288
being and on many human beginses
and on families around them, 

05:01:31.289 --> 05:01:34.344
things like that.
  That's a I amazing.  

05:01:34.345 --> 05:01:36.625
Education, I spend a lot of my 
time working on the education 

05:01:36.626 --> 05:01:38.626
products.

05:01:39.883 --> 05:01:41.930
The idea of  imagining an 
environment where every student 

05:01:41.931 --> 05:01:46.402
can learn in the way that they 
want to learn at their own pace 

05:01:46.403 --> 05:01:49.242
in their own style and having AI
help power that can be 

05:01:49.243 --> 05:01:54.120
transformative.  You can pull 
the potential and actually make 

05:01:54.121 --> 05:01:56.121
-- harness the potential of 
every single individual that was

05:01:57.983 --> 05:02:00.829
never possible before.
  &gt;&gt; FERNANDA VIEGAS: I'm going 

05:02:00.830 --> 05:02:02.830
to segue 

05:02:03.917 --> 05:02:05.917
from that and say again, one of 
the 

05:02:07.414 --> 05:02:09.442
things that's been really 
inspiring to see with things 

05:02:09.443 --> 05:02:11.443
like tenser flow.

05:02:13.724 --> 05:02:16.354
js, it is that we have now 
professors at a number of 

05:02:16.355 --> 05:02:18.355
universities who were 

05:02:20.016 --> 05:02:22.864
building educational materials 
around this and I feel that's 

05:02:22.865 --> 05:02:25.309
really important and I'm really 
excited about this.

05:02:28.368 --> 05:02:30.368
It not only lowers the barrier 
for 

05:02:32.044 --> 05:02:34.044
entry in this technology, but it
also I 

05:02:36.728 --> 05:02:39.611
think starts to hit a much more 
diverse set of developers who 

05:02:39.612 --> 05:02:41.612
are interested in 

05:02:43.478 --> 05:02:45.478
using this technology for 
different 

05:02:46.720 --> 05:02:48.720
things that we haven't even 
dreamt of yet.

05:02:48.965 --> 05:02:50.965
I'm very excited about that.

05:02:52.445 --> 05:02:54.445
The other thing that I think is 
really 

05:02:55.692 --> 05:02:57.692
good to see is how the 
conversation 

05:02:59.973 --> 05:03:02.634
around machine learning has been
-- has started to touch on 

05:03:02.635 --> 05:03:04.635
things like ethics 

05:03:05.713 --> 05:03:08.775
and fairness.  I think that's 
really important.   I'm really 

05:03:08.776 --> 05:03:10.776
happy it that here at 

05:03:15.089 --> 05:03:16.932
Google we think very deeply 
about these questions, and both 

05:03:16.933 --> 05:03:20.585
from a research perspective, 
what are research things we can 

05:03:20.586 --> 05:03:22.586
do to help address some of these

05:03:24.653 --> 05:03:27.305
problems, but also, you know, 
policy, product wise, design 

05:03:27.306 --> 05:03:29.536
wise, what are -- it is a 
broader conversation.

05:03:34.466 --> 05:03:36.466
With that, I'm going to thank 
our panel.  Thank you so much.

05:03:38.918 --> 05:03:42.196
It has been inspiring to hear 
your insights and have you share

05:03:42.197 --> 05:03:44.641
your experience as you have said
from many different parts of 

05:03:47.084 --> 05:03:48.113
Google on this topic today with 
us.

05:03:48.114 --> 05:03:52.139
Thank you.  Thank you.  

06:21:57.937 --> 06:22:00.637
How to Build a User Base for 
your Actions.

06:22:00.638 --> 06:22:04.508
Stage 8.
 2:30 p.m.

06:24:04.340 --> 06:24:06.340
[ Applause ]

06:24:08.414 --> 06:24:10.414
&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone!  Thank you 
all for coming.

06:24:12.707 --> 06:24:14.707
It is so exciting to see you 
here.

06:24:16.230 --> 06:24:18.230
My name is Tanya Gupta, and I am
a 

06:24:19.291 --> 06:24:21.528
Product Manager on the Google 
Assistant, focusing on natural 

06:24:21.529 --> 06:24:25.039
language understanding and 
discovery of  third-party 

06:24:25.040 --> 06:24:26.676
actions.
&gt;&gt; DINA ELHADDAD:  And this is 

06:24:26.677 --> 06:24:28.677
Dina Elhaddad.

06:24:30.344 --> 06:24:32.379
I'm also a Product Manager on 
the Assistant team and I lead 

06:24:32.380 --> 06:24:35.428
the discovery and engagement.
&gt;&gt; TANYA GUPTA:  We're here 

06:24:35.429 --> 06:24:39.102
today to talk to you about how 
to make your action more 

06:24:39.103 --> 06:24:41.103
discoverable, and build a 

06:24:44.356 --> 06:24:46.356
strong and consistent user base

06:24:47.668 --> 06:24:48.993
.
&gt;&gt; DINA ELHADDAD:  These 

06:24:48.994 --> 06:24:52.866
shouldn't be a surprise to you 
at this point.  The Assistant is

06:24:52.867 --> 06:24:54.867
a large and ever growing 
ecosystem.

06:24:56.531 --> 06:24:58.531
We have over 1 million actions 
across 

06:25:01.790 --> 06:25:04.931
more than 500 million devices in
more than 25locales.  Now the 

06:25:04.932 --> 06:25:06.932
question is:  How can you stand 
out?

06:25:08.992 --> 06:25:11.033
How can you get a share of that 
user base?

06:25:12.247 --> 06:25:13.881
&gt;&gt; TANYA GUPTA:  Many of you may
recognize this and see the 

06:25:13.882 --> 06:25:15.882
similarity to 

06:25:17.347 --> 06:25:19.823
a marketing funnel, and a lot of
building a user base is creating

06:25:19.824 --> 06:25:24.989
a brand that users recognize 
immediately.  We've broken this 

06:25:24.990 --> 06:25:30.055
funnel into three stages:  The 
first and biggest stage is all 

06:25:30.056 --> 06:25:31.910
about creating awareness for 
your action, so that users know 

06:25:31.911 --> 06:25:33.911
that it 

06:25:34.975 --> 06:25:36.975
exists, and what they can use it
for.

06:25:39.883 --> 06:25:42.353
Once they know about your 
action, the second stage is all 

06:25:42.354 --> 06:25:45.230
about creating an engaging 
experience so that users are 

06:25:46.245 --> 06:25:49.156
immediately hacked.
And the last stage is about 

06:25:49.157 --> 06:25:51.157
retaining 

06:25:52.439 --> 06:25:54.263
users so they come back day 
after day, week after week, year

06:25:54.264 --> 06:25:58.786
after year.  For all three of 
these stages we'll talk about 

06:25:58.787 --> 06:26:00.421
different techniques and 
different tools you can use to 

06:26:00.422 --> 06:26:03.706
improve your action.

06:26:07.063 --> 06:26:08.920
Let's jump right in and talk 
about some of the ways you can 

06:26:08.921 --> 06:26:10.976
build awareness around your 
action and make it more 

06:26:12.625 --> 06:26:14.624
discoverable to users.
&gt;&gt; DINA ELHADDAD:  There are 

06:26:14.625 --> 06:26:16.625
various 

06:26:18.579 --> 06:26:20.454
discovery opportunities in 
Google Assistant, starting from 

06:26:20.455 --> 06:26:25.209
the Assistant directly to in 
conversation suggestions to in 

06:26:25.210 --> 06:26:27.210
app discovery to built-in 
intents.

06:26:28.897 --> 06:26:31.169
You can even ask Google 
Assistant what can you do?  And 

06:26:31.170 --> 06:26:33.226
it whether even respond back 
with relevant actions to 

06:26:33.227 --> 06:26:37.503
treatment now let's jump and 
focus on the Assistant directly,

06:26:37.504 --> 06:26:39.504
also known as  Explore.

06:26:40.581 --> 06:26:42.581
Explore is a one stop shop for 
all Assistant actions.

06:26:46.922 --> 06:26:48.922
It's available on web at  
Assistant.google.

06:26:50.888 --> 06:26:54.130
com/explore and in the Assistant
app on both Android and iOS.  

06:26:54.131 --> 06:26:56.131
The directory is interesting, 
because 

06:26:57.825 --> 06:26:59.871
we see that more than 30% of our
third-party actions being 

06:26:59.872 --> 06:27:01.872
discovered and used directly 
from there.

06:27:03.778 --> 06:27:06.050
So now let's walk through the 
different user flowing that are 

06:27:06.051 --> 06:27:09.816
supported in Explore, and how 
you can optimize each of them.

06:27:13.719 --> 06:27:16.382
One of the primary use cases for
Explore is browsing.

06:27:21.378 --> 06:27:22.391
When we designed the landing 
page for Explore, we made sure 

06:27:22.392 --> 06:27:24.883
that the most relevant and 
personal recommendations are 

06:27:24.884 --> 06:27:26.928
shown at the top of the page 
with less relevant held shuns 

06:27:26.929 --> 06:27:30.384
shown as you scroll down.
At the high level, there are 

06:27:30.385 --> 06:27:32.385
three key 

06:27:35.105 --> 06:27:37.375
areas to highlight on the 
landing page.  First, we have 

06:27:37.376 --> 06:27:39.858
contextual suggestions.  These 
are relevant recommendations 

06:27:42.908 --> 06:27:44.908
based on the users context such 
as time and location.

06:27:45.985 --> 06:27:47.985
For example, I can see here that
for my 

06:27:49.220 --> 06:27:51.679
morning, I can play my favorite 
playlist or listen to my daily 

06:27:51.680 --> 06:27:57.409
brief.
Next comes dynamic categories.  

06:27:57.410 --> 06:27:59.855
To date, we have 4 of these:  
What's new, which highlights new

06:27:59.856 --> 06:28:01.856
high-quality actions.

06:28:04.108 --> 06:28:08.175
What's popular, which highlights
overall popular actions.  What's

06:28:08.176 --> 06:28:11.027
trending, which highlights newly
popular actions.  And you might 

06:28:11.028 --> 06:28:13.113
like, which recommends action 
that the user may like based on 

06:28:15.366 --> 06:28:17.366
their history with Assistant.

06:28:19.035 --> 06:28:21.681
We have also just launched 
editorial pics.  This is a new 

06:28:21.682 --> 06:28:23.682
feature highlighting high 
quality and seasonal actions 

06:28:25.343 --> 06:28:27.343
through visual campaigns.

06:28:28.616 --> 06:28:30.505
An interesting fact about the 
landing page is that we see that

06:28:30.506 --> 06:28:35.183
actions that get promoted on 
that page specifically in 

06:28:35.184 --> 06:28:37.460
dynamic categories are 10 times 
more likely to be used on that 

06:28:37.461 --> 06:28:40.714
day.
If you ask me, how can I ensure 

06:28:40.715 --> 06:28:45.191
that my action gets featured in 
the landing page?  I would say 

06:28:45.192 --> 06:28:47.836
that the main ingredient here is
quality, and quality can mean a 

06:28:48.891 --> 06:28:50.891
variety of things.

06:28:52.387 --> 06:28:54.387
It means solid ratings, positive

06:28:55.651 --> 06:28:57.651
reviews, steady health signals, 
among other things.

06:28:58.916 --> 06:29:00.916
The second use case that Explore

06:29:02.198 --> 06:29:04.653
supports is categorical browsing
and search.  Here, we're trying 

06:29:04.654 --> 06:29:06.654
to expose the user to the 
variety of actions available 

06:29:09.368 --> 06:29:11.368
within a category of interest, 
whiles 

06:29:13.260 --> 06:29:15.498
allowing the user to easily find
their favorite actions through a

06:29:15.499 --> 06:29:18.765
quick search.  Let's say, for 
example, I'm interested in food 

06:29:18.766 --> 06:29:21.440
and drink.  By going to that 
category, I can see 

06:29:24.755 --> 06:29:27.388
all the relevant actions grouped
by helpful  subcategories.

06:29:30.914 --> 06:29:32.914
For example, I can see here that
I can 

06:29:38.420 --> 06:29:42.486
order food from Dunkin' Donuts 
and domino's pizza, whereas I 

06:29:38.420 --> 06:29:40.420
can find recipes from Food 
Network.

06:29:42.401 --> 06:29:43.408
As for search and autocomplete, 
the idea is to expose the user 

06:29:43.409 --> 06:29:45.409
to the variety of capabilities 
supported by an 

06:29:48.430 --> 06:29:50.671
action of interest, whiles also 
providing predictive suggestions

06:29:50.672 --> 06:29:53.722
to the user based on the key 
term.  If you want to make sure 

06:29:53.723 --> 06:29:55.723
your action 

06:29:57.839 --> 06:29:59.461
is showing in the right category
and is being searched for the 

06:29:59.462 --> 06:30:01.462
right key terms 

06:30:02.517 --> 06:30:04.951
you want to ensure your display 
same, your description and 

06:30:04.952 --> 06:30:06.986
sample invocations are 
reflective of your action and 

06:30:09.659 --> 06:30:11.284
actually includes useful 
keywords.  Finally and most 

06:30:11.285 --> 06:30:13.285
importantly, let's 

06:30:14.553 --> 06:30:17.452
move to the action page.  The 
Action Page is a welcome action.

06:30:19.076 --> 06:30:21.076
It should reflect your brand and

06:30:23.968 --> 06:30:25.968
invite the user to try your 
action out.

06:30:27.223 --> 06:30:30.666
At a glance the Action Page 
consists of two main sections.  

06:30:30.667 --> 06:30:32.753
The top section provides the 
user with a quick summary of 

06:30:32.754 --> 06:30:38.403
what your action does, through 
your imagery description and 

06:30:38.404 --> 06:30:40.049
sample invocation the user 
should get an idea about your 

06:30:40.050 --> 06:30:44.122
action before trying it out.  
The second section covers more 

06:30:44.123 --> 06:30:46.123
details.

06:30:47.629 --> 06:30:50.286
The user can see your ratings 
and our newly launched reviews. 

06:30:50.287 --> 06:30:52.750
This allows the user to assess 
the quality of your action 

06:30:52.751 --> 06:30:54.751
before giving it a try.

06:30:57.435 --> 06:31:00.071
Now that we've walked through 
the main user flows, how can you

06:31:00.072 --> 06:31:04.370
optimize your page and really 
shine in the directory?  Let's 

06:31:04.371 --> 06:31:06.371
go through an example.

06:31:11.501 --> 06:31:13.325
I'm a French bulldog over and I 
wanted to post an action about 

06:31:13.326 --> 06:31:15.987
French bulldogs.  On the left, I
chose a short and 

06:31:19.654 --> 06:31:21.654
concise name, French bulldog 
trivia.

06:31:22.821 --> 06:31:25.666
It explains exactly what my 
action does and it fits nicely 

06:31:25.667 --> 06:31:27.667
on the screen.

06:31:30.385 --> 06:31:32.385
The right I picked a long 
display name 

06:31:33.838 --> 06:31:35.463
that got caught up and I used 
redundant keywords such as "the 

06:31:35.464 --> 06:31:37.464
best."

06:31:39.371 --> 06:31:40.590
On the left for my imagery I 
created graphics based on my 

06:31:40.591 --> 06:31:43.868
dogs.  They're  iconic and they 
look great on a large screen.

06:31:46.895 --> 06:31:50.358
On the right, I used the 
distorted picture of my dogs.  

06:31:50.359 --> 06:31:52.177
Though undeniably cute, it 
doesn't look great on a large 

06:31:52.178 --> 06:31:56.884
screen, and it doesn't reflect 
well on my brand.

06:31:59.935 --> 06:32:02.807
For my description, on the left,
I wrote a short and glancable 

06:32:02.808 --> 06:32:04.808
description, but I made sure 
that all the important 

06:32:07.714 --> 06:32:09.714
keywords to me are there, 
keywords such 

06:32:11.156 --> 06:32:13.411
as:  Frenchies, French bulldog 
lovers, dog lovers, dogs, and 

06:32:13.412 --> 06:32:15.412
facts.

06:32:17.495 --> 06:32:19.495
This is great, as it will 
potentially 

06:32:21.372 --> 06:32:24.233
allow my action to be searched 
for these key terms.  On the 

06:32:24.234 --> 06:32:26.234
right I have a long 

06:32:27.291 --> 06:32:30.350
description, and I didn't use 
any useful keywords.  Finally 

06:32:30.351 --> 06:32:32.598
for my sample invocations, on 
the left, I maximized the number

06:32:32.599 --> 06:32:36.665
of sample invocations on the 
screen.  I also made sure that 

06:32:36.666 --> 06:32:38.666
they were 

06:32:39.729 --> 06:32:42.608
descriptive, instead of just 
limiting  myself to talk to 

06:32:42.609 --> 06:32:45.254
French bulldog trivia, I used 
more descriptive sample 

06:32:49.955 --> 06:32:52.804
invocations such as ask French 
bulldog about grooming.  If you 

06:32:52.805 --> 06:32:55.046
want your Action Page to really 
shine in the directory, you want

06:32:55.047 --> 06:32:58.292
to do these four things --
You want to have a short and 

06:32:58.293 --> 06:33:00.293
unique display name.

06:33:02.176 --> 06:33:04.176
You want to have a descriptive 
yet glancable description.

06:33:05.881 --> 06:33:08.132
You want to have 5 sample 
invocations that are 

06:33:08.133 --> 06:33:10.174
descriptive, and you want to use
high-quality graphics.

06:33:13.048 --> 06:33:15.287
As mentioned, you're encouraged 
to use relevant keywords to your

06:33:15.288 --> 06:33:18.947
action, but don't overdo it and 
definitely don't include 

06:33:18.948 --> 06:33:22.199
keywords that are not relevant 
to your action.  Otherwise, you 

06:33:22.200 --> 06:33:24.200
may be penalized.

06:33:26.500 --> 06:33:28.323
Now, let's switch gears a bit 
and talk about in conversation 

06:33:28.324 --> 06:33:31.000
discovery through built-in 
intents.

06:33:31.408 --> 06:33:33.442
&gt;&gt; TANYA GUPTA:  Another 
important aspect to building 

06:33:33.443 --> 06:33:37.761
awareness is to Surface your 
action when it's most relevant 

06:33:37.762 --> 06:33:41.840
to the user.  One such 
opportunity is when the user is 

06:33:41.841 --> 06:33:43.841
interacting directly with the 
Assistant.

06:33:45.913 --> 06:33:49.226
But natural language 
understanding is hard.  In 

06:33:49.227 --> 06:33:51.867
addition to the multitudes of 
languages, there's dialects, 

06:33:51.868 --> 06:33:57.026
there's slang, and there's 
cultural variations that 

06:33:57.027 --> 06:33:59.473
increase the number of ways that
a user can express the same 

06:33:59.474 --> 06:34:02.930
thing.
So let's take an example of some

06:34:02.931 --> 06:34:07.196
of the ways that a user can 
express that they're stressed 

06:34:07.197 --> 06:34:11.539
out and they want to calm down.
These examples here are just 

06:34:11.540 --> 06:34:17.254
some of the ways users would say
it in American English.  It 

06:34:17.255 --> 06:34:19.102
doesn't include other variations
of English, such as British 

06:34:19.103 --> 06:34:22.572
English or Indian English.  Then
when you start thinking about 

06:34:24.842 --> 06:34:26.881
other  languages, you could 
imagine just how long this list 

06:34:26.882 --> 06:34:29.394
would be.
Well, I work with a team of 

06:34:29.395 --> 06:34:31.395
expert 

06:34:33.680 --> 06:34:35.902
linguists to define intents that
capture all of these natural 

06:34:35.903 --> 06:34:37.903
language variations into one 
definition.

06:34:40.822 --> 06:34:42.822
As Brad mentioned in the 
developers 

06:34:44.068 --> 06:34:46.522
keynote, these built in intents 
are a common taxonomy to 

06:34:46.523 --> 06:34:48.523
describe actions across Google 
Surfaces^.

06:34:50.903 --> 06:34:52.903
As a developer, you can 
integrate your 

06:34:54.393 --> 06:34:56.393
action with a relevant built-in 
intents 

06:34:57.726 --> 06:34:59.961
and this allows Google to handle
the natural language 

06:34:59.962 --> 06:35:03.840
understanding and the semantic 
parsing for you.  Google will 

06:35:03.841 --> 06:35:05.841
extract the relevant parts of 
the queries and pass it to your 

06:35:07.779 --> 06:35:10.251
action in a structured format.
So let's take a few of these 

06:35:10.252 --> 06:35:12.252
queries, 

06:35:13.537 --> 06:35:15.537
and see what they look like as a
built-in intent.

06:35:16.795 --> 06:35:18.795
On the right here, you can see 
that 

06:35:20.888 --> 06:35:22.301
we've defined the intent and 
called it start calming 

06:35:22.302 --> 06:35:24.302
activities.  We've also 
identified three arguments.

06:35:27.832 --> 06:35:30.090
The first is activity the user 
wants to partake  in.  Second is

06:35:30.091 --> 06:35:32.091
how long they want to 

06:35:33.186 --> 06:35:35.226
partake in that activity and 
third is a reason why they're 

06:35:35.227 --> 06:35:37.466
stressed out.
On the left you can see how 

06:35:37.467 --> 06:35:39.467
we've mapped 

06:35:40.929 --> 06:35:42.945
the queries to the built-in 
intent so in that second 

06:35:42.946 --> 06:35:45.189
example, we've extracted 
breathing exercises and mapped 

06:35:45.190 --> 06:35:47.190
it to the 

06:35:48.240 --> 06:35:50.240
calming activity, and we've 
extracted 

06:35:51.338 --> 06:35:53.411
the my interview, and that 
became the stressor.

06:35:55.860 --> 06:35:57.505
Built-in intents make it so that
developers don't need to worry 

06:35:57.506 --> 06:36:00.994
about the natural language 
variations.  You just need to 

06:36:00.995 --> 06:36:03.221
make sure that you can fulfill 
all of the arguments 

06:36:06.725 --> 06:36:08.725
specified by the built-in 
intent.

06:36:09.975 --> 06:36:12.262
Another benefit to built-in 
intents is that it gives Google 

06:36:12.263 --> 06:36:14.913
information about the type of 
queries that your action can 

06:36:17.977 --> 06:36:19.977
handle, and how good it is in 
responding to those queries.

06:36:22.868 --> 06:36:25.116
Google can then use that info to
apply AI, and Surface your 

06:36:25.117 --> 06:36:27.117
action when it's most relevant 
to the user.

06:36:30.417 --> 06:36:33.062
On the screen here, you see some
explorations on how built-in 

06:36:33.063 --> 06:36:35.063
intents can 

06:36:36.307 --> 06:36:39.164
be used to makings more 
discoverable.  So, for example, 

06:36:39.165 --> 06:36:41.165
on the left there, 

06:36:43.247 --> 06:36:45.935
the user has asked to check 
their Leo horoscope and is 

06:36:45.936 --> 06:36:50.008
presented with four high quality
actions that Google is confident

06:36:50.009 --> 06:36:53.050
can fulfill that request.
Built-in intents are not just 

06:36:53.051 --> 06:36:56.822
limited to the Assistant.  In 
previous sessions, you may have 

06:36:58.852 --> 06:37:01.088
heard about app actions and how 
it is also built on built-in 

06:37:01.089 --> 06:37:05.970
intents.  What that means is 
that when you integrate your 

06:37:05.971 --> 06:37:07.971
action with a built-in 

06:37:09.658 --> 06:37:14.990
intent, not only are you 
creating opportunities discovery

06:37:14.991 --> 06:37:16.991
across the Assistant but across 
a variety of Surfaces such as 

06:37:18.840 --> 06:37:21.084
Google Play and Google search 
search.  So now I know all of 

06:37:21.085 --> 06:37:24.791
you are itching to find out how 
to integrate with a built-in 

06:37:24.792 --> 06:37:26.792
intent, so let's do a quick 
demo.

06:37:29.975 --> 06:37:32.048
Can we switch to the laptop, 
please?

06:37:34.714 --> 06:37:36.714
So here you can see that we've 
signed 

06:37:38.174 --> 06:37:40.174
into dialogue flow, and I've 
already 

06:37:41.228 --> 06:37:43.228
selected my action here called 
breathing Buddha.

06:37:44.947 --> 06:37:46.942
I have a series of intents I've 
defined and to integrate with a 

06:37:46.943 --> 06:37:51.128
built-in intent I can create a 
new intent.  Let's call this 

06:37:51.129 --> 06:37:53.129
intent "demo."

06:37:55.071 --> 06:37:57.503
Inside of the events section, I 
can see all of the built-in 

06:37:57.504 --> 06:37:59.756
intents that are available for 
me to integrate with.

06:38:03.650 --> 06:38:05.880
Given that my action is about 
meditating and breathing 

06:38:05.881 --> 06:38:09.549
exercises, I think start calming
activity probably makes the most

06:38:09.550 --> 06:38:11.550
sense.

06:38:12.599 --> 06:38:15.036
So here, I can see a few example
queries that would map to this 

06:38:15.037 --> 06:38:17.037
built-in 

06:38:18.540 --> 06:38:20.540
intent, as well as all of the 
arguments.

06:38:21.618 --> 06:38:24.047
Now, the proper way to fulfill 
this intent would be to create a

06:38:24.048 --> 06:38:29.814
Webhook where I could parse the 
argument values and respond to 

06:38:29.815 --> 06:38:31.867
the user accordingly, but for 
the sake of time, I'm just going

06:38:31.868 --> 06:38:34.387
to create a simple response 
here.

06:38:39.426 --> 06:38:42.791
I can save my intent, and try it
out in the simulator.

06:38:53.436 --> 06:38:55.487
Now, as usual, I could choose to
speak directly to my action, but

06:38:55.488 --> 06:38:58.140
let's try one of the queries 
that I know maps to this 

06:38:59.562 --> 06:39:01.562
built-in  intent.

06:39:12.200 --> 06:39:14.076
All right, as you can see here, 
I'm presented with a list of 

06:39:14.077 --> 06:39:16.077
four actions 

06:39:17.336 --> 06:39:19.605
that I can use to meditate for 
one hour.  Let's switch over to 

06:39:19.606 --> 06:39:23.278
the phone, and try it on on the 
real Assistant.

06:39:28.427 --> 06:39:32.906
I want to meditate for one hour.
&gt;&gt; Assistant:  All right, which 

06:39:32.907 --> 06:39:36.980
one would you like to try?
&gt;&gt; TANYA GUPTA:  Again you can 

06:39:36.981 --> 06:39:38.397
see the same actions, with my 
action being the first one 

06:39:38.398 --> 06:39:40.398
there.

06:39:42.096 --> 06:39:44.096
Let's switch back to the slides,
please.

06:39:46.585 --> 06:39:48.830
We are excited to announce 
built-in 

06:39:51.941 --> 06:39:53.358
intents as part of Google I/O, 
these are just some of the 

06:39:53.359 --> 06:39:55.359
intents that we're 

06:39:56.447 --> 06:39:58.496
working on this year, and the 
ones with the stars next to them

06:39:58.497 --> 06:40:00.739
are already available as a 
developer's preview.

06:40:04.206 --> 06:40:06.837
So I encourage all of you to 
sign into dialogue flow, try 

06:40:06.838 --> 06:40:10.774
them out, familiarize yourselves
with them, and see how they can 

06:40:10.775 --> 06:40:14.898
fit into your action.
So with that, we've talked about

06:40:14.899 --> 06:40:18.394
two different ways that you can 
build  awareness for your 

06:40:18.395 --> 06:40:24.335
action.  First, by optimizing 
the Assistant Directory page.  

06:40:24.336 --> 06:40:26.336
And, second, by integrating with
built-in intents.

06:40:28.442 --> 06:40:30.481
Now that your action is 
discoverable, let's jump to the 

06:40:30.482 --> 06:40:33.116
next stage, which focuses on 
creating an engaging 

06:40:36.812 --> 06:40:39.461
experience so that users are 
immediately hooked.

06:40:40.279 --> 06:40:42.113
&gt;&gt; DINA ELHADDAD:  In the 
Assistant team, we assess our 

06:40:42.114 --> 06:40:44.114
product through the 

06:40:45.580 --> 06:40:47.580
lens of critical user journeys.

06:40:49.276 --> 06:40:51.927
We built Google Assistant to 
help our users throughout their 

06:40:51.928 --> 06:40:56.398
day and based on research and 
from analyzing usage behavior we

06:40:56.399 --> 06:40:58.399
have seen we truly offer values 
in three key moments:  In the 

06:41:00.291 --> 06:41:02.291
morning, during the commute, and
in the evening.

06:41:03.996 --> 06:41:06.290
In the morning, we help our 
users from the minute they get 

06:41:06.291 --> 06:41:09.761
out of bed till they head out of
the door.  From setting alarms 

06:41:09.762 --> 06:41:11.839
to checking the weather to 
listening to the news, the 

06:41:14.318 --> 06:41:18.236
Assistant is always there.
Next comes the commute journey. 

06:41:18.237 --> 06:41:20.320
Imagine you are driving to work 
and you have a million things on

06:41:20.321 --> 06:41:25.150
your mind.  The Assistant can 
make that time productive.  It 

06:41:25.151 --> 06:41:27.151
could help you with navigation, 

06:41:29.899 --> 06:41:31.522
listening to your favorite 
podcast or even rescheduling 

06:41:31.523 --> 06:41:34.178
your next meeting.  Finally 
comes the evening journey, the 

06:41:35.183 --> 06:41:39.102
time to destress.  The Assistant
is still there for you.  It 

06:41:39.103 --> 06:41:41.845
could help you with things like 
control your smart home devices,

06:41:41.846 --> 06:41:43.846
play 

06:41:44.890 --> 06:41:46.890
relaxing music or help you cook 
a meal.

06:41:48.165 --> 06:41:50.165
Now, as a developer, whether you
focus 

06:41:51.860 --> 06:41:54.726
on morning productivity, media 
on the go, or smart home, by 

06:41:54.727 --> 06:41:57.651
focusing on one of those 
critical user journeys you'd be 

06:41:59.938 --> 06:42:01.768
optimizing for moments where we 
truly believe we can offer 

06:42:01.769 --> 06:42:03.769
assistance to our users.

06:42:05.455 --> 06:42:08.321
This will automatically lead to 
higher engagement and will  

06:42:08.322 --> 06:42:10.825
potentially lead to more organic
discovery opportunities.

06:42:14.122 --> 06:42:16.122
Another key source for 
engagement is our 

06:42:17.441 --> 06:42:19.499
newly launched Action Links.  
Action  Links are hyperlinks 

06:42:19.500 --> 06:42:23.823
that point directly to your 
action.  They make your action 

06:42:23.824 --> 06:42:26.073
discoverable from any platform 
or Surface.

06:42:29.341 --> 06:42:31.824
They allow users to engage 
directly with your action 

06:42:31.825 --> 06:42:33.825
irrespective of how they found 
this link, whether on a website,

06:42:36.547 --> 06:42:40.433
in a social media campaign, or 
even on a billboard.  I am 

06:42:40.434 --> 06:42:44.080
personally considering having a 
billboard for my action.  Isn't 

06:42:44.081 --> 06:42:47.416
it awesome?
On the Assistant side, we're 

06:42:47.417 --> 06:42:51.895
going to promote these links 
everywhere.  You're going to 

06:42:51.896 --> 06:42:56.996
start seeing these links on your
Action Page in the directory.  

06:42:56.997 --> 06:42:59.051
This will allow users to try 
your action easily, and engage 

06:42:59.052 --> 06:43:03.326
with you directly.
If they had a good experience, 

06:43:03.327 --> 06:43:06.439
they're also going to be able to
share it with their friends.

06:43:09.095 --> 06:43:11.095
Supporting Action Links is very 
easy.

06:43:12.160 --> 06:43:15.851
All you need to do is go to the 
actions console.  Over there, 

06:43:15.852 --> 06:43:18.715
you can publish a URL for your 
action, and choose a title for 

06:43:18.716 --> 06:43:23.271
your link.  Once you do that, 
you will instantly get a link 

06:43:23.272 --> 06:43:25.707
that you can start sharing.
Once you have a published link, 

06:43:25.708 --> 06:43:28.356
you're encouraged to promote it 
everywhere.

06:43:31.612 --> 06:43:33.612
You might have seen this in the 

06:43:35.274 --> 06:43:36.898
developers' keynote, but head 
space has built some great 

06:43:36.899 --> 06:43:41.658
experiences on Google Assistant,
helping users  meditate.  They 

06:43:41.659 --> 06:43:45.330
also happen to have a really 
engaged social following.  Now 

06:43:45.331 --> 06:43:47.612
every time they have a new 
update since they have an action

06:43:47.613 --> 06:43:49.857
link, they can direct their 
users directly to that  update.

06:43:53.109 --> 06:43:54.756
They can do so through a blog 
post like anyway have done so on

06:43:54.757 --> 06:43:57.415
Tuesday, or through a quick 
Tweet.

06:43:59.663 --> 06:44:02.327
So just to recap, so far, we 
have talked about awareness 

06:44:02.328 --> 06:44:04.366
through the Assistant Directory 
and built-in  intents, 

06:44:06.404 --> 06:44:10.147
engagement through critical user
journeys and Action Links.  Now 

06:44:10.148 --> 06:44:12.148
let's move to the last piece of 
the funnel:  Retention.

06:44:15.664 --> 06:44:17.664
&gt;&gt; TANYA GUPTA:  Retention is 
all about 

06:44:20.374 --> 06:44:25.264
creating a loyal base of users 
that derive value your action.  

06:44:25.265 --> 06:44:27.498
Not only do these users bring 
consistent traffic, but they 

06:44:27.499 --> 06:44:32.592
also eventually become your 
evangelists, and they feed the 

06:44:32.593 --> 06:44:34.593
funnel by creating awareness for
your action.

06:44:36.875 --> 06:44:38.875
So how do you go about building 
these loyal users?

06:44:41.558 --> 06:44:43.558
The best way is a lot of what 
Dina 

06:44:45.842 --> 06:44:47.842
talked about, by creating a 
high-quality 

06:44:48.928 --> 06:44:51.182
action with dynamic and unique 
content that users find  

06:44:51.183 --> 06:44:54.033
meaningful.
Once you're confident that your 

06:44:54.034 --> 06:44:58.102
action does this, there are a 
few tools that you can leverage 

06:44:58.103 --> 06:45:00.103
to re-engage and 

06:45:01.580 --> 06:45:03.580
maintain a relationship with a 
user.

06:45:04.641 --> 06:45:07.498
The first feature allows you to 
send an update on a daily basis 

06:45:07.499 --> 06:45:12.805
to the user at a time specified 
by them.  Let me give you a 

06:45:12.806 --> 06:45:16.687
personal example of how I like 
to use this feature.  Every day 

06:45:16.688 --> 06:45:18.688
at 2:00 p.m.

06:45:19.783 --> 06:45:21.783
, I like to grab a coffee and 
just 

06:45:22.874 --> 06:45:24.874
escape from work for a few 
minutes and  destress.

06:45:27.114 --> 06:45:29.345
I'm also an avid story-reader 
and reading stories really 

06:45:29.346 --> 06:45:34.269
relaxes me, so I set up this 
feature so that every day, as 

06:45:34.270 --> 06:45:36.530
I'm getting my coffee, I receive
an update with a story to read.

06:45:37.754 --> 06:45:42.093
Another feature that helps with 
re-engaging users is the push 

06:45:43.761 --> 06:45:46.065
notifications feature.  As the 
name denotes, this feature 

06:45:48.522 --> 06:45:50.765
allows you to push a 
notification to the user 

06:45:50.766 --> 06:45:52.840
whenever your action deems it 
appropriate.

06:45:55.097 --> 06:45:57.097
Let's say, for example, your 
action 

06:45:58.347 --> 06:46:00.186
tracks cryptocurrency prices, 
and there's a fluctuation in the

06:46:00.187 --> 06:46:04.690
price.  Your action can 
automatically push an  update to

06:46:04.691 --> 06:46:06.691
the user so that the user can 
take the appropriate response.

06:46:07.540 --> 06:46:12.885
Both of these features can be 
enabled for your action inside 

06:46:12.886 --> 06:46:16.366
of the actions on Google 
Console.  Once you've enabled 

06:46:16.367 --> 06:46:19.046
it, you can start prompting 
users to see if they'd like to 

06:46:21.080 --> 06:46:23.080
receive these updates or these 
notifications from your action.

06:46:28.246 --> 06:46:30.280
The last tool that I want to 
talk about builds on the key 

06:46:30.281 --> 06:46:33.805
user journeys that Dina talked 
about as part of the engagement 

06:46:33.806 --> 06:46:35.806
section.  We really believe that
these are some 

06:46:38.731 --> 06:46:41.589
of the best times that the 
Assistant can provide the most 

06:46:41.590 --> 06:46:43.590
benefit to the user.

06:46:45.660 --> 06:46:47.911
For this reason, we built the  
routines assistance feature 

06:46:47.912 --> 06:46:49.912
which allows the user 

06:46:51.026 --> 06:46:53.026
to customize the information 
that they 

06:46:54.123 --> 06:46:56.438
receive when they trigger a 
routine.  So for example, when I

06:46:56.439 --> 06:46:59.284
say  hey, Google, good morning, 
I've customized my 

06:47:02.547 --> 06:47:04.547
phone to take itself off of 
silent, to 

06:47:05.610 --> 06:47:08.459
tell me about may commute, the 
weather, as well as may first 

06:47:08.460 --> 06:47:11.330
meeting, and then kick it into 
my favorite music.

06:47:14.407 --> 06:47:16.679
As a developer, you can also 
enable your action to be 

06:47:16.680 --> 06:47:18.680
incorporated as part of a 
routine.

06:47:21.829 --> 06:47:23.475
Following the same model as the 
daily updates, once you enable 

06:47:23.476 --> 06:47:27.160
this for your action, you can 
start prompting users to see if 

06:47:27.161 --> 06:47:29.237
they'd like to incorporate it as
part of one of their routines.

06:47:29.638 --> 06:47:32.502
After the user does so, the next
time 

06:47:35.758 --> 06:47:38.646
they trigger a routine, your 
action will automatically get 

06:47:38.647 --> 06:47:42.577
called.
Another important aspect to 

06:47:42.578 --> 06:47:48.086
retaining users is to make sure 
that users can have a smooth and

06:47:48.087 --> 06:47:50.087
free-flowing conversation with 
your action.

06:47:52.808 --> 06:47:55.459
Have you ever had that situation
where you walked up to someone 

06:47:55.460 --> 06:48:00.644
and you asked them a question, 
and they just didn't get it?  So

06:48:00.645 --> 06:48:02.645
you rephrased it a little bit, 

06:48:03.956 --> 06:48:06.201
hoping that they'd be able to 
understand you this time, and 

06:48:06.202 --> 06:48:08.674
they shrugged their shoulders?  
So you try one last time, a 

06:48:08.675 --> 06:48:11.974
third time, hoping that they'd 
be able to answer and tell you 

06:48:11.975 --> 06:48:14.637
what you're looking for?  And 
they still could not help you.

06:48:15.438 --> 06:48:17.692
How frustrating was that 
experience?

06:48:20.755 --> 06:48:23.397
In the same way, you want to 
make sure that your action 

06:48:23.398 --> 06:48:25.855
understands your user, and is 
able to give it the information 

06:48:27.492 --> 06:48:29.492
that it's looking for.

06:48:31.349 --> 06:48:35.415
We have a few tools that you can
use to ensure that.  The first 

06:48:35.416 --> 06:48:38.123
is a session flow feature inside
of dialogue flow, which allows 

06:48:40.996 --> 06:48:43.030
you to analyze the conversation 
flow users having with your 

06:48:43.031 --> 06:48:45.031
action.

06:48:46.924 --> 06:48:48.924
Let's take the session flow of 
the 

06:48:52.379 --> 06:48:53.572
mobile legends action as an 
example.  This action was built 

06:48:53.573 --> 06:48:55.573
a little over a 

06:48:57.434 --> 06:49:00.075
month  ago, and quickly Rose to 
become a top-10 action globally,

06:49:00.076 --> 06:49:03.549
so it makes for a great case 
study.  The action for those of 

06:49:03.550 --> 06:49:05.550
you who aren't 

06:49:06.828 --> 06:49:09.519
familiar with it is based on the
mobile legends game and it tells

06:49:09.520 --> 06:49:12.181
users about the different 
characters from the game.

06:49:15.649 --> 06:49:17.649
So you can see from the session 
flow 

06:49:18.719 --> 06:49:20.962
here that about 97% of users 
that start a conversation do so 

06:49:20.963 --> 06:49:23.451
in the default welcome intent, 
where they're presented 

06:49:27.950 --> 06:49:29.950
a list of characters to choose 
from.

06:49:31.249 --> 06:49:33.281
Let's dig a little bit deeper 
and see where the conversation 

06:49:33.282 --> 06:49:35.282
goes from here.

06:49:37.464 --> 06:49:39.705
As you can see, session flow 
allows you to break down the 

06:49:39.706 --> 06:49:41.706
conversation on a  per-intent 
basis.

06:49:43.870 --> 06:49:45.904
I was able to click on the 
default welcome intent, and see 

06:49:45.905 --> 06:49:49.988
what the next set of intents 
that triggered from there.

06:49:51.831 --> 06:49:53.831
In this case, about 57% of users
clicked 

06:49:54.887 --> 06:49:57.941
on one of the characters to 
learn about it.  I'm going to 

06:49:57.942 --> 06:49:59.942
dig one level deeper, and see 
what happened from there.

06:50:03.884 --> 06:50:05.884
41% of users that selected a 
character 

06:50:07.598 --> 06:50:09.669
read about the character, and 
then 32% dropped off from there,

06:50:09.670 --> 06:50:13.529
as we can see from that red line
coming out of the intent.

06:50:16.185 --> 06:50:19.060
Session flow is a powerful tool 
for you to identify what the 

06:50:19.061 --> 06:50:22.529
most popular intents in your 
action are.  This is great if 

06:50:22.530 --> 06:50:25.508
you're looking to expand your 
action, and want to see how 

06:50:28.924 --> 06:50:31.764
users are already leveraging it.
The second thing that I would 

06:50:31.765 --> 06:50:34.088
recommend using session flow for
would be to use 

06:50:37.358 --> 06:50:40.932
it to identify where the large 
drop-offs are.  Maybe there's 

06:50:40.933 --> 06:50:42.933
certain intents where it's just 
not understanding the user, or 

06:50:44.958 --> 06:50:46.958
it's not providing the user the 
information they're seeking.

06:50:49.936 --> 06:50:51.560
Identifying these  drop-offs is 
a great way to ensure that 

06:50:51.561 --> 06:50:54.215
you're not losing users when 
they interact with your action.

06:50:54.655 --> 06:50:59.603
And the last thing I'd encourage
you to use this feature for 

06:50:59.604 --> 06:51:01.604
would be to identify the intents
that just aren't 

06:51:04.325 --> 06:51:06.325
getting any love, and that might
mean 

06:51:07.413 --> 06:51:09.413
restructuring your action so 
that users 

06:51:10.703 --> 06:51:12.703
can find those intents much more
easily.

06:51:13.579 --> 06:51:15.579
Another tool I want to quickly 
touch 

06:51:18.078 --> 06:51:21.135
upon is the history feature 
inside of  Dialogueflow.  This 

06:51:21.136 --> 06:51:23.186
feature allows you to see the 
most popular queries that users 

06:51:23.187 --> 06:51:25.187
are issuing to your action.

06:51:27.275 --> 06:51:29.111
It's a great way of ensuring 
that your action responds in the

06:51:29.112 --> 06:51:31.762
appropriate way, and is giving 
the user what they're looking 

06:51:31.763 --> 06:51:34.599
for.
You can also see a few of these 

06:51:34.600 --> 06:51:36.600
queries 

06:51:37.663 --> 06:51:41.969
have an exclamation mark next to
it.  That's never a good thing. 

06:51:41.970 --> 06:51:44.009
These exclamation marks mean 
that either your action could 

06:51:44.010 --> 06:51:46.734
not be reached or that it gave 
the default fall-back 

06:51:49.783 --> 06:51:51.783
intent, or worst of all, it just
quit.

06:51:53.684 --> 06:51:55.722
In all after these cases, that 
is a poor user experience, and 

06:51:55.723 --> 06:51:58.776
the user is less likely to 
engage again with your action.

06:51:59.170 --> 06:52:03.334
Now, we've talked about two 
different aspects to retaining 

06:52:03.335 --> 06:52:05.335
users.

06:52:07.612 --> 06:52:09.873
The first is talking about 
creating a smooth conversation, 

06:52:09.874 --> 06:52:13.391
and the second was all about -- 
what was the second one?

06:52:14.037 --> 06:52:15.689
&gt;&gt; DINA ELHADDAD:  Metrics?
&gt;&gt; TANYA GUPTA:  Oh, yeah, so 

06:52:15.690 --> 06:52:19.379
this is all about creating the 
metrics, right?  It's always 

06:52:19.380 --> 06:52:22.222
important to keep a lookout on 
the metrics to ensure that 

06:52:26.324 --> 06:52:28.355
your users having a good 
experience, and their action is 

06:52:28.356 --> 06:52:30.397
performing consistently.  So 
let's talk about a few metrics 

06:52:30.398 --> 06:52:33.101
that are particularly important.

06:52:36.813 --> 06:52:40.529
The first is a star rating that 
users are giving your action.  

06:52:40.530 --> 06:52:42.170
These star ratings are a good 
signal as to whether users 

06:52:42.171 --> 06:52:44.171
enjoyed your action and are 
likely to come back.

06:52:46.915 --> 06:52:49.554
Ideally, the star ratings should
be always either be 5-star or  

06:52:49.555 --> 06:52:54.652
4-star, and if you're seeing a 
lot of one-star and 2-stars, 

06:52:54.653 --> 06:52:56.707
that means something is going 
wrong and it needs to be fixed.

06:53:00.437 --> 06:53:02.437
Other ratings to keep a lookout 
on are 

06:53:03.899 --> 06:53:05.932
things like:  Active users, 
average conversation length, 

06:53:05.933 --> 06:53:08.098
messages and abort rate.  All of
these should be what you expect 

06:53:08.921 --> 06:53:12.993
them to be.  You want your abort
rate to be low.  You want your 

06:53:12.994 --> 06:53:14.994
active users to be high.

06:53:16.085 --> 06:53:17.098
You want your average 
conversation length to be what 

06:53:17.099 --> 06:53:21.592
it is.  If you see any 
deviations, that means  again 

06:53:21.593 --> 06:53:23.593
something has gone wrong with 
your action.

06:53:24.237 --> 06:53:25.657
So we've talked about a lot of 
different things in this 

06:53:25.658 --> 06:53:28.523
session.  Let's quickly recap 
what they were.

06:53:31.358 --> 06:53:33.622
We broke the funnel into three 
parts:  The first was we talked 

06:53:33.623 --> 06:53:38.499
about awareness, where we talk 
about two different tools.  

06:53:38.500 --> 06:53:42.829
First, optimizing for the 
Assistant Directory page.  And, 

06:53:42.830 --> 06:53:44.830
second, integrating with 
built-in intents.

06:53:46.702 --> 06:53:49.349
The second was about creating an
engaging experience, and this 

06:53:49.350 --> 06:53:51.350
could be 

06:53:52.404 --> 06:53:54.668
done by tailoring for the key 
user journeys where the 

06:53:54.669 --> 06:53:56.669
Assistant can provide the most 
benefit.

06:53:57.919 --> 06:53:59.919
And the last part of the funnel 
was 

06:54:01.412 --> 06:54:04.864
about retaining users so that 
they come back repeatedly.  And 

06:54:04.865 --> 06:54:07.099
here we talked about creating a 
compelling  conversation, and 

06:54:07.100 --> 06:54:09.100
using 

06:54:10.381 --> 06:54:13.271
metrics to identify pitfalls.
&gt;&gt; DINA ELHADDAD:  This 

06:54:13.272 --> 06:54:16.144

we would love to hear you 

06:54:16.145 --> 06:54:18.145

&gt;&gt; Hello!  And welcome to what 
is almost certainly the last 

07:23:58.540 --> 07:24:01.189
session you'll be attending here
this week.

07:24:05.293 --> 07:24:06.721
I'm Ben Frenkel, Product Manager
on the Google Play Instant team 

07:24:06.722 --> 07:24:08.722
and I focus on games.

07:24:12.423 --> 07:24:14.063
Today we have Jam City, King and
Zynga with us to talk about 

07:24:14.064 --> 07:24:16.510
Google Play Instant.  But before
we get started I'm going to 

07:24:18.747 --> 07:24:20.747
provide you some context for the
panel discussion.

07:24:24.488 --> 07:24:26.744
So last year at I/O we launched 
instant apps and since then 

07:24:26.745 --> 07:24:28.745
we've been pretty busy.

07:24:31.828 --> 07:24:33.454
We've enabled instant apps on 
over one billion devices and 

07:24:33.455 --> 07:24:35.720
we've made major improvements to
our tooling and Android 

07:24:38.773 --> 07:24:40.187
Studio, and most recently, at 
the game developer conference in

07:24:40.188 --> 07:24:44.735
March, we announced that instant
apps was finally coming to 

07:24:44.736 --> 07:24:46.736
games.  And this week, we were 
excited to 

07:24:50.263 --> 07:24:52.263
announce that Google Play 
Instant is now 

07:24:53.284 --> 07:24:57.831
available to all game 
developers.  Now, let's take a 

07:24:57.832 --> 07:24:59.832
look at Google Play Instant in 
action.

&gt;&gt; Goodbye!

07:25:34.861 --> 07:25:38.726
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  So King's 
Candy Crush team just launched 

07:25:38.727 --> 07:25:41.916
that app this past Tuesday day 
and you can check it out on the 

07:25:41.917 --> 07:25:47.543
Play Store today.  So just think
about that for a second.  That's

07:25:47.544 --> 07:25:49.544
Candy Crush, one of the most, 

07:25:50.610 --> 07:25:52.610
if not the most, successful 
mobile games 

07:25:55.073 --> 07:25:56.704
ever coming to Google Play 
Instant, and what gets partners 

07:25:56.705 --> 07:25:58.705
like King excited is 

07:25:59.774 --> 07:26:02.213
the vision that bringing Instant
to games can transform game 

07:26:02.214 --> 07:26:04.214
discovery, and 

07:26:05.485 --> 07:26:07.598
we know that this is possible 
because we have seen this movie 

07:26:07.599 --> 07:26:10.270
before.
Whenever media becomes instant, 

07:26:12.310 --> 07:26:17.587
consumption goes up.  Speed is a
huge competitive advantage.  

07:26:17.588 --> 07:26:19.588
We've seen this with streaming 
music 

07:26:20.644 --> 07:26:22.644
and movies, and before that, 
Google 

07:26:23.682 --> 07:26:25.536
proved the  transformative 
impact of speed with  Instant 

07:26:25.537 --> 07:26:27.537
Search.

07:26:29.032 --> 07:26:31.032
And we want to do the same thing
for 

07:26:32.280 --> 07:26:34.280
games, because we believe that 
Instant 

07:26:35.590 --> 07:26:37.590
will do the same thing for you, 
the game developer.

07:26:39.495 --> 07:26:42.161
Imagine users trying more games,
Exploring more genres, and 

07:26:42.162 --> 07:26:47.054
ultimately finding more games 
they love to play.  That would 

07:26:47.055 --> 07:26:49.907
have a  transformative impact on
your business, and over the 

07:26:52.999 --> 07:26:55.239
course of our early access 
program, the data has proven 

07:26:55.240 --> 07:26:58.718
this theory out.
Today, the most visible entry 

07:26:58.719 --> 07:27:02.502
point to an instant app is the 
Try Now button, as you can see 

07:27:02.503 --> 07:27:06.987
here.  And with just the Try Now
button, partners are already 

07:27:06.988 --> 07:27:09.467
seeing an up to 20% increase in 
user acquisitions.

07:27:14.354 --> 07:27:16.354
Again, that impact is from Try 
Now 

07:27:17.398 --> 07:27:19.398
alone, which just scratches the 
Surface 

07:27:21.085 --> 07:27:23.085
of the overall Google Play 
Instant opportunity.

07:27:24.349 --> 07:27:26.349
People will also be able to 
discover 

07:27:27.815 --> 07:27:29.641
your games through ads, through 
the play games app, through 

07:27:29.642 --> 07:27:33.119
social invites and banners and 
collections on the Play Store.

07:27:33.524 --> 07:27:36.380
And today, we're announcing that
Instant 

07:27:41.378 --> 07:27:43.482
Apps is coming soon to  
pre-registration.  Soon, players

07:27:43.483 --> 07:27:46.399
that pre-register can also get a
sneak preview of your game.

07:27:50.271 --> 07:27:52.935
And when you promote 
reregistration through social 

07:27:52.936 --> 07:27:55.382
media, email or your website, 
users can instantly play that 

07:27:57.640 --> 07:27:59.640
game from any Android device.

07:28:00.681 --> 07:28:02.681
It's an awesome way to introduce
your game to the world.

07:28:04.366 --> 07:28:06.366
And as you look at what our 
partners 

07:28:08.231 --> 07:28:10.687
have done with the discovery 
services that I just described 

07:28:10.688 --> 07:28:12.688
and you hear about what they're 
excited about doing in the 

07:28:13.981 --> 07:28:16.830
future, you'll start to see how 
important a role Google Play 

07:28:16.831 --> 07:28:20.122
Instant can play throughout the 
lifecycle of a game.

07:28:22.384 --> 07:28:25.257
From the pre-launch Phase, when 
your goal is to make your launch

07:28:25.258 --> 07:28:27.258
as big as 

07:28:28.706 --> 07:28:31.086
possible, to build the hype 
machine around your game, and 

07:28:31.087 --> 07:28:35.170
once you've had that big launch 
and you've acquired a bunch of 

07:28:35.171 --> 07:28:37.823
users, you want your game to go 
viral.  You want your players to

07:28:37.824 --> 07:28:42.088
invite their friends to the 
party, so to speak.  And after 

07:28:42.089 --> 07:28:44.530
your game has been around for a 
while, your goals end up 

07:28:44.531 --> 07:28:47.586
changing.
Your focus then turns to 

07:28:47.587 --> 07:28:49.587
retaining your 

07:28:50.642 --> 07:28:52.470
existing players, and bringing 
back those that may have 

07:28:52.471 --> 07:28:54.471
churned.

07:28:57.573 --> 07:28:59.597
At each stage, the right instant
experience can play an integral 

07:28:59.598 --> 07:29:02.877
role in your game's success.  
And there are three times of 

07:29:02.878 --> 07:29:07.387
instant experiences among the 
many, many that we saw among our

07:29:07.388 --> 07:29:11.408
partners.  It was very difficult
to choose just these three.  But

07:29:11.409 --> 07:29:15.287
I wanted to highlight these 
three today for you.  The first 

07:29:15.288 --> 07:29:17.528
is the minigame.  A minigame is 
often a gaming 

07:29:20.991 --> 07:29:22.991
experience that is complimentary
to the 

07:29:25.680 --> 07:29:29.353
full game, and is a great fit 
for  pre-registration.  

07:29:29.354 --> 07:29:31.354
Dancevil's minigame let's you 

07:29:33.564 --> 07:29:34.989
choreographic a routine by 
manipulating the individual 

07:29:34.990 --> 07:29:37.022
limbs on this awesome looking 
character and once you're done 

07:29:39.047 --> 07:29:42.497
you can share an animated  GIF 
with all of your friends.  It 

07:29:42.498 --> 07:29:45.359
offers endless combinations of 
moves and plenty of 

07:29:45.360 --> 07:29:47.360
entertainment to occupy players 
all the way through to 

07:29:50.081 --> 07:29:52.081
the event you'll launch of the 
game.

07:29:53.158 --> 07:29:55.158
The second is what I'm calling 
the core gameplay preview.

07:29:57.603 --> 07:29:59.056
And the goal of this archetype 
is to provide a glimpse of what 

07:29:59.057 --> 07:30:02.094
players will experience after 
the tutorial and introductory 

07:30:02.095 --> 07:30:04.095
levels.

07:30:05.161 --> 07:30:07.161
This is a great game and a great
type 

07:30:08.643 --> 07:30:10.691
for different experiences that 
have a deep upgrade system, for 

07:30:10.692 --> 07:30:16.019
example, such as zombie Gunship 
Revenant, like you can see here,

07:30:16.020 --> 07:30:18.020
and this example, the 

07:30:19.280 --> 07:30:20.704
installed app at the top 
typically starts you off with a 

07:30:20.705 --> 07:30:25.188
single weapon.  It's not unusual
to let people slowly acclimate 

07:30:25.189 --> 07:30:27.618
to new game mechanics and so 
forth.  So you start off with a 

07:30:27.619 --> 07:30:29.619
single machine 

07:30:31.278 --> 07:30:33.278
gun, and the zombie horde that's

07:30:34.936 --> 07:30:37.430
arriving is arriving at a 
relatively modest pace.  

07:30:37.431 --> 07:30:39.277
Contrast this with the instant 
experience, which you can see 

07:30:39.278 --> 07:30:44.158
down here on the left.
In this one, you don't just get 

07:30:44.159 --> 07:30:47.021
one machine gun, but you get two
machine guns.

07:30:51.306 --> 07:30:53.746
You get a high-powered sniper 
rifle and hellfire missiles.

07:30:56.807 --> 07:30:58.807
The whole experience is intended
to 

07:31:00.471 --> 07:31:02.471
get your adrenaline pumping, and
is a 

07:31:03.544 --> 07:31:05.167
great fit for Try Now, for ads 
and other user acquisition 

07:31:05.168 --> 07:31:07.168
channels.

07:31:10.383 --> 07:31:12.412
And if you're focused on 
bringing back churned users, the

07:31:12.413 --> 07:31:14.413
game highlights pattern might be
the right fit for you.

07:31:17.407 --> 07:31:19.407
The Candy Crush experience is a 
great example of this.

07:31:21.383 --> 07:31:22.954
To build their Instant app, the 
Candy Crush team selected five 

07:31:22.955 --> 07:31:24.955
levels from the more than 3,000 
available in the full 

07:31:27.278 --> 07:31:29.278
game, starting with Level 16, 
going all 

07:31:32.977 --> 07:31:34.405
the way up to  Level 90 and each
was selected to highlight a 

07:31:34.406 --> 07:31:38.707
unique combination of game 
mechanics.  I really like 

07:31:38.708 --> 07:31:43.480
playing level 590 which you can 
see here.  There's a convey or 

07:31:43.481 --> 07:31:48.993
belt which Mavs candies around 
and there's this fascinating 

07:31:48.994 --> 07:31:51.653
portal in the mid Olof it which 
you can't see it now, and 

07:31:51.654 --> 07:31:56.756
through which candies magically 
disappear.  The goal of this 

07:31:56.757 --> 07:31:58.757
type of experience is to provide
a glimpse of what you've been 

07:32:01.067 --> 07:32:03.305
missing out on since the last 
time you played.  And it's very 

07:32:03.306 --> 07:32:05.306
effective.

07:32:06.991 --> 07:32:08.215
So now that you have a sense of 
the role Google Play Instant can

07:32:08.216 --> 07:32:12.942
play throughout the lifecycle of
a game, let's turn our attention

07:32:12.943 --> 07:32:16.872
to how you build these types of 
experiences.  And just like we 

07:32:16.873 --> 07:32:18.873
want to make it as easy as 
possible for users to start 

07:32:20.568 --> 07:32:22.568
playing your games, we also want
to make 

07:32:24.032 --> 07:32:26.885
it easier for you, the game 
developer, to build these 

07:32:26.886 --> 07:32:28.886
experiences.

07:32:30.888 --> 07:32:32.888
And we've mad

07:32:33.941 --> 07:32:36.915
made substantial  investment.  
First we have the framework to 

07:32:36.916 --> 07:32:39.988
meet the unique needs of game  
developers.  We made three 

07:32:39.989 --> 07:32:41.989
changes.

07:32:43.660 --> 07:32:45.660
We raised the size limit to 10 
megabytes.

07:32:47.772 --> 07:32:50.613
Enabled the download of assets 
and executable Code and we 

07:32:50.614 --> 07:32:56.126
integrated with game engines and
added support for native Code 

07:32:56.127 --> 07:32:58.127
and OpenGL and that last point 
is vitally important because it 

07:32:59.858 --> 07:33:01.858
means you can use the same Code 
base as 

07:33:03.100 --> 07:33:05.370
your full game to build your 
instant app and by integrating 

07:33:05.371 --> 07:33:09.643
with game engines like Unity, 
we've made it possible to build 

07:33:09.644 --> 07:33:11.644
with the tools you're already 
familiar with.

07:33:14.107 --> 07:33:15.763
To make this possible for Unity 
developers, possibly many of you

07:33:15.764 --> 07:33:20.031
in the audience here today, we 
have to work closely with the 

07:33:20.032 --> 07:33:22.032
world's most widely 

07:33:23.286 --> 07:33:25.310
used game engine, Unity.  
Through this close collaboration

07:33:27.147 --> 07:33:28.790
millions of Unity developers 
will be able to optimize their 

07:33:28.791 --> 07:33:30.791
current and future games for 
Google Play Instant.

07:33:34.318 --> 07:33:35.952
And to that end, we've built the
Google Play Instant Unity 

07:33:35.953 --> 07:33:38.587
plugin.  The plugin simplifies 
building and 

07:33:42.063 --> 07:33:44.063
deploying an instant app all 
from within 

07:33:45.144 --> 07:33:48.216
the Unity IDE and it will become
available in the coming weeks.  

07:33:48.217 --> 07:33:50.217
If you're a Unity developer and 
want 

07:33:51.709 --> 07:33:54.184
to start building an instance 
experience today we represented 

07:33:54.185 --> 07:33:56.003
you join our Unity Beta Program.
You can sign up at the link in 

07:33:56.004 --> 07:34:00.294
the lower left-hand corner and 
I'll review this at the end so 

07:34:00.295 --> 07:34:03.146
you don't have to immediately 
break out your photos and take a

07:34:03.147 --> 07:34:08.032
picture.  If you sign up today, 
you'll get the latest news and 

07:34:08.033 --> 07:34:11.090
access to beta features.
We're also excited to announce 

07:34:11.091 --> 07:34:13.091
that 

07:34:14.349 --> 07:34:17.205
Cocos has added instant support 
to their IDE Cocos Creator and 

07:34:17.206 --> 07:34:20.675
they've gone beyond supporting 
Google Play Instant as a build 

07:34:20.676 --> 07:34:23.344
target by adding tools that 
simplify the process of building

07:34:23.345 --> 07:34:26.811
an instant app.
Cocos has added two steps to 

07:34:26.812 --> 07:34:31.074
their standard build process 
just for this purpose:  Record 

07:34:31.075 --> 07:34:33.940
and refactor steps.  On the 
recording step, you play your 

07:34:36.423 --> 07:34:38.423
game in the Cocos simulator 
which tracks 

07:34:39.667 --> 07:34:42.340
which assets are used and when. 
Then in the refactor step you 

07:34:42.341 --> 07:34:44.369
use a visual  non-linear editing
style tool to 

07:34:47.629 --> 07:34:50.074
define the boundaries of your 
instant experience, and assets 

07:34:50.075 --> 07:34:53.320
are broken down by category.  As
you can see here, to support 

07:34:55.568 --> 07:34:57.568
further optimizations.

07:35:00.483 --> 07:35:03.379
Cocos has made an alpha build 
available for the adventure us 

07:35:03.380 --> 07:35:05.622
to try and you can check it out 
today.

07:35:08.921 --> 07:35:10.342
With that, now that I've set the
context, let's bring our 

07:35:10.343 --> 07:35:12.343
esteemed panel 

07:35:13.392 --> 07:35:15.421
up on the stage to talk about 
their vision for and experience 

07:35:15.422 --> 07:35:19.337
with Instant Apps.  So, folks, 
come on up.

07:35:20.385 --> 07:35:22.385
[ Applause ]

07:35:30.173 --> 07:35:34.036
Thank you.  So why don't we kick
things off with each of you 

07:35:34.037 --> 07:35:36.037
introducing yourselves, 

07:35:37.326 --> 07:35:39.185
talking a bit about your 
background and any other 

07:35:39.186 --> 07:35:41.186
thoughts you think might be 
interesting for the  crowd.

07:35:42.062 --> 07:35:44.062
&gt;&gt; Hello everyone.  I'm Marcelo 
Ferreiro.

07:35:46.768 --> 07:35:48.768
I'm the Director of Engineering 
at Jam 

07:35:51.879 --> 07:35:53.879
City and we were in charge of 
creating 

07:35:56.349 --> 07:35:58.349
the Google Play Instant 
experience for our game.

07:35:59.243 --> 07:36:01.719
&gt;&gt; OLILVIA YU:  I'm Olivia Yu, 
vice president of platform 

07:36:01.720 --> 07:36:06.433
partnerships at King and we 
created two Google Play Instant 

07:36:06.434 --> 07:36:08.059
experiences bubble with bubble 
witch three and recently earlier

07:36:08.060 --> 07:36:10.060
this 

07:36:11.515 --> 07:36:12.941
week on Tuesday with Candy Crush
Saga.

07:36:12.942 --> 07:36:14.942
&gt;&gt; KYLE RUSHTON:  My name is 
Kyle 

07:36:17.005 --> 07:36:19.257
Rushton, the senior developer of
product management at Zynga and 

07:36:19.258 --> 07:36:22.720
I work in the product management
team.  I worked on the solitaire

07:36:22.721 --> 07:36:24.721
and worlds 

07:36:25.979 --> 07:36:26.846
with friends 2 Google Play 
Instant experiences.

07:36:26.847 --> 07:36:28.847
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  Awesome.  
Thank you for that.

07:36:32.403 --> 07:36:33.837
So first question:  How do you 
see instant and instant 

07:36:33.838 --> 07:36:38.129
experiences impacting the 
overall gaming landscape?

07:36:39.375 --> 07:36:41.375
&gt;&gt; MARCELO FERREIRO:  So the 
mobile 

07:36:42.638 --> 07:36:44.638
gaming landscape, it's more 
competitive 

07:36:49.106 --> 07:36:50.998
than ever at this moment, and we
sea goog Google Play Instant as 

07:36:50.999 --> 07:36:52.999
a very 

07:36:54.052 --> 07:36:56.052
valuable tool for developers to 
acquire 

07:36:57.101 --> 07:36:59.101
new users into their games, so I
think 

07:37:00.416 --> 07:37:01.632
that's the best part.
&gt;&gt; OLILVIA YU:  So at King, I 

07:37:01.633 --> 07:37:05.534
think we think it can completely
change the way that games are 

07:37:05.535 --> 07:37:07.535
discovered, so there's a ton of 
different untapped opportunities

07:37:09.588 --> 07:37:11.588
that we're looking into, whether
it's 

07:37:13.003 --> 07:37:14.430
advertising,  cross-promotion in
our games, social, so there's a 

07:37:14.431 --> 07:37:17.272
bunch of different opportunities
that we haven't even looked at 

07:37:17.273 --> 07:37:19.273
for Google Play Instant, 

07:37:21.558 --> 07:37:22.593
so there's a lot of untapped 
potential.

07:37:22.594 --> 07:37:24.635
&gt;&gt; KYLE RUSHTON:  I think in the
short term when thinking about 

07:37:24.636 --> 07:37:28.290
app store discovery we'll 
ultimately see more consumers 

07:37:28.291 --> 07:37:30.538
trying games which will 
ultimately lead to more installs

07:37:30.539 --> 07:37:35.228
and longer and better engagement
but thinking longer term I think

07:37:35.229 --> 07:37:40.352
it will allow developers to 
reshape the way they think think

07:37:40.353 --> 07:37:43.203
about discovery and think 
outside the box about how to 

07:37:43.204 --> 07:37:45.236
bring the experience to 
consumers in ways that are 

07:37:47.470 --> 07:37:48.078
outside the traditional app 
store.

07:37:48.079 --> 07:37:50.920
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  Awesome.  
So a couple other questions here

07:37:50.921 --> 07:37:57.010
for you  guys.  What instant use
cases have you tried?  And what 

07:37:57.011 --> 07:37:59.011
use cases are you most excited 
about?

07:38:02.098 --> 07:38:04.098
&gt;&gt; MARCELO FERREIRO:  So for us,
we 

07:38:10.901 --> 07:38:12.901
build the first 10 levels of the
game 

07:38:14.903 --> 07:38:16.903
for users to play, and then they
are 

07:38:18.915 --> 07:38:20.944
able to carry over their 
progress into the full app when 

07:38:20.945 --> 07:38:22.945
they install it.

07:38:24.097 --> 07:38:26.541
So it's more like the core 
gameplay that you made.  And in 

07:38:26.542 --> 07:38:28.542
the future, we see that we're 

07:38:33.124 --> 07:38:35.124
going to Explore probably 
sharing the 

07:38:36.609 --> 07:38:37.834
game with your other -- with 
your friends.

07:38:37.835 --> 07:38:40.081
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  Right.  So
this would be, like, a social 

07:38:40.886 --> 07:38:42.886
invite use  case?
&gt;&gt; MARCELO FERREIRO:  Yes, yes.

07:38:46.571 --> 07:38:49.250
&gt;&gt; OLILVIA YU:  So I think I 
mentioned earlier, I think we're

07:38:49.251 --> 07:38:52.705
pretty excited about all the 
different use cases.  Probably 

07:38:52.706 --> 07:38:55.963
specifically on the performance 
marketing side.  Once it's 

07:38:55.964 --> 07:39:01.504
available.  And then also for 
our side, also cross-promotion. 

07:39:01.505 --> 07:39:03.537
It's really important as you 
brought up earlier, we have a 

07:39:03.538 --> 07:39:08.208
ton of lapsed players on Candy 
Crush saga so it's a great way 

07:39:08.209 --> 07:39:10.209
for us to bring players back for
them to see everything that's 

07:39:11.694 --> 07:39:13.508
happened with the  game, all the
new features and for people to 

07:39:13.509 --> 07:39:16.771
remember about the game again.  
So I think those are sort of the

07:39:16.772 --> 07:39:18.772
main use cases we're pretty 
excited about, 

07:39:21.665 --> 07:39:23.131
and social, as well as Marcelo  
mentioned.

07:39:23.132 --> 07:39:25.132
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  Seems to 
be a common theme.

07:39:26.010 --> 07:39:28.454
&gt;&gt; KYLE RUSHTON:  To date we've 
been focused almost exclusively 

07:39:28.455 --> 07:39:30.922
on Try Now and trying to 
optimize conversion funnel 

07:39:31.319 --> 07:39:33.319
through app store.

07:39:34.779 --> 07:39:36.623
What I'm most excited about is 
we've already said social a few 

07:39:36.624 --> 07:39:38.624
times.

07:39:39.662 --> 07:39:41.662
Part of my Zynga DNA is social 
invites and sharing.

07:39:43.533 --> 07:39:45.993
I think on native, driving 
virality and social growth has 

07:39:45.994 --> 07:39:48.638
always been challenging on the 
recipient side of 

07:39:52.115 --> 07:39:53.943
that experience, there's a lot 
of friction for users to think 

07:39:53.944 --> 07:39:55.944
about what 

07:39:58.037 --> 07:40:00.037
they received, go to the app 
tore store, 

07:40:01.683 --> 07:40:03.115
install the app, and potentially
find out what their friend was 

07:40:03.116 --> 07:40:07.049
trying to share with them but in
the world of instant where you 

07:40:07.050 --> 07:40:09.050
can just share that 

07:40:10.554 --> 07:40:12.554
experience, play a word in words
with 

07:40:14.030 --> 07:40:16.874
friends and open the game word 
is transformative in the way we 

07:40:16.875 --> 07:40:20.756
talk about discovery and sharing
the app in the first place.

07:40:21.586 --> 07:40:24.055
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  Common 
theme, social good.  There's 

07:40:24.056 --> 07:40:27.905
lots of other opportunities I'd 
love to hear you thoughts on.  

07:40:27.906 --> 07:40:30.144
But all the things you've 
implemented, what's been the 

07:40:30.145 --> 07:40:35.048
impact you've seen?  And what do
you anticipate in the future 

07:40:35.049 --> 07:40:37.083
from the next project that you 
do with Google Play Instant?

07:40:40.564 --> 07:40:42.564
&gt;&gt; MARCELO FERREIRO:  Well, I 
think 

07:40:43.830 --> 07:40:45.830
social will be really important 
in that sense.

07:40:49.793 --> 07:40:52.265
Being able to just click and 
being able to play the game, 

07:40:52.266 --> 07:40:54.266
that's going to be really 
important.

07:40:57.892 --> 07:40:59.892
It removes the friction of the  

07:41:01.148 --> 07:41:03.853
installation, which is where 
people actually are eager to 

07:41:03.854 --> 07:41:05.854
play the game, and 

07:41:07.110 --> 07:41:09.950
they probably need to wait 10, 
15, 20 seconds to download it, 

07:41:09.951 --> 07:41:11.951
and being able 

07:41:14.440 --> 07:41:16.268
to take advantage of that 
eagerness, I think that's going 

07:41:16.269 --> 07:41:18.269
to be really important in the 
future.

07:41:18.554 --> 07:41:20.183
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  Thank you.
&gt;&gt; OLILVIA YU:  So from our 

07:41:20.184 --> 07:41:24.046
side, we actually see a lot of 
users like a high intent to 

07:41:24.047 --> 07:41:26.047
install and we've actually 

07:41:27.146 --> 07:41:29.146
seen a lot of users who played 
the game 

07:41:30.606 --> 07:41:32.850
actually go to install bubble 
witch 3 or Candy Crush saga so 

07:41:32.851 --> 07:41:37.158
that's what we're excited about 
and if there's different ways to

07:41:37.159 --> 07:41:39.159
continue to optimize the funnel 

07:41:40.159 --> 07:41:42.159
from

07:41:43.267 --> 07:41:44.078
instant to installing the game.
&gt;&gt; KYLE RUSHTON:  We've been 

07:41:44.079 --> 07:41:47.537
encouraged by the level of 
engagement we've seen with the 

07:41:47.538 --> 07:41:48.947
Try Now experience and the 
demand we're seeing from the 

07:41:48.948 --> 07:41:52.050
consumers of being really 
interested, just check something

07:41:52.051 --> 07:41:54.496
out and not necessarily download
the full experience.

07:41:58.160 --> 07:42:00.202
But our focus has been purely on
driving installs and conversion,

07:42:00.203 --> 07:42:02.861
looking forward in addition to 
sort of moving forth that 

07:42:04.489 --> 07:42:07.148
experience, also look to drive 
things like re-engagement and  

07:42:07.149 --> 07:42:11.271
reactivations, and other sort of
core metrics as part of the 

07:42:11.272 --> 07:42:13.722
experience beyond just 
optimization of the installation

07:42:13.723 --> 07:42:14.946
funnel.
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  That makes

07:42:14.947 --> 07:42:18.227
a lot of sense.  So we've heard 
from you kind of like 

07:42:21.319 --> 07:42:23.575
what you've done, what the 
impact has been.  But let's 

07:42:23.576 --> 07:42:25.398
shift the conversation to 
talking about how you build the 

07:42:25.399 --> 07:42:27.399
instant 

07:42:28.440 --> 07:42:30.440
app, and how you design an 
instant experience.

07:42:32.358 --> 07:42:34.994
So let's start off with you, 
Olivia.  What factors do you 

07:42:34.995 --> 07:42:36.995
think make for a 

07:42:38.016 --> 07:42:42.386
great instant experience?
&gt;&gt; OLILVIA YU:  You're pretty 

07:42:42.387 --> 07:42:45.178
much playing instantly and to 
make sure the player feels like 

07:42:45.179 --> 07:42:47.019
they're in pretty much the 
experience right away and we 

07:42:47.020 --> 07:42:50.271
really picked as you've shown 
earlier really exciting levels 

07:42:50.272 --> 07:42:52.308
so we wanted to make sure we had
really great exciting and 

07:42:54.587 --> 07:42:56.009
engaging levels for the user to 
experience so that was for us 

07:42:56.010 --> 07:42:59.881
really important.  That's why 
we've selected certain levels as

07:42:59.882 --> 07:43:01.707
you can see so certain levels 
have certain boosters, certain 

07:43:01.708 --> 07:43:03.708
features to make sure it's 
really different for 

07:43:06.430 --> 07:43:08.303
every level that they 
experience, within the Google 

07:43:08.304 --> 07:43:12.622
Play Instant experience.
&gt;&gt; KYLE RUSHTON:  Yeah, so would

07:43:12.623 --> 07:43:15.450
you restate the question?
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  So what 

07:43:15.451 --> 07:43:17.451
factors make for a great instant
experience?

07:43:18.379 --> 07:43:20.427
&gt;&gt; KYLE RUSHTON:  Oh yeah.  
Sorry, missed it for a second 

07:43:20.428 --> 07:43:24.325
there.  Yes, expertly speed is 
important, so getting people 

07:43:24.326 --> 07:43:27.187
immediately into the core 
experience, I think probably 

07:43:27.188 --> 07:43:30.648
goes without saying but I also 
think it's important to really 

07:43:30.649 --> 07:43:32.649
design for the use 

07:43:33.899 --> 07:43:36.134
case, so at Zynga, with 
optimization of installs being 

07:43:36.135 --> 07:43:38.135
sort of our primary driver, 
we're really trying to get an 

07:43:39.793 --> 07:43:41.439
experience that was concise and 
short so that it ended in a 

07:43:41.440 --> 07:43:43.440
clear opportunity to 

07:43:47.474 --> 07:43:49.474
expose a user to installing the 
full experience.

07:43:51.379 --> 07:43:53.379
I think if you were doing 
something 

07:43:55.398 --> 07:43:57.398
like a social invite or using it
for 

07:44:00.458 --> 07:44:03.724
cross-promotion or user 
acquisition or different 

07:44:00.458 --> 07:44:01.393
channels you might have to think
about the design for that use 

07:44:01.394 --> 07:44:03.394
case 

07:44:05.374 --> 07:44:07.374
specifically, so I think use 
case is 

07:44:08.391 --> 07:44:08.499
really important to understand, 
and exactly what KPI you're 

07:44:08.500 --> 07:44:11.381
trying to drive when building 
the experience, so it's probably

07:44:11.382 --> 07:44:12.617
not necessarily a one size fits 
all answer.

07:44:12.618 --> 07:44:13.424
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  Gotcha.  
Marcelo?

07:44:13.425 --> 07:44:15.660
&gt;&gt; MARCELO FERREIRO:  Well, for 
us, what made sense was to as I 

07:44:15.661 --> 07:44:17.661
mentioned before, 

07:44:19.116 --> 07:44:21.116
build, like, the first part of 
the game, 

07:44:22.387 --> 07:44:24.387
basically because we know it's 
strong, 

07:44:27.834 --> 07:44:29.711
so we wanted to share that, and 
having the possibility to then 

07:44:29.712 --> 07:44:31.712
move to 

07:44:33.670 --> 07:44:35.670
the full app and be able to 
carry over 

07:44:38.761 --> 07:44:41.013
that progress, that was the use 
case that we...

07:44:46.499 --> 07:44:48.499
But we see in the future another

07:44:51.333 --> 07:44:53.333
possibilities of making probably

07:44:54.886 --> 07:44:57.518
other games we do at Jam City 
lake testing different use cases

07:44:57.519 --> 07:44:59.790
and optimize those for each 
game.

07:45:00.603 --> 07:45:02.603
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  So I have 
a follow-up for you.

07:45:04.903 --> 07:45:07.539
So building a game that meets 
the 10 megabyte size limit 

07:45:07.540 --> 07:45:12.641
sounds probably for many of you 
to be pretty intimidating but 

07:45:12.642 --> 07:45:15.917
all of you have successfully 
done something like that.  What 

07:45:15.918 --> 07:45:17.918
my question is for you is, as 
you 

07:45:21.446 --> 07:45:22.866
built out the instant experience
for  Panapo, what are the kinds 

07:45:22.867 --> 07:45:24.886
of things you learned about both
that process as well 

07:45:27.951 --> 07:45:29.951
as maybe things you learned 
about the 

07:45:31.257 --> 07:45:33.142
installed apps infrastructure, 
and so forth?

07:45:33.143 --> 07:45:35.143
&gt;&gt; MARCELO FERREIRO:  So our 
first idea 

07:45:38.050 --> 07:45:40.050
was to make the instant app 20 
levels 

07:45:41.520 --> 07:45:43.366
long, being able to go back and 
forth to the map, and then go to

07:45:43.367 --> 07:45:45.405
the game and then go to the map 
again.

07:45:51.939 --> 07:45:54.784
But again, we realized that we 
weren't going to achieve the 

07:45:54.785 --> 07:45:56.785
size limit goal 

07:45:59.869 --> 07:46:01.505
that we had, so at that point, 
we got together with the team 

07:46:01.506 --> 07:46:03.506
and basically 

07:46:05.186 --> 07:46:07.255
decided to only do gameplay, and
do the first 10 levels.

07:46:11.119 --> 07:46:13.119
So that enabled us to remove a 
lot of 

07:46:16.025 --> 07:46:18.025
textures, scenes that we weren't
using, 

07:46:20.330 --> 07:46:22.330
localization strings that need 
to be 

07:46:24.611 --> 07:46:26.611
stripped off, and what we 
learned is 

07:46:29.127 --> 07:46:31.127
that every little thing that you
can 

07:46:32.612 --> 07:46:35.262
remove from the app, remove it, 
because it's going to be 

07:46:35.263 --> 07:46:37.263
important.

07:46:38.728 --> 07:46:40.956
Remove the plugins, remove the 
localizations that you don't 

07:46:40.957 --> 07:46:42.957
use.

07:46:44.639 --> 07:46:47.706
Even the smallest  prefab, it's 
important to take it out.

07:46:49.332 --> 07:46:51.179
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  It's all 
cut out.

07:46:51.180 --> 07:46:53.180
&gt;&gt; MARCELO FERREIRO:  Yeah, so 
take away everything.

07:46:55.912 --> 07:46:57.912
We try to do it in a way where 
we 

07:47:00.586 --> 07:47:02.586
could build it on top of the 
regular 

07:47:03.656 --> 07:47:05.890
game, so we benefit from 
changing -- from the changes 

07:47:05.891 --> 07:47:07.891
that we made in the 

07:47:10.363 --> 07:47:13.605
full app, so I would also 
recommend that, if possible.

07:47:14.434 --> 07:47:16.659
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  You're 
saying that through that 

07:47:16.660 --> 07:47:18.702
process, you were able to make 
optimizations that then impacted

07:47:19.342 --> 07:47:21.342
your full game?  Is that right?
&gt;&gt; MARCELO FERREIRO:  Yes.

07:47:25.636 --> 07:47:27.864
In fact, there were two things 
that we benefit from building 

07:47:27.865 --> 07:47:29.865
the instant app.

07:47:34.186 --> 07:47:36.186
One was we improved the way we 
were 

07:47:39.309 --> 07:47:41.309
making animations and that made 
the 

07:47:42.364 --> 07:47:44.803
application run mather, and with
a reduced memory footprint, so 

07:47:44.804 --> 07:47:46.804
we 

07:47:49.329 --> 07:47:51.329
basically in the full app, we 
gained 

07:47:52.572 --> 07:47:54.607
memory and we gained 
performance, so it was truly 

07:47:54.608 --> 07:47:56.227
beneficial.
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  That's 

07:47:56.228 --> 07:47:59.092
awesome.  And, kale, why don't 
you talk a little bit about your

07:47:59.093 --> 07:48:01.093
experience.

07:48:02.379 --> 07:48:04.007
You converted at least a couple 
of games that I've had an 

07:48:04.008 --> 07:48:06.008
opportunity to play.

07:48:07.483 --> 07:48:09.483
What was your experience like 
and how did you do that?

07:48:10.735 --> 07:48:13.589
&gt;&gt; KYLE RUSHTON:  Fortunately in
the case of Zynga solitaire the 

07:48:13.590 --> 07:48:15.590
full app was 

07:48:17.054 --> 07:48:19.913
around the 10 megabyte mark.  In
the case of words with friends 

07:48:19.914 --> 07:48:25.015
2, I think it was, goes back to 
sort of like the design piece of

07:48:25.016 --> 07:48:27.016
it as well was 

07:48:28.026 --> 07:48:28.044
really just having a clear focus
of what we wanted to bring to 

07:48:28.045 --> 07:48:30.045
consumers.

07:48:32.944 --> 07:48:37.077
So for  us, we launched words 
with friends 2 about six months 

07:48:32.944 --> 07:48:34.965
ago.  One of the new features 
was a feature 

07:48:38.089 --> 07:48:40.547
called solo series which allows 
users to play against AI powered

07:48:40.548 --> 07:48:44.822
bots.  We thought that was a 
good match so we focused 

07:48:44.823 --> 07:48:46.870
exclusively on bringing a subset
of solo series to the instant 

07:48:46.871 --> 07:48:51.342
app.  By having that clear focus
we're able to remove a lot of 

07:48:51.343 --> 07:48:56.273
other stuff that was tangential 
unrelated so we could reduce the

07:48:56.274 --> 07:48:58.353
app size and build a really 
clean experience without a lot 

07:48:58.354 --> 07:49:00.598
of the other I won't call it 
fluff but aspects of the app.

07:49:00.990 --> 07:49:04.065
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  Awesome.  
So to synthesize that, you're 

07:49:04.066 --> 07:49:09.430
saying that you can cut out 
let's say lots of levels but 

07:49:09.431 --> 07:49:11.470
another thing is to focus on one
particular slice of the 

07:49:11.471 --> 07:49:13.471
experience.
&gt;&gt; KYLE RUSHTON:  Yeah, exactly.

07:49:16.569 --> 07:49:18.392
That was a good summary.
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  Cool.  

07:49:18.393 --> 07:49:20.030
Your thoughts, Olivia?
&gt;&gt; OLILVIA YU:  So I think for 

07:49:20.031 --> 07:49:24.536
us we just focused a lot on the 
gameplay and then we took out 

07:49:24.537 --> 07:49:27.611
the saga map.  We don't have any
other features.  A lot of our 

07:49:27.612 --> 07:49:29.623
games always have a narrative in
the beginning so we took 

07:49:31.505 --> 07:49:34.572
everything out so it was only 
just focused on the  gameplay.  

07:49:34.573 --> 07:49:35.595
That's what we wanted to focus 
on.

07:49:35.596 --> 07:49:38.652
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  Makes a 
lot of sense.  And we've heard 

07:49:38.653 --> 07:49:40.653
similar things from a 

07:49:41.715 --> 07:49:43.715
lot of our other partners, as 
well, 

07:49:44.967 --> 07:49:47.416
that's either stripping out 
assets or choosing a select 

07:49:47.417 --> 07:49:51.119
gameplay but things really could
get some additional context from

07:49:51.120 --> 07:49:53.582
you up here.
So I wanted to particularly talk

07:49:53.583 --> 07:49:55.583
to you 

07:49:57.088 --> 07:49:59.088
about some of the challenges 
related to 

07:50:00.358 --> 07:50:02.186
developing a instant experience 
in Unity and what are some of 

07:50:02.187 --> 07:50:05.063
the things you ended up having 
to do and learn through that 

07:50:05.064 --> 07:50:05.882
process?
&gt;&gt; MARCELO FERREIRO:  Well, as 

07:50:05.883 --> 07:50:07.980
you mentioned before, the 
biggest challenge 

07:50:15.959 --> 07:50:18.830
for us was size, so we did it as
I mentioned before, we needed to

07:50:18.831 --> 07:50:20.831
change 

07:50:23.305 --> 07:50:25.305
the way we are doing animations,
because 

07:50:30.428 --> 07:50:32.676
what we were using at the time, 
the what it was producing, they 

07:50:32.677 --> 07:50:34.677
were bigger and 

07:50:36.851 --> 07:50:39.399
they were also taking up a lot 
of memory in the game.

07:50:48.469 --> 07:50:50.598
And after that, we also needed 
to, like, refactor certain parts

07:50:50.599 --> 07:50:56.922
of the Code to be able to only 
use the scene of the gameplay.  

07:50:56.923 --> 07:50:58.963
I think those were the two 
biggest challenges that we 

07:50:58.964 --> 07:51:00.964
needed to make, but 

07:51:05.024 --> 07:51:07.024
in the end, we ended up with

07:51:09.213 --> 07:51:11.213
a more modernized application, 
and we 

07:51:13.076 --> 07:51:15.076
were able to benefit from that 
in a technical way, also.

07:51:20.979 --> 07:51:22.979
So it was a win-win for us.
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  Excellent.

07:51:28.470 --> 07:51:32.736
And so looking forward, overall,
what kind of developments do you

07:51:28.470 --> 07:51:30.470
see emerging 

07:51:32.500 --> 07:51:34.500
in the instant gaming space in 
the coming years?

07:51:36.386 --> 07:51:36.480
You can go as far as in the 
future as you would like but 

07:51:36.481 --> 07:51:38.481
love to hear your thoughts on 
how you see the whole space 

07:51:39.441 --> 07:51:43.106
evolving.
&gt;&gt; MARCELO FERREIRO:  I think 

07:51:43.107 --> 07:51:45.107
that this 

07:51:50.529 --> 07:51:52.529
is going to be like probably

07:51:57.330 --> 07:52:00.224
I want to say the future of 
acquisition.  Also the social 

07:52:00.225 --> 07:52:02.225
part of being able to 

07:52:03.293 --> 07:52:07.806
share a link and start playing 
right away.  That's probably 

07:52:07.807 --> 07:52:10.043
going to be the future apps that
we're going to see, and of 

07:52:12.288 --> 07:52:13.731
course, we're going to benefit 
from  that.

07:52:13.732 --> 07:52:16.374
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  Awesome.
&gt;&gt; OLILVIA YU:  I think as you 

07:52:16.375 --> 07:52:20.266
mentioned especially with new 
famous coming so there's also a 

07:52:20.267 --> 07:52:22.267
way, you know, to also 

07:52:23.335 --> 07:52:24.791
fully leverage the  
pre-registration on Google Play 

07:52:24.792 --> 07:52:27.238
so players can actually try the 
game before they pre-register 

07:52:27.239 --> 07:52:31.306
and actually install it so I 
think that's another way and 

07:52:31.307 --> 07:52:33.955
then depending on where you are 
in the stage for your game, 

07:52:36.411 --> 07:52:38.411
there could be different instant
games experiences.

07:52:39.128 --> 07:52:41.128
&gt;&gt; KYLE RUSHTON:  I'm really 
excited to 

07:52:43.003 --> 07:52:45.656
see what the creativity of game 
developers will bring to Google 

07:52:45.657 --> 07:52:48.117
Instant and I think there will 
be some breakout 

07:52:52.798 --> 07:52:55.721
mechanic built on top of Google 
Play Instant that to date would 

07:52:57.152 --> 07:52:59.202
not be possible so I think once 
you think about it from a design

07:52:59.203 --> 07:53:03.873
perspective and what you can 
bring once there's no friction 

07:53:03.874 --> 07:53:06.514
between a current user and 
potential users or re-activated 

07:53:06.515 --> 07:53:09.359
user you'll be able to build new
mechanics on 

07:53:14.819 --> 07:53:17.349
top of that that are breakouout.
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  We now 

07:53:17.350 --> 07:53:19.797
have about 10 minutes left which
means we could do 

07:53:24.265 --> 07:53:27.121
some Q&amp;A, if you in the audience
are excited about that.  I'm 

07:53:27.122 --> 07:53:29.585
sure we would love to answer 
your questions.

07:53:32.036 --> 07:53:34.036
See if that mic works.

07:53:35.700 --> 07:53:38.960
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Chris, I'm from Hong 
Kong.  We're a game publisher.  

07:53:38.961 --> 07:53:40.961
I'm just  wondering, I think 
kale 

07:53:42.050 --> 07:53:44.050
mentioned about re-- Kyle 
mentioned 

07:53:45.508 --> 07:53:47.508
about engagement I was wondering
if you 

07:53:49.825 --> 07:53:51.825
did a different experience with 
users from organic  users.

07:53:53.513 --> 07:53:54.731
&gt;&gt; KYLE RUSHTON:  Yeah so to 
date we haven't specifically 

07:53:54.732 --> 07:53:58.788
tried a use case related to 
re-engagement but if we were we 

07:53:58.789 --> 07:54:01.032
would design a new experience 
for that so if we were releasing

07:54:01.033 --> 07:54:03.033
a new 

07:54:04.275 --> 07:54:05.521
feature we could put the content
with that feature into Google 

07:54:05.522 --> 07:54:09.587
Play Instant and introduce that 
to a consumer through instant 

07:54:09.588 --> 07:54:11.588
but I definitely think for us, 

07:54:12.914 --> 07:54:14.914
when looking at install 
optimization 

07:54:16.574 --> 07:54:18.209
that wouldn't be the appropriate
experience we're trying to bring

07:54:18.210 --> 07:54:22.694
back someone accustomed to 
playing the game.  We haven't 

07:54:22.695 --> 07:54:24.695
tried that to date but it's 
something we're considering.

07:54:28.209 --> 07:54:30.056
&gt;&gt; So you're more for Ben as 
well you're able to distinguish 

07:54:30.057 --> 07:54:32.496
the engaged users coming back 
versus new users, right?

07:54:33.517 --> 07:54:36.169
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  There's a 
couple of different ways I 

07:54:36.170 --> 07:54:38.170
imagine this working 

07:54:39.458 --> 07:54:40.676
but in one scenario it's about 
how you target your users, 

07:54:40.677 --> 07:54:42.677
right?

07:54:43.732 --> 07:54:45.367
If you have existing channels to
reach people that are already 

07:54:45.368 --> 07:54:47.368
playing your 

07:54:49.077 --> 07:54:51.077
game, then you could have some 
certainty 

07:54:52.562 --> 07:54:55.453
that it's going to be the 
already playing your game type 

07:54:55.454 --> 07:54:58.367
of user that you're exposing to 
the instant experience.

07:55:01.045 --> 07:55:03.745
And if you're -- the Try Now 
button on the Store is a good 

07:55:03.746 --> 07:55:05.979
fit for new users in many cases,
right?  So I think that you can 

07:55:05.980 --> 07:55:07.980
handle the 

07:55:09.240 --> 07:55:11.887
targeting on the basis of how 
you identify your users, and 

07:55:11.888 --> 07:55:14.561
look to see how you can get the 
instant experience in front of 

07:55:14.562 --> 07:55:16.822
them.
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

07:55:23.335 --> 07:55:25.335
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  We've got 
some more people coming up here?

07:55:25.773 --> 07:55:28.632
&gt;&gt; KYLE RUSHTON:  I would add to
that, ultimately any channel 

07:55:28.633 --> 07:55:30.633
you're currently using for 
marketing for the most part 

07:55:32.517 --> 07:55:34.393
could be used in a use case for,
I believe we mentioned, for 

07:55:34.394 --> 07:55:39.080
cross promotion and as was just 
noted but the targeting would 

07:55:39.081 --> 07:55:42.749
come from the developer 
themselves.

07:55:42.954 --> 07:55:44.954
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  Excellent.
&gt;&gt; Can I do one?

07:55:45.193 --> 07:55:47.193
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  Go for it.

07:55:48.450 --> 07:55:50.450
&gt;&gt; As a developer, I have a 
design question.

07:55:53.145 --> 07:55:56.020
I'm curious, in your experience 
of instant apps so far, did you 

07:55:56.021 --> 07:55:58.021
find that 

07:56:00.155 --> 07:56:01.985
you had to design a custom pitui
for the instant app to get users

07:56:01.986 --> 07:56:05.036
so they could play it really 
quickly?  Because you obviously 

07:56:05.037 --> 07:56:07.689
have limited time to teach them 
controls.

07:56:09.322 --> 07:56:12.192
&gt;&gt; BENJAMIN FRENKEL:  The 
question is whether or not we, 

07:56:12.193 --> 07:56:14.193
or you, had to build 

07:56:17.488 --> 07:56:18.111
a custom Ptui for your instant 
speans.

07:56:18.112 --> 07:56:20.555
&gt;&gt; KYLE RUSHTON:  The short 
answer is we did not.  In the 

07:56:20.556 --> 07:56:22.187
case of solitaire we benefited 
from people understanding how to

07:56:22.188 --> 07:56:26.684
play solitaire.  But for words 
with friends 2, the experience 

07:56:26.685 --> 07:56:28.685
we drop users into which was 

07:56:30.370 --> 07:56:31.985
a solo series was we felt 
self-explanatory enough where a 

07:56:31.986 --> 07:56:33.986
user 

07:56:37.880 --> 07:56:39.880
could just pick it up off the 
bat, as we 

07:56:42.414 --> 07:56:44.414
didn't have a custom PTUI for 
our 

07:56:45.903 --> 07:56:49.236
instant experience.
&gt;&gt; OLILVIA YU:  Same for Candy 

07:56:45.903 --> 07:56:47.903
Crush.
