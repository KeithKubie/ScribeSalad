00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.290
Let's continue with the GMAT
problems. We're on problem 16

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.240
on page 279.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.780
Problem 16.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.030
Is x greater than 1.8?

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.650
That's all they're asking us.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.290
And statement one says,
x is greater than 1.7.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.850
Well that doesn't help us
because I don't know, x could

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.560
be 1.71, in which case this
wouldn't be true.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.240
Or x could be a million, in
which case this is true.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.630
So this isn't really
that helpful.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.830
We immediately see that.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.020
Statement two says that
x is greater than 1.9.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.680
Well, if you're greater than
1.9, you're definitely

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.720
greater than 1.8.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.720
So this is all we need,
statement number two.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.450
So b.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.270
Problem 17.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.210
Problem 17.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.610
If n is an integer,
is n plus 1 odd?

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.450
Well if n plus 1 is odd, that's
the same thing as

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.190
asking, is n even?

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.800
And I haven't looked at the
statements yet, but that's

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.710
just something your brain might
automatically connect.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.130
And let's see.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.820
What do they tell us?

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.030
Statement one tells us that
n plus 2 is even.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.270
Well if n plus 2 is even, then
n is definitely even.

00:01:21.992 --> 00:01:26.520
If you don't believe me, think
about the number 4.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.370
4 is even, and 4 plus 2 is
6, which is still even.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.790
Right?

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.110
Because if you add 1, you're
going to go from even to odd.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.660
You add 2, you go back
to even, right?

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.990
So this is all we need.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.220
If n plus 2 is even, then we
know that n is even, and n

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.000
plus 1 is odd.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.390
And you could try it out
with numbers if you

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.490
don't believe me.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.170
Two.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.070
What is statement two?

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.590
n minus 1 is odd.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.170
Well this is the same thing.
n minus 1 is odd.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.410
Once again this tells us that
n has to be an even number.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.200
If you subtract 1 from it and
you get an odd number, then it

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.830
has to be even.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.590
If you say that n is
4, 4 minus 1 is 3.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.780
And try it for any
even number.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.680
I don't want to over-explain
with a fairly simple problem.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.320
So anyway, the answer is either
of them alone are

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.900
sufficient, D.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.260
And try it out with numbers
if you don't believe me.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.820
Problem 18.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.675
Is x between 1 and 2?

00:02:25.675 --> 00:02:26.950
Is essentially what
they're saying.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.060
It can't be 1 or 2, because
these aren't equal signs,

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.670
they're less than signs.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.120
OK.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.240
So that's what they're asking.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.240
Statement one tells us that x is
essentially greater than 0.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.512
They wrote it a little
different, they said 0

00:02:40.512 --> 00:02:41.770
is less than x.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.110
So x is greater than 0.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.420
That doesn't help us. x
could still be 0.1 It

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.580
could be still be 1/2.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.960
So that doesn't tell us where
it is in this range.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.060
It could also be 100, in which
case it's out of this range.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.390
Statement two tells us that
x is less than 3.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.960
So this alone doesn't help us.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.410
x could still be 2.1.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.640
Or x could still be
minus a million.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.380
This doesn't help us.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.760
And even if we took them
together, that would just tell

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.330
us that 0 is less than x,
which is less than 3.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.960
Which is a superset
of this, right?

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.910
If we know that x is in this
range, it doesn't tell us that

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.150
x is definitely in this range.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.330
For example, if we know this
is true, x could still be

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.140
equal to 1/2.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.420
But 1/2 isn't in this range.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.540
x could be equal to 1.5,
which is in the range.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.500
Or x could be equal to 2.5,
which isn't in the range.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.440
So both of these, even taken
together, are not sufficient.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.350
So the answer is e.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.310
Problem 19.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.040
These are going fast. Maybe too
fast. Let me know if I'm

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.440
going too fast. OK.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.160
Water is pumped into a partially
filled tank at a

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.800
constant rate through
an inlet pipe.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.030
At the same time, water is
pumped out of the tank at a

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.190
constant rate through
an outlet pipe.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.010
OK.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.570
So essentially we have a tank.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.240
There's a pipe here.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.079
So water is going in at, x-- we
could say, I don't know--

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.890
meters cubed per second or--
units shouldn't matter.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.490
And it's getting pumped out at
y meters cubed per second.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.960
At what rate in gallons per
minute-- OK, so these aren't

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.020
meters cubed per second, these
are gallons per minute-- at

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.060
what rate in gallons per minute
is the amount of water

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.120
in the tank increasing?

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.770
So in order for the water to be
increasing, more has to be

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.600
coming in than going out.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.540
And the rate of it is going
to be the difference.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.260
So essentially they just want to
know what x minus y gallons

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.570
per minute are.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.650
If x is less than y, and we get
a negative number here,

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.900
then actually we have more
coming out than going in.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.130
And so the water isn't
increasing.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.360
So anyway, they tell us that,
one, the amount of water

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.190
initially in the tank
is 200 gallons.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.740
That's useless.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.740
Why is that useless?

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.130
Because it just tells us how
much water is in the tank.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.770
It doesn't tell us anything
about the

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.200
rates going in or out.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.000
So that's useless.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.250
Two.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.990
Water is pumped into the
tank at a rate of

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.010
10 gallons per minute.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.510
So x is equal to 10 gallons
per minute.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.160
That's the rate you're
pumping into it.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.250
And out of the tank
at a rate of 10

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.610
gallons every 2 1/2 minutes.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:42.980
So y is equal to 10 gallons
per 2.5 minutes.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.540
Which is equal to what?

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.290
That's 4 gallons per minute.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.775
So that second statement, that
second part of statement two

00:05:53.775 --> 00:05:55.710
is a little bit shady,
but you get a y.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.500
It's 4 gallons per minute.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.650
So you actually don't
have to figure it.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.990
But if you wanted to, you could
say that the rate at

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.200
which water is increasing is--
the rate at which it's coming

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.670
in at 10, minus the rate
it's going out.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.450
So 6 gallons per minute
is actually the

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.260
answer to the question.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.160
But all you have to know is that
you just needed statement

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.200
two, which gives us this
information to figure it out.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.230
And statement one was useless.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.560
So that's b, statement two
alone is sufficient.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.130
Let's do another one.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.170
OK.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.760
So we have problem number 20.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.010
Is x negative?

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.900
OK.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:43.100
The first statement, they
tell us that 9x is

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.410
greater than 10x.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.460
So this is an interesting
situation.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.420
So let's try to solve
this equation.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.950
Let's subtract 10x from both
sides of this equation.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.260
And if you're adding or
subtracting on both sides of

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.110
an equation or inequality, the
inequality stays the same.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.330
So let's subtract 10x from
both sides of this.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:13.110
So you get 9x minus 10x is
greater than 10 minus 10x.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:18.250
And then you get minus
x is greater than 0.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.690
Or you can multiply both
sides by negative 1.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.620
And when you multiply or divide
by a negative number

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.360
with an inequality, you
switch the inequality.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.570
x is less than 0, so we know
that x is definitely negative.

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:30.870
The other way you could have
done it, you could have

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.070
subtracted 9x from both sides,
and you would have gotten 0 is

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.990
greater than x.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.210
Which is a faster
way of doing it.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.080
But either way, statement one
lets us know that x is

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.670
definitely negative.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.880
Let's see what statement
two does for us.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.320
Statement two.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.140
x plus 3 is positive.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.640
Well I mean, x could be 100.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.390
If x is 100, then 103 is
definitely positive.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.340
Or x could be negative
1, right?

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.720
Because negative 1 plus
3 is positive 2.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.610
So this doesn't tell us
any information about

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:09.730
whether x is negative.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.250
So this is useless.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:12.370
So the answer is a.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.330
Statement one alone
is sufficient.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.000
Statement two alone
is useless.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.510
Let's see how much time I have.
I'm doing well on time.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:27.430
I'm on problem 21.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:33.590
Does 2m minus 3n equal 0?

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.960
And let's just think
about this.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.000
That's the same thing as asking,
does 2m equal 3n?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.930
If you just add 3n into
both sides, these

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:46.980
are equivalent questions.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.260
If you can answer one, you
can answer the other.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:58.880
So statement one says,
m does not equal 0.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.950
Well that seems fairly
useless to me.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:04.990
I mean, m does not equal 0, so
m is still-- I could pick a

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:09.800
random m, not equal to 0, and
depending on what n is, this

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.950
may or may not be true.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.300
So far that seems kind of
useless for me, but maybe it's

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.900
useful in conjunction
with two.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.350
The next thing they say,
6m is equal to 9n.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.810
This one's interesting.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.450
So what does this tell us?

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:34.500
So 6m is equal to 9n.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:40.660
So let's divide both
sides by 3.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.210
We get 2m is equal to 3n.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.630
And then we can subtract
3n from both sides.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:50.600
And you get 2m minus
3n is equal to 0.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.150
So statement two-- I mean, you
essentially just do a little

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.440
bit of algebra, and you get what
we're trying to prove.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.330
So statement two is good.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.230
Statement one, do we
need it at all?

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.800
Well no, because-- I mean, that
is one solution, that if

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.130
m and n are both equal to 0,
that this thing is true.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.390
But it doesn't really
do as much in the

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.110
way of anything else.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.680
And we don't need it, to
come up with this.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.720
So the answer is b.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.250
Statement two alone
is sufficient.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.750
I'm already past 10 minutes.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:20.320
So that's it.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.980
I'll do 22 in the next video.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.350
See you soon.
