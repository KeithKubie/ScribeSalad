you an API and we will see how we can

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700
you an API and we will see how we can
 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.819

move to the next slide right so like I

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599
move to the next slide right so like I
 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.449
move to the next slide right so like I
said monkey runner provides an API for

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459
said monkey runner provides an API for
 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.479
said monkey runner provides an API for
interfacing with devices what this means

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489
interfacing with devices what this means
 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.220
interfacing with devices what this means
is that you can connect two different

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230
is that you can connect two different
 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.039
is that you can connect two different
devices or emulators available attached

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049
devices or emulators available attached
 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.309
devices or emulators available attached
to your system and you can basically

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319
to your system and you can basically
 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.890
to your system and you can basically
send commands and inputs and we'll see a

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900
send commands and inputs and we'll see a
 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.869
send commands and inputs and we'll see a
detail what we can do so it uses jython

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879
detail what we can do so it uses jython
 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.550
detail what we can do so it uses jython
which is an implementation of Python

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560
which is an implementation of Python
 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.160
which is an implementation of Python
that uses Java programming language so

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170
that uses Java programming language so
 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.589
that uses Java programming language so
it's a there are multiple options unable

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599
it's a there are multiple options unable
 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.869
it's a there are multiple options unable
to you in all you want to run your

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879
to you in all you want to run your
 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.729
to you in all you want to run your
script you can go to an interactive

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739
script you can go to an interactive
 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.020
script you can go to an interactive
session or you can actually write a

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030
session or you can actually write a
 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.929
session or you can actually write a
complete script and run it to the two

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:12.939
complete script and run it to the two
 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:15.539
complete script and run it to the two
that we provide so also it's important

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549
that we provide so also it's important
 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.160
that we provide so also it's important
to note that the code runs on a

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170
to note that the code runs on a
 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.809
to note that the code runs on a
different device that it's it's running

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819
different device that it's it's running
 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.580
different device that it's it's running
on your workstation where you have the

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590
on your workstation where you have the
 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.970
on your workstation where you have the
SDK and while running on your machine it

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980
SDK and while running on your machine it
 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.819
SDK and while running on your machine it
controls the attached devices so it's

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829
controls the attached devices so it's
 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:27.900
controls the attached devices so it's
not actually running on the Android

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910
not actually running on the Android
 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.129
not actually running on the Android
device next thing is let's look at some

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139
device next thing is let's look at some
 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.710
device next thing is let's look at some
of the capabilities of monkey alert so

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720
of the capabilities of monkey alert so
 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.390
of the capabilities of monkey alert so
like I said first it allows you to

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400
like I said first it allows you to
 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.430
like I said first it allows you to
connect multiple devices not just one

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440
connect multiple devices not just one
 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.479
connect multiple devices not just one
you can actually connect multiple

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489
you can actually connect multiple
 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.569
you can actually connect multiple
devices it can launch application and

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579
devices it can launch application and
 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.819
devices it can launch application and
activities it has api's to help you do

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829
activities it has api's to help you do
 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.580
activities it has api's to help you do
that to send start activity and send

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590
that to send start activity and send
 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.159
that to send start activity and send
podcast events you can also send touch

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169
podcast events you can also send touch
 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.530
podcast events you can also send touch
events and keystrokes which means you

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540
events and keystrokes which means you
 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.930
events and keystrokes which means you
can provide input to your running

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940
can provide input to your running
 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.719
can provide input to your running
applications sort of a remote way to do

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.490
can script the above operations in a
sequence of commands so you can just say

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500
sequence of commands so you can just say
 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.159
sequence of commands so you can just say
do this and then sleep for some time and

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169
do this and then sleep for some time and
 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:16.229
do this and then sleep for some time and
then watch the activity sleep again and

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239
then watch the activity sleep again and
 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.819
then watch the activity sleep again and
so you can write a complete script and

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829
so you can write a complete script and
 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.350
so you can write a complete script and
run it okay so let's move to the next

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360
run it okay so let's move to the next
 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.000
run it okay so let's move to the next

capabilities let's see what monkey
 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.060
capabilities let's see what monkey
learner can do or so basically there are

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070
learner can do or so basically there are
 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.140
learner can do or so basically there are
there are two ways you can perform

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150
there are two ways you can perform
 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.670
there are two ways you can perform
testing on your applications using

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680
testing on your applications using
 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.660
testing on your applications using
monkey learnin

the first one is a functional testing

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950
the first one is a functional testing
 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.540
the first one is a functional testing
and like I said you can write a scrip so

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550
and like I said you can write a scrip so
 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.400
and like I said you can write a scrip so
it gives me a fully automated test

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410
it gives me a fully automated test
 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.590
it gives me a fully automated test
procedure where you can perform an

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600
procedure where you can perform an
 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.070
procedure where you can perform an
end-to-end test on your application you

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080
end-to-end test on your application you
 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.440
end-to-end test on your application you
can also execute use cases which are

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450
can also execute use cases which are
 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.500
can also execute use cases which are
interactive with input events

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510
interactive with input events
 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.210
interactive with input events
the second thing can allow you to do is

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220
the second thing can allow you to do is
 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.760
the second thing can allow you to do is
do a regression testing so I mentioned

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770
do a regression testing so I mentioned
 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.950
do a regression testing so I mentioned
that you can take screenshots from your

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960
that you can take screenshots from your
 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.830
that you can take screenshots from your
application using monkey runner so what

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840
application using monkey runner so what
 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.660
application using monkey runner so what
we can do is once you have a good build

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:09.670
we can do is once you have a good build
 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.550
we can do is once you have a good build
and you've done functional testing with

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560
and you've done functional testing with
 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.920
and you've done functional testing with
a good bill you can compare this with

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930
a good bill you can compare this with
 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.660
a good bill you can compare this with
your daily bill by taking screenshots

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670
your daily bill by taking screenshots
 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.910
your daily bill by taking screenshots
and comparing the screenshots to see if

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920
and comparing the screenshots to see if
 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:24.540

our build using or pin system and then

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.360
our build using or pin system and then
 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.689
our build using or pin system and then
we have an apk that we watch the multi

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:24.699
we have an apk that we watch the multi
 

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:27.779
we have an apk that we watch the multi
and ask where to install the apk package

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:27.789
and ask where to install the apk package
 

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:30.239
and ask where to install the apk package
onto the device and like I said you can

00:07:30.239 --> 00:07:30.249
onto the device and like I said you can
 

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:32.069
onto the device and like I said you can
have multiple devices and not just one

00:07:32.069 --> 00:07:32.079
have multiple devices and not just one
 

00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:33.749

device if you are testing different

00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759
device if you are testing different
 

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:35.909
device if you are testing different
configurations you can actually do this

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919
configurations you can actually do this
 

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:40.109
configurations you can actually do this
for multiple devices so you you do a

00:07:40.109 --> 00:07:40.119
for multiple devices so you you do a
 

00:07:40.119 --> 00:07:42.659
for multiple devices so you you do a
call through install package onto the

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:42.669
call through install package onto the
 

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:45.599
call through install package onto the
device giving the part to your full apk

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:45.609
device giving the part to your full apk
 

00:07:45.609 --> 00:07:49.739
device giving the part to your full apk
and this will help you store the package

00:07:49.739 --> 00:07:49.749
and this will help you store the package
 

00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:53.639
and this will help you store the package
on to the device and once you install

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:53.649
on to the device and once you install
 

00:07:53.649 --> 00:07:55.319
on to the device and once you install
the packages what you want to do is

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:55.329
the packages what you want to do is
 

00:07:55.329 --> 00:07:57.119
the packages what you want to do is
probably launch your main activity and

00:07:57.119 --> 00:07:57.129
probably launch your main activity and
 

00:07:57.129 --> 00:07:59.850
probably launch your main activity and
all that is available the API here is

00:07:59.850 --> 00:07:59.860
all that is available the API here is
 

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.829
all that is available the API here is
start activity and you pass the

component which is your which comprises
of your package name and the main

00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:05.769
of your package name and the main
 

00:08:05.769 --> 00:08:13.109
of your package name and the main
activity so putting it all together you

00:08:13.109 --> 00:08:13.119
activity so putting it all together you
 

00:08:13.119 --> 00:08:15.839
activity so putting it all together you
can see how it goes this is a small

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:15.849
can see how it goes this is a small
 

00:08:15.849 --> 00:08:18.059
can see how it goes this is a small
strip that's actually importing some of

00:08:18.059 --> 00:08:18.069
strip that's actually importing some of
 

00:08:18.069 --> 00:08:20.129
strip that's actually importing some of
the modules that we talked about there's

00:08:20.129 --> 00:08:20.139
the modules that we talked about there's
 

00:08:20.139 --> 00:08:21.779
the modules that we talked about there's
a monkey runner there's a monkey device

00:08:21.779 --> 00:08:21.789
a monkey runner there's a monkey device
 

00:08:21.789 --> 00:08:24.389
a monkey runner there's a monkey device
and a time module to install to to

00:08:24.389 --> 00:08:24.399
and a time module to install to to
 

00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:26.729
and a time module to install to to
basically allow the device to sleep for

00:08:26.729 --> 00:08:26.739
basically allow the device to sleep for
 

00:08:26.739 --> 00:08:28.829
basically allow the device to sleep for
some time so that if you are installing

00:08:28.829 --> 00:08:28.839
some time so that if you are installing
 

00:08:28.839 --> 00:08:30.479
some time so that if you are installing
the device and it's going to take like

00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:30.489
the device and it's going to take like
 

00:08:30.489 --> 00:08:32.730
the device and it's going to take like
five ten seconds to install the APK onto

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:32.740
five ten seconds to install the APK onto
 

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.619
five ten seconds to install the APK onto
the device you wanna do a sleep

00:08:34.619 --> 00:08:34.629
the device you wanna do a sleep
 

00:08:34.629 --> 00:08:36.119
the device you wanna do a sleep
meanwhile before you execute the mix

00:08:36.119 --> 00:08:36.129
meanwhile before you execute the mix
 

00:08:36.129 --> 00:08:39.059
meanwhile before you execute the mix
come on so this is the this is the

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:39.069
come on so this is the this is the
 

00:08:39.069 --> 00:08:41.999
come on so this is the this is the
module to help us with that so as you

00:08:41.999 --> 00:08:42.009
module to help us with that so as you
 

00:08:42.009 --> 00:08:44.869
module to help us with that so as you
can see the first car there was monkey

00:08:44.869 --> 00:08:44.879
can see the first car there was monkey
 

00:08:44.879 --> 00:08:47.689
can see the first car there was monkey
monkey runner dog bed for connection and

00:08:47.689 --> 00:08:47.699
monkey runner dog bed for connection and
 

00:08:47.699 --> 00:08:50.280
monkey runner dog bed for connection and
yeah the teeth the three things that we

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:50.290
yeah the teeth the three things that we
 

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:51.689
yeah the teeth the three things that we
just discuss on how you wanna begin

00:08:51.689 --> 00:08:51.699
just discuss on how you wanna begin
 

00:08:51.699 --> 00:08:56.020
just discuss on how you wanna begin
testing alright so what

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:56.030
testing alright so what
 

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:57.790
testing alright so what
once you've installed the a begin we got

00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:57.800
once you've installed the a begin we got
 

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.640
once you've installed the a begin we got
your main activity on monkey Anna you

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:00.650
your main activity on monkey Anna you
 

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:02.260
your main activity on monkey Anna you
want to do is what you want to do is an

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:02.270
want to do is what you want to do is an
 

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.690
want to do is what you want to do is an
automated way we want to send some touch

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:04.700
automated way we want to send some touch
 

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.350
automated way we want to send some touch
inputs or type text or send input so

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:08.360
inputs or type text or send input so
 

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.500
inputs or type text or send input so
this can be done using a touch using a

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:11.510
this can be done using a touch using a
 

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.860
this can be done using a touch using a
touch API and when you send in x and

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:14.870
touch API and when you send in x and
 

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.630
touch API and when you send in x and
y-coordinate of where you want to

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640
y-coordinate of where you want to
 

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.400
y-coordinate of where you want to
generate the touch email and the type of

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:18.410
generate the touch email and the type of
 

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.680
generate the touch email and the type of
touch so for example this can be down

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:20.690
touch so for example this can be down
 

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.630
touch so for example this can be down
and up so this is a touch where you

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:22.640
and up so this is a touch where you
 

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.850
and up so this is a touch where you
press down and up and then there is a

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:24.860
press down and up and then there is a
 

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.240
press down and up and then there is a
type text which is which is basically

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:28.250
type text which is which is basically
 

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.670
type text which is which is basically
used if you have an input field on the

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:30.680
used if you have an input field on the
 

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.800
used if you have an input field on the
screen and you wanna put in some text in

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:32.810
screen and you wanna put in some text in
 

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.020
screen and you wanna put in some text in
an automated way so as you can see now

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:35.030
an automated way so as you can see now
 

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:37.180
an automated way so as you can see now
we can now we are executing our use

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:37.190
we can now we are executing our use
 

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:40.180
we can now we are executing our use
cases how we want to test our app using

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:40.190
cases how we want to test our app using
 

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:44.730
cases how we want to test our app using
some of the monkey mother in Korea api's

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:44.740
 

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.610
alright so so now we begin we've

alright so so now we begin we've
 

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.300
alright so so now we begin we've
installed our apk onto the device we've

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:51.310
installed our apk onto the device we've
 

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:54.070
installed our apk onto the device we've
we've launched our main activity and

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:54.080
we've launched our main activity and
 

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.380
we've launched our main activity and
we've sent some input commands and we're

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:56.390
we've sent some input commands and we're
 

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.540
we've sent some input commands and we're
going through our screens so at this

00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:58.550
going through our screens so at this
 

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:00.430
going through our screens so at this
point for functional testing what you

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:00.440
point for functional testing what you
 

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.620
point for functional testing what you
want to do is take a snapshot this is

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:02.630
want to do is take a snapshot this is
 

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.780
want to do is take a snapshot this is
basically it's gonna give you a

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:04.790
basically it's gonna give you a
 

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.480
basically it's gonna give you a
screenshot of the of watch on your

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:07.490
screenshot of the of watch on your
 

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.280

emulator and as an image and the object
 

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:13.930
emulator and as an image and the object
that's representing this is the monkey

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:13.940
that's representing this is the monkey
 

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.910
that's representing this is the monkey
image and you can write this to a file

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920
image and you can write this to a file
 

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.490
image and you can write this to a file
for if you want to do regression testing

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:18.500
for if you want to do regression testing
 

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.080
for if you want to do regression testing

doesn't aim regression testing so now we

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:42.950
doesn't aim regression testing so now we
 

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:44.500
doesn't aim regression testing so now we
going to look at the script altogether

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:44.510
going to look at the script altogether
 

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.080
going to look at the script altogether
so you see the complete script and this

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:47.090
so you see the complete script and this
 

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:49.090

developer website so if you go there and
 

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.040
developer website so if you go there and
look for tools and Marty are you gonna

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:54.050
look for tools and Marty are you gonna
 

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:55.810
look for tools and Marty are you gonna
see a lot of the API is and links and

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:55.820
see a lot of the API is and links and
 

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.730
see a lot of the API is and links and
documentation so this is a this is a

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:57.740
documentation so this is a this is a
 

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.600
documentation so this is a this is a
script from from the website and as you

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:01.610
script from from the website and as you
 

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.940
script from from the website and as you
can see this just puts together what

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:03.950
can see this just puts together what
 

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.280
can see this just puts together what
we've been doing so we install a package

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:06.290
we've been doing so we install a package
 

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:09.610
we've been doing so we install a package
we run the main activity and then

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:09.620
we run the main activity and then
 

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.760
we run the main activity and then
we start the activity we we send a key

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:12.770
we start the activity we we send a key
 

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.470
we start the activity we we send a key
code menu which is which is just

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480
code menu which is which is just
 

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.230
code menu which is which is just
pressing the menu button onto the device

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:17.240
pressing the menu button onto the device
 

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.090
pressing the menu button onto the device
and then we take a snapshot on how our

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:19.100
and then we take a snapshot on how our
 

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.040
and then we take a snapshot on how our
menu item looks on the screen and then

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:21.050
menu item looks on the screen and then
 

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:22.630
menu item looks on the screen and then
you just write the file to a disk so

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:22.640
you just write the file to a disk so
 

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.970
you just write the file to a disk so
over a simple script something you can

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:24.980
over a simple script something you can
 

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.400
over a simple script something you can
start with image you don't want to run a

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:27.410
start with image you don't want to run a
 

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.260
start with image you don't want to run a
script what you can do is just like I

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:29.270
script what you can do is just like I
 

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:30.940
script what you can do is just like I
said mentioned you can go to an

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:30.950
said mentioned you can go to an
 

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.220
said mentioned you can go to an
interactive shell and using the

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:33.230
interactive shell and using the
 

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:34.600
interactive shell and using the
interactive shell you can just start

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:34.610
interactive shell you can just start
 

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.670
interactive shell you can just start
typing device not touching forth here

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:36.680
typing device not touching forth here
 

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.530
typing device not touching forth here
and there figure out your buttons figure

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:38.540
and there figure out your buttons figure
 

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.720
and there figure out your buttons figure
out the X&amp;Y positions and then write a

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:40.730
out the X&amp;Y positions and then write a
 

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:45.540
out the X&amp;Y positions and then write a
complete script that can be controlled

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:45.550
 

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:50.140
so so these are what we discussed ways

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:50.150
so so these are what we discussed ways
 

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.480
so so these are what we discussed ways
of doing functional testing which is

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:52.490
of doing functional testing which is
 

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.180
of doing functional testing which is
executing your use cases remotely in a

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:55.190
executing your use cases remotely in a
 

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:58.570
executing your use cases remotely in a
in a automated way using scripts but

00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:58.580
in a automated way using scripts but
 

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.310
in a automated way using scripts but
there is more to monkey rather than

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:00.320
there is more to monkey rather than
 

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.670
there is more to monkey rather than
functional and regression testing so you

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680
functional and regression testing so you
 

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.530
functional and regression testing so you
can also extend the API by writing your

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:05.540
can also extend the API by writing your
 

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:09.190
can also extend the API by writing your
own plugins in Java language there are

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200
own plugins in Java language there are
 

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.620
own plugins in Java language there are
some utilities like device thought shell

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:11.630
some utilities like device thought shell
 

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.050
some utilities like device thought shell
it's a monkey run at a why you got shell

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:14.060
it's a monkey run at a why you got shell
 

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.540
it's a monkey run at a why you got shell
which thinks n80 become a sphere device

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:16.550
which thinks n80 become a sphere device
 

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:19.390
which thinks n80 become a sphere device
we can also use the standard Python sub

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:19.400
we can also use the standard Python sub
 

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.130
we can also use the standard Python sub
process and OS modules to launch

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:21.140
process and OS modules to launch
 

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.170
process and OS modules to launch
external programs and again like you

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:23.180
external programs and again like you
 

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.000
external programs and again like you
think launch ADB and send commands to

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:25.010
think launch ADB and send commands to
 

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:28.090
think launch ADB and send commands to
ADB using this uh process and OS modules

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:28.100
ADB using this uh process and OS modules
 

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:32.710
ADB using this uh process and OS modules
and again there is also a java api which

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.930
the X&amp;Y from the from the sample app
this swing app and then it sends the

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:04.940
this swing app and then it sends the
 

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.850
this swing app and then it sends the
same coordinates to generate attach on

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:06.860
same coordinates to generate attach on
