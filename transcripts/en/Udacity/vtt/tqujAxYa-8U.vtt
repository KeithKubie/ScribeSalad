00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.060
Now that we've enumerated our first four
states, let's use them for something.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.260
One of the challenges with sync adapters
is that they don't return status to

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.840
us when they complete.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.800
So we have to use another
mechanism to do that.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.520
Since these states occur before
we have a valid location.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.790
There's no proper way to store this
information in our existing database,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.570
which requires all of the location
fields to be filled out.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.330
The method we're going to use is to
have the sync adapters store the current

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.260
location status in a shared preference.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.640
This has some nice advantages.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.690
Namely, it persists after
closing the application.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.470
And we can register a listener to be
notified when the preference changes.
