00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:07.460
so today let's talk about animation

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470
so today let's talk about animation
 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.259
so today let's talk about animation
there was a lot of animation facilities

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269
there was a lot of animation facilities
 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.690
there was a lot of animation facilities
added in android 3.0 the honeycomb

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700
added in android 3.0 the honeycomb
 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.459
added in android 3.0 the honeycomb
release there's a whole animation

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469
release there's a whole animation
 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.799
release there's a whole animation
package and that's packaged in those

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809
package and that's packaged in those
 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.630
package and that's packaged in those
classes have been enhanced over time in

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640
classes have been enhanced over time in
 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.950
classes have been enhanced over time in
subsequent releases so we're going to

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960
subsequent releases so we're going to
 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.359
subsequent releases so we're going to
talk about some of the stuff that was

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369
talk about some of the stuff that was
 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.580
talk about some of the stuff that was
added in 3.0 as well as some stuff that

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590
added in 3.0 as well as some stuff that
 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.890
added in 3.0 as well as some stuff that
was added in Android 4.1 jelly bean in

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900
was added in Android 4.1 jelly bean in
 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.480
was added in Android 4.1 jelly bean in
particular we're going to talk about the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490
particular we're going to talk about the
 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.250
particular we're going to talk about the
layout transition class it's a little

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260
layout transition class it's a little
 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.870
layout transition class it's a little
known class it's actually used a lot

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880
known class it's actually used a lot
 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.669
known class it's actually used a lot
internally in some of the applications

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679
internally in some of the applications
 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.310
internally in some of the applications
that we ship on Android and it's

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320
that we ship on Android and it's
 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.720
that we ship on Android and it's
something that we created to make

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730
something that we created to make
 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.569
something that we created to make
animation much easier for you I like to

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579
animation much easier for you I like to
 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.369
animation much easier for you I like to
think about animation all the time but I

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379
think about animation all the time but I
 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.990
think about animation all the time but I
realize that maybe some other developers

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000
realize that maybe some other developers
 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.459
realize that maybe some other developers
don't so if we can make it easier and

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469
don't so if we can make it easier and
 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.350
don't so if we can make it easier and
easier for you to get animated

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360
easier for you to get animated
 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.880
easier for you to get animated
facilities within your application

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890
facilities within your application
 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.560
facilities within your application
without spending a great deal of time

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570
without spending a great deal of time
 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.630
without spending a great deal of time
and thought on it then that's a good

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640
and thought on it then that's a good
 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.049
and thought on it then that's a good
thing right

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059
thing right
 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.060
thing right
so let's talk about layout transition

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070
so let's talk about layout transition
 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.560
so let's talk about layout transition
first of all we'll start with the base

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570
first of all we'll start with the base
 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.330
first of all we'll start with the base
application that doesn't have animations

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340
application that doesn't have animations
 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.849
application that doesn't have animations
in it and let's look at the code here so

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859
in it and let's look at the code here so
 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.830
in it and let's look at the code here so
we have a simple class that I've created

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840
we have a simple class that I've created
 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.110
we have a simple class that I've created
it's a custom view that I call colored

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120
it's a custom view that I call colored
 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.960
it's a custom view that I call colored
view and it has two States it has an

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970
view and it has two States it has an
 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.690
view and it has two States it has an
expanded and a compressed state and when

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700
expanded and a compressed state and when
 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.670
expanded and a compressed state and when
it's first added into its container it's

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680
it's first added into its container it's
 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.870
it's first added into its container it's
in a compressed State and it's going to

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880
in a compressed State and it's going to
 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.960
in a compressed State and it's going to
be 50 pixels high and when it's expanded

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970
be 50 pixels high and when it's expanded
 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.450
be 50 pixels high and when it's expanded
it's going to be 200 pixels high and we

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460
it's going to be 200 pixels high and we
 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.190
it's going to be 200 pixels high and we
can simply change those layout brands so

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200
can simply change those layout brands so
 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.539
can simply change those layout brands so
that when we click on this thing it can

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549
that when we click on this thing it can
 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.240
that when we click on this thing it can
expand or it can contract and so we can

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250
expand or it can contract and so we can
 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.440
expand or it can contract and so we can
see we do something really interesting

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450
see we do something really interesting
 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.560
see we do something really interesting
here we basically randomized a color to

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570
here we basically randomized a color to
 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.810
here we basically randomized a color to
make it a colored view so that you can

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
make it a colored view so that you can
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.950
make it a colored view so that you can
actually tell what the bounds of the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960
actually tell what the bounds of the
 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.160
actually tell what the bounds of the
view are and then we allow you to click

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170
view are and then we allow you to click
 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.960
view are and then we allow you to click
on the view and expand it contract and

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970
on the view and expand it contract and
 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.370
on the view and expand it contract and
we can take a look at the demo over on

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380
we can take a look at the demo over on
 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.690
we can take a look at the demo over on
the screen to the right and see how this

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700
the screen to the right and see how this
 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.069
the screen to the right and see how this
works so we have two buttons up at the

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079
works so we have two buttons up at the
 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.940
works so we have two buttons up at the
top which adds new views of different

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950
top which adds new views of different
 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.359
top which adds new views of different
randomized colors or remove views in the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369
randomized colors or remove views in the
 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.980
randomized colors or remove views in the
container and if we click on one of

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990
container and if we click on one of
 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.080
container and if we click on one of
these views it will expand and contract

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090
these views it will expand and contract
 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.359
these views it will expand and contract
as we toggle the clicks back and forth

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369
as we toggle the clicks back and forth
 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.889
as we toggle the clicks back and forth
and we can see other activity logic up

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899
and we can see other activity logic up
 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.510
and we can see other activity logic up
here that does that we have an add

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520
here that does that we have an add
 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.130
here that does that we have an add
button and a remove button we have the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140
button and a remove button we have the
 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.770
button and a remove button we have the
container and we start out with two

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780
container and we start out with two
 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.389
container and we start out with two
views that we add to the container and

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399
views that we add to the container and
 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.750
views that we add to the container and
then when you click on the Add button

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760
then when you click on the Add button
 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.070
then when you click on the Add button
we add a view and when you click on the

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080
we add a view and when you click on the
 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.220
we add a view and when you click on the
remove button well we remove a view okay

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230
remove button well we remove a view okay
 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.010
remove button well we remove a view okay
not terribly interesting I don't think

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020
not terribly interesting I don't think
 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.480
not terribly interesting I don't think
I'd be doing this video if this was all

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490
I'd be doing this video if this was all
 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.400
I'd be doing this video if this was all
it was but now let's actually add some

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410
it was but now let's actually add some
 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.810
it was but now let's actually add some
animation you can notice that when we

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820
animation you can notice that when we
 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.520
animation you can notice that when we
add an item it just blinks into place

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530
add an item it just blinks into place
 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.710
add an item it just blinks into place
when we remove it it blinks out of place

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720
when we remove it it blinks out of place
 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.800
when we remove it it blinks out of place
and when we click it just automatically

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810
and when we click it just automatically
 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.710
and when we click it just automatically
expands or contracts that's not what I

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720
expands or contracts that's not what I
 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.740
expands or contracts that's not what I
would call a nice transition it's

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750
would call a nice transition it's
 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.630
would call a nice transition it's
certainly not a nice animation so what

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640
certainly not a nice animation so what
 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.500
certainly not a nice animation so what
can we do about that

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510
can we do about that
 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.530
can we do about that
well first thing we can do is add a

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540
well first thing we can do is add a
 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.080
well first thing we can do is add a
facility that was added in android 3.0

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090
facility that was added in android 3.0
 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.030
facility that was added in android 3.0
as I said before called layout

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040
as I said before called layout
 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.980
as I said before called layout
transition and there are a couple of

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990
transition and there are a couple of
 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.350
transition and there are a couple of
different ways to do this both of which

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360
different ways to do this both of which
 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.660
different ways to do this both of which
are simple but the easiest way is just

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670
are simple but the easiest way is just
 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.610
are simple but the easiest way is just
to tell the container where you want

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620
to tell the container where you want
 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.470
to tell the container where you want
animations to run automatically to

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480
animations to run automatically to
 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.110
animations to run automatically to
animate the layout changes so let's add

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120
animate the layout changes so let's add
 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.199
animate the layout changes so let's add
an attribute here that is Android

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209
an attribute here that is Android
 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.940
an attribute here that is Android
animate layout changes and we'll set it

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950
animate layout changes and we'll set it
 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.600
animate layout changes and we'll set it
to true we go ahead and save this we'll

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610
to true we go ahead and save this we'll
 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.830
to true we go ahead and save this we'll
run the application again

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840
 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.860
and watch over on the demo screen as it

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870
and watch over on the demo screen as it
 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.950
and watch over on the demo screen as it
comes up so starts out the same we add

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960
comes up so starts out the same we add
 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.630
comes up so starts out the same we add
an item you'll see we actually get

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640
an item you'll see we actually get
 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.250
an item you'll see we actually get
animated behavior just from that one

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260
animated behavior just from that one
 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.620
animated behavior just from that one
line of code in the XML file things

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630
line of code in the XML file things
 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.000
line of code in the XML file things
slide out of place to make room and then

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010
slide out of place to make room and then
 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.150
slide out of place to make room and then
fade in or fade out so you can see as we

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160
fade in or fade out so you can see as we
 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.610
fade in or fade out so you can see as we
add items everything around it moves out

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620
add items everything around it moves out
 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.170
add items everything around it moves out
of the way and then we fade the new item

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180
of the way and then we fade the new item
 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.990
of the way and then we fade the new item
in as we remove an item we fade out the

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000
in as we remove an item we fade out the
 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.700
in as we remove an item we fade out the
item and then everything moves around it

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:36.710
item and then everything moves around it
 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.250
item and then everything moves around it
to compress the space that was freed up

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260
to compress the space that was freed up
 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.860
to compress the space that was freed up
by the item going away but when we click

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870
by the item going away but when we click
 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.360
by the item going away but when we click
on the items to expand and contract

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370
on the items to expand and contract
 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.810
on the items to expand and contract
obviously those are not animating those

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820
obviously those are not animating those
 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.730
obviously those are not animating those
are just popping into their before and

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740
are just popping into their before and
 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.950
are just popping into their before and
after state this was the behavior as it

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960
after state this was the behavior as it
 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.810
after state this was the behavior as it
was in a honeycomb you could easily add

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820
was in a honeycomb you could easily add
 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.550
was in a honeycomb you could easily add
this one line of code in XML you could

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560
this one line of code in XML you could
 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.320
this one line of code in XML you could
add something very similar to set a

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330
add something very similar to set a
 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.090
add something very similar to set a
layout transition object on a container

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100
layout transition object on a container
 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.700
layout transition object on a container
if you wanted to do it in code instead

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710
if you wanted to do it in code instead
 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.980
if you wanted to do it in code instead
of the XML file so now we go to Android

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990
of the XML file so now we go to Android
 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.650
of the XML file so now we go to Android
4.1 jelly bean release and we've got a

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660
4.1 jelly bean release and we've got a
 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.600
4.1 jelly bean release and we've got a
new facility in there that allows you to

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610
new facility in there that allows you to
 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.020
new facility in there that allows you to
actually animate more so let's see how

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030
actually animate more so let's see how
 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.420
actually animate more so let's see how
that works so if we come down to the end

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430
that works so if we come down to the end
 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.240
that works so if we come down to the end
of our on create method and we actually

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250
of our on create method and we actually
 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.770
of our on create method and we actually
get a reference to the layout transition

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780
get a reference to the layout transition
 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.370
get a reference to the layout transition
object that we created so we can say

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380
object that we created so we can say
 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.990
object that we created so we can say
layout transition

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000
 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.970
equals container get layout transition

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980
 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.960
okay we know there's one on there

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970
okay we know there's one on there
 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.370
okay we know there's one on there
because we set it in the resource file

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380
because we set it in the resource file
 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.680
because we set it in the resource file
but and similarly we could have set this

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690
but and similarly we could have set this
 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.200
but and similarly we could have set this
in encode instead instead of the

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210
in encode instead instead of the
 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.120
in encode instead instead of the
resource file anyway we know that

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130
resource file anyway we know that
 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.530
resource file anyway we know that
there's a transition there and we can

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540
there's a transition there and we can
 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.680
there's a transition there and we can
say transition dot enable transition

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690
say transition dot enable transition
 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:04.400
say transition dot enable transition
type layout transition dot change in so

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410
type layout transition dot change in so
 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.680
type layout transition dot change in so
there's a new type of transition that

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690
there's a new type of transition that
 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.120
there's a new type of transition that
we're going to take advantage of in this

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130
we're going to take advantage of in this
 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.780
we're going to take advantage of in this
release now if we run this file again

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790
release now if we run this file again
 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.900
release now if we run this file again
down pops up off the hand a demo screen

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910
down pops up off the hand a demo screen
 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.400
down pops up off the hand a demo screen
and now let's see what it's like so as

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410
and now let's see what it's like so as
 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.350
and now let's see what it's like so as
before when we add items we get a nice

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360
before when we add items we get a nice
 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.570
before when we add items we get a nice
animated behavior when we remove them we

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580
animated behavior when we remove them we
 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.310
animated behavior when we remove them we
get a nice animated behavior and we

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320
get a nice animated behavior and we
 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.930
get a nice animated behavior and we
would click on them we also get an

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940
would click on them we also get an
 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.940
would click on them we also get an
animated behavior so what we've told the

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950
animated behavior so what we've told the
 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.860
animated behavior so what we've told the
layout transition object is to animate

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870
layout transition object is to animate
 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.350
layout transition object is to animate
not only the default animations that it

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360
not only the default animations that it
 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.450
not only the default animations that it
knows about when items go away or come

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460
knows about when items go away or come
 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.090
knows about when items go away or come
into being but also when anything in the

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100
into being but also when anything in the
 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.730
into being but also when anything in the
container changes the layout so anything

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740
container changes the layout so anything
 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.409
container changes the layout so anything
that happens that causes a layout on the

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419
that happens that causes a layout on the
 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.540
that happens that causes a layout on the
container will make it look at all of

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550
container will make it look at all of
 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.250
container will make it look at all of
its items and say ok where are you now

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260
its items and say ok where are you now
 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.620
its items and say ok where are you now
and how big are you and where are you

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630
and how big are you and where are you
 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.030
and how big are you and where are you
and how big are you after the layout

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040
and how big are you after the layout
 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.280
and how big are you after the layout
runs and then it sets up animations

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290
runs and then it sets up animations
 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.230
runs and then it sets up animations
internally to animate those changes

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240
internally to animate those changes
 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.880
internally to animate those changes
basically animating the bounds of the

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890
basically animating the bounds of the
 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.450
basically animating the bounds of the
objects so kind of nifty and the best

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460
objects so kind of nifty and the best
 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.070
objects so kind of nifty and the best
part is this was what three lines of

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080
part is this was what three lines of
 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.960
part is this was what three lines of
code it's one line of code just to

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970
code it's one line of code just to
 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.460
code it's one line of code just to
enable the layout transition on a

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470
enable the layout transition on a
 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.500
enable the layout transition on a
container and then it's another couple

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510
container and then it's another couple
 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.420
container and then it's another couple
of lines of code or even effectively one

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430
of lines of code or even effectively one
 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.340
of lines of code or even effectively one
line of code to say oh I also want this

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350
line of code to say oh I also want this
 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.940
line of code to say oh I also want this
changing behavior now we change the we

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950
changing behavior now we change the we
 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.860
changing behavior now we change the we
added this facility in fourth I want to

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870
added this facility in fourth I want to
 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.390
added this facility in fourth I want to
allow this behavior but we did not

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400
allow this behavior but we did not
 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.159
allow this behavior but we did not
change the default behavior because it

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169
change the default behavior because it
 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:20.930
change the default behavior because it
could have been unexpected if people

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940
could have been unexpected if people
 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.180
could have been unexpected if people
were using layout transition already so

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190
were using layout transition already so
 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.880
were using layout transition already so
instead we added it as a facility that

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890
instead we added it as a facility that
 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.440
instead we added it as a facility that
you could add after the fact saying ok

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:27.450
you could add after the fact saying ok
 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.540
you could add after the fact saying ok
enable a layout transition and also

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550
enable a layout transition and also
 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.310
enable a layout transition and also
enable the changing capability on that

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320
enable the changing capability on that
 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.530
enable the changing capability on that
and one of the things to realize about

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:33.540
and one of the things to realize about
 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.090
and one of the things to realize about
layout transition is that these could

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.100
layout transition is that these could
 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.550
layout transition is that these could
also be custom animations you can check

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560
also be custom animations you can check
 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.230
also be custom animations you can check
this out in API demos if you'd like

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240
this out in API demos if you'd like
 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.380
this out in API demos if you'd like
there's some dem

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.390
there's some dem
 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.390
there's some dem
showing custom animations as well as the

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400
showing custom animations as well as the
 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.340
showing custom animations as well as the
default animations but the default ones

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:44.350
default animations but the default ones
 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.410
default animations but the default ones
basically give you kind of what would be

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:46.420
basically give you kind of what would be
 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.240
basically give you kind of what would be
expected which is when an item comes

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250
expected which is when an item comes
 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.460
expected which is when an item comes
into being we move everything out of the

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.470
into being we move everything out of the
 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.350
into being we move everything out of the
way then we fade it in and when it goes

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360
way then we fade it in and when it goes
 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.510
way then we fade it in and when it goes
away we fade the thing out and then we

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520
away we fade the thing out and then we
 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.950
away we fade the thing out and then we
move everything around if you want

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960
move everything around if you want
 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.940
move everything around if you want
something different than you can

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:56.950
something different than you can
 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.800
something different than you can
certainly create that so go ahead and

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:58.810
certainly create that so go ahead and
 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.110
certainly create that so go ahead and
check out layout transition and the 4.1

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120
