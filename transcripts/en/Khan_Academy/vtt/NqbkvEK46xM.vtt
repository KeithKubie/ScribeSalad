00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.950
A thermometer in a science
lab displays the temperature

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.730
in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.410
If the mercury in
the thermometer

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.880
rises to 56 degrees
Fahrenheit-- they're

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.110
giving us the
Fahrenheit temperature--

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.540
what is the corresponding
Celsius temperature?

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.704
And then they give
us the two formulas,

00:00:15.704 --> 00:00:17.370
that if we know the
Celsius temperature,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.382
how do we figure out the
Fahrenheit temperature,

00:00:19.382 --> 00:00:21.090
or if we know the
Fahrenheit temperature,

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.120
how do we figure out
the Celsius temperature.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.130
And these are actually
derived from each other,

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.338
and you'll learn more about
that when you do algebra.

00:00:27.338 --> 00:00:29.060
And we also-- maybe
in another video--

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.843
will explain how
to derive these.

00:00:30.843 --> 00:00:32.259
It's actually kind
of interesting,

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.530
involves a little
bit of algebra.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.750
But they gave us the formula.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.810
So they really just want us to
apply it, and maybe make sure

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.877
we understand which
one we should apply.

00:00:39.877 --> 00:00:41.960
Well, they're giving us
the Fahrenheit temperature

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.530
right here, so F is
going to be equal to 56.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.990
And they're asking us for
the Celsius temperature,

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.570
so we need to figure out what
the Celsius temperature is.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.570
Well, in this one over here,
if you know the Fahrenheit

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.260
temperature, then you can solve
for the Celsius temperature.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.360
So let's use this
right over here.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.880
So our Celsius
temperature is going

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.780
to be 5/9 times the Fahrenheit
temperature-- the Fahrenheit

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.578
temperature is 56 degrees
Fahrenheit-- minus 32.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.090
Well, 56 minus 32 is 24.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:23.490
So this is going to be
equal to 5/9 times 24.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.920
And this is the same thing
as 5 times 24, over 9.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.420
And before I even
multiply out 5 times 24,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.260
we can divide the numerator
and the denominator by 3.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.270
So let's do that.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.760
If we divide the numerator
by 3 and the denominator,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.190
we're not changing the value.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.850
24 divided by 3 is 8.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.440
9 divided by 3 is 3.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.880
So it becomes 5 times 8,
which is 40, over 3 degrees.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.921
And if we want to write
this as a number that

00:01:52.921 --> 00:01:55.170
makes a little bit more sense
in terms of temperature,

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.460
let's divide 3 into 40 to get
the number of degrees we have.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.060
3 goes into 4 one time.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.610
1 times 3 is 3.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.550
Subtract.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.120
4 minus 3 is 1.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.280
Bring down the 0.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.960
3 goes into 10 three times.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.810
3 times 3 is 9.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.880
Subtract.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.020
Get a 1.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.860
And then you could
bring down another 0.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.810
We now have a decimal
point over here.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.050
You're going to get a 0 here.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.150
3 goes into, once
again, 10 three times.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.980
And this 3 is going
to repeat forever.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.960
So you could view this--
this is equal to 13.333--

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.290
it'll just keep repeating.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.700
This little line on top means
repeating-- degrees Celsius.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.096
Or you could say that, look,
3 goes into 40 13 times

00:02:40.096 --> 00:02:42.910
with a remainder of 1.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.040
So you could say that this is
also equal to 13, remainder 1.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.600
So 13 and 1/3 degrees Celsius.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.740
Either way, it works.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.470
But that's our
Celsius temperature

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.520
when our Fahrenheit
temperature is 56 degrees.
