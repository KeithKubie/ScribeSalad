HENRY SHACKLETON: So
collaboration for me was great.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.930
My partner and I lived
on the same hall.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.805
We lived right down the
hall from each other.

00:00:10.805 --> 00:00:13.597
So we could very easily pop
over and talk to each other.

00:00:13.597 --> 00:00:14.930
One thing that I found helpful--

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.940
that we actually
started messing up

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.160
a bit later on
throughout the semester--

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.890
was that your partner
is very good as a sort

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.580
of sanity check for you.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.885
Which means that there's
a bit of a danger for you

00:00:25.885 --> 00:00:29.480
and partner to start essentially
operating as one person,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.334
and just like taking what your
other partner says for granted,

00:00:32.334 --> 00:00:33.500
and using that in your data.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.720
Because then you lose
that sanity check,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.710
that that double-checking
of your data.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.280
So it's important to work
together with your partner,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.670
but also sort of constantly
be checking their work,

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.170
and verifying that what they're
doing is actually correct.
