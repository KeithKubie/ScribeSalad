00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.950
&gt;&gt; Stephen King: Hello, I'm
Stephen King and I'm here

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.070 position:56%
to kick off the Library of Congress
Literacy Awards by issuing this call

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.390
to nominate a group in your town
- wherever you are in the world -

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.650
that is doing great work
to promote literacy.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.440
Illiteracy remains an enormous
problem around the world -

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.330
757 million adults cannot read
or write a simple sentence.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.300
61 million elementary
school-age children

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.490
around the world are not in school.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.360
In the United States, 34 percent

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.110
of the children entering
kindergarten do not have the basic

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.280
language skills to learn to read.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.380
No one person or group is
going to move the needle alone.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.230
But together, we can
make a difference.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.940
That's why I am joining
the Library of Congress

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.430
in supporting the thousands of
organizations around the world

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.650
that are working to
promote literacy.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.420
Every year through the generosity
of David M. Rubenstein the Library

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.050
of Congress Literacy Program
honors 15 to 20 agencies

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.050
and awards hundreds of thousands of
dollars in support of replicating,

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.370
expanding or promoting
their outstanding work.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:33.050
Nominate them now at loc.gov/read.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.350

good to read.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.150
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
