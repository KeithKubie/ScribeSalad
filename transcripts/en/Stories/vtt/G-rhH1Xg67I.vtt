00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.620
ALICIA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.080
NARRATOR: No, this isn't
an anti-feminist statement

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.760
from a bygone era.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.180
These are ideas that
are being shared today

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.430
in Russia's womanhood schools.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.680
ALICIA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.410
NARRATOR: In her
one-on-one courses,

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.750
Alicia offers counseling,
beauty, and styling tips

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.440
all with the aim of
creating what she

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.140
believes is the ideal woman.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.260
According to Alicia,
women come to her

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.564
seeking three main things.

00:01:14.564 --> 00:01:17.120
ALICIA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:28.500
NARRATOR: But according
to Jennifer Utrata,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.490
author of "Women Without Men--
Single Mothers and Family

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.140
Change in the New Russia," the
role of women as caretakers

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.090
and men as protectors
is not as idealized

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.180
as Alicia makes it out to be.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.340
DR. JENNIFER ULTRATA: There's
a longing for a sober, reliable

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.659
breadwinner.

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.200
NARRATOR: Utrata
interviewed hundreds

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.424
of Russian men and women to
understand family life there.

00:01:49.424 --> 00:01:51.090
What she found was a
reoccurring problem

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.120
within Russian
marriages-- alcoholism.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.380
In 2014, a study indicated
that 25% of Russian males

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.580
died before the age of 55,
largely because of alcohol.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.480
As a result, Utrada
noted that women

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.098
were being forced to take up the
role of caretaker in the home.

00:02:08.098 --> 00:02:10.639
DR. JENNIFER ULTRATA: Studying
families, it is a big problem,

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.390
and it would come up
in terms of just not

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.064
being able to
count on a partner.

00:02:15.064 --> 00:02:16.980
NARRATOR: And among the
women she interviewed,

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.880
the idea that the men in
their lives were unreliable

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.261
wasn't just down to alcohol.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.290
Unlike the West,
Russian society never

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.500
really embraced
feminist ideas that

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.820
would encourage men to become
more involved in home life.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.460
During the Soviet era,
women were required to work,

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.190
but they were also still
expected to be homemakers.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.440
DR. JENNIFER ULTRATA: With
establishment of the Soviet

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.370
Union, equality felt
like more of a slogan

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.800
because there was a
movement to really involve

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.900
men in domesticity,
childcare, housework.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.819
Women really had
this double burden.

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.360
NARRATOR: In modern
day Russia, there

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.380
are no rules requiring
women to work.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.030
But under Russian
President Putin's

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.710
conservative
government, benefits

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.000
that help working women are
not as plentiful as before.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.010
And according to
Utrada, many women

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.719
feel like their life
choices are limited.

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:10.093
DR. JENNIFER
ULTRATA: I think one

00:03:10.093 --> 00:03:12.480
of the main themes I found
in researching this book

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.760
is that there is a
real disappointment

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.110
in both Russian men and also
the idea of the government

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.110
doing anything for them.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.246
Like it used to
provide these benefits,

00:03:21.246 --> 00:03:24.330
and free after-school
programs, and maternity leave.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.669
They can't rely on that anymore.

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.085
Literally, almost
every woman said

00:03:27.085 --> 00:03:29.110
I can rely on myself alone.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.346
There were a range of
things that they're open to.

00:03:31.346 --> 00:03:33.220
They would get support
from their girlfriends

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.450
and other women that would help
them keep this focus on relying

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.860
on themselves.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.360
NARRATOR: The idea
of self-reliance,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.490
of being the person
within the marriage who

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.000
is holding everything
together, is one that

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.754
is echoed in Alicia's ideology.

00:03:48.754 --> 00:03:50.660
ALICIA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.000
NARRATOR: Of course, not
every woman in Russia

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.050
feels the same way as Alicia.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.029
In 2012, the feminist
rock band Pussy Riot

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.790
staged an impromptu
concert inside a church

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.610
singing lyrics that incited men
and women to become feminists.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.260
They were arrested, but it's
thought that their protest was

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.350
one that represented
a growing feeling

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.050
among young Russian women
that they were being treated

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.900
as second-class citizens.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.110
But inequality surrounding
gender role expectations

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.480
in Russia may
continue to permeate

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.720
because despite his
policies, it seems

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.460
there is an appeal in
Putin to some Russian women

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.900
because he appears reliable,
masculine, and more

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.730
sober than previous leaders.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.850
And though it may
seem strange to some,

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.850
there are a lot of
women like Alicia

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.650
who just don't
believe in feminism.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.961
ALICIA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:05:30.471 --> 00:05:31.970
NARRATOR: And while
Alicia continues

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.640
to school dozens of young
women to be the perfect wife,

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.860
she herself remains
unwed, building what seems

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.420
to be a thriving business.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.890
In this next episode
over on "Seeker Daily,"

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.585
learn more about what life
is like in Russia for women.

00:05:48.585 --> 00:05:50.210
SPEAKER 1: And although
women in Russia

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.690
are legally allowed
maternity leave, some women

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.130
are forced to sign
contracts which

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.440
effectively waive their
rights to work in case

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.730
they get pregnant.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.390
This is in spite of the fact
that Article 19 of the Russian

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.150
Constitution guarantees equal
rights for men and women.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.650
