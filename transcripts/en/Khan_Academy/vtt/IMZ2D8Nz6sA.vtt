00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.344
- [Voiceover] Now I wanna
use a diode in a circuit,

00:00:04.344 --> 00:00:07.501
and we'll see how we solve
circuits that include

00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:09.954
these nonlinear diodes in them.

00:00:09.954 --> 00:00:12.875
So I have a circuit here
with a battery and a resistor

00:00:12.875 --> 00:00:15.392
and a diode here, and it's
gonna be a special kind,

00:00:15.392 --> 00:00:17.110
it's gonna be an LED diode,

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.097
so it's gonna give off light.

00:00:19.097 --> 00:00:22.274
This is a kind of diode that's
manufactured to generate

00:00:22.274 --> 00:00:25.867
photons of light when it has
a current flowing through it

00:00:25.867 --> 00:00:27.721
in the forward direction.

00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:29.961
They're pretty cool and
you see them all the time

00:00:29.961 --> 00:00:31.887
in electronic components.

00:00:31.887 --> 00:00:34.235
So we're gonna figure
out how to use an LED

00:00:34.235 --> 00:00:36.902
in a real simple little circuit.

00:00:38.694 --> 00:00:41.142
And in our circuit here,
we're gonna have a resistor

00:00:41.142 --> 00:00:42.142
of 330 ohms,

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:48.455
and we'll make this battery three volts,

00:00:48.455 --> 00:00:51.122
so it's like two double-A cells.

00:00:54.307 --> 00:00:55.845
And what we wanna find out is

00:00:55.845 --> 00:00:58.611
how much current's gonna
flow around this circuit.

00:00:58.611 --> 00:01:00.981
And then we label this here,

00:01:00.981 --> 00:01:04.326
let me label the voltages
across our components.

00:01:04.326 --> 00:01:07.826
We'll have VD, which is this voltage here,

00:01:09.676 --> 00:01:13.640
and we'll have VR, which
is the resistor voltage,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.827
and that's that voltage right there.

00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:20.895
So now I'm gonna show you
a plot of the iv curve

00:01:20.895 --> 00:01:22.181
of our diode.

00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:24.147
You can see right here, around 0.7 volts,

00:01:24.147 --> 00:01:27.811
the current rises rapidly
when there's 0.7 volts

00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:29.228
across the diode.

00:01:30.325 --> 00:01:32.557
And let's start out by analyzing this,

00:01:32.557 --> 00:01:35.191
let's start with the same
tools that we always have,

00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:38.272
which is, let's try to
write some current laws

00:01:38.272 --> 00:01:39.974
for these two things.

00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:42.135
So for the diode, we write a current law

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:43.931
that looks like this.

00:01:43.931 --> 00:01:46.598
The current is equal to IS times

00:01:48.111 --> 00:01:49.028
e to the qv

00:01:50.823 --> 00:01:51.656
on kT

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.877
minus one.

00:01:54.877 --> 00:01:57.595
So that's the iv
characteristic for the diode,

00:01:57.595 --> 00:01:59.345
where this is V diode

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.806
right there, and the corresponding
equation for the resistor

00:02:06.806 --> 00:02:08.639
is i equals V resistor

00:02:10.996 --> 00:02:11.829
over 330

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:15.772
ohms.

00:02:16.925 --> 00:02:19.139
That's just Ohm's Law for the resistor,

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:22.556
and i in both cases is this i right here.

00:02:24.524 --> 00:02:27.018
Now if I wanted to, I could
set these two expressions

00:02:27.018 --> 00:02:31.185
equal to each other and
solve somehow for VD and VR,

00:02:32.055 --> 00:02:33.847
but what we're gonna do instead
is we're gonna solve this

00:02:33.847 --> 00:02:36.956
by graphing, by a graphical method.

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:39.064
Here's a graph for the diode,

00:02:39.064 --> 00:02:42.166
and this is the VD scale, this is V diode,

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:43.999
and this is i up here.

00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:47.318
And so what I wanna do is I
wanna plot the resistor curve

00:02:47.318 --> 00:02:48.267
around here as well.

00:02:48.267 --> 00:02:50.864
I wanna plot the resistor iv curve

00:02:50.864 --> 00:02:52.843
on this same plot.

00:02:52.843 --> 00:02:56.533
Now, in this expression,
I have VR instead of VD,

00:02:56.533 --> 00:02:59.783
so let me see if I can work on VR here.

00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:08.136
Let me try to figure
out VR in terms of VD.

00:03:08.136 --> 00:03:09.636
So I can derive VR

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.757
as three volts

00:03:13.428 --> 00:03:14.261
minus VD.

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.566
And let's put this into
this i expression here.

00:03:22.566 --> 00:03:25.272
The Ohm's Law expression now becomes

00:03:25.272 --> 00:03:26.105
i equals,

00:03:27.912 --> 00:03:30.829
VR is replaced with three minus VD,

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.310
all over 330 ohms.

00:03:38.478 --> 00:03:40.906
And let's work on this a little more.

00:03:40.906 --> 00:03:41.739
i equals

00:03:45.233 --> 00:03:46.400
three over 330

00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:50.161
minus VD over 330,

00:03:55.092 --> 00:03:59.344
and this is starting to look
like the equation of a line.

00:03:59.344 --> 00:04:03.511
Let me write this to recognize
it as a equation of a line.

00:04:05.004 --> 00:04:05.837
Minus VD

00:04:08.572 --> 00:04:09.405
over 330

00:04:14.604 --> 00:04:17.771
plus three over 330 is nine milliamps.

00:04:23.903 --> 00:04:26.314
So this is the equation
of a line, and the slope

00:04:26.314 --> 00:04:29.397
is right here, is minus one over 330,

00:04:30.932 --> 00:04:34.099
and the i-intercept is nine milliamps.

00:04:35.793 --> 00:04:37.521
So let's see if we can plot this line.

00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:40.435
This is actually called a

00:04:40.435 --> 00:04:41.268
Load Line.

00:04:44.183 --> 00:04:47.227
That's just a nickname for
this kind of expression

00:04:47.227 --> 00:04:50.615
that you get when you
have a resistor connected

00:04:50.615 --> 00:04:53.770
to a fixed power supply
above and the resistor is

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.520
hanging down from it.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.234
You get this characteristic
equation of a line

00:04:59.234 --> 00:05:03.718
that has a negative slope,
which is really distinctive.

00:05:03.718 --> 00:05:05.577
Let's see if we can plot this line.

00:05:05.577 --> 00:05:08.619
Now, it's a line, so all we
have to do is find two points

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:12.261
that solve the line and then
we'll be able to draw the line.

00:05:12.261 --> 00:05:14.785
So if I set VD equal to zero,

00:05:14.785 --> 00:05:17.202
then i equals nine milliamps.

00:05:18.427 --> 00:05:22.195
So here's VD equal to
zero, and it'll go through

00:05:22.195 --> 00:05:23.951
nine milliamps.

00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:24.784
So that's

00:05:25.796 --> 00:05:27.629
one point on the line.

00:05:29.085 --> 00:05:30.255
But what else can I set to zero?

00:05:30.255 --> 00:05:31.931
I can set i equal to zero,

00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:34.931
which means I'm on the voltage axis.

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:37.576
And what I'm actually gonna do

00:05:37.576 --> 00:05:39.674
is I'm just gonna look at my
circuit and figure this out

00:05:39.674 --> 00:05:41.174
in my head.

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:43.957
So I'm setting i equal to zero,

00:05:43.957 --> 00:05:47.225
and i equal zero means there's
no current in this resistor,

00:05:47.225 --> 00:05:50.689
which means there's no voltage
drop across that resistor.

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:53.626
And that means that this voltage here

00:05:53.626 --> 00:05:56.659
is the same as this voltage here.

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:57.960
And I know the voltage here,

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.847
the voltage here is three volts,

00:06:00.847 --> 00:06:04.101
so that means the voltage
here is three volts,

00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:08.254
and that's because I
know the current is zero.

00:06:08.254 --> 00:06:11.372
So let's go over and put
that point on a line.

00:06:11.372 --> 00:06:14.372
So when i is zero, v is three volts.

00:06:15.344 --> 00:06:18.863
So there's another point on the line.

00:06:18.863 --> 00:06:20.784
And now we have two points
and we can draw a line

00:06:20.784 --> 00:06:21.784
between 'em,

00:06:22.984 --> 00:06:23.817
like that.

00:06:28.134 --> 00:06:31.462
And what we've drawn is the Load Line

00:06:31.462 --> 00:06:33.629
for this 330-ohm resistor.

00:06:35.522 --> 00:06:37.527
You remember, back over
here we said we could solve

00:06:37.527 --> 00:06:39.669
these two equations by setting the two is

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:41.190
equal to each other,

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.332
and that's basically where
do these two lines intersect?

00:06:44.332 --> 00:06:46.832
And they intersect right here.

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:50.836
That's the solution to our problem.

00:06:52.171 --> 00:06:54.220
So this intersection
point is the solution.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.812
It's where the resistor
current and the diode current

00:06:56.812 --> 00:06:59.428
are the same, and that's that point there.

00:06:59.428 --> 00:07:02.261
Now I can just read off my answer.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.773
Right there is about 0.7 volts,

00:07:09.088 --> 00:07:13.255
and the current over here,
if I read off the current,

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:18.421
just straight across there, it's about

00:07:18.421 --> 00:07:19.254
6.8

00:07:21.397 --> 00:07:23.147
milliamps of current.

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:27.789
So now we actually just solved our circuit

00:07:29.692 --> 00:07:32.482
using a graphical technique.

00:07:32.482 --> 00:07:34.978
And what that says is,

00:07:34.978 --> 00:07:38.793
let me erase this a bit to clean it up.

00:07:38.793 --> 00:07:42.386
Let me take out these two things here.

00:07:42.386 --> 00:07:44.636
That was just the resistor Load Line

00:07:44.636 --> 00:07:47.484
that we were talking about.

00:07:47.484 --> 00:07:51.309
And now for our solution, we have i equals

00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:52.476
6.8 milliamps,

00:07:54.539 --> 00:07:55.372
and V,

00:07:57.973 --> 00:08:00.556
V diode equals about 0.7 volts.

00:08:04.049 --> 00:08:06.709
So that's how you do a
graphical solution with a diode.
