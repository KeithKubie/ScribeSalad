00:00:00.194 --> 00:00:01.644
- [Voiceover] In the last video,

00:00:01.644 --> 00:00:03.284
Sal and I were talking about

00:00:03.284 --> 00:00:06.048
the Civil War Battle of Antietam.

00:00:06.048 --> 00:00:10.215
Antietam took place in
Maryland on September 17, 1862.

00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:16.120
Just to briefly recap, Antietam was the

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.244
single, bloodiest day in American history.

00:00:19.244 --> 00:00:23.179
Over 4,000 people died, and Antietam was a

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:27.262
signature victory in the
Civil War for the North,

00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:31.485
for Abraham Lincoln, and the
forces of the United States.

00:00:31.485 --> 00:00:34.487
One thing that was really
important about Antietam

00:00:34.487 --> 00:00:37.981
was that Lincoln had been
waiting for a Union victory,

00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:42.972
so that he could proclaim the
Emancipation Proclamation,

00:00:42.972 --> 00:00:47.139
which was intended to be a
real morale blow to the South,

00:00:50.114 --> 00:00:54.281
and also a signal to both
enslaved people in the South,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.996
Northern Republicans who were

00:00:56.996 --> 00:01:00.287
strongly in favor of
Abolition, the end of slavery,

00:01:00.287 --> 00:01:03.514
and also the world, especially Europe,

00:01:03.514 --> 00:01:07.170
that the Civil War had become
a fight to end slavery,

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.532
not just a fight to
keep the Union together.

00:01:10.532 --> 00:01:12.653
I mentioned in the last
video that there were

00:01:12.653 --> 00:01:15.474
two reasons why Antietam was so important,

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:17.629
the first being that it led

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:20.582
to the Emancipation Proclamation.

00:01:20.582 --> 00:01:23.340
The second reason was
slightly related to that.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.531
The eyes of the world were really on

00:01:26.531 --> 00:01:30.547
the United States and on
the Civil War at this time.

00:01:30.547 --> 00:01:32.951
Many people in Europe
were trying to decide

00:01:32.951 --> 00:01:37.474
whether they should intervene
in the American Civil War.

00:01:37.474 --> 00:01:38.952
Now, why would they do this?

00:01:38.952 --> 00:01:40.963
I think the most important
reason that they would

00:01:40.963 --> 00:01:45.046
do this is because the
South of the United States

00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:49.451
supplied 75% of the world's cotton

00:01:50.563 --> 00:01:52.925
at the beginning of the Civil War,

00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:55.533
and so to major industrialized nations,

00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:58.254
especially the United Kingdom,

00:01:58.254 --> 00:02:01.754
cotton was the source of their prosperity.

00:02:03.424 --> 00:02:07.949
They based their economy, in
part, around textile mills.

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:10.231
This is what England was known for.

00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:13.564
During the Civil War, the
North blockaded the South,

00:02:13.564 --> 00:02:16.145
which meant that they
used the ships of the Navy

00:02:16.145 --> 00:02:19.339
to prevent supplies from getting in

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:23.580
or crops from getting out
of the American South.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.440
If England can't get their cotton crops,

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.144
they might be in a whole lot of trouble

00:02:28.144 --> 00:02:30.454
when it comes to textile manufacturing.

00:02:30.454 --> 00:02:34.350
In fact, the Confederacy was counting

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.094
on having the support of Europe

00:02:36.094 --> 00:02:39.000
in their rebellion
against the United States,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.213
partly for this reason.

00:02:40.213 --> 00:02:42.406
Now, there were other reasons why Europe

00:02:42.406 --> 00:02:45.287
might have intervened
on behalf of the South.

00:02:45.287 --> 00:02:48.076
One of these was that
Europe was traditionally

00:02:48.076 --> 00:02:50.139
a highly classed society, and they had

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:52.996
a lot of sympathy for the way that the

00:02:52.996 --> 00:02:56.755
South did things with
a wealthy planter class

00:02:56.755 --> 00:03:00.964
similar to the monarchy
or the gentry in Europe,

00:03:00.964 --> 00:03:03.655
which was in control of poor whites

00:03:03.655 --> 00:03:06.415
and enslaved people of African descent.

00:03:06.415 --> 00:03:09.021
Another reason was that
it was to the advantage

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:12.084
of Europe not to have such a strong nation

00:03:12.084 --> 00:03:15.717
as the United States
operating in the Americas.

00:03:15.717 --> 00:03:18.639
Remember that this is
the era of Imperialism,

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.078
the very beginning of Imperialism,

00:03:21.078 --> 00:03:23.226
as countries like the United Kingdom

00:03:23.226 --> 00:03:26.044
and France, Germany, and others in Europe

00:03:26.044 --> 00:03:29.051
begin to look for colonies abroad,

00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:31.552
and the United States had in 1820

00:03:31.552 --> 00:03:34.092
proclaimed the Monroe Doctrine which said,

00:03:34.092 --> 00:03:36.235
"Europe, keep out of the Americas.

00:03:36.235 --> 00:03:39.580
We consider this our area of the world."

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.000
Dividing what had been the United States

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.845
into two smaller nations would probably

00:03:44.845 --> 00:03:46.681
have worked out in their favor,

00:03:46.681 --> 00:03:50.917
so Europe had these
social or cultural reasons

00:03:50.917 --> 00:03:53.500
to join with the South and also

00:03:55.356 --> 00:03:59.214
political, or perhaps
foreign policy reasons

00:03:59.214 --> 00:04:01.131
to join with the South.

00:04:02.777 --> 00:04:05.462
The South was really counting on

00:04:05.462 --> 00:04:08.629
the intervention of a European nation.

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.545
They thought, certainly, the

00:04:11.545 --> 00:04:14.997
United Kingdom would
intercede on their behalf.

00:04:14.997 --> 00:04:19.159
It looked, especially
early in the Civil War,

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:20.793
like that might be the case,

00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:22.392
but when it came down to it,

00:04:22.392 --> 00:04:25.558
the United Kingdom did not
intercede for the South,

00:04:25.558 --> 00:04:27.815
and there were a few
reasons why that happened.

00:04:27.815 --> 00:04:30.666
One of those reasons was that the South

00:04:30.666 --> 00:04:33.989
had kind of oversold cotton to England

00:04:33.989 --> 00:04:36.336
in the years leading up to the Civil War,

00:04:36.336 --> 00:04:41.291
so there was actually a
considerable supply on hand

00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:44.291
which English merchants had built up

00:04:45.443 --> 00:04:48.143
before the Civil War, kind
of seeing this coming.

00:04:48.143 --> 00:04:50.531
The loss of new Southern cotton

00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:52.906
really didn't turn out to be as

00:04:52.906 --> 00:04:55.933
big of a problem, as many had imagined.

00:04:55.933 --> 00:05:00.235
Related to that, as the
Civil War began to ramp up,

00:05:00.235 --> 00:05:04.402
both Egypt and India, which
were also cotton producers,

00:05:05.464 --> 00:05:08.069
began to increase their production,

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:10.593
understanding there
would be more of a demand

00:05:10.593 --> 00:05:11.991
coming from England that couldn't

00:05:11.991 --> 00:05:14.382
be supplied from the American South.

00:05:14.382 --> 00:05:16.390
It's interesting to note that it's partly

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.707
in response to the American Civil War

00:05:18.707 --> 00:05:21.683
and the Northern blockade
of Southern ships

00:05:21.683 --> 00:05:23.924
that Egypt and India become the

00:05:23.924 --> 00:05:26.620
world suppliers of cotton that they

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.060
will be for the rest of the 19th Century.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.077
The other reason that England doesn't aid

00:05:31.077 --> 00:05:33.547
the South is more of a cultural reason,

00:05:33.547 --> 00:05:35.154
which I think is very interesting,

00:05:35.154 --> 00:05:37.614
which is that the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin,

00:05:37.614 --> 00:05:41.025
which we'll talk about
more in other videos,

00:05:41.025 --> 00:05:44.065
was read really widely in England,

00:05:44.065 --> 00:05:45.871
it was a very popular novel there.

00:05:45.871 --> 00:05:50.175
The stage shows of Uncle
Tom's Cabin were quite common.

00:05:50.175 --> 00:05:52.359
This novel, which in the United States,

00:05:52.359 --> 00:05:54.595
helped to propel the Civil War by

00:05:54.595 --> 00:05:56.679
showing Northerners how barbaric the

00:05:56.679 --> 00:06:00.783
institution of slavery was,
also came over to England.

00:06:00.783 --> 00:06:04.480
Because the battle of Antietam allowed

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.110
Lincoln to make the
Emancipation Proclamation,

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.346
to the citizens of England, this meant

00:06:10.346 --> 00:06:14.098
now that the North was
an army of liberation,

00:06:14.098 --> 00:06:16.267
that they had the choice of siding

00:06:16.267 --> 00:06:18.326
with either Southern slaveholders,

00:06:18.326 --> 00:06:20.837
who had been demonized
in Uncle Tom's Cabin,

00:06:20.837 --> 00:06:22.745
or with Northerners, who were

00:06:22.745 --> 00:06:25.388
fighting against those slaveholders.

00:06:25.388 --> 00:06:28.851
Because of the Emancipation Proclamation,

00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:31.682
and because of these other side issues

00:06:31.682 --> 00:06:34.157
about the supply of
cotton, Antietam really

00:06:34.157 --> 00:06:36.212
marks the moment where it becomes clear

00:06:36.212 --> 00:06:38.194
that there is not going to be any

00:06:38.194 --> 00:06:40.527
European help for the South.

00:06:42.658 --> 00:06:44.746
That's really important, because

00:06:44.746 --> 00:06:48.582
think of the American
movement for independence.

00:06:48.582 --> 00:06:51.062
The reason that the United States won,

00:06:51.062 --> 00:06:53.834
or at least one reason
that the United States won,

00:06:53.834 --> 00:06:56.083
was because of the intervention of France.

00:06:56.083 --> 00:06:57.538
The South knew that they needed

00:06:57.538 --> 00:07:00.168
the help of Europe if they
were going to succeed.

00:07:00.168 --> 00:07:03.526
Had England interceded, it's highly likely

00:07:03.526 --> 00:07:07.247
that the South may have
won the American Civil War,

00:07:07.247 --> 00:07:09.345
and it would have been a separate nation.

00:07:09.345 --> 00:07:11.068
After the Battle of Antietam

00:07:11.068 --> 00:07:12.981
and the Emancipation Proclamation,

00:07:12.981 --> 00:07:14.712
it became clear that if the South

00:07:14.712 --> 00:07:17.378
was going to win its
independence from the North,

00:07:17.378 --> 00:07:19.991
it would be doing it on its own.
