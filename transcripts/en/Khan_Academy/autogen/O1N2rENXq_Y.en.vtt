00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.650
 , 

00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:08.170
 The main role of the immune system is to avoid damaging agents 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.950
 which fall into our body, and the role of this system is their destruction 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.680
 These harmful agents are part of the harmful proteins 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:23.670
 which can do damage to your body, viruses, bacteria, and even 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:31.290
 eukaryotic parasites, as well as fungus. 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.770
 So all these agents, if they got into your body, 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.050
 would cause any form of disease. 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.500
 All of these agents are generally called pathogenic agents. 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.730
 , 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.620
 So the basic role of the immune system is, in the first line of the front 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.710
 with this agent gone - and if so 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.480
 get into your body to kill them and eliminate them 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.450
 from our system so that we do not get sick and with that 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.970
 let us not die. 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.470
 I just mentioned that there are two fronts 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.510
 defense and apart from them are also 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.340
 kind of subclassifications. 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.800
 First Defense Front - I'll call it the first line 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.140
 which essentially plays the role of eliminating everyone 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.940
 these pathogens. 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.260
 And here we mention 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.410
 Lekuren tone. 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.540
 Our skin keeps the pathogens away from entering the body 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.040
 the skin also has higher acidity that makes it difficult 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.410
 the introduction of certain types of bacteria in such an environment. 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:35.330
 You also have mucosal membranes, where in the mucus 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.550
 there are some chemical substances that they can not 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.310
 bacterial survival. 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.640
 For example, you find the acidic environment 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.890
 in your own juice. 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.000
 , 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.120
 You might think that the stomach is not your outer part but, 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.310
 in essence it is. 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.810
 Your entire digestive tract, for which you will also take video 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.840
 in a near future, is in your outer part 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.130
 You can imagine the body of most vertebrates 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.270
 as a pretzel in which the digestive system 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.289
 is the inner part of this gevreku. 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.020
 So the juice of the stomach is in the outer space of our body and 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.870
 and you can imagine that this environment is lenient for the pathogens 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.570
 to survive. 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.720
 So this is the first line of defense, but as far as we know it 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.820
 this is not enough, and that some of the pathogens can 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.760
 to get into our bodies, and here we have to start thinking 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.750
 for the second line of defense. 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.540
 what happens when we have presence of these pathogens in our body 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:44.980
 , 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.550
 And as in the first and second line, I'm talking 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.660
 for non-specific immunity - and that makes sense 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.290
 then when we start talking about immunity 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.840
 specific. 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.020
 So these two are non-specific. 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.630
 , 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.840
 And when I say the non-specific expression 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.430
 born - it means that we generally have a response 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.050
 in those ages that are perceived as damaging. 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.840
 and have no memory for the agencies with whom they have come into contact with before 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.690
 It does not respond to a specific type of virus 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.060
 means the answer to each type of virus 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.270
 or each type of bacteria, but they do not know it 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.660
 that this is type A, B, C or that is bacteria A, B, C 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.990
 They just perceive it as a virus and that's it. 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.120
 Do not take it in or pull your neck 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.180
 This is bacteria. 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.390
 Do not take it in or pull your neck 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.950
 do not know what the bacteria is in contact with. 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.320
 So this one is non-specific or 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.630
 immune system born (natural) 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.370
 We will also analyze the specific immune system in detail 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.850
 because you can imagine, it's too much 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.760
 complicated and interesting when you start thinking about it 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.710
 storing viruses from your body, which the virus has been in contact with before 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.930
 and consequently have the best response in contact with the virus 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.240
 bread or protein. 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.580
 so here we are talking about the non-specific immune system. 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.080
 and the second line of your non-specific system, 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.790
 they are great. 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.760
 One, it is inflammatory remnants. 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:16.910
 , 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.250
 For this I will realize it in a special video, but in general. 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.110
 all of us have experienced inflammatory responses. 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.000
 When you see the blood leaking into a certain part 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.010
 and see that there is pus - it will expose it 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.280
 in more detail what the actual inflammatory response is 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.090
 but what is happening 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.250
 is the behavior of blood with combat cells 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.450
 to fight off the infection that you have. I bring these components 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.030
 in the place where we have an app cut where we have a lot 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.370
 bacteria or whatever pathogens. 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.810
 So the inflammatory response in general has to do with fluid behavior 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.570
 and fighters to fight. 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.210
 , 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.500
 For this subject I will make a video in its own right. 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:07.190
 , 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.070
 But the result is that a piece of tissue or 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.030
 part of your body inflates - a huge amount 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.960
 of the fluid and by-products that is the result of the "battle" that occurs. 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.000
 For this we will realize a special video. 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.100
 The other line of defense that is and part of 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.940
 inflammatory response - is phagocytosis or 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.190
 phagocytes. 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.730
 , 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.120
 what I want to realize in the remainder of this video is 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.300
 to speak a bit more in detail about phagocytes 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.110
 because when we understand the function of phagocytes, it helps 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.350
 in the best sense of the immune system 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.010
 will also help us in the related topic 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.850
 inflammatory response due to phagocytosis 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.740
 are part of the inflammatory response. 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.460
 Phagocytes are a type of cell 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.430
 which are plagued by pathogens 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.020
 Phagocytes also ingest other substances, but when they talk about 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.970
 immune system, talk about pathogens. 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.710
 Let's say that this is phagocyte. 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.620
 This is phagocyte. 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.310
 There is a kind of berthame 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.550
 Skam for concentrated focus on the inner part of the phagocytes. 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.210
 It's a eukaryotic cell, but what I want to do is 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.840
 to see what happens when the phagocytes face a particle 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.590
 foreign or with a bacterium. 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.850
 Let's say this here is foreign bacteria. 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.940
 From this phagocytic and this is what we said is non-specific. 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.620
 what's up, possesses receptors that replicate us 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.380
 the substances you know as damaging. 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.426
 You can imagine being a kind of supersensor. 

00:06:36.426 --> 00:06:43.050
 , 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.410
 They are probably supersensors for bacteria. 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.010
 Bacteria have proteins in their appearance 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.860
 something like that. 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.270
 Of course they do not look like that. 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.240
 I'm presenting you in a Y and a triangle so that you can see it 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.430
 fit between them. 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:59.810
 At the moment these two link - let me present the script 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.100
 when these two are connected between them. 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.310
 So this is the bacterium. 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.600
 This is a pathogen. 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.670
 The same situation is with the virus or with the virus 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:07.600
 any other agency. 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.070
 we will see in our future videos that these cells 

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.250
 can be attacked by other molecules, which it does 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.100
 that these phagocytes increase the level of assault. 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.720
 As soon as you connect - this is the bacterium 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.900
 Invasive pathogens 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.590
 And now it's connected 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.850
 and has stimulated the receptors in phagocytes 

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:34.540
 Phagocytes will start to gllabber - it will overwhelm you 

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:35.790
 this pathogen. 

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:44.140
 , 

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:48.125
 And these two parts will finally meet. 

00:07:48.125 --> 00:08:00.230
 , 

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.690
 and when they meet, what's going to happen 

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:09.320
 Very fast bacteria will 

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.350
 is completely immersed. 

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.880
 And it will be inserted inside the cell. 

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.760
 And now the cell - as soon as you meet these two parts 

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.070
 will be melting the membranes, and this component will be located in 

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.410
 its small membrane flush - or you can imagine how it was 

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.820
 we blink her small. 

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:28.370
 So this is the pathogen, in this case the bacterium - but 

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.950
 phagocytosis - the process is entirely identical in the sense 

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.340
 of the globe of the agencies. 

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.390
 If it was a virus or any kind of foreign protein or 

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:42.010
 any kind of a foreign molecule - in fact, 

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:43.620
 not only to foreign agencies. 

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.780
 This process is also directed towards molecules that are not 

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.310
 foreign, but it is necessary to clean up. 

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.190
 But we will focus on the immune system, the agency says 

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:52.440
 foreign. 

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.870
 , 

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.930
 So this membrane here will completely dissolve and come to fruition 

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.520
 this agent in this form. 

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.800
 And of course, you have receptors and who knows 

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.910
 if they are still there. 

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.740
 Within time --- let's draw in order to see 

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.800
 which part is which. 

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.220
 As soon as it becomes globe, this complex is called 

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:20.240
 phage, which is actually a bladder which is in itself 

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.740
 the foreign agent to be eliminated. 

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:33.660
 While other bladders that contain substances themselves 

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:38.800
 which are the third of these phagosomes - to say 

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:43.360
 this is a bladder that contains substances - lysosomes 

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.905
 and contains reactive oxygen species. 

00:09:46.905 --> 00:09:50.420
 , 

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.920
 And if it comes into contact with anyone 

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.240
 by biological components, will make a bull. 

00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:00.360
 But at the moment the pathogen is melted inside 

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:06.530
 cell, this small compound will melt here and will 

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:11.130
 emptying its contents into the fagot, so in this bladder 

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:15.380
 which contains this pathogen, and then does its defect. 

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.990
 Essentially, it delivers its digestion. 

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.190
 The first role is the elimination and 

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.530
 murder. 

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.910
 and the second role - with this I will give 

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.230
 a little taste here. 

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:28.660
 This will be prefixed with details in our next videos. 

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.910
 It destroys. 

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:38.490
 , 

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.550
 So now we have complete destruction. 

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:45.330
 , 

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.930
 It means the agency is embedded in the constituent proteins and us 

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.590
 other molecules. 

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:57.550
 Then, what does phagocytosis do - is that 

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:02.050
 takes some of these molecules 

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:02.990
 the nodules of these proteins. 

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:04.170
 by doing away with them. 

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.860
 Proteins are simply a sequence of amino acids. 

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.350
 Normally when people say proteins, they talk 

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.580
 for long sequences of amino acids. 

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.760
 When talking about short sequences of amino acids 

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.820
 or for the proteins which are multiplied, they refer to as well 

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:17.710
 peptide chain. 

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.360
 The peptide chain is a short chain of amino acids. 

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.880
 So this type here will take some special peptide chains, some of them 

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:28.160
 the special part of the components that has already destroyed them, attaches to 

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.920
 some other proteins. 

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:37.020
 Now I will take a part of the bacteria 

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:45.060
 I will associate it with another protetine, which is called 

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.800
 the main complex of histocompatibility - and if we have the keyword 

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.650
 for phagocytes, this is the main complex of histocompatibility 

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.140
 types II. 

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:59.810
 , 

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:01.900
 It looks like a strange word, but we will find it 

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.150
 quite often. 

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:17.110
 , 

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:20.110
 And the abbreviation is FKH. 

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:24.580
 this is a protein that binds to this peptide which we 

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.510
 a form has been scratched or worn out by 

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:32.820
 this pathogen, then this phagocyt will present it 

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:33.910
 in its membranen. 

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.590
 So this combination - this complex of MHCs - in this 

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.420
 case, it will be the FKH II prothene protein. 

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.960
 , 

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.820
 For Type II we will talk in the future. 

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.920
 what is further the presentation of this complex in 

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.170
 his surface. 

00:12:51.170 --> 00:13:01.780
 , 

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:05.060
 The reason why we are trying to elaborate this 

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.930
 process - you can say, but we are already present 

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:08.340
 we removed the agent and killed him. 

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.240
 What Sal is worried about what's being done with peptides? 

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.780
 This is crucial to our immune system, because we will see them 

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.590
 even the other components of the immune system. 

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:19.590
 Keep in mind, so far we are talking about non-specific immunity. 

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.290
 This guy here, he said, is a conqueror. 

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:22.900
 And do not know what kind of conqueror. 

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.900
 She says, let me connect to this and kill her. 

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.270
 It's one of those things I know to be foreign to my body. 

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.880
 And he kills, but the matter is that he leaves on his surface and 

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.460
 now specific parts, components that in reality have 

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:40.450
 memory and attach special components, you can say, giii, Zotni. 

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:42.600
 Fagocit, look, you've already killed something 

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.260
 Allow me if I have any specific reaction that I can 

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.420
 is initiated by this complex you are presenting. 

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.000
 For that, many phagocytes are also called 

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.590
 the antigen presenting cell. 

00:13:52.590 --> 00:14:00.120
 , 

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.260
 We will go into details of what exactly is 

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.640
 is antigen. 

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.340
 I also call this pathogen agent. 

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.950
 The antigen in essence is - you can think of it as a protein 

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:15.750
 or a peptide chain that initiates it 

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:16.830
 immunological reaction. 

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.720
 I'll be a bit - the specific immune system. 

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.170
 and I will be a little more accentuated about it 

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.150
 I will - I will make a video for antigens and 

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.810
 but you can now see it as a chain 

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:28.620
 peptide. 

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.660
 Antigen is simply a protein or part of a protein. 

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.390
 So this makes the antigen presentation later on 

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:37.220
 may be perodrene from other parts. 

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:41.720
 Tashi, one thing is that there are many, many types 

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.470
 of phagocytes. 

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:45.300
 and how much I was informed - when you meet different words 

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.250
 do not fall into confusion by the different types of phagocytes. 

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.860
 I'll do a review now. 

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:52.110
 You have neutrophils. 

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:54.850
 , 

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:58.340
 These are the most common phagocytes. 

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.120
 and also by the answer, the number and the speed. 

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:10.880
 So get to the site of infection very fast. 

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.900
 Phagocytes do not necessarily have to be killing alone in this way. 

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.620
 I have the word, called phagocytes because they gllabber 

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.930
 in that form, but we will also talk about other forms in the following videos 

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.840
 so phagocytes can also release chemical substances or even DNA networks 

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.540
 to trap pathogens, but neutrophils 

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.210
 are fast and in large numbers. 

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:30.610
 Then you have the macrophages that are to a great extent 

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.800
 more versatile and carry big berries, but also 

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.560
 are phagocytes. 

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.130
 Then dendritic cells. 

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:40.460
 When you meet the dendritic cell keyword, you will think 

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.520
 hey, shit to do with dendrites 

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.390
 nervous system? 

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:46.740
 But no, nothing has to do with the nervous system. 

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:52.720
 , 

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.100
 The reason why they are called dendritic cells is because 

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.350
 they seem to have dendrites. 

00:15:55.350 --> 00:16:03.190
 , 

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:05.640
 They look like neurons on a mass, but they do not 

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:08.130
 participate in the nervous system in any form. 

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:11.610
 And here they tend to be system activators 

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:14.920
 the specific immune we will talk about in the following videos. 

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.680
 Either way, I'll let you down here and talk more 

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.690
 for all this in some of the following videos.
