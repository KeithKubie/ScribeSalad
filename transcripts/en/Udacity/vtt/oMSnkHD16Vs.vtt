00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The right way to think about this is of all the terms in the sum here,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
you need to take the one with the fastest growth rate.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Log n is piddly as n gets big compared to n,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and n is actually pretty piddly as n gets big compared to n².

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
N² is really the only thing that matters here.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This constant in front of the n² is not going to matter in Big Theta world,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
because we can go above it or below it.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Any coefficient in here gives you the same answer.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
These terms drop out. This leading term doesn't really matter.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So really, this is n² .

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
However, in Big Theta world, this is also n².

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Every function is Big Theta of itself.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It's very easy to sandwich it between 1.5 times the function and 0.8 times the function.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
By the definition of Big Theta, this is true.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This is not true. This is true, because 20n² is also Θ(n²).

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
This is not. Once you multiply another term in here, even though it grows really slowly,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
it's not a constant. It changes the asymptotic growth rate. This is Big Theta of those three.
