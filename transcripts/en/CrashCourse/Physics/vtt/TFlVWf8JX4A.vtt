00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.740
The shock you get from a doorknob.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.560
That trick you used to do with a balloon,
to make your hair stick up.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.880
Or, of course, a lightning strike.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.290
They’re all governed by the same principle:
static electricity.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:20.869
Static electricity occurs when an object obtains a net amount of positive or negative electric charge, creating an imbalance that wants to be returned to equilibrium.

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.720
Its effects aren’t always as dramatic as
lightning, though.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.439
Let’s take two pieces of tape that are both
stuck to a table.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.100
If you rip them both off the table and try to stick
them together, that should be easy enough, right?

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.380
But it turns out that they repel one another.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.660
But try this: Stick one on top of the other, rip
the pair off the table, and then separate the pieces.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.600
They’re no longer repelled – now they’re
attracted to one another!

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.700
In the first scenario, both pieces of tape
stole negative charges from the table.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.690
And since like-charges repel, the pieces moved
away from one another.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:57.490
In the second scenario, one piece of tape stole negative charges from the other, leaving the pieces with opposite overall charges, making them attract.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.710
Our study of electricity begins here:

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:07.330
with basic observations about electric charges that, hundreds of years ago, sparked the imagination and innovation that changed our world forever.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:19.970
[Theme Music]

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.700
To understand electricity, you should
start with an atom.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.760
Atoms contain charged particles – positive protons and negative electrons.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.660
And generally there’s an equal number of each,
meaning the net electric charge of the atom is 0.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.170
It’s electrically neutral.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.430
In solid materials, protons stay fixed, but
some electrons are free to move around.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.700
These moving electrons are called free electrons.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:47.160
They reside in an atom’s outer shell as valence electrons and are easily plucked off and carried around, when acted upon by an outside force.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.660
How easy it is for electrons to move around
depends on the material.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.940
And we describe the materials in the same manner we do for heat transfer, with conductors and insulators.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.580
Materials that are conductors, like copper,
let free electrons move freely throughout the solid,

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.100
while insulators, like wood, hold on to
them tightly, limiting their flow.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.260
So we’ve got insulators and conductors with
free electrons moving around in them.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.480
But what causes these charged particles to
move in the first place?

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.480
The answer is an imbalance of electrical charge, when some part of an object has a different number of free electrons than another part.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.440
When we talk about an object having an overall negative charge, we mean that it has too many electrons.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.360
And when we talk about an object having an overall positive charge, we mean it’s missing free electrons.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.580
This imbalance can be created and resolved
in lots of different ways.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.670
Say you have a glass rod that’s electrically
neutral, and you rub it with a cloth.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.900
That physical interaction causes electrons to hop onto the cloth, leaving the rod with an overall positive charge.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.920
This is called charging by friction.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.280
Both the cloth and rod began with a neutral charge, but after friction, the rod has a net positive charge.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.060
But whether the rod ends up with a net positive or negative charge depends on the materials that you use.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.780
The ancient Greeks actually rubbed fur against amber, and discovered that the amber would then attract hair and feathers.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:09.020
Today, we understand that the fur stole electrons during the process, giving the amber an overall positive charge, just like the glass rod.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.290
Now, it’s important to note that no new
charges were created during this process.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.200
The overall charge between the two objects
is still zero.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.260
This is known as the law of conservation of
electric charge.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.500
It says that you can never create
a net electric charge.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.540
Instead, charge can only move
from one place to another.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.480
Now, if we bring our positively charged glass
rod in contact with another, neutral rod,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:38.720
some of the negative charge – that is, some electrons – will jump from the neutral rod to the positive one, until both objects have the same distribution of charge.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.490
So now we have two rods that are both slightly
positive.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.690
This is called charging by contact.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.770
When the two objects touched, charges moved
between them.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.120
OK, so, charges can move when different materials touch each other, either through friction or simple contact.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.420
But materials don’t actually have to touch
in order for their electrons to get all rearranged.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.299
Say you bring a positively charged rod close
to a metal conductive rod.

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.810
Then, the electrons in part of the metal rod
will be drawn towards the positive rod.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.460
Now, the side with more electrons has a negative charge, leaving the other side of the rod with fewer electrons and a positive charge.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.820
You know what we’ve done here?

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.460
We’ve polarized the metal rod.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:22.000
We’ve redistributed the charge in order to create an imbalance of charge within an object an object that’s still electrically neutral.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.030
Now, imagine that we slice the metal rod right
down the center!

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:32.710
It still hasn’t touched the positive rod, but since we split it while an imbalance was present, we’re left with one positive side and one negative side.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.600
This process is known as charging by induction – creating a net charge without contacting another object.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:48.740
Now, if a charged object is connected to a much larger neutral conducting object, then the net charge gets redistributed so that the smaller object loses most of its net charge.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.300
How large an object are we talking about,
exactly?

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.040
Well, how about Earth?

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.680
The Earth’s surface is a fairly good conductor in most places, and, for our purposes, it can be considered neutral.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:05.600
So, connecting a charged object to the ground creates a way for the charge to leak into the Earth, rendering the object electrically neutral.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.100
This is known as grounding.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.100
So, let’s say we repeat the previous experiment, but we bring a negatively charged rod close to our neutral one.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:18.560
The neutral rod becomes polarized, with a net positive charge close to the charged rod and a negative charge on the opposite side.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:24.940
But if we ground the metal rod, the negative charges repelled by the charged rod now have a place to go:
the Earth!

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.620
The negative charges scurry away, leaving
the metal rod with an overall positive charge.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.140
Now, if we sever the connection to the ground,
our rod remains positively charged!

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.960
This process required no contact between the
rods, only a connection to the ground.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:46.300
OK, so we’ve talked about how opposite charges attract and like charges repel, but how do we quantify those interactions in terms of equations and units?

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.640
Well, we’ll want to find the force on charged
particles in Newtons.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.760
But to calculate the number of Newtons, we’ll first need to measure the charge, denoted by “q”, in units called Coulombs.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.940
Since objects can be positively or negatively charged, “q” can have both positive and negative values.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:06.720
For example, one electron has a charge of negative 1.6 times 10 to the negative 19th Coulombs.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.140
That means there are 6.24 times 10 to the
18th electrons for every negative Coulomb!

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:18.740
This value – the charge of a single electron in Coulombs – is known as the elementary charge, and it’s denoted with a lowercase “e”.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:25.500
We’ll use this notation a lot when talking about protons and electrons, since protons have a charge of positive e and electrons of negative e.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.580
Now that we have a way to measure the charge,
we can calculate the force between particles.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.200
And the equation we use is very similar to the one we use with gravitation.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.020
It’s just that, instead of using kilograms to find Newtons,
here we’re using Coulombs to find Newtons.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.380
Our equation here states that the force between
two charged particles is equal to the product

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.400
of the two charges, divided by the distance
between them squared.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:54.240
And the distance is squared because, just like gravitation, when the distance between objects doubles, the force between them reduces to a quarter of the original value.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.730
And, ALSO as with gravitation, this force
has its own proportionality constant.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.080
It’s labeled lower-case k, and its value depends
on the medium that surrounds the charges.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.420
The vast majority of the time, the medium you’ll be working with will just be the air, or possibly a vacuum.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.240
And in both cases the constant is 9 times
10 to the ninth Coulombs.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.800
So when you multiply the rest of the expression
by k, that gives the result in terms of Newtons.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.580
This whole expression is known as Coulomb’s
Law.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.070
And k is often known as the Coulomb’s Law
constant.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:28.240
Now, gravitation and electrostatic forces work in totally different ways, of course, so we have to express them differently, too.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.220
The force of gravity, after all, is always
attractive.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:36.420
But the electrostatic forces can be either attractive or repulsive, depending on the signs of the charges.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:44.700
So the product of the two charges can be negative or positive, with the resulting sign of F being plus or minus, corresponding to either attraction or repulsion.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:46.630
Now, let’s put Coulomb’s Law to the test!

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.620
Let's say there are two electrons that are
1 nanometer apart.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.460
That’s 1 times 10 to the -9 meters.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:08:02.560
You can calculate the force between them by multiplying their charges, which are both -1.6 times 10 to the -19 Coulombs divided by the distance between them squared.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:08.700
You then multiply that by k, and the resulting force is positive 2.3 times 10 to the -10 Newtons.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.860
Now, notice that the answer is positive – that
means the electrons repel one another.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:21.440
If we used a proton and an electron the same distance apart, we’d get -2.3 times 10 to the -10 Newtons, meaning they’d attract one another.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.560
And just like other forces, vector addition
also applies here, too.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:31.880
This means we can solve for the net force on a charge by using Coulomb’s law on each pair of charges in any situation.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:37.680
From Coulomb’s law, we can calculate the magnitude of the force and find the direction based on the sign of the result.

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:44.840
So, from a simple trick with tape, and the help of a couple of animated rods, we’ve already uncovered the basics of electrostatic forces!

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:49.860
Next time, we’ll learn about electric fields and
how to visualize their effect on neighboring objects.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:54.660
Today, we learned about electrostatic forces, and how electrical charge can be altered and rearranged.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:09:00.080
We also discussed Coulomb’s law and how the force between charged particles is calculated using vectors.
