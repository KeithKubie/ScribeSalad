interpretation is I thought a lot about
 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.669
interpretation is I thought a lot about
what it means to interpret music and to

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:15.679
what it means to interpret music and to
 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:17.190

can get more beautiful playing that I

think somehow it be more true to the

less sound notation as i said is

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560
less sound notation as i said is

necessarily limited and I think that's

the beauty of interpretation is that you

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970
the beauty of interpretation is that you
 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.910
the beauty of interpretation is that you
have to take the notation and make it

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920
have to take the notation and make it
 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.540
have to take the notation and make it
your own and so when I study a piece I

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550
your own and so when I study a piece I
 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.530
your own and so when I study a piece I
try to work with it until I get to the

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540
try to work with it until I get to the
 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.240
try to work with it until I get to the
point where if I open the page the score

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250

to any page I get an immediate and

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440
to any page I get an immediate and
 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.320
to any page I get an immediate and
visceral response that this is how the

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330
visceral response that this is how the
 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.949
visceral response that this is how the
music goes and that means that I've made

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959
music goes and that means that I've made
 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.780
music goes and that means that I've made
choices but finally in a strange way my

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790
choices but finally in a strange way my
 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.880

personality has nothing to do with it of
 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.640
personality has nothing to do with it of
course in the actual performance you

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650
course in the actual performance you
 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.229
course in the actual performance you
have to be engaged you have to be

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239
have to be engaged you have to be
 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.550
have to be engaged you have to be
involved you have to be able to commit

able to go for something but i think

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360
able to go for something but i think
 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.140

that there's the mistaken idea people

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150
that there's the mistaken idea people
 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.030
that there's the mistaken idea people
talk about oh I like the interpretation

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040
talk about oh I like the interpretation
 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.920
talk about oh I like the interpretation
I think often when people talk about

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930
I think often when people talk about
 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.479
I think often when people talk about
interpretation in that way what they're

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489
interpretation in that way what they're
 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.630
interpretation in that way what they're
looking for is a quirky decision

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640
looking for is a quirky decision
 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.040
looking for is a quirky decision
something that that has obviously been

something that that has obviously been
 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.340
something that that has obviously been
worked out and for me as soon as i'm

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350
worked out and for me as soon as i'm
 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.370
worked out and for me as soon as i'm
aware of a decision having been made in

aware of a decision having been made in
 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.699
