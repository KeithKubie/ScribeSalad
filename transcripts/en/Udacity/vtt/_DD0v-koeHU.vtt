00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.331
Well let's see, I chose this point,

00:00:02.331 --> 00:00:05.053
and it looks like he
goes through this point.

00:00:05.053 --> 00:00:08.528
The coordinates of this point are zero,
zero and

00:00:08.528 --> 00:00:13.806
the coordinates of this point are one,
two, three, four, so x is four.

00:00:13.806 --> 00:00:17.950
And one, two, three, four, five,
six, so y is six, four, six.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.980
I guess that means the rise is six and
the run is four.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.746
So the slope would be rise over run,

00:00:24.746 --> 00:00:29.370
six over four, but I want to
simplify that to three over two.
