00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 in this capsule we will see an example 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.799
 of the performance of the tax collector for 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.360
 concretize all this example 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.120
 the execution of the tax collector's war 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.740
 shadow offered an iteration especially our 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.199
 training set that is given 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.640
 so we have each excited pair yt 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.160
 but in this case we have a very good example 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.420
 simple that one only four 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.810
 examples of training in our camp 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.279
 of training to make an example with 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.439
 a bias or I'm going to explicitly put 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.230
 the baby that will be adjusted in addition to the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.880
 w parameters and learning rate 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.010
 we're going to use it's going to be alpha and 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.230
 wins 0.1 so we'll assume that 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.960
 the user has determined that the sheet 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.039
 0.1 rittenband on time to run 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.450
 our mouth then what are we going to do 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.239
 we're going to start by initializing 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.949
 our perception so a realization 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.920
 possible it would mean that wba is 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.300
 equals a vector of 0 and then for this 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.079
 example if the bias have earned a series 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.219
 0.5 we have something else to complain about or 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.700
 0.5 is going to be actually more interesting 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.049
 for our example to illustrate 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.380
 the updates then have an example 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.750
 interesting so what do we do 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.659
 begins ay terrine includes the first 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.479
 hexion element there is so the first 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.759
 pair in our training room and 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.939
 we will do a calculation of the prediction 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:28.409
 extra skin take off foot wm by 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.700
 example as w00t 0 plus our ticket 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.369
 who 0.5 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.150
 so that gives an entry before the 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.470
 threshold function which of 0.56 as we have 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.869
 here and if we applied it it gives a 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.970
 prediction of 1 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.729
 now are we looking at hdx 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.329
 man who is one is equal to y 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.710
 a grigri is equal to 1 here so 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.490
 we do not even have it 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.259
 good prediction 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.740
 so in this case if we do not update 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:01.530
 our parameters w nor the baby parameter 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:05.189
 we go to the second example so the 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.220
 second example chi x 2 with the target y 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.080
 two and we do it again 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.590
 calculation but for the prediction for 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.250
 the x2 input one aw they have to revisit 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.620
 2 0 plus the bias that is still 0.5 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.040
 so it goes from the same prediction that is 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.769
 of 1 now in this case it's not 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.750
 in a prediction that is not the same 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:32.280
 that the desired target that is zero here 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.950
 so in this case we find at 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.040
 have to update w and peace bias 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.230
 with the stop that we saw previously 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.150
 so if we apply the vector rule 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.489
 have the rule say that the new double 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.950
 visit to the old w 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.959
 the higher the learning rate times the 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.349
 difference in place and the prediction 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:55.200
 times the entry so my double value 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:59.400
 life now it's 0 0 all 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.360
 learning is 0.1 times the target 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.900
 0 me my prediction that was 1.6 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:09.629
 times my vector 0.3 and so if I do 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:15.840
 this calculation gets the new w that is 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:18.239
 zero and - 0 - 0 point 3 and could 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.130
 update the bias so as we have 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.810
 seen previously makes a room a bit 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.670
 as a connection with an entry that 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.019
 is equal to 1 it is as if we had the 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.950
 same rule of the updates but with a 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:33.239
 here so we bias it 0.5 plus the auto 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:35.639
 learning 0.1 times the target less 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.620
 the one time prediction so that's like 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:43.530
 if we had nothing so that the good 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:45.150
 now will go to 0.4 so we 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.739
 sees that the current value of 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.209
 loaded settings made me to double 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:53.340
 life that is zero and comma - 0.3 and the 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.959
 well which is now at 0.15 we pass 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.030
 now third example 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:01.889
 of training made a prediction 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:10.319
 so we calculate h2x three gifts that are 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:13.680
 off 0 times for 3 which is zero + - 0 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:19.079
 point 3 x 0 I'm going all 6 0 so what 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:21.299
 saturday 0 here plus the bias which 0.4 so 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.150
 we obtain the function of thresholds on 0.4 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.469
 which again our prediction goes 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.000
 to be bad will not be equal to the 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:29.490
 target who 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.570
 should we and 10.0 for this example so 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.130
 again update wpp 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:38.300
 so what we get in this case 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:41.430
 is that the new parameter w is going to be 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:45.060
 launched by ammar which is the zero vector 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:48.360
 and minus 0.3 plus the rate 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.890
 learning 0.1 times the plate 0 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.750
 least the prediction made that was 1 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:58.770
 times my input vector they were 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:01.290
 3 and 0 rector with the first element 3 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.850
 2010 if we do this calculation hours on 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.120
 gets a new weight vector that 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.590
 will be less 0 point 3 - 0 point 3 and 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.510
 if we do the same thing for the bias 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:14.840
 we get a new ticket that will be 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.840
 of 0.3 that it will decrease by 0.1 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.010
 third example during fourth 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.770
 example so now new 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.360
 parameter values ​​and bias 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.790
 forgiveness and good weight vectors 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:30.500
 before - 0 point 3 months 0.3 for the 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:33.510
 w vector and a ticket that will be at 0.3 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.490
 we take our fourth example in the 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.030
 training center we calculate the 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.280
 prediction 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:44.010
 so here we will have less 0.3 times a 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:49.610
 plus - 0 point 3 x 1 what will give 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:52.140
 - 0 points 10-6 plus my piquet of 0.3 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.560
 we'll say but that's what will give me - 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:58.290
 0.3 so we will get a prediction 2 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.669
 0 unfortunately it turns out that in 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:03.720
 the training intention the vector 1 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:05.940
 1 was associated with target 1 so we 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.910
 not equal between the prediction and 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.290
 lascivious we apply again our 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.800
 learning eye that makes our 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:18.180
 new w that's going to be the current vector 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:20.550
 for w - 0 point 3 - 0 point 3 plus 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.610
 the other learning times practice 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:26.250
 forgiveness the target minus the prediction times 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.470
 the input vector which is the vector 1 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.860
 it gives us a nice value of w which 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.970
 will be less 0 point 2 - 0 point even 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.780
 thing for beers we get a 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:38.099
 new ticket that will be 0.15 then 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.870
 that we would continue like that we prefer 

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:40.330
 a new iteration on the whole 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.250
 between them 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.330
 and we would continue like this until 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.979
 whether we reach a number 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.759
 maximum iterations or that we have 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:51.129
 reaches a value of w and berries 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:52.719
 our parameters as we always do 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:55.120
 the good prediction is to say that 

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:56.650
 for this vector and its vectors there we 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.659
 actually predicts a 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:03.569
 and for this vector the inspector the dance 

00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:03.569
 in training we predict well 0
