or anyone else so I got to thinking that
 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.750

perhaps these two systems needed to find

perhaps these two systems needed to find
 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.170

a way to talk to each other or at least
to cross paths and to do that I took as

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510
to cross paths and to do that I took as
 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.940
to cross paths and to do that I took as
the basis of a sort of a thought

namely I took God to be as literally

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060
namely I took God to be as literally
 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.069

substance in the world to do that I

substance in the world to do that I
 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.050
substance in the world to do that I
decided that I would attempt to

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060
decided that I would attempt to
 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.510
decided that I would attempt to
scientifically figure out where on the

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520
scientifically figure out where on the
 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.480
scientifically figure out where on the
phylogenetic tree which is the master

you might put god what species is God

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550
you might put god what species is God
 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.610
you might put god what species is God
that was a question that I asked myself

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620
that was a question that I asked myself
 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.630
that was a question that I asked myself
and then I had to find a way to address

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640
and then I had to find a way to address
 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.110
and then I had to find a way to address
it scientifically so science has many

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.940
it scientifically so science has many
different ways in which you can pursue

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950
different ways in which you can pursue
 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.490
different ways in which you can pursue
such a question probably the most

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500
such a question probably the most
 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.149
such a question probably the most
obvious would be to obtain DNA for God

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159
obvious would be to obtain DNA for God
 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.479
obvious would be to obtain DNA for God
but I couldn't get my hands on that so

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489
but I couldn't get my hands on that so
 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.149
but I couldn't get my hands on that so
another possibility I realized was to

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159
another possibility I realized was to
 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.339
another possibility I realized was to
attempt to genetically engineer God in a

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349
attempt to genetically engineer God in a
 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.460
attempt to genetically engineer God in a
laboratory and so I found collaborators

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470
laboratory and so I found collaborators
 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.280
laboratory and so I found collaborators
at UC Berkeley and several other

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290
at UC Berkeley and several other
 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.470

institutions who are willing to help me
 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.500

such a way that you favor certain random
 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.440
such a way that you favor certain random
mutations over others and you sort of

one direction versus another it works

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400
one direction versus another it works
 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.800
one direction versus another it works
very well for instance if we're talking

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810
very well for instance if we're talking
 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.250

nobody had ever tried this in terms of

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200
nobody had ever tried this in terms of
 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.280

attempting to genetically engineer God
 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.819
attempting to genetically engineer God
so I set up my experiment and saw where

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829
so I set up my experiment and saw where
 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.940
so I set up my experiment and saw where
it went I took two different candidate

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950
it went I took two different candidate
 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.509
it went I took two different candidate
species to species that were based on

the best source material that i could

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530
the best source material that i could
 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.309
the best source material that i could
find the bible for instance and various

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319
find the bible for instance and various
 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.530
find the bible for instance and various
other religious tracts that on the one

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540
other religious tracts that on the one
 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.619
other religious tracts that on the one
hand tell us that God came first on the

hand tell us that God came first on the
 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.860
hand tell us that God came first on the
other hand that told us that God created

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870
other hand that told us that God created
 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.920
other hand that told us that God created
man in His image so it seemed that I

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930
man in His image so it seemed that I
 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.409
man in His image so it seemed that I
should look to the earliest extant

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419
should look to the earliest extant
 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:03.949
should look to the earliest extant
species which are cyanobacteria on the

species which are cyanobacteria on the
 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.319
species which are cyanobacteria on the
one hand and I should look to humans on

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329
one hand and I should look to humans on
 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.759
one hand and I should look to humans on
the other well humans are very difficult

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769
the other well humans are very difficult
 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.409
the other well humans are very difficult
to work with in a laboratory over

to work with in a laboratory over
multiple generations so i worked with

figured that since people are always
praying to God maybe there's some way in

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780
praying to God maybe there's some way in
 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.710
praying to God maybe there's some way in
which God metabolizes worshiped so I

took leading prayers for each of the
 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.580
took leading prayers for each of the
major monotheistic religions and as a

radio so over seven days and nights I

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690
radio so over seven days and nights I
 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.010
radio so over seven days and nights I
ran the experiment and then I looked for

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020
ran the experiment and then I looked for
 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.230
ran the experiment and then I looked for
one of the qualities that is often

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240
one of the qualities that is often
 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.510
one of the qualities that is often
associated with godliness as a way of

associated with godliness as a way of
 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.490
associated with godliness as a way of
measuring these two different species

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500

and so I was interested in this project

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100
and so I was interested in this project

in this thought experiment in trying to

in this thought experiment in trying to
figure out whether there was a way in

works so I looked to both science and

so what happens if we take the

so what happens if we take the
 

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:19.790
so what happens if we take the
scientific method and we apply it to the

they are incompatible and you can put
them together and try out combinations
