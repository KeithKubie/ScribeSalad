00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.460
This is two amp fuse wire

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:09.000
it's copper, tinned copper wire which used to be used in old fashioned fuses

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and George has this long bit of fuse wire, which is hung between two electrodes.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
You probably can't see so we put some paper on this wire

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.700
and you see the line across there and then it comes along here

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.500
Well this is a wire which is jittering a bit because ... I don't know why ..

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.760
you do just leave me ...

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Allright it's hanging there in a shape which doesn't seem to be particularly special.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.840
Now I am going to turn the current on

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.160
This is volts going up and this is the current in amperes.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.080
So it goes all the way up and this goes up to 1.8 amps roughly, 1.75

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.020
So this is below the point where the fuse wire will melt.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.820
So now, I am going to do the experiment. I am going to turn the current on

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.900
and here it goes up to 1.8 amps

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.660
and now I am going to turn it off.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.680
on

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.640
off

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.920
It's reversible: it goes up, it goes down.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.520
on

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.760
off

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.620
on

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.500
off

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.800
When the current's on, it goes through the fuse wire

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.940
and because of the resistance of the fuse wire

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.360
it heats up - that's what a fuse wire is for

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.520
it's meant to heat up and melt when you get up to about 200Â°C

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.700
this gets up somewhere near there.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.040
so we are not melting this

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.900
We are just heating it up quite a bit

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.220
and as we heat it up it expands

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.940
and you normally can't see the expansion of a metal when you heat it up

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.720
but here you can

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.940
So this sagging in the middle is due to the fact that the wire has got

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.920
a little bit longer. Less than 1% increase in length will cause it to sag by that amount

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.120
So this is a measure of the current going through

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.620
That's the first thing, current leads to heat, changes the temperature

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.980
leads to expansion, leads to sagging.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.120
Now I've got another magic box

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.980
This is a magic box with an N on the top because that's probably something to do with north

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.760
and something else on the bottom - south

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.320
I am not meant to take this out. George tells me that if I take it out

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.160
it will then suck itself into anything and cause great dammage

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.820
oh it's a magnet, allright, here it is

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.800
another one of these neodymium magnets

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.660
it's very, very strong and I am very clumsy with these things

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.540
you put near a piece of metal it will disappear into it.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.540
So now I've got a magnet

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.780
if I put this horizontally nothing much happens

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.240
but if I put it this way

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.540
as I move the magnet towards the wire

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.800
you can see it's repelled quite strongly

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.240
If I turn it rount the other way

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.660
so now the north pole is at the bottom

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.220
it should pull in the other way, can you see that Brady?

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.780
yeah

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.780
it comes and hits the magnet

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.360
What's going on?

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.800
And if I put it horizontally not much happens, well

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.360
there is a magnetic field going this way

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.420
and when a current goes down the wire this way

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.420
that leads to a force on the wire

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.360
in a ... not in this direction, not in that direction but in the third direction, perpendicular to it.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.240
And if I turn the magnetic field round I change the direction of the force

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.060
so this is the force between a moving charge and a magnetic field

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.460
which acts in a funny, funny way. Which you normally can't see

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.660
but here it's very graphic cause I got such a strong magnetic field you can actually see it beeing repelled

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.600
If I were to be a magician in the 19th century (8, 20th century?)

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.980
and I wanted to go on stage and fool people

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.060
and I set this up it would look as though I had magic powers, pushing it away

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.040
oh, float my beauty

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.740
If I now turn the current off

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.420
you have a wire without any current

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.020
and you have no effect at all, it is proportional to the current

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.020
this is sagging a little bit

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.780
it would move if it could but it doesn't want to because there's no current.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.480
Pretty cool. Yeah I love this because I mean

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.840
thermal expansion used to be one experiment and you could never measure it

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.780
and this thing, the force on a moving current, you could never see it, it's so weak

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.000
and now I can see both, cause the magnet is so big

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.360
So this is, this is, George again to the rescue, this is wonderful, thank you George.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.800
We're talking about the rotation of the earth or other objects and the effects of small forces that can disturb that
