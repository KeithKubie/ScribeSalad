[sparse electronic music]

â™«

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.860
You say you're sorry 
and you're leaving

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.500
Don't think we'll work out
and it's just a feeling

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.979
I say hey baby,
don't you worry

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.440
Just want you happy 
and if it's not me, then

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.020
You can go on your way

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.580
I'd never force you to stay

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.520
But I'm so far from okay (yeah)

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.840
(Oh oh) Let's be alone together

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.240
Oh, can we be alone together?

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.760
You can go off on your own
I'll love you whether

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.180
I'm all alone
But we're alone together

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.640
You tell yourself
this is the right thing

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.980
Oh yes, you miss me 
and you're so damn lonely

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.600
But you don't come back in the morning

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.720
I fall asleep 
dreaming that you hold me

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.560
You don't reach out again

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.940
And I'm just here wondering

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.060
How long were you pretending?

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.300
(Oh oh) Let's be alone together

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.660
Oh, can we be alone together?

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.200
You can go off on your own
I'll love you whether

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.560
I'm all alone
But we're alone together

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.080
(Oh oh) Let's be alone together

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.560
Oh, can we be alone together?

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.980
You can go off on your own
I'll love you whether

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.320
I'm all alone
But we're alone together

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.400
[pause]

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.700
(Oh oh) Let's be alone together

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.320
Oh, can we be alone together?

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.600
You can go off on your own
I'll love you whether

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.180
I'm all alone
But we're alone together

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.420
(Oh oh) Let's be alone together

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.940
Oh, can we be alone together?

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.460
You can go off on your own
I'll love you whether

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.760
I'm all alone
But we're alone together
