00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.270
A couple of more things about the model
that are similar to what we did

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.760
before for the Kalman, okay?

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.600
Since I know some of you have a machine
learning background a little bit

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.720
drawn here is a graphical model.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.270
The idea is that x is only impacted by

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.220
what the x was before, and
what the new protobation is.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.660
And the z's, the measurements, are only
a function of the current state,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.700
all right.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.780
And that's written in the following way,
right.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.480
The first thing says the probability of
the measurement, given all the states,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.990
given all my histories,
only a function of the current state and

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.660
that's sometimes called
sensor independence.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.230
Okay, the sensing is only dependent
on the current state, all right.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.720
The other element is this one that
says the probability of the next

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.100
state given all of these things that
came in and including the states before

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.070
is only a function of where we were
before plus the current input.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.190
And by the way, here, this is
written as ut, not the ut minus 1,

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.410
that's what I was telling
you about before.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.130
The shame on me,
because I did both of those and

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.280
I should have made them consistent.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.860
But the idea,
this is the Markovian property, right?

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.910
We ha, we had the Markovian
property last time also.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.590
And Markovian property says,
if I know the state at the last time,

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.310
none of the earlier state information,
none of the earlier measurements,

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.600
none of the earlier anything
matter except the state then.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.740
And then the one thing we've
added new this time is action

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.300
at the current time, okay?

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.750
That's the Markovian property.
