00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, let's take a few stabs at it.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It seems like we definitely want 0 through 9+

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
to get the first part of any phone number.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
What about this regular expression?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We have 0 through 9+, and then as many times as you like

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
we have a hyphen, and then 0 through 9+ again

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
as kind of a group.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This actually works quite well.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
However, if we were to put a star here instead of a +,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
this one accepts -6 by just skipping this part

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and doing this part once, -6, and then we're done.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We don't like this.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And as we've mentioned, regular expressions admit room for creativity.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
What if I want to do this interesting grouping at the beginning?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
What if I say you can have as many of the 08-78-88- things as you want

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
as long as you end with some final numbers?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
This one also works.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You may remember the hyphenated word problem we had from before.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This hyphenated phone number problem is actually quite similar,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
but now that we know how to do grouping

00:00:58.000 --> 09:59:59.000
with parentheses, it's much easier to solve.
