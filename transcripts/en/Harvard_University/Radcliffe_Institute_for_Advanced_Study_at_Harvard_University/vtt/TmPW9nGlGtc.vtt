00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.265
-Thank you, Judy.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.580
Such a warm welcome makes
me feel like such a fraud,

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.650
but I know I am, as
many of you are, so

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.170
lucky to be at the
Radcliffe this year.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.430
And I thank Dean
Liz Cohen, Judy,

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.390
and the smartness
of the reviewers

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.010
in getting us all here.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.900
But I recognize it to
be an academic idyll,

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.470
which most of the
universities that we come from

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.110
are no longer, and so I want
to talk about neoliberalism

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.260
to some extent and
how wonder works

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.100
with the neoliberal worlds.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.750
Many of you heard in
my introductory story

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.590
last week-- I spoke about
how I started the origin

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.490
story for this work,
when I literally

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.540
stumbled over four priests
trying to physically push

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.460
a cow into a mirrored
luxury elevator.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.540
And I wondered why, and I was
told that the ritual would

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.520
be wonderful, which it was.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.710
And so I stumbled
serendipitously

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.300
into this project of thinking
about wonder, and as Judy said,

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.310
it's taken me an enormously
long time-- 16 years.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.700
But it grew out of two
very simple questions.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.529
The first one was scholarly,
and the second one was personal.

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:38.820
We'll start with the scholarly.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:48.880
Can anyone tell the encompassing
story of a radically diverse,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.620
ancient society like
India that's propelled,

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:59.060
pushed into the modern moment
through recording fragments

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.480
of creative enterprise?

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:09.160
And can one design a good
life-- a personal question--

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.100
in a neoliberal context?

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.760
The two questions
might seem divergent,

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.280
and indeed I'd consider
them very divergent.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.760
But they've come
to a focus, and I

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.630
hope I'll elucidate this
focus as I go forward.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.490
When I speak of
neoliberalism, I'm

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.910
using it in the
simplest sense-- what

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.930
Jean and John Comaroff
here at Harvard

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.980
called "millennial capitalism"
and the radical sort

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.820
of uncertainty and precarity
it brings to our lives.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.950
So I turned to my hometown
of Bangalore for answers,

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.250
and Bangalore is acknowledged
to be, as Judy told you,

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.020
the Silicon Valley of Asia.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.300
It is the center for biotech,
for information technology.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.990
It is a center for innovation.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.810
And at one point in
2007, it was supposed

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.200
to be the fastest
growing city in Asia.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.330
And to just give
you a sense, in 1990

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.660
when I left to go to school--
I think of it as a town,

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.530
forgive me-- it was
2.9 million people.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.430
I went to Denmark to
speak, and they reared back

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.110
when I said a "town"
of 2.9 million people.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.660
But in 2010, the
latest census we have,

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.000
we had an estimate of 9.2,
and that is just an estimate

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.590
of families that were counted.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.130
There are many people living in
precarious slum circumstances

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.890
that are not counted
in the census.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.140
So you can see the
radical shift in 20 years.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.670
I'm going to come back
to Socrates in a minute.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.670
So that's typical Bangalore.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.560
And as you can see,
it's centrally located

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.720
in the subcontinent of India.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.300
It's an exciting
cosmopolitan city.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.250
It's a hub of disruptive
innovation or creativity,

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.490
of building and patenting
new technologies.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.700
The Fortune 500 companies
there are largely

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.040
software-based companies, IT
companies, biotech companies.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.150
It's supposedly known for
curating new ideas, objects.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.370
People think of it as an icon
of smokeless kind of growth.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.270
So I thought, surely, the
bourgeoisie of Bangalore

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.520
would be able to tell me
something about a good life

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.640
and how to live it, right?

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.920
Surely, they grasped at
what a good life would be.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.480
At the top of this building is
the fanciest bar in Bangalore,

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.136
and the cover charge is $700.

00:04:37.136 --> 00:04:38.510
That's before you
start drinking.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.240
I began study in February
1998, and in the 17 short years

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.250
since then, neoliberal
policies have

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.150
affected the city spectacularly,
increasing growth,

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.530
as I mentioned.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.820
It moved from being
a safe green city

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.950
that I grew up in
to a city where

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:11.600
water shortages, rolling
blackouts, extreme poverty

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.970
and inequality, cutting
of the green cover,

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.250
desertification-- all that
was happening simultaneously

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.390
as I was doing the study.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:26.580
This was one of the main
streets in 1967, I believe,

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.070
and this is the
same street today.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.010
So the anthropological
proposition that follows

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.710
is very simple.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:34.460
It's modest.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.360
It's in three parts.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.330
And in this talk,
I'm going to take

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.640
a slice of a slice
of a larger question,

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.560
and I'm going to deal
with technology here.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.680
But the larger anthropological
proposition about wonder

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.900
is as follows.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.700
Can we try to make it visible?

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.990
Can we "f" the
ineffability of wonder?

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.300
Can we think of an
invitation to wonder

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.360
as a strategic yet passionate
act that can be hosted,

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.600
built, captured, and stoked?

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.330
And can we explore this
sort of experimental ethos

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.760
within which wonder is created?

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.560
And can we think about
creativity differently?

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.740
And what are the ethics of
a creative, contingent act?

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.660
So I'm going to try and
work my way around these.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.370
I probably won't
get all of them,

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.010
but let's see how far I get.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.880
And I would really,
really encourage

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:37.490
you to push me on all this,
because I am struggling my way

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.500
thinking through it.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.700
So what I'm aiming
to do is to construct

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.880
what I see as a very urgently
needed conceptual framework

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.940
to understand contemporary
religious practice

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.650
in the margins of what
we consider technically

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.750
religion and ethical life.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.600
In academe, I've tried to
bust my way into philosophy

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.000
departments, into religious
studies departments,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.790
and India and
Hinduism-- there have

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.530
been questions about what
kind of religion is it.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.770
Is it practice-based?

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.080
It's theologies.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.140
And so it raises very
interesting questions

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.075
as to what is a religion
in the first place.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:24.131
So this is the
neighborhood I studied.

00:07:24.131 --> 00:07:25.380
It's in the north of the city.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.755
It's called
Malleshwaram, but you

00:07:26.755 --> 00:07:28.230
don't have to remember that.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.940
And it was carved
out of virgin forest.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.250
And as you can see on
the Google Maps page,

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.190
it's known for its temples.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.350
The first thing that
pops up is the temples.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.430
And so if you get
closer now, these

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.785
are the two temples I studied.

00:07:42.785 --> 00:07:46.790
On Google Maps, they're within
quarter of a mile, half a mile,

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:47.730
of one another.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:53.900
And the symbol for
a temple is the ohm.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.030
So I began to study ritual
in two Hindu temples

00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:00.030
in this neighborhood, and
I divided it carefully

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:02.530
between the two
large Hindu sects.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.600
Vaishnavism, those who
worship Vishnu, and Shaivism,

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.470
those who worship Shiva.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.700
So this is the Ganesha Temple
for those who worship Shiva,

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.040
and this is the deity.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.200
And he's dressed in
tropical fruit on that day.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.330
Guavas, pineapples
are all sliced,

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:23.110
and the image is
made out of fruit.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.360
And somebody yesterday, when
I showed them this slide,

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.430
said, wow, think of the
number of fruit flies.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.120
Yes, there are plenty of flies.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.090
And Ganesha is the
elephant-faced god

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:35.659
who protects, and
then we have Vishnu

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:39.340
in the form of
the flute cowherd.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:48.700
And he is the sort of
redemptive, blue-faced god.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.130
So I decided to study
ritual in these two temples,

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:56.740
and I can hear you
think, why ritual?

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.330
And let me explain why.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.820
Quite simply put, ritual is
the counterintuitive case

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.130
to creativity.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:04.400
Let me explain that.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.170
Ritual is always taught by
anthropologists and others

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.850
who study rituals to be
the antithesis of change.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:15.220
It is where we go for tradition,
for stability, for continuity.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.040
Gregory Bateson, Clifford
Geertz, Catherine Bell

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.710
have talked about
this repeatedly.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.830
So any changes in
ritual-- any creativity,

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:30.090
I would argue-- have been
misdiagnosed as a disruption,

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:34.840
and I'm quoting, "a mistake, a
flaw, a distortion, an error,

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.640
or a failure."

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.880
So sites of creativity
that anthropologists

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.010
typically study--
and I'm not going

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.840
to go into all the
anthropologists,

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.160
but I'm looking at
South Asia particularly.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.540
Anand Pandian studies cinema.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.060
Kirin Narayan studies songs.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.640
Tim Ingold doesn't study
South Asia, studies Britain,

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.200
but studies drawing
and painting.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.850
And these are the classical
sides, artistic sides,

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:04.700
that we think of as
sites of creativity.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.960
But I want to argue that
ritual is creative, too,

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.830
and this comes out
of my dissertation

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.290
defense at Harvard.

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:16.080
Because I started talking about
these disruptions and failures,

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.880
and a very famous professor,
who shall remain nameless,

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.300
said to me, but we know
these guys are creative.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.210
That's nothing new.

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:26.460
And I thought, really?

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.080
I've never read that.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:34.130
So then I thought, if we know we
it, why isn't it written down?

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:36.780
So I started thinking
about my own education.

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.460
And there's a famous essay by
a very famous anthropologist

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:40.340
Clifford Geertz.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.756
A specialist audience will
know where I'm going with this,

00:10:42.756 --> 00:10:45.420
but hey, I'll continue.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.460
All anthropologists read
this in graduate school

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.370
if they don't read
it as an undergrad,

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:54.910
and it's about the funeral of
a young boy in Java, Indonesia.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.880
I'm going to paraphrase
and bastardize,

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.950
but anyway, what happens is
this young boy dies unexpectedly

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.860
when he's living at
his uncle's house.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.760
And his uncle happens to
have a new religious, secular

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.610
political identity.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:11.720
The priest comes
over and says, well,

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.670
I can't do this funeral because
you are not a [? Bangan ?].

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.140
You're not of the
traditional type.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.440
The uncle gets infuriated
and says, look,

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.300
this child has just died.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.800
You need to do something.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:30.515
So the entire village is thrown
into a moment of conflict.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.850
And so Geertz talks about
this conflict, talks

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:40.290
about this funeral, and he
notes that funerals in Java

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:44.290
are meant to be, as he says,
"a languid letting go."

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:48.100
But here the residents show
"a froth of unusual emotion"--

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.830
I'm quoting-- "screaming and
crying, thinking and arguing,

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:55.050
sulking and storming away," and
meanwhile the body of the boy

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:57.300
simmers in the sunshine.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.270
Geertz is focused on the fear
and confusion of the villagers.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:03.200
The stalling and the
questioning pulls us back

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.970
into that concept of
social structure--

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:11.860
that rituals elevate us
to a movement, that is,

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.110
that defies social structure.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:17.780
And then we are brought back
it into a social structure

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:21.410
in an enhanced, elevated state.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:25.730
Well, one can, I argue, read
this text very differently,

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:27.790
because what happens
in the end of the story

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.910
is that, in point of fact,
the parents of the boy

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:35.190
traveled to the uncle's house
and they find a way out.

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.600
They actually improvise
something that works.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.850
So why don't we read
it as a case study

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.620
of the initial
origin of creativity

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.810
rather than the
failure of ritual?

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:51.620
That would point to a
different direction.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.310
So unlike contemporary
theorists,

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:54.810
who then begin with
social structure

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:58.530
and ask what ritual does--
its efficacy, its abilities,

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:01.910
its domestication of
strange forces, et cetera--

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:06.670
if we take Geertz's moment
as a moment of creativity,

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:10.210
we then ask what is a ritual.

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:13.530
Very different question.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:16.050
And I want to ask
this simple question.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:17.290
What is it?

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.200
How does it allow
for contingency?

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.290
How does it allow for a
radical revisionist reading?

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:25.460
How this vision uncoils
surreptitiously.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.887
It draws together
modernity and religion.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.690
And here I focus on a
very small snippet--

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:35.440
as I said, a snippet
of a snippet--

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.980
and I'm going to talk about
technology because technology

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.915
is, to many people,
enchanted in the first place.

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:46.880
I'm going to drag
you unfortunately--

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.865
I hope not kicking
and screaming--

00:13:48.865 --> 00:13:50.490
through a little bit
of theory before I

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.800
get to the fascinating
stories I encountered.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.620
So Jonathan C. Smith
suggests that ritual

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.017
is a particular mode
of paying attention.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.820
It's a way of attending
more closely to our habitus,

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.245
and it is about the
doing of religion.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.320
And let me show you three
slides in quick succession.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.970
The first one was taken in 1999,
and it is the same procession

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:20.550
taken over 12 years.

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.780
So here the Lord
Krishna is taken out

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.820
in an evening procession-- the
scent of his jasmine garlands.

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:31.146
There's drumming and the white
umbrellas of sacred kingship.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.340
This is six years later.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.610
You can see electric
light has intruded.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.350
You can see they're
doing it in the evening.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.580
The god seems to
almost fade away

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.160
in the way the lights
are positioned.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.243
And there's a video light.

00:14:45.243 --> 00:14:47.250
That's what makes it so bright.

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:50.770
And this was in
2009, and you can

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:54.640
see that technology now changes
the devotee's relationship

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.520
to the god.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.070
You collect pictures of the god.

00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:01.120
They're on your phone, versus
the face to face version

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.960
that Diana Eck has talked
so beautifully about.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.210
So if we think about it as
a mode of paying attention,

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:11.671
what does technology do to
this mode of paying attention?

00:15:11.671 --> 00:15:13.330
Philip Fisher--
more beautifully,

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:18.950
Stephen Greenblatt-- tells us
that if we think about wonder,

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:22.090
it is visuality that
motivates us, the visual.

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:24.350
And that has an
enchantment all its own.

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:28.250
Here visual
experimentation consciously

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.690
opposes ritual creativity.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.440
We'll get back to that.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.680
And ritual creativity
here is a crucial means

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.060
of engaging contingency.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.530
So improvisation becomes
a core around which

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:42.718
creativity is generated.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.220
This was in Bangalore.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:54.250
So Bangalore is very
big on creativity.

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:57.310
And as an aside,
when I was writing

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:59.690
this last week-- I was
writing this talk last week--

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.170
and I was in a hospital--
it had become clearer

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:05.940
why I was in this talk-- I
started watching the TV news.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:09.790
And it's astounding how
frequently creativity, wonder,

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:12.490
curiosity keep repeating.

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:14.830
And I was watching the
news, so this was Viagra,

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.650
this was car
commercials, this was GE.

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:21.030
That's what they
were talking about.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.250
So creativity is endemic,
as we understand it

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.610
in the modern world,
to new technologies

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:28.130
and new ways of being.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:31.350
Now, it's not that
anthropologists have not

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:32.890
talked about wonder.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:35.870
Margaret Mead, the
mother of anthropology,

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.320
talked about wonder
very early on.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.040
And she says, "Anthropology
demands the open-mindedness

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.600
with which one must look and
listen, record in astonishment

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.550
and wonder at that
which one would not

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.250
have been able to guess."

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.310
So wonder for me is a
bewilderment at the engagement

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:55.980
of the Other, capital "O."

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:59.970
So it seems to me, well,
we don't hear of wonder

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:01.430
after Margaret Mead.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:04.380
Anthropologists have been
strangely silent on wonder,

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.089
and my question was why.

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:09.940
So I think that an
ethnography of wonder

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:14.050
is both timely and urgent.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:16.300
Why this urgency, you ask?

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.740
And let me simply
put it that when

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:24.470
we try to imagine new
worlds-- and I think

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.160
this will speak to what
the Radcliffe does-- when

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.850
we try to imagine new worlds and
we build upon them or we build

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:35.449
them, we open up creative
"what if" possibilities.

00:17:35.449 --> 00:17:36.990
That is what we are
attempting to do,

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:41.040
and these "what if"s are the
center of all inquiry when we

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.370
dream of a world that
we cannot imagine today.

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:46.690
And it is the goal to
building new economies,

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:52.050
new technologies, new ways
of being, new resistances,

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.520
new imaginings, new
revolutions, et cetera.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:58.450
And so we come back to Socrates,
where wisdom begins in wonder.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.590
So there's a difference
here, of course,

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:02.489
between wonderment
and wondering,

00:18:02.489 --> 00:18:03.780
and I'm playing with those two.

00:18:06.904 --> 00:18:08.320
So the Oxford
English Dictionary--

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.850
I know I'm talking about the
Oxford English Dictionary

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:11.475
and you have one of
the templates here,

00:18:11.475 --> 00:18:16.550
but I like the sort
of disturbance--

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.710
defines wonder as
"an emotion excited

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:22.070
by the perception of something
novel, something unexpected."

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:25.990
It extends to astonishment,
perplexity, bewilderment.

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:31.180
And in the Greek "thaumazein,"
the sudden descent of wonder

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:34.392
implies that you are passive
and you are wonder-struck,

00:18:34.392 --> 00:18:36.320
struck by wonder.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.990
But how passive are we?

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:41.430
An essential definition brings
to the forefront how little

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:42.890
we actually know about wonder.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:48.470
We see it as a passive
condition that we receive.

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.480
It's extraordinariness,
it's suddenness,

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.100
it's seemingly divine
rupturing into the mundane.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.290
So mundane is set in
opposition to wonderment.

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.050
In the 18th and 19th
centuries, if one

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:00.780
looks at the Western
intellectual history

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:04.320
of wonder-- Dunstan and Park
have done excellent work

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.480
on this, on science and how
wonder breeds curiosity.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.210
It breeds collection,
as in the Wunderkammers,

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:14.480
and you get Galvani and Boyle,
the natural philosophers,

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.666
talking about everything
from the human body

00:19:17.666 --> 00:19:19.290
to the crumbling
edges of the universe.

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.080
I know if Demetrius
were here, he

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.540
would say they
are not crumbling.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:28.890
But it's a childlike amazement
that fuels us to ask.

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:31.260
And Philip Fisher
has said that wonder

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.610
is "a sudden experience of
an extraordinary object that

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:38.250
produces delight."

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:40.610
We'll hold that thought.

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:42.226
But I bring it into
the 20th century,

00:19:42.226 --> 00:19:43.850
and I start looking
at who writes about

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:44.990
wonder in the 20th century.

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:47.960
And there is this
strange German scholar--

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:53.770
forgive me, Bob Orsi--
Rudolf Otto, who

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:55.840
writes this beautiful
book The Idea of the Holy,

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.300
Das Heilige, in which he
talks about the feeling

00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.630
of the numinous.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.720
And this feeling of the
numinous is essentially

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.730
a feeling of wonderment.

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:10.800
And I'm quoting Greg Alles who
has written this book on Otto.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.680
For Alles, Otto's
numinous encompasses--

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.610
and I say it in alphabetical
order-- awe, bewilderment,

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:21.000
curiosity, confusion,
excitement, ecstasy, fear,

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.210
dread, marvel, mystery,
perplexity, reverence,

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.860
surprise, and supplication.

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:28.960
So it includes not only
the psychological effects

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.930
of receiving wonder, but,
as human beings perceive it,

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:35.280
of placing that wonder
squarely back on the Other

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.630
as the numinous of the divine.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:40.236
So we feel it and we
ascribe it to divinity.

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:46.770
Strangely, the Upanishads
say the same thing,

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:51.230
and they were
2,500 years before.

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:53.280
By the way, I
couldn't resist this.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.290
This is a decoration
made of American corn

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:59.280
two weeks ago for
the Ganesha Festival.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.430
A chandelier of corn seemed
particularly wondrous

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:03.660
of American corn.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:07.680
America has-- I won't use
the word dumped, but pushed

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.230
a lot of its corn,
as many of you know,

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:12.280
to different
economies, and this is

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.360
the way the priests
in Bangalore use it.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:23.450
This is the essential Hindu
moment of looking at the god

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:27.450
and having the god look back
at you to recognize you.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:31.750
Offering up the camphor flame,
the priest and his two sons.

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:38.426
And the devotion to the deity.

00:21:38.426 --> 00:21:44.050
And this is me, and this
is my back doing fieldwork.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:46.040
I am wondrous.

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.005
I'm wondering, and I'm
bewildered and I'm perplexed.

00:21:49.005 --> 00:21:53.630
And I keep asking them
repeatedly questions.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:55.740
And I liked it because
the priests are explaining

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.080
something to me, and there's
the processional guard

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.920
in the foreground
and the guard looking

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.710
at me from inside the alcove.

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:05.960
And this is the priest who
was a sort of philosopher,

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.750
an extempore philosopher.

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:10.500
He taught me everything
I know, and I told him

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.200
at the end of 15 years I
am so grateful that you

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.156
are the priest because
I could never be one.

00:22:15.156 --> 00:22:16.530
And he said, yes,
you're a woman.

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:18.571
You couldn't be one anyway,
but if you were a man

00:22:18.571 --> 00:22:20.790
you would have made
a very good priest.

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:21.560
I'll take that.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:30.390
So to go back to my story, the
Upanishads 2,500 years ago talk

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:32.210
about wonder, and
they talk about

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:34.180
wonder in a fascinating way.

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.740
And I take this excerpt from
the Taittirya Upanishad,

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:40.150
which Kirin Narayan
brought to my notice.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:44.530
And I've marked the words
that are important in red.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.480
Haavu, haavu, haavu.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.240
We have no essential
translation of this,

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.400
but it has been translated by
the mystical philosopher J.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:58.510
Krishnamurti as "oh, wonderful,
oh, wonderful, oh, wonder."

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.080
Aham-annam-- "I am the food."

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.420
Aham-annam.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.270
Annam-aham.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:06.850
"I am the food, I am the food,
I am the eater of the food."

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:11.080
The story behind this is of
a saint who suddenly realizes

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.370
in a moment of
self-transformation the oneness

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:16.370
of the universe, and he realizes
he is not only the eater;

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:17.160
he is the food.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.150
The tyranny and
beauty of universality

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:26.720
comes through to him.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:31.960
And I put it up in Sanskrit
because the long r's

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.730
that are part of the
text are the [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.710
They are essentially
stating ecstasy.

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:42.810
He's in an ecstatic
moment of wonderment.

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:46.990
So wonder haunts this
text from 2,500 years ago,

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:49.620
and from this text we understand
it's a point of convergence.

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:52.620
He says, "suvarna
jyothi." "I am effulgent.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.110
I am radiant with wonder."

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:57.000
It's a point of
convergence not only

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.420
of technologies of information,
of knowledge, self-knowledge

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:04.290
and other knowledge, but of
the soul-- so technologies

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:08.620
of information,
technologies of the soul.

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:10.610
Bear with me.

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:14.500
So back to the
temples in Bangalore

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:18.510
and to the first story, which I
called the "Animatronic Devi."

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:21.260
In October of every year, the
Hindu festival of Navratri,

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.970
of nine nights devoted
to the female principle,

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:29.870
occurs, and I'm quoting verbatim
from my field notes here.

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:33.220
And the female principle in
this particular nine nights

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.530
engages in a battle,
so it's basically

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:40.080
consciousness over ego,
the deity representing

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:45.217
consciousness and the
battle between the deity

00:24:45.217 --> 00:24:45.800
and the demon.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.560
The demon represents the ego.

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.250
The beautiful deity of
higher consciousness

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:55.410
is trying to defeat
Mahisha, the demonic ego.

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:58.420
He is aided by the
lesser demons of fear,

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:03.955
anger, greed, and lust, and
when he tries to grab her--

00:25:03.955 --> 00:25:09.660
and you can see the sort of
demon with a buffalo head.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.620
She's astride on a lion.

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.510
She's trying to draw her bow.

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:16.720
That's a more popular
representation of the demon.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.870
This is a really
ancient sculpture.

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:23.770
So think of the rape of
Europa-- very similar.

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:26.800
So Mahisha tries to
grab the goddess,

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:30.970
and when he tries to capture
her she's instantly weaponized.

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:33.265
Fangs develop in
her howling mouth.

00:25:33.265 --> 00:25:36.030
Her arms sprout
innumerable weapons--

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:38.820
the sword of discrimination,
the bow of determination,

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.050
the bludgeon of
psychic practice,

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:45.430
all with the ultimate nuclear
payload of powerful mantras.

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:48.080
She roars like the
lion she sits upon.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.560
Don't mess with her.

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.300
So in October 1998--
there she is again--

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:57.510
Kashi, the head priest
of the Ganesha Temple,

00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:59.760
told me of this Navratri myth.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.760
In his telling,
the buffalo demon

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.400
is a master of disguise,
morphing instantly

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.590
from one form to
another, shapeshifting

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:08.910
as the ego is wont
to do, but the deity

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:11.580
recognizes him regardless
of what shape he takes.

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.490
She pours forth
millions of goddesses

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:16.530
from herself-- the goddess of
prudently applied intelligence,

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:19.610
the goddess of wisely
used materials sources.

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:22.490
And finally Parvathi,
the goddess of creation,

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:23.460
comes forth.

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.710
As she does so,
the goddess pierces

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:28.380
the demon's buffalo
head with a trident,

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:29.950
and she decapitates him.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:31.330
Here Kashi got very excited.

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:34.830
He swung his arm to show
what the goddess does.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:37.920
And he said he wanted
to do a decoration

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.260
of the deity, the female
deity, to show this power.

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.490
For a week before the
festival, Kashi mysteriously

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:46.140
walked on mechanical
apparatus, which

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.570
he kept covered with an oil
cloth in the lower courtyard.

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:52.270
I knew he had enlisted the help
of a couple of IT engineers

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:54.260
who came regularly
to the temple.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:56.660
On days he looked tired,
defeated, and he told me,

00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:01.030
"I have failed," in English,
as though he had taken an exam.

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:03.480
But he never said what
the Alankara would be.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.990
Finally, the day for
the Pujah arrived.

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:08.780
Kashi disappeared into the
sanctum hidden by a curtain.

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:11.630
Several cutting,
mysterious sounds followed.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.680
With a flourish, the
curtain was pulled back,

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.230
and the goddess was revealed.

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:17.770
She had one armed raised
in an alarming height,

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:21.160
and in it she clutched a
shining tinfoil trident.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.100
At the goddess's feet was
a papier mâché buffalo with

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:26.340
a severed head
which ran red ink.

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.215
I want you to picture
the kitchiness of this.

00:27:28.215 --> 00:27:30.940
As we watched the
spectacle transfixed,

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.590
light bulbs in the sanctum
flared and flashed,

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:35.420
and the right arm of
the deity came down

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:39.240
with a rolling cut like a garage
door, the trident striking

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.430
the buffalo's body.

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:42.100
Collectively the
assembled devotees

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:45.542
let out a long of "ah" of
astonishment and appreciation.

00:27:45.542 --> 00:27:47.000
Their eyes were
wide open, and they

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.460
hissed-- the in-drawn hiss.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.570
Suddenness.

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:54.620
They were wonderstruck.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:58.021
For the next nine days, every
10 minutes, the deity's hand

00:27:58.021 --> 00:28:00.020
would come down with the
sound of a garage door,

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:03.890
and every time I noticed that
the devotees were thrilled.

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:05.800
The children would applaud.

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.850
People would scream
with delight.

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:10.250
Michael Jackson,
also here at Harvard,

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:15.320
in his brilliant
phenomenological study

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.430
of the human tech interface,
talks about this interface

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:21.820
as having existential issues.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:24.010
Human-machine
relations are where

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:26.060
our fate and destiny collide.

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.140
They are both implicated.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.670
Indeed, in Bangalore, these
existential questions are rife,

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:34.930
but there are ethical and
theological questions as well.

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:38.962
I think that for a city
built on tech and innovation,

00:28:38.962 --> 00:28:41.610
our reflection on the
connections between worship

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:44.180
and technology may
help us reframe

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:47.950
our most implicit taxonomies
of matter and spirit

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:50.590
into intellectually
freeing ways.

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:52.450
What is compelling
for me is the image

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:55.560
of the engagement, even
a union, between divinity

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.030
and technology.

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:00.130
It's not the typical
subject-object split

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:03.050
that we think of, but
an object-other split,

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:06.600
a cosmological split where the
material and the technological

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.100
become an apparatus
in creating belief.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:14.680
A new, high-degree mode
of knowing is created.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.130
So this reforging,
this resonance

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:18.870
of fusing the
deity and the robot

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:21.310
allows for chains of
equivalence to occur

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:24.770
of simultaneous existence
and annihilation,

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:27.170
changing not only the
meaning of the technology

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:30.600
but the biometrics
of the deity itself.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:34.170
Here ritual, as Iliadi
noted, makes creation

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:36.740
again through an
ethos of improvisation

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.200
and experimentation.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.610
Michael Puett-- I don't
know if he's here--

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:43.090
has written this
amazing set of texts

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:46.800
on ancient Chinese
ritual, and he

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:51.570
asked the central question,
how can we create anew?

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:54.040
And this question
I have followed

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:58.860
as the central sort of
mantra in attempting to parse

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:02.160
the other two examples.

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:06.300
So priests like Kashi engage
technological apparati

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.750
and the ethos of
newness as an instrument

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:12.550
and an agent of religious
change and transformation.

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:15.570
They allow an imagined
world full of potential,

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:17.980
full of creative
forces of possibility,

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:21.297
a propensity of life.

00:30:21.297 --> 00:30:23.630
And he extends the divine
properties of both imagination

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:27.940
and creativity, marking
the devotee as an agent--

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.640
that wonder doesn't
just strike you,

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.110
but you strategically
seek wonder.

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:35.850
He creates the conditions in
which wonder is made possible.

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:39.900
So pursuit of wonder,
a practice of wonder,

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:44.580
becomes far more
important in this case.

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:48.130
And here when I asked him what
are you doing, quite simply he

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:52.350
said, "What I am doing?

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:55.620
What I am doing is technology,
yes, but what I am doing

00:30:55.620 --> 00:31:00.010
is I am invoking Brahman,
the supreme deity."

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:02.560
Now, Brahman is this
cosmological deity from which

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.670
all things flow,
and he's referring

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:07.310
to the radical
meaning of Brahman.

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:12.070
In Sanskrit, root word
means "to grow, to expand."

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:13.800
The concept of
Brahman has wrongly

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:19.240
been imagined as a sort
of singular divinity,

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.590
but in point of fact, it is
about world impermanence.

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:27.370
It is the idea of the
continuity of change.

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:30.900
So ritual specialists like
Kashi play a double game.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.570
They reference things that
we know very well which

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:36.160
may not in fact be really
new, but they put it

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.320
in a new context.

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:41.270
And in that new context, it
becomes the force of wonder.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:46.340
And this is what Greenblatt
has talked about in resonance,

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:47.210
I think.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:49.370
So Catherine Bell
says this resonance

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:51.170
is at the heart of ritual.

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:53.500
It is the domestication
of strange forces.

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.260
It makes the strange familiar,
the familiar strange.

00:31:56.260 --> 00:32:00.020
Here lived experience
becomes blurred,

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:03.640
and the practice of wonder is,
I believe, about this blurring.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.520
That is what elevates
you into a state

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:10.144
of worshipful astonishment.

00:32:10.144 --> 00:32:11.560
I'm going to come
to Wittgenstein,

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.850
so those of you who are
thinking about Wittgenstein

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:13.881
hold the thought.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.093
So in thinking about this,
another illustration is useful.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.690
These are all the
devotees who came

00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:27.320
to see the animatronic deity.

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.290
And it changes the
biometrics of divinity.

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:31.810
As you can see, here is
Ganesha taking a selfie

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:33.462
with his divine wife.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:41.790
And here is the Ganesha deity
dressed as a software engineer.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:43.870
You can see the lanyards.

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:47.690
This was first cool
around the time

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:50.410
of exams and entries
for engineering school,

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:51.590
medical school, et cetera.

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:53.320
The deity takes on this cast.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.189
So the deity becomes
a familiar figure,

00:32:55.189 --> 00:32:56.730
rather like Greek
and Roman deities--

00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:59.080
a familiar,
human-like figure who

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.700
takes on the troubles
of our everyday,

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:03.303
but transcends
them all superbly.

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:08.800
The second illustration
might be useful.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.290
So Kashi comes to
me, and he says

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:14.950
he wants to install a shrine
to this deity, the Devi deity.

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:17.930
And he wanted a
helicopter to shower

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:21.160
the temple, this new shrine,
with holy consecrated water

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:25.460
and rose petals for the
installation festival.

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:29.270
And he says the civil aviation
charges are around 60,000

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:31.750
rupees, then about $1,500.

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:34.430
He asked me, do you think
the prices are reasonable?

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:36.660
I point out I don't have
much experience with hiring

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:38.190
private helicopters.

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:40.080
It sounds reasonable to me.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.870
The morning of the
consecration ceremony

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:44.270
I arrive at the Ganesha
Temple at 4:00 AM,

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:46.590
and I find Dando,
a neophyte priest,

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:49.510
giggling with excitement,
sporting a gigantic crash

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:52.190
helmet with a radio receiver.

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:54.870
One of the young priests slaps
him on the back and says,

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:58.810
[SPEAKING HINDI], well,
Top Gun, are you ready,

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:00.350
referencing the
popular Hollywood

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:02.050
movie starring Tom Cruise.

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:09.150
I saw Dando then depart on
a scooter with his friends,

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:11.340
flying to the helicopter
take-off site.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:15.179
At 10:00 AM precisely, the
Mahabishekam, the consecration

00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:19.670
part of the deity, where the
deity is given life, was over,

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:23.110
and the chanting of 108
priests reached a crescendo.

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:25.969
Suddenly, we heard
a buzzing sound.

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:28.550
The 108 priests stopped
dead and looked at the sky,

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:30.050
because we had all
heard there would

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:32.429
be a helicopter-- but nothing.

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:35.086
So we waited.

00:34:35.086 --> 00:34:36.710
Suddenly, from behind
the temple tower,

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:38.750
rose the dark shadow of
the helicopter, rising

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:41.340
deliberately, almost
menacingly, like a scene

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:43.620
in an apocalyptic
Hollywood movie.

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:47.080
But as we watched, rising
also with the helicopter

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.610
was a lone Garuda, an
eagle, a brahminy kite,

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:52.372
the mythic vehicle of Vishnu.

00:34:52.372 --> 00:34:53.830
The bird clearly
had been disturbed

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:56.300
from its nest in the
temple tree by the noise.

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.980
Kashi the priest became
incoherent in his excitement,

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:01.310
and forgetting the magnifying
effects of microphone

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:03.450
he shouted,
"Helicopter has come.

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:03.950
Helicopter.

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:04.860
Garuda is here.

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:08.578
Helicopter, Garuda, helicopter,
Garuda, Garuda, helicopter."

00:35:08.578 --> 00:35:12.190
As some of the crowd of devotees
roared, "Garuda, helicopter,"

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:14.170
and folded their
hands in prayer,

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:18.190
Mr. Sambad, a retired engineer
at the Hindustan Aeronautics

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:21.290
Laboratory, where he had built
satellite communications,

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:22.960
repeated, "Garuda,
helicopter," and then

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:27.530
added "Vishnu's vehicle"
as the helicopter

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:29.150
hovered in the clear blue sky.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:34.820
We were all drenched in
red and yellow petals

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:38.782
and consecrated holy water as
Dando was peering anxiously

00:35:38.782 --> 00:35:41.240
over the edge of the helicopter
and finally found his mark.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.840
Many of the devotees were moved
and had tears streaming down

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:44.840
their faces.

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:47.920
I was embarrassed
to say I did, too.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.750
Mr. Sambad and his
friend Mr. [? Ayers ?]

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:53.350
said, [INAUDIBLE], that
it is a wonderful site.

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:55.840
I found myself moved
to tears as well.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.020
Now, one might argue
that such improvisation,

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:01.550
the use of non-new
technologies in new contexts,

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:04.410
is sort of practicality
attendant to piety.

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:08.880
That's what Michael Herzfeld
has so persuasively argued,

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.690
and he argued this
just last year

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:12.497
and I was so taken with it.

00:36:12.497 --> 00:36:14.330
But I want to suggest
that something more is

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:17.460
happening here.

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.930
When I looked at my
notes over 16 years,

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:24.230
I found the word "wonderment,"
or its cognates, 2,000 times.

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:26.120
So something else
is happening, and it

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:28.290
forces us to take note not
only what the priests are

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:31.855
doing seriously but what they
say they are doing seriously as

00:36:31.855 --> 00:36:32.355
well.

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:37.210
And in subsequent
days and even years,

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:40.495
I heard devotees talk
about the ceremony

00:36:40.495 --> 00:36:44.494
as "helicopter aputa," the
astonishment of the helicopter.

00:36:44.494 --> 00:36:48.370
Aputa, loosely translated,
means "odd" in Sanskrit,

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:52.334
but it also is wonder,
astonishment, and awe.

00:36:52.334 --> 00:36:53.750
So what Kashi was
doing was he was

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:55.740
creating a hybrid
between the technological

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:58.620
and the marvelous, a
conjoined material one,

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:01.950
an imagined mythic
bird that spoke

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:07.370
of both newer technology--
newish technologies--

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:09.570
and ancient myth.

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:13.300
It was the sudden conflation,
this mythic disorientation,

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:16.040
that was aputa.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:19.180
It is a sublime
vision that conjoins

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:25.680
reason and passion,
which have been separated

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.610
in Western understandings.

00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:32.250
And it puts us in a contingent
state that is highly valuable.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:34.530
It's an excited
contingent state.

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:38.100
Helicopters become valued
not only as status symbols,

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:42.166
but as representing
divine transport.

00:37:42.166 --> 00:37:43.790
So one part of my
thinking in this book

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:46.050
is going to be about
tedium and mundanity

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:50.011
and how wonder breaks through
tedium and re-crafts things.

00:37:50.011 --> 00:37:51.510
Now, of course, one
could and should

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:54.670
argue that not every time
that the helicopter appears

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:56.180
does the Garuda appear.

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.760
It was essentially
an act of God.

00:37:58.760 --> 00:37:59.740
It's unpredictable.

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:03.070
The intersection was marvelous.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:08.110
But Kashi said that he was
purposely using the helicopter

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:10.680
to create a moment when
wonderment might make

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.170
its appearance, so again
the pursuit of wonderment

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:15.710
versus its actual application.

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:18.830
And for believers
perhaps this is wondrous.

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:21.790
Wonder is the creation of
this sublime aesthetic moment

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:24.240
both as a new
category of experience

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:27.800
and as a subversion of
previously understood texts--

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:31.630
previously understood
relationships and texts.

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:35.920
So Puett tells us
that these wonder

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.170
and, well, ritual
that is created

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:42.590
pushes us towards a
subjunctive state, and I agree.

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:45.390
So practices of wonder
push us to consider

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:47.540
the future and
futurities and how

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:48.900
we imagine these futurities.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:55.110
This potentiality, this world
as pregnant in becoming,

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:58.250
is a key to understanding
the durability of ritual.

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:00.850
This is why ritual makes sense.

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:02.160
This is what ritual is.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.240
It gives us the fuel
to imagine possibility

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:08.030
in a world that is
constantly engaging the new,

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:13.040
from making anew, renewing,
and encountering the new.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:15.770
So it folds all that
together and creates

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:19.510
possibilities and imaginations
of the future, the possibility

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:20.950
to imagine the future.

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:25.230
This, I believe, is what
Bergson calls the "élan vital,"

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:27.420
or the propulsive
life towards a future.

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.630
Michael Fisher, down
the road at MIT,

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:35.800
says technology marks a
kind of messianic space,

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:42.240
and I think that this is
exactly what Kashi is doing.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:45.070
And he's using it as a
heightened experimental regime.

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:50.130
Now, I know for the scientists
here experimentation

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:52.270
would imply failure, and
in the rest of the book

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:55.740
I do have mixed examples
of when the wonder fails--

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:58.630
pursuit of wonder
fails spectacularly

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.460
and it becomes just mundane.

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:03.530
And so there is a sort
of pushing and trying

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:06.110
newer and newer things.

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:08.840
So the larger acceptance
of what is improvisational

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.580
marks the temple
space as a space

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.690
of constant experimentation.

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:14.970
This experimental
regime, combined

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:16.820
with the idea that the
public imagination,

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:21.540
the Hindu imagination-- Hinduism
is the dominant religion--

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:24.160
it's complex, but
it's also provisional.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.480
So residents can be
taken by emotions,

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.650
but they can also
imagine a future.

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:30.720
They can incorporate
helicopters,

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.870
new forms of money like
credit cards, into the temple

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:36.820
and into their lives
without feeling the anxiety

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:39.410
of leaving something behind.

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:42.360
So rather than the
disenchantment of modernity,

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:46.080
which Peter Berger
has talked about

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.990
and people after
him have worked on,

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:52.370
I would argue that
this form of modernity

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:53.600
doubles down on enchantment.

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:11.255
And now, it has become
everyday wonderment.

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:19.630
And to my last example,
wonderment came to my life

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:21.520
most vividly a week ago.

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:24.090
My mother needed
a pacemaker, and I

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:27.440
called Kashi-- and this was my
first time I actually used him

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.760
as a priest-- to do
a personal worship

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.480
puta for her well-being.

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.060
He recommended a
Vedic fire sacrifice

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:37.030
that was [INAUDIBLE],
a defeat of death.

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:39.400
As we went through
the details of my vow

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.480
and my mother's lineage descent
on the astrological chart,

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:45.310
which is what he needed,
Kashi asked me an aside.

00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:49.140
He suddenly said, do you have
Macbook Skype in English.

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:51.050
And I said, no.

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:52.300
He said FaceTime, FaceTime?

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:54.330
I said, yes.

00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:59.610
Then he says, OK, live relay--
all in English, by the way.

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:02.890
Then he switches to Tamil.
"Your mother can see the Pujah.

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:04.170
I'll give you a missed call."

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:06.540
This is a salutation thing
of where he calls you

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:08.081
and then he doesn't
pay for the call,

00:42:08.081 --> 00:42:11.510
and then you see the number
and then you call him back.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:12.065
Missed call.

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:18.080
So traditionally,
darshan is when

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.140
you are face to face
with a god, as I said.

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:21.580
You see the god,
the god sees you.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:25.390
The camphor flame
moves between the two.

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:27.600
So this is classic--
people waiting

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.070
for darshan in the temple.

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:30.800
This is darshan,
everyone leaning in

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.440
to see the god at
the moment when

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:36.870
the camphor flame is offered.

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:40.170
And more importantly,
the god looks at you,

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:43.200
so now we get to this.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.650
"Your mother can get darshan."

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:46.980
The next evening we
facetime Kashi on his iPhone

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:49.770
after his missed call prompt
at the auspicious start

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:50.870
time of the ritual.

00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:53.770
Over FaceTime he showed us
the entire scene in Bangalore.

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:56.550
The monsoon rains had left
the temple courtyard wet.

00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:58.710
The sun just had risen
behind the ficus tree

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:01.100
where we had seen the Garuda,
and the choir of birds

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.950
were whooping and whistling
in the branches above.

00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:07.810
He began the Sankalpa, the
slow unfurling of ritual intent

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:11.130
with the instructions in English
"repeat after me" to my mother.

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:13.550
Kashi recited the Sanskrit
slokas and mantras,

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:16.610
and my mother, seated on a
sofa in the Boston night,

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:17.610
repeated them.

00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:19.510
We watched late into
the night as priests

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:22.550
recited the sacred mantras,
the rites of gods and plants,

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:26.910
the invocation of planetary gods
into their lives, their ritual

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:28.580
adoration and sacrifice.

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:31.150
We watched as Kashi and
his cohort of priests

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:33.410
laid the Vedic fire,
ringed it with grass,

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:35.840
and offered it sacrifices for
my mother's life and health.

00:43:42.275 --> 00:43:44.626
I have a video, which is
going to be quite loud,

00:43:44.626 --> 00:43:47.720
but I think you can see
the Vedic fire here.

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:51.185
[CHANTING]

00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:31.350
So this is a very
ancient ritual,

00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:33.349
and you would have heard
the word Rukmini, which

00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:35.570
is my mother's name.

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:39.153
And he's essentially
battling death on her behalf.

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:46.300
And then he finishes
that, and then he

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:47.903
offers us the camphor flame.

00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:52.515
Watch this.

00:44:52.515 --> 00:44:53.601
He builds it to a form.

00:44:58.511 --> 00:45:00.475
And my mother takes darshan.

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:09.200
So this is 10,600 miles away.

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.090
Occasionally, during
the ritual, the internet

00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:13.290
would cut out, the
signals dying as they

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:16.620
pass through fiber optic cables
deep under the ocean floor.

00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:20.320
Kashi would disappear while
that slowly spinning circle

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:22.411
rebuffered.

00:45:22.411 --> 00:45:24.660
But soon he would reappear
stronger than ever and say,

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:25.425
network OK?

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:31.740
Then once when the Vedic
sacrificial fire flickered low,

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.270
he gestured to it and
said jokingly in Tamil,

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:36.410
"Our network is going down.

00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:38.610
The network of Agni
needs more key,"

00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:42.050
indicating that
his network was one

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:45.280
made of smoke that carried
the sacrifices to the gods,

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:48.920
just as our network that linked
us was a virtual one as well.

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:51.710
In one reconnect, I
happened to place my iPhone,

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:55.880
and if we go back maybe
you can see the scene.

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.460
Behind my phone
is the deity I had

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:00.520
placed for my mother to view.

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.820
So in one reconnect, I happened
to place my iPhone in front

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:05.920
of a brightly
colored Ganesha image

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.970
I had placed on my
table in Boston.

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:10.980
As the form reconnected,
for that instant

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:13.750
we saw Kashi's puzzled
face as he looked directly

00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:17.370
at the face of the god just
before he went to life.

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:22.204
He came in chuckling, "oh,
look, my boss is now in America.

00:46:22.204 --> 00:46:26.140
Super, super."

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:28.560
He referred to this
network repeatedly,

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:31.480
and when I reminded him of
what he said about Brahman

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:33.070
he said, exactly.

00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:34.242
That is what I meant.

00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:39.150
So essentially, I was
left with this question.

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:44.200
It's wonderful and
amusing and it draws you

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:47.970
in, but what are the ethics
of this kind of hack?

00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:49.410
What is actually happening here?

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:51.550
What are the morals
of improvisation?

00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:55.120
Because I think we
all laud creativity.

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:56.110
It's important.

00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:57.320
We all want to be leaders.

00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:59.290
Every university
tells us that they

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:01.780
want to train us in creativity.

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:05.040
What does that mean?

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:09.190
In South Asia, Pandian and Ali
have considered ethical life,

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:12.110
and they say the ethical
choices are indelibly

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:15.660
conjoined with the problems of
mundane living in South Asia.

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:18.270
But it would appear to
me that people like Kashi

00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:20.240
and the pursuit of
wonder that they do

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:22.060
have some unforeseen outcomes.

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:24.110
But such injunctions
are routinely

00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:28.240
broken or transcended, and
morals are continuously eroded.

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:31.990
So creative ethics
is each point along

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:34.190
this unpredictable trajectory.

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:36.810
So I came up with this.

00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:38.530
I don't like the
term creative ethics,

00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:40.950
and I seek a better
term from you all.

00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:43.610
But that's the best
I could come up with.

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:46.270
It's each point
along this trajectory

00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:48.130
as a sediment of
repeated actions that

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:51.480
are special to devotees
and priests themselves

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:55.580
are performed, and they shift
ever so slightly over time.

00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:59.470
They create a language,
volatility of growth,

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:01.740
and a shift in the
ethical paradigm

00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:08.260
that is almost untraceable.

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:10.617
It happens, but one
is not cognizant of it

00:48:10.617 --> 00:48:12.450
happening at the moment
that it's happening.

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:18.110
The creative ethical
paradigm is thus

00:48:18.110 --> 00:48:20.980
constantly shifting,
refining, and extending

00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:24.705
to reach a final form.

00:48:24.705 --> 00:48:26.080
I don't know if
I should do this,

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:29.000
but very quickly,
Dharma is a word

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.740
that's used in Hindu
philosophy repeatedly.

00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:35.540
And it is used as a sort
of rigid call to duty.

00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:37.790
Dharma is translated as duty.

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:41.030
But here it becomes a
fluid ethical analytic

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:45.250
that the devotees and priests
use very differentially.

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:47.310
It becomes a space
of vulnerability

00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:52.350
where duty is ceded, duty's
use might not even be dutiful.

00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:57.480
So they are translating
in a very loose way.

00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:01.760
So perhaps the good life is
not so good or not so moral

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.410
after all.

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:07.080
Untangling unethical
and ethical becomes

00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:10.452
very difficult at the
moment of improvisation.

00:49:10.452 --> 00:49:12.190
Creativity can be
rooted in violence,

00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:14.790
we know, in
disruption, in failure

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:16.820
of that which is
familiar and stable,

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:19.420
and it results in
inevitable moral dilemmas

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:21.220
that are unresolvable.

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:23.740
But it allows us to
approach a limit condition

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:25.530
to create new imaginations.

00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:29.070
We open up the world of creative
formulations and reformations,

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:31.490
allowing for experiences
that are alive, creative,

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:34.914
life-affirming, radical,
and perhaps even freeing.

00:49:34.914 --> 00:49:36.330
In conclusion, I
confess I've been

00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:37.610
struggling how to write this.

00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:39.210
You see, it's not easy.

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:41.330
Wonder is such an
evanescent condition.

00:49:41.330 --> 00:49:45.840
I think I will write as an
experimental folio where

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.760
this sense of creative
play and interrogation

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:51.190
and the joy that the priests
have should come out,

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:54.210
I believe, rather than
a textual treatise that

00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:56.910
moves us towards closure.

00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:59.060
So I think the fragments
of creative acts

00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:01.140
that I present give
us some sense of what

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:04.490
is going on in Bangalore.

00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:08.540
I take heart in Rainer
Maria Rilke's statement

00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:10.820
that most questions are
unanswerable when asked.

00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:13.030
One has to live out the answers.

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:15.250
In keeping with that
modality, I write what I know,

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:17.720
but I try to write through
to what I don't know.

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:19.700
And I invite openings
in the joints

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:24.750
between wonder and creativity,
for, after all, Fredrik Barth

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:28.380
said one thing with
regard to anthropologists.

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:30.760
He said studying change
is urgent and central

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:32.300
to the anthropological endeavor.

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:35.100
We need new concepts that allow
us to observe and describe

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:36.097
events of change.

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:44.760
So we have understood
change only as disruption,

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:47.080
and I have focused
on this disruption.

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:49.090
But in these spaces,
in these interruptions,

00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:52.850
priests like Kashi not only
are informed by the zeitgeist.

00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:56.820
They push it forward and inform
the categories of universal

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:59.260
in particular in
very specific ways,

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:03.720
and they make us think
about universal, particular,

00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:08.660
contemporary, comparative--
these structures

00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:11.860
that are very foundational to
interrogations of knowledge.

00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:13.964
Thank you.
