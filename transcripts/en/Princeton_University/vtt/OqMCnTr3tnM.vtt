ANNE HOLTON: I learned
crucial lessons

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.920
of humility and appreciation
of differential human talent.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.960
I also learned
that sometimes it's

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.830
OK to try something so
hard that success is not

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.705
a foregone conclusion.

BAZ LUHRMANN:
Listen to everyone.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.340
Listen to your friends.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.220
Listen to your enemies.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.253
But then, go into a
corner and ask yourself,

00:00:47.253 --> 00:00:52.070
not, 'what do I think?' but,
'what do I actually feel?

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.000
What do I feel?'

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.590
And that decision, my friends,
will be the right decision.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.210
Because you made it.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.919
And it wasn't made for you.

SANJEEV KULKARNI: This
educational process

00:01:18.615 --> 00:01:23.640
at Princeton cultivates in
you the ability and confidence

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.990
to succeed and lead in new
areas of inquiry, in new fields,

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.420
and in new endeavors
throughout your lives.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.370
Congratulations on
your accomplishments.

JIN YUN CHOW: More
often than not,

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.810
it's not because of some
orchestrated, pre-planned

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.080
effort that we end up sharing
a beautiful bond of friendship

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.150
with someone.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.090
It's because we were
present to talk.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.285
It's because we were
there to listen.

00:02:21.285 --> 00:02:25.220
Here's to all of our
heroes, known and unknown,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.570
sung and unsung, who got us
through these four years.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.230
To them and to everyone
who has been there for us

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.136
through this journey, thank you.

00:02:37.136 --> 00:02:39.510
CHRISTOPHER L. EISGRUBER: The
place of learning, he said,

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.410
should be a large and lasting
one consistent in character

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.060
and scale with the values of
this university from which you

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.730
are now to take your lead.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.140
May it be a place able to
accommodate the fun of learning

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.340
as well as the effort that
all true learning requires.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.950
May its boundaries
be set not by what

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.270
we think we know now but
by a lifelong curiosity

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.240
and an abiding
appreciation for ideas,

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.000
for their elusiveness
to be sure,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.740
but also for their power, their
beauty, and their capacity

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.740
to enrich our lives and
the lives of others.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.610
To all of you who received
degrees from this university,

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.340
from all of us here
on the platform,

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.440
congratulations to the
great Class of 2017.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.040
Onward!
