00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
YouTube Red, not mentioned in the main video,

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.440
is YouTube's second source of income that avoids the whole

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.700
advertiser auction by getting viewers to pay monthly to hide the ads and get access to exclusive content.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.900
YouTube keeps the exact split of revenue a secret,

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.620
only saying that creators get a majority,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.340
but whatever that percent is, that portion of the money collected from subscribers is divided among

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.480
all creators based on what percent of total time on YouTube their videos are watched.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.840
Doing a very ballpark estimate,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.620
channels with short videos might get around 5% additional revenue from Red,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.600
and channels with really long videos that are watched might get 40 to 50% more.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.460
It's worth noting that per view a YouTube subscriber is worth more to both YouTube and creators,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.880
not just in dollars, but also in stability.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.680
Their monthly payments are predictable unlike the ad auctions,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.800
So, it shouldn't be a surprise if YouTube continues to try to turn more subscribers and countries Red.
