ANNOUNCER: It's picked off.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:04.550
Arizona with the football.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.350
30, 25, down to the 20.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.479
15, 10, 5, touchdown.

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:12.380
Jace Whittaker, his second.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.470
 How did you end up here
at University of Arizona?

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.730
 Football brought me here.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.970
 I know, but why here versus
UCLA, or USC, or Stanford,

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.250
or Arizona State?

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.880
 Yeah I wanted to
get away from home,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.810
but once I came and visited
this campus, I loved it.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.190
I loved everything about it.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.410
I loved how all
the sports arenas

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.360
were right next to each other.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.294
And the history
behind it, the teams

00:00:37.294 --> 00:00:38.460
that have come through here.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.669
And it was just ready for me.

00:00:39.669 --> 00:00:41.585
LACEY NYMEYER-JOHN:
CATS-- which is Commitment

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:43.040
to an Athlete's Total Success--

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.341
was actually created
in the early '90s.

00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:47.840
And it was one of
the first programs

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.131
in the country that took a
holistic approach to student

00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:51.530
athlete development.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.890
And it was founded
in this belief

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.751
that the better we can
develop you as a person,

00:00:57.751 --> 00:00:59.750
the better you're going
to perform on the field,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.900
in the pool, in the classroom,
and in the community

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.495
in general.

00:01:03.995 --> 00:01:06.965
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:08.645 --> 00:01:10.970
ROBERT ROBBINS: How have you
benefited from being here

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.660
in this incredible facility?

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.180
 Oh man.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.180
So it all started with
coming here for football.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.140
And that's what I
thought I was only doing.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.042
It was just football.

00:01:20.042 --> 00:01:20.750
 Yeah of course.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.630
 And being hard headed,
young, and stubborn, I

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.790
was really gifted with a great
Learning Specialist, Sabrina.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.150
A tutor who broadened
my vision of what I

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.679
was going to do after football.

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:34.970
It's not going to last forever.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.720
And we've gotten into
many debates about this.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.840
And she was just patient.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.060
She was patient
and understanding.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.100
And her being patient and
understanding made me that way.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.950
 Once we got him
in and he started

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.760
to see that, oh these are
resources that I can absolutely

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.370
benefit from, it
wasn't too long after

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.400
that that Jace was
actually texting me saying,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.740
when are you in?

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.540
When can I come in to
get some extra help?

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.530
And that's carried over, because
Jace is actually graduated out

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.210
of the program now.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.720
But still he's in upper division
criminal justice coursework,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.555
and he comes to me
pretty regularly.

00:02:16.555 --> 00:02:17.530
 Still coming back.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.030
Yeah.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.430
 He still comes back.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.180
 In high school it's like not
too many people are on you.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.610
You do the homework
and you'll be fine.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.530
But here they stressed the
importance of academics.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.084
You had football practice and
you also had school practice.

00:02:34.084 --> 00:02:35.125
This was school practice.

00:02:35.125 --> 00:02:35.780
ROBERT ROBBINS: School practice.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.030
JACE WHITTAKER: You come in
here and you're practicing

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.989
what you learned today.

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.696
ROBERT ROBBINS: What
were our statistics?

00:02:40.696 --> 00:02:41.840
How have we improved?

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.830
What are we doing?

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:43.970
JOHN MOSBACH: This
last academic year

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.470
was the best academic
year we've had

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.290
in the history of
our athletic program.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.030
Our student athletes eclipsed
the 3.0 cumulative mark

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.030
for the first time ever.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.360
So that's exciting.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.110
 Very exciting.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.609
 Yeah.

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.240
Last spring we had 59 4.0s is in
the spring term for our student

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.740
athletes.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.365
And just generally speaking, in
the spring term and every term,

00:03:00.365 --> 00:03:02.150
we have close to
60% of our student

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.580
athletes with a 3.0 in the term.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.920
So when you're looking at a
cohort of 500 higher student

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.890
athletes, to think that
well over half of them

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.580
are earning a 3.0
midterm, it was

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.549
pretty phenomenal to be
able to brag about that,

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:14.840
and be able to talk about that.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.770
So that's one of the
metrics certainly

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:16.811
that we're excited about.

00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:18.800
Our graduation rates
are trending up

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.320
every year for the past
seven or eight years.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.510
One of the metrics that's
maybe harder to evaluate

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.604
is just the
student's experience.

00:03:25.604 --> 00:03:27.020
Kind of a pitch I
give to recruits

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.710
is that you can be an
Academic All-American,

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.470
and you can be an
Athletic All-American.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.928
But we're here to
make you the best

00:03:31.928 --> 00:03:33.980
version of yourself, the
best person in combining

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:34.550
those things.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.930
And I think some metric
may be harder to evaluate,

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.270
hard to assess and track.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.820
But I think it's one that we
very much pay attention to.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.180
It matters a lot to us.
