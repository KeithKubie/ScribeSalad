00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.760
 

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.400
So we have some race
cars racing, right here.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.480
And I have an interesting
question to ask you.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.450
If we assume that these
cars are making this turn

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.930
right over here,
that all of them

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:21.720
are making this turn at
a constant speed of 100

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.980
kilometers per hour, my
interesting question for you

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.510
is, are these cars accelerating
while they make this turn?

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.335
So is acceleration happening?

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:39.270
 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.110
And you might say, well, gee,
look, my speed was constant,

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.090
it's not changing.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.052
If I looked at the
speedometer for the car

00:00:46.052 --> 00:00:48.010
here, if I looked at the
speedometer over here,

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.720
it won't budge, it just stays
at 100 kilometers per hour.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.790
I don't have any change
in speed over time.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.530
And so then you
might say that you

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.552
don't have any acceleration.

00:00:58.552 --> 00:01:00.010
But then you might
be saying, well,

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.940
why would Sal even
make this video?

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.360
And why would that question
even be interesting?

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.860
And your second
suspicion would be true,

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.520
because these cars
actually are accelerating

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.960
despite having a constant speed.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.630
And you can pause it and
think about that for a second,

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.317
if want to.

00:01:19.317 --> 00:01:20.900
But I wanted to point
this out to you,

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.840
because in an example like this,
the difference between speed

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.570
and velocity starts
to matter, speed

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.800
being a scalar quantity
only having a magnitude.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.120
And velocity being
a vector quantity,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.640
being speed with a
direction, having

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.680
a magnitude and a direction.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.250
And to think about-- let's
take a top view of this thing,

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.720
and then I think it'll
become a little bit clearer

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.782
the difference between
speed and velocity

00:01:45.782 --> 00:01:47.365
and why these things
are accelerating.

00:01:47.365 --> 00:01:50.160
So if I were to take a top
view of this racetrack--

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.450
I'll do my best
attempt to draw it--

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.350
so it might look
something like this.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.950
This is the top view.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.530
I could even draw
this red and white.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.650
So red, just to
give you the idea.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.230
So this is the red, and
there's some white in between.

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:09.979
Obviously I'm not
drawing as many dividers

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.437
as there are in
the actual picture,

00:02:11.437 --> 00:02:13.970
but it gives you an idea of
what I'm actually drawing.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.910
And then there's
some grass out here,

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.150
there's some grass
over here, and then

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.050
there's some grass over here.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.580
And let's focus on this orange
car and this red car right

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.240
over here.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.500
And this is a top view, so this
is its path right over here.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.300
And we're saying it
has a constant speed

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.630
of 100 kilometers per hour.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.640
So if you think
about its velocity,

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.610
the magnitude of it's
velocity is constant,

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.750
it's 100 kilometers per hour.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.670
But what is happening to the
direction of the velocity?

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.030
Remember, velocity
is a vector quantity.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.450
It has magnitude and direction.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.570
So up here, when it's
starting to enter the curve,

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.990
it's going in this direction.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.039
And you tend to show
vectors by arrows like this.

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:59.580
And what you do is,
the arrow's going

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.660
in the direction of the
velocity, in this case,

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.910
and normally you would draw
the length of the arrow shows

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:06.950
what is the velocity.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.290
The magnitude of the
velocity, I should say.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.580
So it's velocity's constant.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.090
So the length of this arrow
will always be constant.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.950
But as we see, it's
direction changes.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.457
When it's halfway
through the turn,

00:03:16.457 --> 00:03:18.040
it's not going in
that same direction.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.950
It is now going in a
different direction,

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.783
and when it comes to
the bottom of the turn,

00:03:21.783 --> 00:03:23.600
it's going in a very
different direction.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.109
And the direction keeps changing
as long as it is turning.

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:28.900
And I'm not going to
go into the math here.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.420
We're going to wait for the
math on this a little bit later.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.210
But remember, acceleration is
a change in velocity over time.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:46.760
Acceleration is equal to a
change in velocity over time,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.510
or we could say over
a change in time.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.360
And although the velocity's
magnitude is constant here,

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.305
it's direction is changing.

00:03:57.305 --> 00:04:00.670
 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.510
If there was no
acceleration on it,

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.990
it's magnitude and the
direction of it's velocity

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.300
would be constant,
and the car would just

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.600
keep going in that direction.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.810
So somehow, the
car's direction is

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.855
changing inward over
and over and over again.

00:04:17.855 --> 00:04:19.980
And so this is just kind
of a little bit of a trick

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.000
question, something
for you to think about,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.660
we're going to discuss
the math in more

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.510
detail in future videos.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.640
But what's happening here is the
cars actually are accelerating.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.990
And they're actually
accelerating inwards,

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.800
and that's what's
changing inwards.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.440
And when I say inwards,
they're being accelerated

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.890
towards the center of
the curve, and that's

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.937
what's allowing their
direction to actually change.

00:04:47.937 --> 00:04:48.437
