00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:04.140
Living down here on Earth it’s easy to forget
that we have it pretty good, at least in terms

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.010
of our environment not doing everything it
can to destroy us and everything we love.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.029
But that’s not the case in space, and scientists
have had to solve all sorts of challenges

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:19.820
to keep space stations, probes, and satellites
functioning in such an extreme environment.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:28.260
For example, they have to engineer their way
around problems like temperature.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.200
Space can be extremely cold; the background
temperature of space is minus two hundred

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.400
seventy degrees celsius in the shade, just
a few degrees above absolute zero.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.850
But in direct sunlight radiation can warm
a spacecraft hundreds of degrees, especially

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.800
when it’s closer to the sun.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.050
Temperature extremes can damage or shatter
delicate equipment, and depending on the mission,

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.820
engineers will have to either insulate their
spacecraft from the cold or protect it from

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.820
the heat.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.300
Sometimes they’ll have to do both!

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.469
The European Space Agency’s Rosetta mission
had to chase down a comet.

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.830
To get there Rosetta had to do several planetary
flybys before heading out towards the asteroid

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.830
belt.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.950
On its ten year journey it went through wild
temperature fluctuations, so to overcome this

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.859
engineers fitted Rosetta with metal slats
or “louvres” that could open to let heat

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:18.659
radiate away or close to trap it and keep
the probe warm.

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.770
Comets like the one rosetta caught leave a
trail of dust in their wake, and are frequently

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.319
the cause of meteor showers we see on Earth.

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:29.290
Those little dust particles can also pose
a threat to spacecraft because they’re traveling

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.210
at thousands of kilometers per hour.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.140
These can have the effect of sandblasting
solar arrays, harming optics, or damaging

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.509
the structure outright.

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.299
The best strategy is avoidance -- chart a
course where you don’t think there’s going

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.279
to be a lot of debris, but if it’s unavoidable
there’s still measures you can take.

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:52.990
When the Hubble telescope passes through a
meteor shower, scientists will rotate it so

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.599
those big solar panels are edge-on to the
incoming hazard, minimizing its surface area

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:59.459
like a fencer standing sideways.

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:04.599
But even if a spacecraft can keep itself at
the right temperature and avoid physical impacts,

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:08.729
there’s another hazard that will always
get them in the end.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.080
Spacecraft are exposed to extreme radiation,
mostly in the form of high-energy charged

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.080
particles.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.670
These particles can come from the sun or just
be zipping around the galaxy as cosmic rays.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.830
They can also be trapped by the Earth’s
magnetic field and form enormous bands of

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.140
protons and electrons called Van Allen belts.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.950
Not only do these particles pose a threat
to humans, but they can damage the electronics

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.060
of spacecraft as well.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.450
They can cause a current to flow on the surface
of the craft, or burn out chips.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.340
They can even change the contents of memory
cells, corrupting data the spacecraft’s

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.560
computers need to function.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.540
If the computers fail or valuable data gets
corrupted, the whole mission can be a bust,

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.450
so engineers have to come up with strategies
to protect electronics from radiation in space,

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.760
what’s known as “space hardening.”

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.800
They can try and shield the electronics, but
shielding is heavy and weight adds cost to

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.590
the launch.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.310
Spacecraft can have redundant electronics,
like three chips performing the same operation

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.310
simultaneously.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.510
If radiation causes one to make an error,
the other two can check its work and overrule

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.510
it.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.200
This way they can just use commercial electronics,
which are cheaper.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.540
Interestingly, electronics today are more
sensitive to space radiation than they were

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.350
in the 60s and 70s.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.040
To make them more robust the chips themselves
can be designed in such a way that makes them

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.990
resistant to radiation.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.520
Designing hardened chips is difficult and
expensive though, and one of the most popular

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.550
chips still in use has the processing power
of a laptop from almost two decades ago.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.190
Even with all these precautions, even the
best space-born electronics will still fail

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.190
eventually.

Despite the challenges we have launched an
absurd number of satellites up there.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:56.850
Is there room for any more?

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.660
Amy covers that here.One cool thing about
Rosetta’s louvres is they opened and closed

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.660
automatically.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.130
The springs were temperature sensitive because
of the metals they were made of and so they

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.130
used no power.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.138
