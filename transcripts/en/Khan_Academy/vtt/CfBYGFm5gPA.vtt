00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:01.250
Add.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:03.570
Simplify the answer and write
as a mixed number.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.740
And we have three mixed numbers
here: 3 and 1/2 plus

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.130
11 and 2/5 plus 4 and 3/15.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.870
So we've already seen that we
could view this as 3 plus 1/12

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.219
plus 11 plus 2/5-- let
me write that down.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:23.180
This is the same thing as 3
plus 1/12 plus 11 plus 2/5

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.330
plus 4 plus 3/15.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.170
The mixed number 3 and 1/12
just literally means 3 and

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.840
1/12 or 3 plus 1/12.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.930
And since we're just adding
a bunch of numbers, order

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.690
doesn't matter, so we
could add all the

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.500
whole numbers at once.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.500
So we have 3 plus 11 plus 4,
and then we can add the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:57.080
fractions: the 1/12 plus
2/5 plus 3/15.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.650
Now, the blue part's pretty
straightforward.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.540
We're just adding numbers.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.360
3 plus 11 is 14 plus 4 is
18, so that part right

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.740
there is just 18.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.080
This will be a little bit
trickier, because we know that

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.120
when we add fractions, we have
to have the same denominator.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.590
And now we have to make all
three of these characters have

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.030
the same denominator and that
denominator has to be the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.910
least common multiple
of 12 and 5 and 15.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.210
Now, we could just do it kind
of the brute force way.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.530
We could just look
at the multiples.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.310
We could pick one of these guys
and keep taking their

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.020
multiples, and then figuring
out whether those multiples

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.080
are both divisible
by 5 and 15.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.330
Or the other way we can do
it is take the prime

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.590
factorization of each of these
numbers, and just say that the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.670
least common multiple has
to contain the prime

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.960
factorization each of these
guys, which means it contains

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.200
each of those numbers.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.910
So let me show you what
I'm talking about.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.640
If we take the prime
factorization of 12, 12 is 2

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:03.020
times 6, 6 is 2 times 3, so 12
is equal to 2 times 2 times 3.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.310
That's the prime factorization
of 12.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.940
Now, if we do 5, prime
factorization of 5, well, 5 is

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.900
just 1 and 5, so 5 is
a prime number.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.670
It is the prime factorization
of 5.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.210
There's just a 5 there.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.660
This 1 is kind of useless.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.880
So 5 is just 5.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.340
And then 15, let's do 15.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.620
Actually, when I did the prime
factorization of 5, I should

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.620
have said, look, 5 is prime.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.880
There's no number larger than
1 that divides into it, so

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.070
it's actually silly to even
make a tree there.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.230
And now let's do 15, 15's
prime factorization.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.450
15 is 3 times 5, and now both
of these are prime.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.210
So we need something that has
two 2's and a 3, so let's look

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.310
at the 12 right there.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.165
So our denominator has to have
at least two 2's and a 3, so

00:02:55.165 --> 00:02:56.080
let's write that down.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.530
So it has to be 2
times 2 times 3.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.390
It has to have at least that.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.120
Now, it also has to have
a 5 there, right?

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.380
Because it has to be a
common multiple of 5.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.050
5's another one of those prime
factors, so it's got to have a

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.900
5 in there.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.670
It didn't already have a 5.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.390
And then it also has to
have a 3 and a 5.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.550
Well, we already have a 5.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.440
We already have a 3 from the
12, and we already have a 5

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.090
from the 5, so this number will
be divisible by all of

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.350
them, and you can see that
because you can see it has a

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.570
12 in it, it has a 5 in it,
and it has a 15 in it.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:31.790
So what is this number?

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.810
2 times 2 is 4.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.460
4 times 3 is 12.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.640
12 times 5 is 60.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.090
So the least common multiple
of 12, 5 and 15 is 60.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.000
So this is going to be plus.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.490
We're going to be over 60.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.040
So all of these are going
to be over 60.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.160
All of these three fractions
are over 60.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.850
Now, to go from 12 to 60,
we have to multiply the

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.110
denominator by 5, so we also
have to multiply the numerator

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.930
by 5, so 1 times 5 is 5.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.900
5/60 is the same
thing as 1/12.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.200
To go from 5 to 60 in the
denominator, we have to

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.490
multiply by 12, so we
have to do the same

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:11.580
thing for the numerator.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.150
12 times 2 is 24.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.740
The last one, 15 to 60, you have
to multiply by 4, so you

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.339
have to do the same thing
in the numerator.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:27.120
4 times 3 is 12.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.020
And now we have the
same denominator.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.460
We are ready to add.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.380
So let's do that.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.970
So this is going to be 18 plus,
and then over 60, we

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.450
have 5 plus 24, which is 29.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:52.320
29 plus 12, let's see, 29
plus 10 would be 39

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.420
plus 2 would be 41.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.940
It would be 41.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.800
And as far as I can tell,
41 and 60 do not

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.030
have any common factors.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.230
41 actually looks prime to me.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:12.220
So the final answer
is 18 and 41/60.
