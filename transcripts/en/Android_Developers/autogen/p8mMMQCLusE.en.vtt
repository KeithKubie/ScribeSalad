it's obviously just been really fun

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160
it's obviously just been really fun

testing is really really fun it's
extremely validating right you just get

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559
extremely validating right you just get
 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.560
extremely validating right you just get
this this immediate gratification and

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570
this this immediate gratification and
 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.700
this this immediate gratification and
there's just this this beautiful

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710
there's just this this beautiful
 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.170

customer feedback loop that you're

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180
customer feedback loop that you're
 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.150
customer feedback loop that you're
basically just trying to harness and and

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160
basically just trying to harness and and
 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.670

interpret so where do we test and what

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680
interpret so where do we test and what
 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.350
interpret so where do we test and what
do we test for back in 2015 the

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360
do we test for back in 2015 the
 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.660
do we test for back in 2015 the
subscription business essentially went

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670
subscription business essentially went
 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.189
subscription business essentially went
through a digital transformation where

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199
through a digital transformation where
 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:55.750
through a digital transformation where
they said we need to kind of read jigger

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760
they said we need to kind of read jigger
 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.790
they said we need to kind of read jigger
things and set ourselves up for more

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800
things and set ourselves up for more
 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.220
things and set ourselves up for more
digital growth and so there were a

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230
digital growth and so there were a
 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.290
digital growth and so there were a
number of changes one of them was that

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300
number of changes one of them was that
 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.600
number of changes one of them was that
they made this this little team and they

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610
they made this this little team and they
 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.460
they made this this little team and they
said here's some money and go do some

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470
said here's some money and go do some
 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.530
said here's some money and go do some
testing and that's about that's about

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540
testing and that's about that's about
 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.149
testing and that's about that's about
all the guidance we we had and that's

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159
all the guidance we we had and that's
 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.240
all the guidance we we had and that's
about all we needed but the best place

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250
about all we needed but the best place
 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.230
about all we needed but the best place
to start any testing or experimentation

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240
to start any testing or experimentation
 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.420
to start any testing or experimentation
program is on the acquisition side right

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430
program is on the acquisition side right
 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.090
program is on the acquisition side right
it's really difficult to to screw up

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100
it's really difficult to to screw up
 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.830
it's really difficult to to screw up
your results or to not figure out when

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840
your results or to not figure out when
 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.590
your results or to not figure out when
you did something good or orders more

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600
you did something good or orders more
 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.039
you did something good or orders more
money is just usually a good thing so we

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049
money is just usually a good thing so we
 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.350
money is just usually a good thing so we
spent more than a year just focused on

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360
spent more than a year just focused on
 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.490
spent more than a year just focused on
solving for acquisition but of course

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500
solving for acquisition but of course
 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.499
solving for acquisition but of course
then we realized testing is something

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509
then we realized testing is something
 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.359
then we realized testing is something
that all you really need is you need a

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369
that all you really need is you need a
 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.550
that all you really need is you need a
digital moment he'd lots of traffic and

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560
digital moment he'd lots of traffic and
 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.889
digital moment he'd lots of traffic and
you need to know what you want people to

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899
you need to know what you want people to
 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.899
you need to know what you want people to
do so you can basically apply it to any

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909
do so you can basically apply it to any
 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.310
do so you can basically apply it to any
digital experience as long as you've

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320
digital experience as long as you've
 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.020
digital experience as long as you've
you've got all those things lined up so

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030
you've got all those things lined up so
 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.700
you've got all those things lined up so
we moved up the funnel on to the

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710
we moved up the funnel on to the
 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.550
we moved up the funnel on to the
editorial site but for people who were

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560
editorial site but for people who were
 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.789
editorial site but for people who were
unsubscribed so trying to trying to

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799
unsubscribed so trying to trying to
 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.200
unsubscribed so trying to trying to
change that experience and optimize that

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210
change that experience and optimize that
 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.990
change that experience and optimize that
experience so we could get increase the

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000
experience so we could get increase the
 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.060
experience so we could get increase the
conversion rate from content and then

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070
conversion rate from content and then
 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.259
conversion rate from content and then
also moving down the funnel where

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269
also moving down the funnel where
 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.449
also moving down the funnel where
obviously all of you guys are are

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459
obviously all of you guys are are
 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.790
obviously all of you guys are are
extremely well aware that onboarding is

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800
extremely well aware that onboarding is
 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.430
extremely well aware that onboarding is
a critical Accord

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440
a critical Accord
 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.710
a critical Accord
where you can really sort of set up your

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720
where you can really sort of set up your
 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.440
where you can really sort of set up your
members your your users for success or

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450
members your your users for success or
 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.190
members your your users for success or
for failure and again we've pushed out

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200
for failure and again we've pushed out
 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.350
for failure and again we've pushed out
again in 2018 we've partnered with the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360
again in 2018 we've partnered with the
 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.060
again in 2018 we've partnered with the
core product team which is sort of the

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070
core product team which is sort of the
 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.740
core product team which is sort of the
stewards of just what it means to

consume Wall Street Journal content so

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570
consume Wall Street Journal content so
 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.390
consume Wall Street Journal content so
we're solving just for real kind of true

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400
we're solving just for real kind of true

we're gonna add some more we're teaming

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140
we're gonna add some more we're teaming
 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.510
we're gonna add some more we're teaming
up with the retention team we're teaming

up with the retention team we're teaming
 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.280
up with the retention team we're teaming
up with the education team so we're just

up with the education team so we're just
 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.050
up with the education team so we're just
kind of getting our our tendrils out

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060
kind of getting our our tendrils out
 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.600
kind of getting our our tendrils out
across the business where there's sort

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610
across the business where there's sort
 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.890
across the business where there's sort
of the stakeholder who has the real

ownership of the real estate or the the
 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.480
ownership of the real estate or the the
business outcome and we try to

business outcome and we try to
 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.310
business outcome and we try to
facilitate them achieving that by

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320
facilitate them achieving that by
 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.640
facilitate them achieving that by

because we're we become experts at the
discipline of experimentation another

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020
discipline of experimentation another
 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.480
discipline of experimentation another
way to look at it is you look at the

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490
way to look at it is you look at the
 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.010
way to look at it is you look at the
metrics that were actually solving for

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020
metrics that were actually solving for
 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.660
metrics that were actually solving for
they've obviously exploded so how do we

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670
they've obviously exploded so how do we
 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.610
they've obviously exploded so how do we
choose what to test now I don't know

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620
choose what to test now I don't know
 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.810
choose what to test now I don't know
in this room would you guys who here

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820
in this room would you guys who here
 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.330
in this room would you guys who here
feel here isn't doing any a B

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340
feel here isn't doing any a B
 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.290
feel here isn't doing any a B
multivariate testing okay great

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300
multivariate testing okay great
 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.210
multivariate testing okay great
who feels like they're who feels like

there's just starting out okay so we're

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120
there's just starting out okay so we're
 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.410
there's just starting out okay so we're
yeah we're we're in we're further along

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420
yeah we're we're in we're further along
 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.750
yeah we're we're in we're further along
the the curve regardless of where you

are these are these three slides I think

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890
are these are these three slides I think
 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.340
are these are these three slides I think
are the most important slides in terms

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350
are the most important slides in terms
 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.720
are the most important slides in terms
of I think driving the success that

we've moved it up so there's nothing
wrong with that

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.390
wrong with that
so I'm gonna roll into some examples

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:49.400
so I'm gonna roll into some examples
 

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.710
so I'm gonna roll into some examples
again think about the thing about the

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720
again think about the thing about the
 

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.870
again think about the thing about the
low-hanging fruit I think there's all

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880
low-hanging fruit I think there's all
 

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.340
low-hanging fruit I think there's all
these examples are consistent at their

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:54.350
these examples are consistent at their
 

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:55.569
these examples are consistent at their
low-hanging fruit

00:08:55.569 --> 00:08:55.579
low-hanging fruit
 

00:08:55.579 --> 00:08:57.639
low-hanging fruit
and that they were we started with

00:08:57.639 --> 00:08:57.649
and that they were we started with
 

00:08:57.649 --> 00:09:02.559
and that they were we started with
something relatively subtle on the

something relatively subtle on the
acquisition side cut the fat add a

thought they already knew time and place
so cutting the fat the first thing that

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:13.160
so cutting the fat the first thing that
 

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.490
so cutting the fat the first thing that
we did was not to have an idea about

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:15.500
we did was not to have an idea about
 

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.019
we did was not to have an idea about
what we should add to anything there's a

00:09:17.029 --> 00:09:19.119
what we should add to anything there's a

thing we said is let's not assume we

00:09:25.809 --> 00:09:25.819
thing we said is let's not assume we
 

00:09:25.819 --> 00:09:27.009
thing we said is let's not assume we
have any good ideas about what we should

00:09:27.009 --> 00:09:27.019
have any good ideas about what we should

add to any of these experiences let's

00:09:28.569 --> 00:09:28.579
add to any of these experiences let's
 

00:09:28.579 --> 00:09:30.220
add to any of these experiences let's
look at what we can cut especially when

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:30.230
look at what we can cut especially when
 

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.800
look at what we can cut especially when
it comes to forms so this was the

about one minute to complete it when you
went as fast you could we cut about 25%

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360
onboarding was our onboarding is a
 

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.579
onboarding was our onboarding is a
historically was a single sort of static

00:16:47.579 --> 00:16:47.589
historically was a single sort of static
 

00:16:47.589 --> 00:16:50.790
historically was a single sort of static
page and we realized they just came from

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800
page and we realized they just came from
 

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.189
page and we realized they just came from
a checkout which is mandatory obviously

00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199
a checkout which is mandatory obviously
 

00:16:53.199 --> 00:16:55.530
a checkout which is mandatory obviously
and card based so we wondered could be

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:55.540
and card based so we wondered could be
 

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.030
and card based so we wondered could be
psychologically leveraged this

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040
psychologically leveraged this
 

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.740
psychologically leveraged this
experience going into onboarding where

00:16:58.740 --> 00:16:58.750
experience going into onboarding where
 

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:00.059
experience going into onboarding where
this stuff that we really would love

00:17:00.059 --> 00:17:00.069
this stuff that we really would love
 

00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:01.110
this stuff that we really would love
them to do and we know they're gonna

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120
them to do and we know they're gonna
 

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.610
them to do and we know they're gonna
value our product a lot more they're

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:02.620
value our product a lot more they're
 

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.650
value our product a lot more they're
gonna get much more out of it if they

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:04.660
gonna get much more out of it if they
 

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.900
gonna get much more out of it if they
actually do perform these actions so we

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:06.910
actually do perform these actions so we
 

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:09.419
actually do perform these actions so we
wondered if we could leverage that's

00:17:09.419 --> 00:17:09.429
wondered if we could leverage that's
 

00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:11.819
wondered if we could leverage that's
that that experience once we got to

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:11.829
that that experience once we got to
 

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:13.500
that that experience once we got to
onboarding so we turned onboarding into

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:13.510
onboarding so we turned onboarding into
 

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.120
onboarding so we turned onboarding into
a card-based experience so the most

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:15.130
a card-based experience so the most
 

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:16.860
a card-based experience so the most
important thing it does is it focused it

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:16.870
important thing it does is it focused it
 

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.140
important thing it does is it focused it
focused them in on an a.1 experience at

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:19.150
focused them in on an a.1 experience at
 

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:20.880
focused them in on an a.1 experience at
the TAT a time so right so there their

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:20.890
the TAT a time so right so there their
 

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.980
the TAT a time so right so there their
attention was not divided between the

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:22.990
attention was not divided between the
 

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:24.390
attention was not divided between the
four things and we obviously were able

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400
four things and we obviously were able
 

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.100
four things and we obviously were able
to prioritize them in Torreon in order

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:26.110
to prioritize them in Torreon in order
 

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:29.909
to prioritize them in Torreon in order
of benefit to them and to us but the

00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919
of benefit to them and to us but the
 

00:17:29.919 --> 00:17:31.020
of benefit to them and to us but the
second thing is just because it was

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:31.030
second thing is just because it was
 

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.640
second thing is just because it was
cautious because it looked card based

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:32.650
cautious because it looked card based
 

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:34.409
cautious because it looked card based
and it looked like the checkout it just

00:17:34.409 --> 00:17:34.419
and it looked like the checkout it just
 

00:17:34.419 --> 00:17:37.380
and it looked like the checkout it just
felt just mandatory enough even though

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:37.390
felt just mandatory enough even though
 

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:38.880
felt just mandatory enough even though
right there's a very large skip and

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:38.890
right there's a very large skip and
 

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:40.890
right there's a very large skip and
continue button on any of them that

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:40.900
continue button on any of them that
 

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.890
continue button on any of them that
we're able to really get really you know

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:43.900
we're able to really get really you know
 

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.180
we're able to really get really you know
dramatically increase the rate at which

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:45.190
dramatically increase the rate at which
 

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.610
dramatically increase the rate at which
they're doing all these things which

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:47.620
they're doing all these things which
 

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:50.049
they're doing all these things which
just enhances the value of

00:17:50.049 --> 00:17:50.059
just enhances the value of
 

00:17:50.059 --> 00:17:55.149
just enhances the value of
the subscription they just decided to to

00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:55.159
the subscription they just decided to to
 

00:17:55.159 --> 00:17:58.299
the subscription they just decided to to
purchase and I think that's what all I

00:17:58.299 --> 00:17:58.309
purchase and I think that's what all I
 

00:17:58.309 --> 00:17:58.710
purchase and I think that's what all I
got

00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:58.720
got
 

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:05.269
got
