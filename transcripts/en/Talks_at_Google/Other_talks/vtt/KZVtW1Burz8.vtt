00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:03.630
&gt;&gt; Male Presenter: Good afternoon ladies and
gentlemen.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.310
Hopefully everyone on VC can hear us.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.440
Uh, my name is Dontae Rayford, and on behalf
of Authors@Google and the Black Googler Network,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.889
I’m really excited to announce today’s
speaker, Mr. Baratunde Thurston.

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.460
Um, Baratunde is described as a politically
active, tech loving comedian.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.880
He currently serves as the Director of Digital
for The Onion, and he’s also the co-founder

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.830
of Jack and Jill Politics.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.239
He is a D.C. native, graduated from Harvard
University, and he currently lives in Brooklyn,

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:33.390
New York.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.260
His first book, How to Be Black, which he’s
here to speak to us about today, was published

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.339
this month, black history month, February
2012 by Harper Collins.

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:45.350
Without further ado, I’d like to welcome
Mr. Baratunde Thurston.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.350
[Applause]

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.200
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: What’s up everybody?

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.730
[Audience murmurs]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Happy black history

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.730
month.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.940
Give yourselves a round of applause for black
people.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.750
[Applause]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: All people, but especially,

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.839
especially us.

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.110
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: It’s, uh, it’s

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.330
good to be here at the Googleplex.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.270
I saw some strange, you have like a, sort
of E.T. type pod going on.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.050
There’s like these zipped up tents that
people are workin' in.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.590
And then I met someone, she said she worked
in People Operations.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.330
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: And I was, are you

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.160
experimenting on the human genome?

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.080
Like, it’s just a little disconcerting.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.660
Basically, for those of you watching on video,
this may be my last appearance in public.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.340
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Tell my family I love

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.990
them, very much.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.480
Uh, I wanna talk about, uh, “blackness”,
the book, my life, a little bit of tech stuff

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.210
and wrap it all into one.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.010
Why don’t we just get started with this,
uh, first a little bit more background of,

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.010
uh, who I am.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.090
I’m a stand-up comic.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.610
I’ve been doing comedy for about ten years.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.409
I started off in Boston and moved to New York
four and a half, five years ago.

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.430
I co-founded this blog, Jack and Jill Politics.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.619
It started in the summer of 2006 with Cheryl
Contee.

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.390
And it’s a blog about U.S. politics, usually
from a black perspective.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.310
The watermelon is our logo, and that symbolizes
intelligence.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.761
Most smart people love watermelon and that’s
really all that there is to it.

00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:15.770
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: If you see something

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.200
else you should get yourself checked out cause
you have issues.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.580
You know, watermelon is just wonderful.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.440
I hosted a TV show on Discovery Science channel
a few years ago called Popular Science's Future

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.360
Of, and it was really cool for me to be able
to do this show.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.810
We traveled around the world looking at questions
about how we might live in ten to twenty years.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.380
The future of sex, future of play, future
of habitat and what I learned most importantly

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.520
is that in the future, all black people will
be required to wear wet suites.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.220
So make sure you get yours, uh, because supplies
are running out.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.820
Global warming is coming.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.959
I now, uh, work as Director of Digital for
The Onion, America’s finest news source.

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.090
I’ve been there for over four years and
I’ve had a great time.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.450
My chief contribution, however, is to be every
black person in all the images that The Onion

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.810
uses in this journalism.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.569
[laughter] In this case, I played Obama’s
hillbilly half cousin, Cooter Obama, and threaten

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:13.920
to derail his campaign.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.550
Obviously, Cooter did not succeed, and others
are still attempting to derail the president.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.690
Um, and I, this is a very important aspect
of my life.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.450
I do a lot of public service work, a lot of
community service and sort of volunteer efforts.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.920
And, the chief thing that I do is I live hate
tweet the Twilight movies.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.660
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: And so what that means

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.190
is, first of all Twilight is a terrible, terrible
thing.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.910
It’s basically like a stalker positioned
as an object of desire to convince young girls

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.760
that they want to live this sort of life that’s
very, very destructive to their egos and their

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.760
self-esteem.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.130
And it’s horrible for America and the world,
so I tried to do what I can.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.020
So opening weekends I go to the theater, I
sit in the back, and I live tweet the movie

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.020
but with hate.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.190
So I call it live hate tweeting.

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.480
And it’s amazing.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.239
I’ve convinced several people not to see
it.

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.220
It’s been worth that investment of my time.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.129
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: I kinda feel like that

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:07.530
teacher that wants to reach one student, you
know if you could just change one life.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.209
Uh, so if I could just convince one person
not to spend fifteen dollars on garbage, then

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.180
I’ve done my job as a citizen.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.190
So that’s pretty cool.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.329
And then I’ve written this book and that’s
what we’re here to talk mostly about.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:20.769
Uh, the book is called How to Be Black.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.750
I have a very simple marketing message, if
you don’t buy the book, you’re a racist.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.180
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: And that’s just true,

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.570
it’s not like a thing, it’s not a hook,
it’s not a scam.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.039
And it works, it works.

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:38.110
We actually found out, uh, after the first
week, that we made the New York Times best

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.110
seller list.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.270
So guilt works ladies and gentlemen.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.190
[Cheering]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: I highly recommend

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.190
it.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.540
You guys should try it in your, in your Google
products.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.949
And those of you at home, your products as
well.

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:53.940
So before I keep going forward I want to go
back a little bit and then tell you not just

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.210
what I’ve been up to, but where I’ve come
from, and I’ll go back a couple generations.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:05.190
This is an image of my great grandfather,
Benjamin Lonesome, born in 1870 in Caroline

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.750
County, Virginia, born a slave, taught himself
to read, as the family story goes, and moved

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.750
to Washington, D.C.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.380
Now some of you are thinking, “Born a slave
after the emancipation proclamation?”

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.200
Government doesn’t always work ladies and
gentlemen.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.250
Government doesn’t always work.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.830
Decrees are not always adhered to.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.280
But, he moved to D.C. and he worked for the
city and he lived to be quite old actually,

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.100
he had two daughters.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:34.440
One of whom was Lorraine Martin, who I didn’t
find out until 2005, that she was the first

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.970
black employee in the US Supreme Court building.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.250
And we found all these clips in our mom’s
stuff.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.139
Our mom had passed away, so we’re going
through trying to figure out what to keep

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:43.139
and what not to keep.

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.570
We’re like, “Hey, we have this great family
history we did not know about.”

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.710
Now, our grandmother was a very proud woman.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.660
She’s pretty well educated for the time.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.280
She traveled a lot more than was normal for
black people of the era.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.410
She did not necessarily spend a lot of her
own time, uh, raising her own daughter.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.490
She had this really adorable daughter.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.300
This is my mother, Arnita Thurston.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.680
You can see where my cuteness comes from.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.449
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: So she sent, our grandmother

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:14.430
sent our mother off to Boarding School at
age 8.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.050
In a little town called Cornwells Heights,
Pennsylvania.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:22.520
At the time it was a rural farming community,
now it’s a thriving suburb of Philadelphia.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.940
And my mother had some trouble adjusting to
this environment, little black girl away from

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.050
her home in the city cast off into an all-black
Catholic boarding school.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.470
Kareem Abdul Jabbar went to this boarding
school.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.150
He was not Kareem Abdul Jabbar at the time
he went there.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.830
I’m not sure they would have admitted him,
uh, if he had been.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.160
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: But my mother had some

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.250
tough times at this school.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.500
So tough that she wrote letters back to her
mother and I want to share just one of them

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.080
that my sister and I found.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.660
This is letter, in the 8-year-old handwriting,
sent from a daughter to her mother, “Dear

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.340
Mother, I am having fun but I do not like
it here.”

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.830
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: “I am mad at you.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.300
Please send me some cookies.”

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.690
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Very important.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.419
“And a Sparkle Plenty doll.”

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:15.310
Sparkle Plenty was this character, very, very
popular back in the 40s and 50s.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.180
“Please, uh, they can have dolls here.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.199
Please send it because I do not have anything
to play with.

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:24.830
Yours Truly, Arnita.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.820
So it’s an adorable, sad letter from a daughter
to her mother.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.650
But I want you to focus on the lower left
corner of this letter.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:39.860
This very neat handwriting, very different
font, uh, different color scheme, says “over.”

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:45.760
When you flip the letter over you see this
note, which says, “If your little girl is

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:52.540
dissatisfied, we’d be glad to have her bed
for children who are anxious to come.”

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:58.389
Signed, “Sister” Which is sort of like
the NSA wiretapping of, I guess, 1948.

00:07:58.389 --> 00:08:00.330
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: You gotta protect the

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.770
nation from little black girls that want dolls
and cookies.

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.229
It’s very much a threat to the nation.

00:08:06.229 --> 00:08:08.729
So my mother did not stay long at that school.

00:08:08.729 --> 00:08:13.960
But she did stay within the confines of what
was expected of a modern Negro woman.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:19.380
This is her as a teenager wearing a dress
below the knees, carrying a basket, probably

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.230
full of happy feelings about America.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:22.810
I’m sure what was in that basket.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:28.490
She worked at her high school newspaper, but
before long her social network changed and

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.250
she started hanging out with people that looked
like this.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.450
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: This is a dude name

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:34.450
El Dorado.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.450
[Laughter]
[Murmurs]

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:36.950
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Like the car.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.390
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: And there are many

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:41.890
people in this world who, uh, who think they’re
cool.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:46.590
Some people watching this right now think
you’re cool and know people who are cool.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:47.750
You’re not.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.050
You’re friends aren’t.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:54.190
This dude, El Dorado, is the last cool person
to ever have existed.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.790
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Look at the shoes,

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:59.529
look at the phone; look at the typewriter,
the pants, the hair, everything about this

00:08:59.529 --> 00:09:01.150
picture is cool.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:05.290
Cool is now a historic relic thanks to the
high bar El Dorado set.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:06.560
But my mom didn’t stop there.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.779
She started getting political.

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:08.779
She was joining rallies.

00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:10.160
She was out in the streets.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:15.250
This is African Liberation Day Parade outside
of Malcolm X Park in Washington, D.C., headed

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.110
south on 16th street northwest.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.670
And right in the thick of it is my mom.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:21.200
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Cause the revolution

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.899
may not be televised but it could be photographed.

00:09:22.899 --> 00:09:24.440
You want your hair done up right.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.830
You want the eyes focused on the camera.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:30.290
[Pause]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Now, when I was born,

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:34.391
my mother did not leave these politics behind,
she very much infused them with me.

00:09:34.391 --> 00:09:37.920
A lot of kids had little books when they were,
you know, you had cartoons.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.080
You had See Spot Run and stuff like that.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.080
I didn’t have that.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.390
This was my first book, pretty much.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.670
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Called This is Apartheid.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:47.790
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: I had another book

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:51.260
called Africa is Not a Country, it’s a Continent.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:55.260
And when you are raised with this, like stark
black and white photos of Apartheid.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.110
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: It maybe has a little

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:01.180
effect on you as a young person whose mind
is being molded.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.839
Now, outside of our house is a very different
picture.

00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:09.970
This was a constant view from our front window
of Newton Street in the Columbia Heights neighborhood

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:11.649
of Washington, D.C.

00:10:11.649 --> 00:10:14.760
Lots of drugs deals and other stuff going
on, very much like the Wire.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.930
When the Wire came out I was traumatized and
excited.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.860
I was like, “I love this show, but I have
flashbacks.”

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:24.279
'Cause my neighborhood was just like the Wire,
you know, we had the drug dealing, the police

00:10:24.279 --> 00:10:27.290
corruption, we had everything the Wire had,
right?

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:32.700
Except for universal critical acclaim, uh,
and the undying love of white people who saw

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.700
it.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:34.700
Our neighborhood did not have that.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.700
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: But otherwise it was

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.029
very similar to the Wire.

00:10:37.029 --> 00:10:42.459
So my mom help navigate me and my sister through
this environment and we had this very proud

00:10:42.459 --> 00:10:45.540
moment at my college graduation from Harvard.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:50.170
And she gave me this big hug and said, “We
did it!” and my sister is so proud of capturing

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:53.560
this moment, she’s like, “I’m the best
photographer ever.”

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:59.589
And so that’s kind of where I have come
from and it’s the foundation of what this

00:10:59.589 --> 00:11:05.010
book is and kind of this conversation I wanna
start off with you guys here today.

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:09.500
So, let me talk about how the book was born,
first of all.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.410
And there’s, there’s a lot of the personal
stuff in there.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:14.340
But there’s also like a tech story too and
I think it’s pretty interesting to be talking

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.580
about that at Google.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:21.490
The book was born on Twitter via a hash tag.

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:27.720
And essentially I was shopping for wine and
I didn’t know how to buy wine.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.970
There’s all this history of wine flavors
and the air of frankincense or whatever, I

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.330
don’t know how to do all that stuff.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:37.910
And I was also not interested in learning,
so, I just wanted a bottle of wine.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:42.839
I went to the shop and I saw this brand of
wine called Negroamaro.

00:11:42.839 --> 00:11:47.870
N-E-G-R, we’re gonna have to riot now aren’t
we?

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.521
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: We’re just, this

00:11:49.521 --> 00:11:50.860
is the black history month.

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:55.690
A black man can’t speak at Google without
some white guy talking loudly over top of

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:56.690
him.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.800
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: This is ridiculous.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.860
I got 29 days man, c’mon.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.149
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Interrupt me in March

00:12:03.149 --> 00:12:04.890
and I will not complain.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.339
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Anyway, I was talking

00:12:07.339 --> 00:12:10.700
about my ignorant wine purchasing decisions.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:16.070
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: So I saw this brand

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:20.090
of wine called Negroamaro, I was like, that
spoke to me, “Negro wine!

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.090
This is perfect.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.180
That’s why I’m gonna buy it.”

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:27.970
So I posted to Twitter, and I was trying to
antagonize my friend, Elon James White who’s

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:29.060
a great comedian.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:32.470
He does a web series called This Week in Blackness
and Blackin’ It Up.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.640
And I said, “This weekend I picked my red
wine because it was called Negroamaro, that’s

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.660
how black I am.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.209
Elon James, how black are you?”

00:12:39.209 --> 00:12:40.990
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: I was just sort of

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.230
picking a fight playing a little joke back
and forth.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:47.710
And then he responded, “I see the subtle
racial implication of Thunder Cat.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:50.880
Panther was black, shirtless and Lionel’s
driver.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.530
How black are you?”

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:56.959
And so we went back and forth, volleying and
hundreds of other people weighed in and threw

00:12:56.959 --> 00:12:59.269
in their observations on how black are you.

00:12:59.269 --> 00:13:04.930
Then the audience for this was a member of
the Harper Collins team, a woman named Debbie

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:05.930
Stier.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:09.460
And she brought me in and we had a nice conversation
and said, “You should write a book.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.410
Why don’t you write a book called how black
are you?”

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:14.600
And I was like, “Why don’t I not do that?”

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.530
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: “That is a terrible

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:17.530
idea!”

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:18.779
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Cause it was one thing

00:13:18.779 --> 00:13:23.050
to have that conversation and that tension
and that battle between two people who know

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:27.170
each other, two people who are comedians and
we have assumed the best intentions.

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:28.660
I don’t wanna hit America with that.

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.190
I don’t trust America with that.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.610
I just had visions of watermelons dancing
in my head.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:34.010
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: People are like, “How

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:35.010
black are you?

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:36.410
I drink grape soda all the time!”

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:38.070
And I’m like, ‘No, no, no.’

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:42.250
America’s not ready for how black are you
at the Wal Mart bookshelf, like we can’t

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:43.250
do that just yet.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:45.510
We have some ways to go.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.000
But they said, “What about how to be black?”

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.850
And I was like, “Yes!

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:50.340
That is ridiculous.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.170
You can’t answer that, thus I want to try.”

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:59.110
And, uh, and be satirical about it, which
gives me some latitude and just have fun with

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.340
the impossible.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:04.940
So the book was gonna be a series of “How
To” chapters.

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:10.790
The first one was “How to speak for all
black people” um, and “How to be the black

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:12.410
friend” “How to be the black employee.”

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:14.400
Which, clearly you guys might have an interest
in.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.400
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: “Tell us how to do

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.400
it!

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.400
Tell us how to do it!”

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.400
Its coming, its coming.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.860
Just buy the book.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:24.761
Uh, but, there was another part of, sort of
the product development of the book, that

00:14:24.761 --> 00:14:27.460
I want to share what was not expected.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.720
And I want to talk about the role that e-mail
played.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.930
So I had this vision of, I’m gonna write
just a straight up satire set of chapters

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:35.830
on “How to.”

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:37.630
Separate from this, I operate an e-mail list.

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:38.980
I’ve been doing it for years.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.110
I thought e-mail was dead.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:43.180
I was like, “Ah, Facebook is here and Google
plus is here and Twitter is here.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.910
Nobody reads e-mail anymore.”

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:49.920
But because we live in such a fast paced,
sort of, status update-isphere, I wanted to

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:53.079
have a deeper relationship with the people
who wanted a connection with me.

00:14:53.079 --> 00:14:56.260
So the e-mail became a more of a behind the
scenes.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:00.320
And rather than just promoting shows, and
doing a few one liner jokes, is that every

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:05.130
e-mail I send, I’m gonna have a true personal
story as a part of it.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:09.130
So the same summer that I was doing the initial
rounds of writing this book, separate from

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:12.120
that I was sharing these personal stories
with my e-mail list.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:17.990
And one story I shared, which really struck
a nerve, I told the story of my father’s

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:21.060
murder and what my memory of him was.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.730
And I really only had six memories of this
dude.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:27.410
He died when I was very young; he didn’t
live with us even for the time when he was

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:28.430
alive.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:33.230
And I sent this out, I was on a bus, I was
on a Bolt bus to Boston, like a $15 bus, on

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:37.010
the Wi-Fi, banged this out in a couple hours,
sent it off.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:41.389
And the flood of responses that came back
from my subscribers was overwhelming.

00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:44.930
And one of those subscribers was my editor
at the time, Debbie Stier.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:47.300
And she wrote, “This needs to go into the
book!”

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:52.449
And she’s like, “All these stories are
just too rich; you can’t not use them.

00:15:52.449 --> 00:15:55.670
And I know it’s not part of the original
vision, but maybe we need to rethink what

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:57.089
this book should be.”

00:15:57.089 --> 00:15:58.360
So she, “Just write those.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.420
Don’t worry about the super hilarious stuff.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:01.910
This is, and this was still funny.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:07.050
Even the piece I wrote about my father’s
murder by gunshot was still darkly hilarious,

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.230
uh, if you’re open to that.

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:12.250
Which I was, I’ve been doing this for a
while.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:18.110
So I reconceived of what the book should be
and then personal memoir actually became the

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:19.950
heart of it.

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:26.230
So let’s talk about what’s inside, between
these pages, between these bytes, in the electronic

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:27.230
version.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:28.389
First off, it is my life.

00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:34.100
It is the story of a young black dude who
has an eccentric black background, and not

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.740
just black background, obviously there’s
more to me then black.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:41.570
But there is that story that people have heard
a lot of, that inner city, single mother,

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:43.170
gun violence and drugs thing.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:44.170
That’s one.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:49.839
There’s the Afrocentric rearing the fact
that I have a Nigerian name and I’m not

00:16:49.839 --> 00:16:50.839
Nigerian.

00:16:50.839 --> 00:16:54.230
[laughter] I remember I had a friend that
was Nigerian when I was growing up and I called

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:58.740
him on the phone, and his Nigerian father
answered and he’s like, “Hello?

00:16:58.740 --> 00:16:59.740
Who’s calling?”

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.579
And I was like, “Oh, sir this is Baratunde.”

00:17:01.579 --> 00:17:02.860
I might have been like 12 years old.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.959
“Where did you get that name?”

00:17:04.959 --> 00:17:07.389
Its like, how do you even answer that first
of all?

00:17:07.389 --> 00:17:10.209
I got it, oh I don’t know, the secret stash
of names that are mine.

00:17:10.209 --> 00:17:11.679
I got it from my parents.

00:17:11.679 --> 00:17:13.659
And he’s like, “Well do you even know
what it means?”

00:17:13.659 --> 00:17:14.699
And I was like, “Yeah.”

00:17:14.699 --> 00:17:17.199
And this is why I was really proud, cause
I had this super Afrocentric mother.

00:17:17.199 --> 00:17:19.499
She’s like, “You have to understand all
this stuff.”

00:17:19.499 --> 00:17:23.429
And I was like, “Literally it means Grandfather
returns or father returns.

00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:27.139
Or one that was chosen” And he’s like,
“No!

00:17:27.139 --> 00:17:31.429
No. it means grandfather returns or one who
was chosen.”

00:17:31.429 --> 00:17:34.960
It’s like, I just said that.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:39.480
Just said, you know how adults can be with
respect to children, they can’t hear you.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.129
Then he went on a rampage.

00:17:41.129 --> 00:17:44.899
He was like, “This is the problem with you
African Americans.

00:17:44.899 --> 00:17:46.460
You have no history.

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.460
No culture.

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.460
No roots.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.729
You think you can wear a dashiki, steal an
African name and become African.

00:17:52.729 --> 00:17:54.179
You cannot.”

00:17:54.179 --> 00:17:58.970
I was like, “Dude, I just learned how to
add last week, like slow down.”

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:01.509
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Why are you hating

00:18:01.509 --> 00:18:02.509
on me?

00:18:02.509 --> 00:18:03.509
I’m a baby.

00:18:03.509 --> 00:18:05.190
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Pick a fight with someone

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:06.570
your own ignorance.

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.989
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: So the book has stories

00:18:09.989 --> 00:18:10.989
like that.

00:18:10.989 --> 00:18:15.249
It also has a lot of the “How to’s”
There’s how to, how to be the next black

00:18:15.249 --> 00:18:17.030
president, one of my favorite chapters.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:22.509
A lot of restrictions around president Obama,
especially his relationship to black America

00:18:22.509 --> 00:18:23.509
and black people.

00:18:23.509 --> 00:18:26.749
Certain issues he can’t talk about because
they think he’s gonna like, reinstitute

00:18:26.749 --> 00:18:27.749
white slavery.

00:18:27.749 --> 00:18:29.139
Yes, I said reinstitute.

00:18:29.139 --> 00:18:31.970
We tried it once; it lasted for like a day.

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:33.830
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: And so there’s, you

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.980
know, some, some guidelines for the next black
president.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:40.330
And also the theory being that the second
black president really is the first black

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:44.169
president, cause the next time around America’s
doing it super intentional, like we know what

00:18:44.169 --> 00:18:45.169
we’re gonna get.

00:18:45.169 --> 00:18:47.200
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: So number 2 is actually

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.309
number 1.

00:18:49.309 --> 00:18:51.609
And then I, uh, so it created a panel.

00:18:51.609 --> 00:18:53.320
And I didn’t wanna interview too many people.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.260
So I picked seven folks, I call them the black
panel.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.960
People who I thought were doing blackness
well.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.500
And differently than what we commonly see.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.440
And so here’s who’s on that panel.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.070
There is three black women, starting with
Demali Ayo.

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:09.529
Demali is a performance artist and a writer.

00:19:09.529 --> 00:19:13.169
She wrote a book called Obamastan: Land without
Racism.

00:19:13.169 --> 00:19:18.129
I came across her in about 2003 when I was
just early in my own stand-up career and I

00:19:18.129 --> 00:19:21.649
found this website called rentanegro dot com.

00:19:21.649 --> 00:19:24.500
I was like, “What in the world is that?”

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:29.581
It was just hilarious, satirical product offering
where she’s like, “Look white people have

00:19:29.581 --> 00:19:32.580
a lot of questions of their black friends.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:37.950
We need to monetize this and set up some sort
of leasing system.”

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:39.850
So she had rentanegro dot com, she had prices.

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:42.419
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: She had all this stuff.

00:19:42.419 --> 00:19:47.070
She was inspired by this other dude, Keith
Obadike , who tried to auction off his blackness

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:48.070
on E-Bay.

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:51.490
And, uh, and sold it for not enough money.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.860
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: So Demali, she’s

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.169
gotta be in the book, gotta be in the book.

00:19:55.169 --> 00:19:58.109
It turns out that we went to the same high
school with the same friends.

00:19:58.109 --> 00:20:00.909
I didn’t even know that until we started
talking.

00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:05.510
Cheryl Contee, she is the co-founder with
me of Jack and Jill Politics.

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:09.130
Based in the Bay area, runs a social media
strategy firm.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:12.340
Um, Jacquetta Szathmari, she was someone I
did not know at all.

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.249
A friend connected me to her.

00:20:14.249 --> 00:20:19.450
A black woman who lives up in Riverside up
in the Bronx, Libertarian, and grew up in

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:20.809
the eastern shore of Maryland.

00:20:20.809 --> 00:20:21.899
She was like my rural vector.

00:20:21.899 --> 00:20:24.880
I was like, “Okay, let’s not keep it too
city focused.”

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.059
And she had a bunch of great stories to share.

00:20:28.059 --> 00:20:29.159
And then I had three black men.

00:20:29.159 --> 00:20:32.230
I had Kamau Bell who’s a Bay area comedian.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:34.409
[Applause]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Yeah, can we clap for

00:20:34.409 --> 00:20:35.409
them?

00:20:35.409 --> 00:20:36.480
Kamau, he, uh, I like this dude.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.239
I remembered hearing about him cause people
kept saying like, “I was like the Kamau

00:20:39.239 --> 00:20:40.239
of the east.”

00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:41.899
Or he was the Baratunde of the west.

00:20:41.899 --> 00:20:43.240
Why can’t black dudes just be each other?

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.330
Like why do you have to?

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.730
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: But um, he has a great

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:52.099
one man show called The W. Kamau Bell Curve,
which is a playoff of the Bell Curve book

00:20:52.099 --> 00:20:53.820
by Charles Murray.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:58.389
Who incidentally, Charles Murray has a new
book out about whiteness and I love that he

00:20:58.389 --> 00:21:00.179
launched it during black history month.

00:21:00.179 --> 00:21:01.179
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Just couldn’t let

00:21:01.179 --> 00:21:02.779
us have it, right?

00:21:02.779 --> 00:21:07.059
Anyway, Kamau’s show, the subtitles is ending
racism in about an hour.

00:21:07.059 --> 00:21:11.119
And he puts his money where his mouth is,
if you show up with a friend of a different

00:21:11.119 --> 00:21:13.039
race, you get in for half price.

00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:14.149
So that’s kind of nice.

00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:15.259
That’s kind of nice.

00:21:15.259 --> 00:21:19.309
Elon James White, who I mentioned earlier,
Brooklyn based comedian, This Week in Blackness

00:21:19.309 --> 00:21:21.409
and Blacking it Up, web shows.

00:21:21.409 --> 00:21:26.190
Derrick Ashong, who is a musician primarily,
but also a speaker and a TV host.

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:30.029
He has a band called Soulfege, he works for
Al Jazeera English.

00:21:30.029 --> 00:21:34.919
And Derrick, for me, also represented a bit
of the diaspora because he was born in Ghana.

00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:39.210
He was raised in all around the Middle East
in Qatar, Saudi Arabia.

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:43.639
And he spend his teen years and after in the
east coast, in the Philadelphia, New Jersey

00:21:43.639 --> 00:21:44.679
area.

00:21:44.679 --> 00:21:47.640
So he was kind of that global brother.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:51.279
And then I had one white guy, uh, on the panel
because I didn’t want to get hit with charges

00:21:51.279 --> 00:21:52.830
of reverse racism.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:55.999
And I wanted a control group cause this is
a science project as well.

00:21:55.999 --> 00:21:57.409
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: And so I picked the

00:21:57.409 --> 00:22:01.629
whitest guy I could find, who’s Christian
Lander, who is the author of Stuff White People

00:22:01.629 --> 00:22:02.629
Like.

00:22:02.629 --> 00:22:04.249
And help create that amazing set.

00:22:04.249 --> 00:22:07.850
And I really wanted the idea, like the idea
of a white comedian commenting on how to be

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:11.010
black was just too good to not try.

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:12.029
And he came through.

00:22:12.029 --> 00:22:17.470
So what I wanna share now is, uh, some of
the questions that I asked these people.

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:20.249
I asked them, “When did you first realize
you were black?”

00:22:20.249 --> 00:22:22.360
“How black are you?”

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.130
“Did you ever wish you weren’t black?”

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:26.429
“Can you swim?”

00:22:26.429 --> 00:22:30.090
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: A very important question.

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:34.720
“How’s that post-racial thing workin out
for you?” and, “What do you wish for the

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.450
future of black people and race in general
in America?”

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:40.240
So seven people, seven questions.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.970
It’s a nice grid of 49 clips.

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:49.159
And then what I did was I video recorded them
and also use a zoom audio mic to get some

00:22:49.159 --> 00:22:50.190
good audio.

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:53.309
So here is a sample of one of those clips.

00:22:53.309 --> 00:22:57.710
[Pause]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Oh, I should press

00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:59.210
play.

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:17.350
This is a compilation around one of the answers.

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:28.419
[Music plays]

00:23:28.419 --> 00:24:21.789
&gt;&gt; Female #1: So, I came home and I remember
I couldn’t really move past the entrance

00:24:21.789 --> 00:24:30.989
of the house.

00:24:30.989 --> 00:25:12.029
And I need to talk about the fact that this
little girl said that I was black when I,

00:25:12.029 --> 00:25:13.309
in fact, found myself to be beige.

00:25:13.309 --> 00:25:14.309
[Music plays]

00:25:14.309 --> 00:25:19.080
&gt;&gt; Male #1: I was playing doctor with a bunch
of kids and, uh, when this one girl, it was

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.719
her turn to kiss me and she didn’t.

00:25:21.719 --> 00:25:24.074
And she sort of ran away laughing, the kids
ran away laughing.

00:25:24.074 --> 00:25:25.074
And the thing I realized at that point is
that I was black and they were all white because

00:25:25.074 --> 00:25:26.074
this was a small private school in Boston.

00:25:26.074 --> 00:25:27.074
And that was the first time I remember feeling
like black was somehow separate from the norm,

00:25:27.074 --> 00:25:28.074
you know.

00:25:28.074 --> 00:25:29.074
I think I knew I was black before then because,
as I say in my show, my mom would not have

00:25:29.074 --> 00:25:30.074
not let me know that I was black.

00:25:30.074 --> 00:25:31.074
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt; Male #1: There would have been no way that

00:25:31.074 --> 00:25:32.074
she would have let that information slip.

00:25:32.074 --> 00:25:33.074
“It’s cold outside take a jacket and you’re
black”.

00:25:33.074 --> 00:25:34.074
[Laughter]
[Music plays]

00:25:34.074 --> 00:25:35.074
&gt;&gt; Male #2: I was born in Africa, so everybody’s
black.

00:25:35.074 --> 00:25:36.074
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Male #2: So, we don’t really think about

00:25:36.074 --> 00:25:37.074
it like that.

00:25:37.074 --> 00:25:38.074
I mean here it’s like “Is he black?

00:25:38.074 --> 00:25:39.074
Is he white?”

00:25:39.074 --> 00:25:40.074
In Africa, like, you don’t ask.

00:25:40.074 --> 00:25:41.074
The assumption is that you’re black.

00:25:41.074 --> 00:25:42.074
Therefore, what becomes more important is
other things.

00:25:42.074 --> 00:25:43.074
What your name is, where you come from, what
language do you speak, what’s your culture,

00:25:43.074 --> 00:25:44.074
what’s your tribe etcetera.

00:25:44.074 --> 00:25:45.074
So I knew I was black.

00:25:45.074 --> 00:25:46.074
When I was eight, I moved to the Middle East.

00:25:46.074 --> 00:25:47.074
I think the Middle East is the first time
I discovered I was black.

00:25:47.074 --> 00:25:48.074
Because people would come up to you and they’d
be like,

00:25:48.074 --> 00:25:49.074
[Inaudible]

00:25:49.074 --> 00:25:50.074
&gt;&gt; Male #3: And what does that translate to?

00:25:50.074 --> 00:25:51.074
&gt;&gt; Male #2: That means this little black guy.

00:25:51.074 --> 00:25:52.074
[Laughter]
[Music plays]

00:25:52.074 --> 00:25:53.074
Male #4: I grew up in East Chinatown in Toronto.

00:25:53.074 --> 00:25:54.074
So it was made very clear that I was gweilo
from a very early--

00:25:54.074 --> 00:25:55.074
Male #3: Gweilo?

00:25:55.074 --> 00:25:56.074
Meaning?

00:25:56.074 --> 00:25:57.074
Male #4: White ghost.

00:25:57.074 --> 00:25:58.074
So I know every derogatory term for a white
person in Chinese.

00:25:58.074 --> 00:25:59.074
[Music plays]

00:25:59.074 --> 00:26:00.074
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: So that’s some of,
you know what people have to say in the book.

00:26:00.074 --> 00:26:01.074
In the enhanced version, we have a lot of
those clips built in.

00:26:01.074 --> 00:26:02.074
And in the audio version, instead of me reading
their words, you actually hear them saying

00:26:02.074 --> 00:26:03.074
what they say and you can hear the backgrounds
of the neighborhoods they live in and I really

00:26:03.074 --> 00:26:04.074
wanted it to be an audio experience.

00:26:04.074 --> 00:26:05.074
I did the reading myself, uh, as well because
black people can read now, it’s pretty awesome.

00:26:05.074 --> 00:26:06.074
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Uh, so I wanna talk

00:26:06.074 --> 00:26:07.074
about that process.

00:26:07.074 --> 00:26:08.074
You know, give a little behind the scenes
of the writing process.

00:26:08.074 --> 00:26:09.074
And this is the sort of, uh, the route that
I came up with.

00:26:09.074 --> 00:26:10.074
I tried to write this book in summer of 2010,
I sort of missed my target.

00:26:10.074 --> 00:26:11.074
I told you about the reengineering around
memoir, so summer 2011 was it.

00:26:11.074 --> 00:26:12.074
I had a drop dead deadline, July 15th.

00:26:12.074 --> 00:26:13.074
And those last four weeks, this was all I
did.

00:26:13.074 --> 00:26:14.074
I woke up, I ate, I wrote, I biked into work,
I took a break, I wrote, I took another break,

00:26:14.074 --> 00:26:15.074
I wrote, I biked home and kind of wash, rinse,
repeat.

00:26:15.074 --> 00:26:16.074
I also wanted to play with the community of
people who knew this book was coming.

00:26:16.074 --> 00:26:17.074
Folks who were interested in what I had to
do.

00:26:17.074 --> 00:26:18.074
So I was trying to use the web in some interesting
ways.

00:26:18.074 --> 00:26:19.074
When I did the interviews I would check in
on four square and use the hash tag how to

00:26:19.074 --> 00:26:20.074
be black.

00:26:20.074 --> 00:26:25.820
I was sharing snippets of what I wrote on
Facebook and on my Google plus page.

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:29.940
And so this was a chapter I wrote about what
It means, “How to be the black employee.”

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:33.809
And folks were just really, you know, we had
a lot of good feedback, uh, on that early

00:26:33.809 --> 00:26:34.809
moment.

00:26:34.809 --> 00:26:37.509
Even as I was writing I was like, “Okay,
is this gonna write my sort of how to be black

00:26:37.509 --> 00:26:39.739
beta project?”

00:26:39.739 --> 00:26:44.190
I also got some amazing feedback and I wanna
share just a few slices of what people had

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:47.349
to say as they looked over my virtual shoulder.

00:26:47.349 --> 00:26:53.309
Some woman said, “This book is clearly not
written for black folks.

00:26:53.309 --> 00:26:56.129
It’s too wordy and there’s no pictures.”

00:26:56.129 --> 00:26:58.909
That was one of my Facebook fans that wrote
that.

00:26:58.909 --> 00:27:03.809
So I wrote her back and saying, “Can someone
please translate this for me?

00:27:03.809 --> 00:27:05.879
I can’t understand it without pictures.”

00:27:05.879 --> 00:27:07.869
Uh, so that was pretty interesting.

00:27:07.869 --> 00:27:12.059
Someone else wrote, “This book is solely
based on ignorance.

00:27:12.059 --> 00:27:14.799
Martin Luther King, Junior would be ashamed
if he read this.

00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:17.379
Good job with settin us back fifty years,
dick.”

00:27:17.379 --> 00:27:19.469
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: There’s a lot to

00:27:19.469 --> 00:27:20.469
unpack from that.

00:27:20.469 --> 00:27:23.580
First of all, he has a direct channel with
the ghost of Martin Luther King, which I think

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.960
is amazing that we haven’t heard from this
dude before.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.029
I also like that he called me a dick, that’s
really nice.

00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:30.029
That’s really nice.

00:27:30.029 --> 00:27:32.409
But mostly I like how he spelled “solely.”

00:27:32.409 --> 00:27:34.179
S-O-U-L-Y, which is kinda black.

00:27:34.179 --> 00:27:36.519
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: And I was like, “Maybe

00:27:36.519 --> 00:27:38.139
I should listen to this dude.

00:27:38.139 --> 00:27:42.820
Maybe I’m, maybe the public knows more than
me about this.”

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:45.539
I got an e-mail from a friend of mine during
this process.

00:27:45.539 --> 00:27:49.830
His name is Anand Giridharadas, he’s a New
York Times columnist, written a book called

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:50.909
India Calling.

00:27:50.909 --> 00:27:52.899
He’s become a very good friend.

00:27:52.899 --> 00:27:57.889
And he said, “I have an amazing idea for
you as a publicity stunt, create a public

00:27:57.889 --> 00:28:00.730
writing viewing for your final day of writing
the book.”

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:05.259
He’s in this screen sharing service called
Join dot Me.

00:28:05.259 --> 00:28:07.529
You can share your screen with the world.

00:28:07.529 --> 00:28:08.529
And so I did that.

00:28:08.529 --> 00:28:14.070
I actually, when he wrote, I wrote him back
immediately, a really long e-mail explaining

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:17.210
why this is a terrible idea and no author
should ever do this.

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:18.440
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: But as I wrote those

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.929
words I convinced myself otherwise and decided
to give it a shot.

00:28:21.929 --> 00:28:23.739
And so I called it My Live Writing Exercise.

00:28:23.739 --> 00:28:28.410
And I was remembering a friend of mine who
does the live painting, Marc Scheff, and he

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:32.789
allows you to see him actually paint, digitally,
using a Wacom Tablet.

00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:35.980
And, uh, I’ve seen stuff like that with
construction.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.489
But never with words, I hadn’t seen someone
do that before.

00:28:38.489 --> 00:28:41.759
So, when people came, this is the screen that
they would see.

00:28:41.759 --> 00:28:44.219
It had a little billboard explaining what
was going on.

00:28:44.219 --> 00:28:49.080
You were watching @Baratunde write How to
Be Black keep the hash tag going.

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.299
Please don’t like, I’m not gonna be chatting
with you.

00:28:51.299 --> 00:28:53.519
People were trying to take control of my machine.

00:28:53.519 --> 00:28:54.659
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Because you’re gonna

00:28:54.659 --> 00:28:55.659
have that happen.

00:28:55.659 --> 00:28:56.659
And like, “I wanna help you!”

00:28:56.659 --> 00:28:57.659
I’m like, “No!

00:28:57.659 --> 00:28:58.659
No!

00:28:58.659 --> 00:28:59.659
This is still me writing.

00:28:59.659 --> 00:29:00.659
You get to watch.

00:29:00.659 --> 00:29:01.659
Right?

00:29:01.659 --> 00:29:02.659
You get to watch.”

00:29:02.659 --> 00:29:06.419
So they started chatting with each other as
I generally, uh, ignored them.

00:29:06.419 --> 00:29:09.240
I did take one major tip from this audience.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:13.860
I had this chapter called Going Back to Africa,
which is about my first trip to Senegal when

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:14.860
I was in high school.

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:18.179
And someone said, “You should call it Going
Black to Africa” And I was like, “Obviously,

00:29:18.179 --> 00:29:19.179
I should.”

00:29:19.179 --> 00:29:20.179
And so I did.

00:29:20.179 --> 00:29:24.169
And I don’t know who that was, it was like
chatuser0056, but uh, they get a little credit

00:29:24.169 --> 00:29:26.629
for making the book even blacker.

00:29:26.629 --> 00:29:29.799
Uh, so this is what people had to say as they
were in the chat room.

00:29:29.799 --> 00:29:34.289
“This is really what the internet is all
about, gives me a connection with the author.”

00:29:34.289 --> 00:29:37.519
“How self-obsessed does one have to be to
set something like this up?”

00:29:37.519 --> 00:29:39.429
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: The answer is very.

00:29:39.429 --> 00:29:41.159
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Uh, I have a lot of

00:29:41.159 --> 00:29:42.159
self-love.

00:29:42.159 --> 00:29:44.619
“Update them to theme and I’ll leave you
alone.”

00:29:44.619 --> 00:29:48.299
A lot of people were obsessed with typos during
live writing.

00:29:48.299 --> 00:29:50.059
I’m like, “I will go back and fix those.”

00:29:50.059 --> 00:29:51.559
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: We have editors and

00:29:51.559 --> 00:29:54.379
copy editors, like, please don’t get caught
up on it.

00:29:54.379 --> 00:29:56.880
But a lot of people have a little OCD about
the spelling.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.980
“I’ve watched cartoonists before, but
this is very different.”

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:03.450
“Just the little I’ve read here makes
me want to buy this book.”

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:04.450
Yes!

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:05.450
Good.

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:07.169
I should follow up and make sure they did
it and they weren’t just lying.

00:30:07.169 --> 00:30:08.730
“I have an urge to tweet about this.”

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:09.730
Good.

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:11.089
“It’s interesting to see his writing flow.”

00:30:11.089 --> 00:30:14.759
“I’m surprised to see Baratunde use semi-colons.”

00:30:14.759 --> 00:30:15.979
Which again I’m like, “Why?

00:30:15.979 --> 00:30:17.279
Is it cause I’m black?

00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:18.279
Like, I don’t understand.”

00:30:18.279 --> 00:30:19.599
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Like, “Is that, am

00:30:19.599 --> 00:30:20.769
I not supposed to use semi-colons?

00:30:20.769 --> 00:30:23.619
Or is it something that I project into the
world?”

00:30:23.619 --> 00:30:27.440
We just know from my writing and my tweets
and my stand up, this dude doesn’t use semi-colons.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.729
What is he up to?

00:30:28.729 --> 00:30:30.029
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Somebody else is writing

00:30:30.029 --> 00:30:31.029
this book.

00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:33.909
Somebody in Norway was watching which I love
because that is a super white nation.

00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:37.589
And so I’m like, “He is gonna get a little
direct access to blackness.”

00:30:37.589 --> 00:30:40.279
This is my favorite comment by far though.

00:30:40.279 --> 00:30:41.460
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: “My girlfriend is

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:46.510
Chinese and I’m half Jamaican, half regular
black.”

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:48.679
So let’s just pause on “regular black.”

00:30:48.679 --> 00:30:50.919
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Cause you got Black

00:30:50.919 --> 00:30:53.299
Zero, Diet Black.

00:30:53.299 --> 00:30:56.190
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Black macchiato.

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:58.380
Like, I just want regular black.

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.549
“I think our kids might end up Dominican
or something.”

00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:08.009
Which is cool cause when you look at the projections
of, you know, demographics and inter marrying,

00:31:08.009 --> 00:31:09.720
like, everyone will kind of look Dominican.

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.379
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Puerto Rican, light

00:31:11.379 --> 00:31:12.379
skin Indian.

00:31:12.379 --> 00:31:13.879
You know, it’s pretty, we’re all gonna.

00:31:13.879 --> 00:31:15.649
How to be Brown is really what I should have
written.

00:31:15.649 --> 00:31:16.649
That’s what I’m saying.

00:31:16.649 --> 00:31:18.159
It’s a plan for the future.

00:31:18.159 --> 00:31:19.210
Future proof my book.

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:20.889
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Uh, and so then, finally

00:31:20.889 --> 00:31:25.559
I wanna talk about kind of taking the spirit
of all that, the life this is wrapped around,

00:31:25.559 --> 00:31:28.179
the way it was written in a semi open fashion.

00:31:28.179 --> 00:31:32.729
I wanted the marketing to be a bit different,
the extra from might typically be done.

00:31:32.729 --> 00:31:35.369
So Harper and I developed a really good partnership.

00:31:35.369 --> 00:31:38.739
They got a lot of great media, uh, for me
and with me.

00:31:38.739 --> 00:31:42.750
I was able to do Terry Gross, Fresh Air, which
is just like, she’s my hero.

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:44.950
She’s this big by the way.

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:47.349
I almost destroyed her by just sitting on
her.

00:31:47.349 --> 00:31:49.169
Terry Gross is the tiniest person.

00:31:49.169 --> 00:31:51.229
So I would almost have to apologize to the
world.

00:31:51.229 --> 00:31:56.009
But the first thing we do, well behind the
scenes, is set up a virtual street team.

00:31:56.009 --> 00:32:00.539
And I had taken some cues from Seth Godin
around this and wanted to tweak it for our

00:32:00.539 --> 00:32:01.539
own campaign.

00:32:01.539 --> 00:32:06.209
So we recruited people, we got over 100 people
folks to sign up to help spread the message

00:32:06.209 --> 00:32:07.679
of the book in their own way.

00:32:07.679 --> 00:32:08.679
So they got the book early.

00:32:08.679 --> 00:32:12.049
I wanted them to blog about it, and they were
not all black.

00:32:12.049 --> 00:32:18.089
This was an international crew, men and women,
um, Asian and Latin American, all kinds of

00:32:18.089 --> 00:32:20.440
folks able to find a connection with some
of these stories.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:26.049
Cause the story, black is sort of the variable,
how to be is sort of the heart of the story.

00:32:26.049 --> 00:32:29.399
I contacted everybody I knew.

00:32:29.399 --> 00:32:30.709
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: This is Ms. Cleo for

00:32:30.709 --> 00:32:32.609
those who don’t know.

00:32:32.609 --> 00:32:36.279
And I’m just like dialing for dollars is
very much a political campaign metaphor for

00:32:36.279 --> 00:32:37.279
this whole thing.

00:32:37.279 --> 00:32:38.979
And I’m still reaching out one by one.

00:32:38.979 --> 00:32:43.129
I talked to an author, I talked to Gary Vaynerchuk,
and I’m like, “What’s the one thing

00:32:43.129 --> 00:32:44.129
you think I should do?”

00:32:44.129 --> 00:32:46.260
He said, “Well did I ask you to buy my book?”

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:47.260
I was like, “Nope.”

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:48.260
And he’s like, “That was a miss.”

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.769
He’s like,” You have all these followers
who are actually friends.

00:32:50.769 --> 00:32:52.589
I didn’t hit you up personally.

00:32:52.589 --> 00:32:55.609
The one thing you could do that would be most
effective in getting your book out there is

00:32:55.609 --> 00:32:58.489
to talk to people one on one.

00:32:58.489 --> 00:32:59.489
Just do it.

00:32:59.489 --> 00:33:00.489
Do the hard work.”

00:33:00.489 --> 00:33:04.479
And show the shoe leather We got a little
crazy.

00:33:04.479 --> 00:33:06.249
I have a, I’m working with someone.

00:33:06.249 --> 00:33:09.090
I hired an assistant to help me through this
whole process.

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:11.909
His title is campaign manager, again sticking
with the theme.

00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:14.399
He’s white so his nickname is “white shadow.”

00:33:14.399 --> 00:33:17.589
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: And he, we were talking

00:33:17.589 --> 00:33:22.690
on Skype, I was traveling overseas and I’m
like, “Why don’t we create a black card?

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:25.289
Like, wouldn’t it be crazy if we created
a black card?”

00:33:25.289 --> 00:33:26.909
He’s like, “Yes, that would be crazy.”

00:33:26.909 --> 00:33:28.419
And, uh, but we did it.

00:33:28.419 --> 00:33:29.419
We actually did it.

00:33:29.419 --> 00:33:31.450
So if you go to gotblackness dot com.

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:33.289
It’s a pl--; we printed up a bunch of these.

00:33:33.289 --> 00:33:35.869
It’s a plastic card with a magnetic strip.

00:33:35.869 --> 00:33:39.070
On it there’s a RFid, or I forget, a QR
code.

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:42.849
There’s a concierge line to call with all
your racial questions.

00:33:42.849 --> 00:33:47.839
And here’s what the card does, it’s sort
of, One, it gets you 24 seven to the white

00:33:47.839 --> 00:33:49.869
house, so long as there’s a black president.

00:33:49.869 --> 00:33:52.299
So there’s an incentive to re-elect Obama.

00:33:52.299 --> 00:33:57.110
Two, you can have police custody for any racially
motivated, uh, holding.

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:58.169
Stop and frisk and stuff like that.

00:33:58.169 --> 00:34:01.629
I know you guys have issues in the Bay area
with that just flash your black card.

00:34:01.629 --> 00:34:06.899
You can win any racial argument if you violently
slam the card down on the table.

00:34:06.899 --> 00:34:08.210
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: And you are declared

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:10.310
an official friend to black people.

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:12.530
So it’s a really cool flexible model.

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:15.050
You got to activated it through text messaging.

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:17.289
We use things like if this, then that to help
us with is.

00:34:17.289 --> 00:34:19.220
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: It’s insane.

00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:21.879
Uh, actually, in fact, you know what, let
me just show you.

00:34:21.879 --> 00:34:24.260
I’m gonna go over to the live thing.

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:28.119
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Alright so here’s,

00:34:28.119 --> 00:34:31.750
uh, let me just show you some of our members.

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:36.149
So Ron Williams, Ron J. Williams CEO of Knodes
start up out of Brooklyn.

00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:41.349
He says, “I could never get a cab to take
me to Brooklyn due to the color of my skin.

00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:45.309
Now that I have the black card, and a phalanx
of lawyers trained by the ghost of Johnny

00:34:45.309 --> 00:34:46.929
Cochran, I get justice.”

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:49.529
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Newt Gingrich, temporarily

00:34:49.529 --> 00:34:54.519
US popular politician, “I make outlandish
comments about black people with almost no

00:34:54.519 --> 00:34:55.519
consequences.

00:34:55.519 --> 00:34:57.890
It’s because I’m a proud holder of the
black card.

00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:00.269
I never leave home without it.

00:35:00.269 --> 00:35:02.359
Now get off those food stamps, Negroes.”

00:35:02.359 --> 00:35:05.670
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Then this one, this

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:06.670
is really adorable.

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:07.950
This is a young member.

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:10.720
There’s no age restriction, no ageism in
the black card.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:14.819
This is Cormack, who is a white child, “I’m
3 years old.

00:35:14.819 --> 00:35:18.140
Thanks to the black card, I will never know
a life filled with white guilt.

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:20.789
Doesn’t your child deserve the same opportunity
I get?”

00:35:20.789 --> 00:35:22.369
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: So, you know, people

00:35:22.369 --> 00:35:23.690
can apply for membership with this card.

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:24.970
It’s a very exclusive program.

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:28.609
But, I’m very proud of what we’ve been
able to do there to kind of spread blackness.

00:35:28.609 --> 00:35:30.510
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: And we’re doing a

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:31.710
lot of live events.

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:37.289
Talks like this, throwing launch parties and
trying to keep the theme very black in the

00:35:37.289 --> 00:35:38.289
party.

00:35:38.289 --> 00:35:39.289
So, in D.C.

00:35:39.289 --> 00:35:41.130
I’m doing an after party at a bar called
Blackbird.

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:46.160
We got Black Grouse Whiskey co- sponsoring,
Brooklyn Beer, Black Chocolate Stout, so just

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:50.140
all black everything, uh, is the theme of
that.

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:53.960
And we have, actually this is very important,
there are two versions of the book.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:58.680
There is a black cover with white text and
a white cover with black text.

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:03.000
If you order online you don’t know which
one you’re gonna get, you can’t request

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000
a specific one.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.601
We’ve actually developed; I think you guys
at Google would be very proud of this, a racial

00:36:07.601 --> 00:36:13.079
profiling algorithm that determines which
book you need most and delivers that one to

00:36:13.079 --> 00:36:14.079
you.

00:36:14.079 --> 00:36:15.420
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: So for folks who insist,

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:18.410
like “I really want a white version, or
I really want a black version.”

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:22.500
Just keep ordering the books until you get
the one you want.

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.170
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: People of mixed race

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:26.150
or other race, are like, “Which one am I
supposed to get?”

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:27.240
“You’re supposed to buy both.”

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:29.000
{Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: So, it’s a very,

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.519
uh, pro-growth program around this book.

00:36:32.519 --> 00:36:37.950
And we set up this website, howtobeblack dot
me, where every day in February, and probably

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:42.430
beyond, we’re asking the same questions
that are shared in those chapters to the public.

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:44.180
“When did you first realize you were black?”

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:48.530
“How black are you?” and the stuff people
are saying, again, is pretty amazing.

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:54.019
Here’s a few I queued up, “I’m a graduating
senior, black female, mechanical engineering

00:36:54.019 --> 00:36:57.640
major from Georgia Tech and I cannot swim.”

00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:02.660
Uh, this is another story that someone shared,
“I realized I was black when they asked

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:03.980
me to Crip walk.”

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:06.079
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Alright.

00:37:06.079 --> 00:37:10.390
“I literally scared the heck out of folks
who had never a black brother that far out

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:11.390
in the ocean.”

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:12.760
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Sort of like black

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:13.790
spotting, I guess.

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:15.850
I don’t know what that is.

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:17.440
“You from Brooklyn and you don’t like
rap?

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:18.500
You ain't black!”

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:23.470
So people share all these stories and, uh,
we wanna kind of keep that going well beyond

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:24.470
the book.

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:26.940
The book’s not supposed to be some final
chapter, so there’s a party that we wanna

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.340
invite everyone to.

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:31.609
This photo, by the way, was shot by Neal Brennan.

00:37:31.609 --> 00:37:33.480
He co-created the Chappelle’s Show.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.079
He’s a stand-up comic.

00:37:35.079 --> 00:37:40.080
I gave him the book, he rid down a New York
subway, he was like mobbed by these four black

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.130
dudes like, “What are you holding?

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:42.130
What is that?”

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:43.130
And so there inspecting.

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:47.160
And I like the dude in the back far right,
who clearly already knows how to be black

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:49.559
and is not interested at all.

00:37:49.559 --> 00:37:52.780
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: So that is my formal

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:53.780
presentation.

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:56.220
I’d love to take your questions and we can
all get a little blacker.

00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:59.150
I’m Baratunde and thank you.

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:00.779
[Applause]

00:38:00.779 --> 00:38:07.859
&gt;&gt;Male #4: I was talking to Joe, and then
he’s like, “I think we got it working.”

00:38:07.859 --> 00:38:11.799
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Yeah, it started working as soon
as you walked out.

00:38:11.799 --> 00:38:12.799
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Oh.

00:38:12.799 --> 00:38:13.799
[Laughter]

00:38:13.799 --> 00:38:14.799
&gt;&gt;Male #5: They didn’t want you to be black,
that’s why it stopped.

00:38:14.799 --> 00:38:15.799
[Laughter]

00:38:15.799 --> 00:38:16.799
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Stopped it.

00:38:16.799 --> 00:38:17.799
[Laughter]

00:38:17.799 --> 00:38:18.799
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: What is going on here?

00:38:18.799 --> 00:38:19.799
Hi Mike!

00:38:19.799 --> 00:38:20.799
Oh, please say something racist.

00:38:20.799 --> 00:38:21.799
Please!

00:38:21.799 --> 00:38:22.799
Please!

00:38:22.799 --> 00:38:24.059
Somebody’s gonna lose their job today.

00:38:24.059 --> 00:38:25.059
Oh!

00:38:25.059 --> 00:38:26.059
[Laughter]
[Inaudible]

00:38:26.059 --> 00:38:29.519
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Yeah, there’s a,
for those in the room, mic right there.

00:38:29.519 --> 00:38:33.450
Please use that to ask all your blackness
questions.

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:36.829
&gt;&gt; Female #2: I apologize for my ignorance;
I don’t get the swimming joke.

00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:37.829
[Laughter]

00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:43.900
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: You know what, that’s
a good, that’s a good point.

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:45.339
She said, “I don’t get the swimming joke.”

00:38:45.339 --> 00:38:48.589
I have an answer but does any black person
here wanna address that.

00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:50.549
Cause we can go peer to peer on this.

00:38:50.549 --> 00:38:51.670
Please, go over to the mic.

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:52.670
[Laughter]
[Inaudible]

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:54.720
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: We want, please, use
the, he’ll hand you a mic.

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:55.720
Don’t talk yet.

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.720
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Don’t talk yet.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.470
And when you answer say your name if you’re
comfortable, if you’re not you can hide

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:00.900
behind your blackness.

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:01.900
[Laughter]

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:06.990
&gt;&gt; Female #3: it’s okay, don’t be ashamed.

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:11.940
Um, my name’s Elica and I work in Android
for the Google music store.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:15.930
So one of the things, I think one of the main
things that keep black people from swimming

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:20.560
so much, so most black people, I think, grow
up not learning how to swim.

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:23.940
I think one of the main things that keeps
us from learning is our hair.

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:28.220
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Female #3: That was, that was a big, big

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:29.440
impediment for me.

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:34.289
Um, but, unfortunately, I mean, fortunately,
for me my mom put braids in my hair and she

00:39:34.289 --> 00:39:37.280
put me in the pool and made me get swim lessons.

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:40.410
But I had girlfriends later I would try to
get to go to the pool they were like, “Uh-uh,

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:42.010
my mom just pressed my hair.”

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:44.680
Or “I did this, you know, I got a jerry
curl.”

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:49.400
You know, so all kind of things with hair
that, you know, really keep a lot of black

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:50.400
people from learning.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:53.990
And, I guess also just fear of sharks, maybe.

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:56.839
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Female #3: I don’t know, but I kind of

00:39:56.839 --> 00:39:59.860
break some of those barriers but, you know,
some people still are.

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:00.860
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Thank you.

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:01.950
Do you have an addendum to this?

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:02.950
Yeah?

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:06.450
&gt;&gt; Female #4: My name is Judith Williams;
I work on the diversity team here at Google.

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:11.430
And I’m probably a little bit older than
most of you here so you might not remember,

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:14.380
but Howard Cosell, who was a sports journalist.

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:15.380
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Yeah.

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:18.990
&gt;&gt;Female #4: He made this famous comment about
how black people can’t swim because we sink.

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:21.559
And that caused a huge uproar.

00:40:21.559 --> 00:40:23.819
So for me that’s one of the reasons why
it’s funny.

00:40:23.819 --> 00:40:25.490
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: There is a, thank you
very much.

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:26.490
Thank you both.

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:28.180
I like that we crowd sourced that a little
bit.

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:32.990
There’s also, in terms of the economics
of it, you know there’s been a historical

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:37.509
lack of access to pools or segregation around
pools that kind of seeped into the community

00:40:37.509 --> 00:40:38.849
over time.

00:40:38.849 --> 00:40:44.760
I ask this question to people, we have the
video on the site, but Jacquetta was a, she

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:47.670
grew up on the eastern shore and she’s like,
“You can’t not swim, you live right next

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:48.670
to the ocean.

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:50.710
If something could happen, I wanna know how
to do it.”

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:52.890
She was outlandish in that way.

00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:57.490
Kamau probably knew how to swim but he said,
“I can’t float very well cause I’m six

00:40:57.490 --> 00:41:01.279
foot two, 250 pounds build for slavery and
the revolution.”

00:41:01.279 --> 00:41:03.859
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: So that’s very important

00:41:03.859 --> 00:41:07.910
to keep in mind as well, if you’re built
for the revolution, you may be slower in the

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:08.910
water.

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:10.119
Any other questions or comments?

00:41:10.119 --> 00:41:11.119
Yeah?

00:41:11.119 --> 00:41:12.130
&gt;&gt; Female #5: Okay.

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:13.640
I’m here again.

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.640
So I know that you’re alum of my alma mater.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.640
And.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.640
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Which one are we talking?

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:19.640
&gt;&gt; Female #5: Harvard.

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:20.640
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Harvard, cool.

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.040
&gt;&gt; Female #3: And one of the things that I
found was, when I was at Harvard, there was

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.730
a lot of pulling the black card, shall we
say, or challenges.

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:30.599
And I’m wondering how your experiences at
a black student Harvard might have informed

00:41:30.599 --> 00:41:33.859
some of your later stand-up and your book
and some of the things you talk about.

00:41:33.859 --> 00:41:37.880
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Yes, so I have, I have
a chapter in the book called Black, “Being

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.130
Black at Harvard.”

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:41.450
I had good preparation for the Harvard environment.

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:45.130
I went to boot camp, also known as private
white high school.

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:46.829
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: And, I went to Sidwell

00:41:46.829 --> 00:41:50.670
Friend School, where the Obama daughters go,
where Chelsea Clinton was two years behind

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:51.670
me.

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:53.910
And that was my big cultural adjustment.

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:57.910
I’d been in D.C. public schools before then
and my neighborhood was all black and Latino.

00:41:57.910 --> 00:42:01.599
There were two white kids in my class in grade
school.

00:42:01.599 --> 00:42:03.490
One was William, one was Willamina.

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:07.150
So as far as I knew all white people had the
same name.

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:08.809
So Sidwell was culture shock.

00:42:08.809 --> 00:42:10.500
I had Ebonics when I showed up.

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:11.550
I axed people questions.

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:13.319
It’s a very long road.

00:42:13.319 --> 00:42:14.680
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: I’ve gotten through

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.040
it now, I’ve gotten through it.

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.660
I got treatment.

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:23.170
And, so Harvard for me was very liberating
because I’d gone through the whole process

00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:25.880
of being the minority in the educational institution.

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.799
Harvard certainly keeps changing in the types
of black people that go there, too.

00:42:28.799 --> 00:42:34.029
At the time that I was there, I think half
or to just slightly majority were not American

00:42:34.029 --> 00:42:38.559
native black, but were immigrants from some
other place, from the Caribbean from across

00:42:38.559 --> 00:42:39.559
the Diaspora.

00:42:39.559 --> 00:42:41.519
That changes things, that changes thing culturally.

00:42:41.519 --> 00:42:45.400
We also have people who much, many more people
over the history of Harvard who’ve had a

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:48.859
private school background, mixing with those
who have public school background, mixing

00:42:48.859 --> 00:42:50.950
with those from the Diasporic background.

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:57.009
So I did not, I was one of those dudes that
like hung out with the blackity black crowd

00:42:57.009 --> 00:42:58.359
and like sat at the black table.

00:42:58.359 --> 00:43:02.869
But also I, like, I talked to white people
because they were there and had knowledge

00:43:02.869 --> 00:43:07.569
in their brains that I wanted, and friendship
in their hearts.

00:43:07.569 --> 00:43:11.039
So I think I had a pretty idealized experience
because I was so very prepared.

00:43:11.039 --> 00:43:13.840
I don’t know that everyone had that experience.

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:16.059
You know everyone’s got their own college
experience, too.

00:43:16.059 --> 00:43:22.119
I would like to think that the mix of the
type of black people in each Harvard class

00:43:22.119 --> 00:43:26.090
over time contributes to a little bit less
of the black card pulling.

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:31.010
Except for mine, which I hope to monetize
and get all those people to invest using the

00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:32.010
black card.

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:33.230
Thank you.

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:36.599
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Anybody else?

00:43:36.599 --> 00:43:37.599
Step right up.

00:43:37.599 --> 00:43:38.619
&gt;&gt; Male #6: Alright.

00:43:38.619 --> 00:43:39.619
My name is Biola.

00:43:39.619 --> 00:43:41.050
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Biola, hello.

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:45.829
&gt;&gt; Male #6: So, um, I understand you have
an Arabic name, and a British name as well.

00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:46.829
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Yeah, yeah.

00:43:46.829 --> 00:43:47.920
My middle name
&gt;&gt; Male #6: Do you ever…?

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:48.920
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: What’s up?

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:49.920
Go ahead.

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.630
&gt;&gt; Male #6: Yeah, do you ever have to pull
out the black card to validate your blackness?

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:52.630
[Laughter]

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:55.740
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: I don’t have to pull
out the black card yet, I think people can

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:58.299
just sense that I have it in my wallet.

00:43:58.299 --> 00:44:03.470
Um, my middle name is Rafiq, R-A-F-I-Q, which
means friend or companion.

00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:07.240
And my last name is Thurston which means that
was the guy that owned my people.

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:10.329
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Um, so my name in comb--.

00:44:10.329 --> 00:44:14.210
Baratunde Rafiq in combination is supposed
to mean kingly companion.

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:16.609
That was what my mother was going for.

00:44:16.609 --> 00:44:21.220
Yeah, and I don’t, I don’t really have
patience for the black card being pulled thing.

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:24.200
And, uh, I know I’m black.

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.539
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: And I think the self-knowledge

00:44:26.539 --> 00:44:32.720
and the confidence to not be buffeted by the
external pressures from all kinds of people.

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.549
You know, there's this weird identity matrix,
right?

00:44:34.549 --> 00:44:38.470
Where there’s like who you are and who the
world expects you to be, whether you’re

00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:41.680
a woman, whether you’re black, whether you’re
gay, whether you’re white dude, whatever.

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.760
There’s always a gap in those things.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:48.140
And within the black matrix, there’s inside
the black community, “You’re not black

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:51.940
enough because you’re not thug or hood or
whatever.”

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:53.979
Or, “You’re not black enough cause you
don’t hate white people enough.

00:44:53.979 --> 00:44:54.979
“
[Laughter]

00:44:54.979 --> 00:44:56.539
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Or “Cause you’re
radically political enough.”

00:44:56.539 --> 00:45:01.200
Derrick had a great story about some folks
at a new Black Panther party in Boston saying

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:04.920
he’s not black enough and he’s like, “I’m
from Africa.

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:08.049
You cannot out black me, I win.

00:45:08.049 --> 00:45:09.119
I always win.”

00:45:09.119 --> 00:45:10.640
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: It’s just like.

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:15.680
So, and then, from the externally, you know
non blacks and black, those same switches

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:16.680
exist.

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:19.931
There’s like a mux right here with all these
different channels of blackness.

00:45:19.931 --> 00:45:26.460
And I think, what I hope will happen and what
I sort of see happening, though I’m in a

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:30.090
little bit of a bubble myself, is that in
part because of tech and part because we can

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:32.759
put out new images of what black is.

00:45:32.759 --> 00:45:38.789
We’re gonna have to just rely on the main
stream MTV commercialized vision of the archaized,

00:45:38.789 --> 00:45:39.789
sassy black woman.

00:45:39.789 --> 00:45:41.039
Like, you can be more than that.

00:45:41.039 --> 00:45:42.069
You know what I’m saying?

00:45:42.069 --> 00:45:44.840
Thugged out, I’m wearing a hoodie but I’m
clearly not very thug.

00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:46.950
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: So, cause I would never,

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:49.680
a thug would never say, “I’m clearly not
very thug.”

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.279
With that inflection.

00:45:51.279 --> 00:45:54.750
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: So as we are able to

00:45:54.750 --> 00:46:00.400
project more of our full selves out into the
world instead of compete with those images.

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.030
And demonstrate that there’s a market for
you.

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:06.589
You have Awkward Black Girl, Black Nerd Comedy,
This Week in Blackness, as examples.

00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:11.740
We can close that gap a little bit more and
have our black cards called a lot less.

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:12.740
Yeah?

00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:13.840
&gt;&gt; Female #6: Hello, thank you.

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:14.840
My name is Chastity.

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:15.840
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Hello Chastity.

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:18.869
&gt;&gt; Female #6: Um, and I onboard all of our
new employees here at Google.

00:46:18.869 --> 00:46:22.950
And your visit couldn’t be more timely because
I’m in an argument with my boyfriend.

00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:24.369
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:46:24.369 --> 00:46:25.369
Okay.

00:46:25.369 --> 00:46:26.369
&gt;&gt; Female #6: Over something like.

00:46:26.369 --> 00:46:27.369
[Laughter]

00:46:27.369 --> 00:46:28.369
&gt;&gt; Female#6: Wait, wait!

00:46:28.369 --> 00:46:29.369
Let me explain.

00:46:29.369 --> 00:46:30.369
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Please explain.

00:46:30.369 --> 00:46:31.769
&gt;&gt; Female #6: To give you background, I’m
from Portland Oregon.

00:46:31.769 --> 00:46:32.769
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Okay.

00:46:32.769 --> 00:46:33.960
&gt;&gt; Female #6: He’s from Philadelphia Pennsylvania.

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.390
&gt;&gt;Baratunde Thurston: Hold on, we got a little
racism happening right now.

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:37.390
Just a little bit.

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:38.390
&gt;&gt; Female #6: Okay.

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:39.390
[Laughter]

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:40.390
&gt;&gt;Baratunde Thurston: Just a smidgen.

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:41.390
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: I’m just--

00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:43.700
&gt;&gt; Female #6: So I’m from Portland, he’s
from Philly; we have two completely different

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:44.700
backgrounds.

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:45.700
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Yeah.

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:47.089
&gt;&gt; Female #6: But, last night, we were watching
an episode of the Chappelle’s Show, there

00:46:47.089 --> 00:46:50.750
was a segment where he brings people out and
he asked them questions.

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:52.769
I think its like, “How well do you know
black people?”

00:46:52.769 --> 00:46:53.769
It was something like that.

00:46:53.769 --> 00:46:54.769
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Yeah.

00:46:54.769 --> 00:46:59.341
&gt;&gt; Female #6: So he would ask someone, “What’s
a Lucy?” and, so, my boyfriend would turn

00:46:59.341 --> 00:47:00.341
to me and say.

00:47:00.341 --> 00:47:02.980
“Babe, what’s a Lucy” And I’m like,
“I don’t know.”

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:06.500
And so the next question was like a character
on Good Times that I didn’t know.

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:07.500
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Yeah.

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.309
&gt;&gt; Female #6: But, “Who is that?” and
I’m like, “I don’t know.”

00:47:09.309 --> 00:47:11.220
So then he asked me one more question
&gt;&gt;Baratunde Thurston: Yeah.

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:13.859
&gt;&gt; Female #6: And I yelled at him, I was like,
“I Don’t Know!”

00:47:13.859 --> 00:47:16.190
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Female #6: And so we got into this argument,

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:21.059
and he says that it’s not his fault that
I’m insecure about my blackness.

00:47:21.059 --> 00:47:22.210
Or lack thereof.

00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:25.890
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Female #6: So, what I need from you, this

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:26.969
isn’t a question it’s more of a request.

00:47:26.969 --> 00:47:27.969
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Yeah.

00:47:27.969 --> 00:47:34.040
&gt;&gt; Female #6: I need something that I can
say to counter him when I see him today.

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:36.629
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Female #6: I need your help.

00:47:36.629 --> 00:47:37.629
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Yeah.

00:47:37.629 --> 00:47:40.700
&gt;&gt; Female #6: It’d be better if you could
just tweet him and play him in front of all

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:41.710
of the world, but if not.

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:42.710
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: What?

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:43.710
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Wow!

00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:48.050
You are really, you are asking me, first of
all, I think this is a fascinating moment.

00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:50.680
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Baratunde Thurston: And I kinda gotta respect

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:56.789
your gusto and your boldness because I don’t
know your boyfriend and I don’t know his

00:47:56.789 --> 00:47:57.789
side of your story.

00:47:57.789 --> 00:47:58.789
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Female #6: Oh!

00:47:58.789 --> 00:48:01.299
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: And you’re asking
me to violate potential bro code here.

00:48:01.299 --> 00:48:03.700
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Which I just, like,

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:04.700
he’s from Philly.

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:05.700
Like, I have mad love for Philly.

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:09.710
I’m from the east coast so I’m not tryin
to do all that.

00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:10.710
Without.

00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:12.690
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: But I will share though,

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:15.599
there is, you’ve reminded me of a funny
story from the book.

00:48:15.599 --> 00:48:20.160
From Jacquetta, again she’s the eastern
shore Maryland native, and she’s like, “I

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:23.690
don’t understand black folks from Chicago
and LA, like I don’t know what they’re

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:25.420
saying when they talk.”

00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:28.190
Because it’s just a different language,
it’s a different community.

00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:32.299
She’s like, “We need some kind of translation,
some kind of app, to help one type of black

00:48:32.299 --> 00:48:34.420
person talk to another type.”

00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:38.790
So if the book does well enough, I’ll be
proud to announce the Negretta Stone App.

00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:40.890
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Which would allow,

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:42.180
like, inter black communication.

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:44.089
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: And maybe you and your

00:48:44.089 --> 00:48:45.089
boyfriend can,

00:48:45.089 --> 00:48:46.089
&gt;&gt; Female #6: Yeah, I think that’s what
I need.

00:48:46.089 --> 00:48:47.089
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: like Beta test it.

00:48:47.089 --> 00:48:48.099
&gt;&gt; Female #6: So just let me know, when it
comes out.

00:48:48.099 --> 00:48:51.099
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Yeah, Cause I just,
I hope your relationship can withstand this.

00:48:51.099 --> 00:48:52.109
&gt;&gt; Female #6: We’ll see.

00:48:52.109 --> 00:48:53.109
I don’t know.

00:48:53.109 --> 00:48:54.109
[Laughter]

00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:55.299
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Wow, I mean there are
other, there are good things in this relationship,

00:48:55.299 --> 00:48:56.910
too, or is this the only thing you do?

00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:57.910
&gt;&gt; Female #6: Good things.

00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:58.910
There are good things.

00:48:58.910 --> 00:48:59.910
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: You actually like him?

00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:00.910
Like he smells good?

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:01.910
Like all this kind of stuff?

00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:02.910
&gt;&gt; Female #6: Thank you.

00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:03.910
[Laughter]

00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:04.910
&gt;&gt;Female #6: Yes.

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:05.910
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: My goodness Chastity.

00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:06.910
&gt;&gt; Female #6: Thank you.

00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:07.910
Just pokin a little fun.

00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:08.910
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Thank you.

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:09.910
Tell him to take it easy on you, though.

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:10.910
Tell him to take it easy.

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:11.910
Best as I can see, you’re black.

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:12.910
[Laughter]

00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:16.660
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: And I’m kind of an
authority cause I’ve been black for over

00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:17.740
30 years.

00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:20.980
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: How we doin?

00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:22.059
Anybody else?

00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:23.140
Going once.

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:25.859
Any remo- are the remote people allowed to
talk?

00:49:25.859 --> 00:49:26.970
&gt;&gt; Audience member: Yes.

00:49:26.970 --> 00:49:30.560
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Anybody on the Google
hangout?

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:35.040
[Pause]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: If you’re talking

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.131
we cannot hear you, just so you know.

00:49:36.131 --> 00:49:37.131
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: Ping Camille.

00:49:37.131 --> 00:49:38.131
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Ping Camille.

00:49:38.131 --> 00:49:39.131
What did I, no what does that mean?

00:49:39.131 --> 00:49:40.131
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: I just yelled out words.

00:49:40.131 --> 00:49:41.131
[Laughter]

00:49:41.131 --> 00:49:42.349
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: I could have launched
something.

00:49:42.349 --> 00:49:46.220
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: What did you do?

00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:51.230
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: It’s like Ender’s

00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:53.400
Game or something up in here.

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:55.680
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: I just wiped out a

00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:56.680
race.

00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:58.809
Or some secret Google hack.

00:49:58.809 --> 00:49:59.809
[Laughter]

00:49:59.809 --> 00:50:02.589
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: Austin has a question.

00:50:02.589 --> 00:50:05.700
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Okay, you can relay
them.

00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:06.960
Go ahead.

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:10.089
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Baratunde Thurston: I’m Sorry.

00:50:10.089 --> 00:50:11.089
[Pause]

00:50:11.089 --> 00:50:15.109
&gt;&gt; Male #7: Can you hear us now?

00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:16.989
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Yes!

00:50:16.989 --> 00:50:19.499
&gt;&gt; Male #7: Oh hooray!

00:50:19.499 --> 00:50:24.749
One question, it’s a little off topic but
I saw that you were an editor for The Onion

00:50:24.749 --> 00:50:28.640
and I just wanted to get your experience what
that was like working with that group.

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:32.119
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Yes, I am at The Onion,
I still am at The Onion.

00:50:32.119 --> 00:50:34.440
Thanks for firing me with your use of tense.

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:37.359
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: What was it like to

00:50:37.359 --> 00:50:39.230
have that job that you used to have?

00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:41.279
That you don’t know that you don’t have
anymore?

00:50:41.279 --> 00:50:43.420
By the way, I have your job.

00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:45.589
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: No, I’ve been with

00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:50.430
The Onion since, we can maybe move him VC
people, he’s like coughing or dying or something.

00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:51.609
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: And I just need him

00:50:51.609 --> 00:50:53.839
to die quietly so I can answer his question.

00:50:53.839 --> 00:50:55.450
Maybe his kids can hear it.

00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:58.400
I’ve been with The Onion since the fall
of 2007.

00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:03.710
I was hired on as Politics editor initially
to help plot and plan and coordinate our election

00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:04.710
coverage.

00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:09.509
Also as web editor to help bring us into the
future digitally even more than we already

00:51:09.509 --> 00:51:10.509
were.

00:51:10.509 --> 00:51:11.509
My title now is Director of Digital.

00:51:11.509 --> 00:51:14.849
I made up that title because it sounded better.

00:51:14.849 --> 00:51:18.740
And it has D-O-D, which sounds pretty bad
ass and I like bad ass job titles.

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:19.980
So it’s been amazing.

00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:22.309
I mean, I do love working there.

00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:25.109
I’ve been into comedy for a very long time.

00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:27.599
I’ve been doing stand-up for over a decade.

00:51:27.599 --> 00:51:32.910
Being at one of the premier comedy institutions
the world has to offer has been great.

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:39.210
And to be able to kind of play on this line
between journalism and comedy and satire and

00:51:39.210 --> 00:51:40.359
all, it’s just very fun.

00:51:40.359 --> 00:51:44.720
We’re sort of in this enthrones of digital
essence and like, “What does it mean to

00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:46.930
be a content company in the inter webs?”

00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:53.420
And are able to kind of mock that, but also
participate in it in really fun ways.

00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:55.880
And they provide healthcare, which is amazing.

00:51:55.880 --> 00:52:00.809
So yeah, the healthcare isn’t amazing, it’s
okay, but the fact that I have it, is awesome

00:52:00.809 --> 00:52:01.809
in America.

00:52:01.809 --> 00:52:03.369
&gt;&gt; Female #7: We have a question from Tenecia,

00:52:03.369 --> 00:52:04.369
&gt;&gt;Baratunde Thurston: Yeah.

00:52:04.369 --> 00:52:05.769
&gt;&gt;Female #7: who is pinging from some place
here in,

00:52:05.769 --> 00:52:07.569
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Somewhere black I’m
guessing.

00:52:07.569 --> 00:52:12.769
&gt;&gt; Female #7: Can you, I’m asking you if,
uh, you’ve ever considered appearing on

00:52:12.769 --> 00:52:16.680
an episode of Awkward Black Girl or helping
them write material for the website.

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:17.680
[Laughter]

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:18.819
&gt;&gt;Baratunde Thurston: That’s funny.

00:52:18.819 --> 00:52:19.999
It reminds me of a question.

00:52:19.999 --> 00:52:23.470
I probably will answer that, but I wanna tell
this story instead.

00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:28.140
When I was doing my stand-up thing people
were like, “Yo, have you ever considered

00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:30.529
being on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno?

00:52:30.529 --> 00:52:31.930
Or maybe you should do SNL or something.”

00:52:31.930 --> 00:52:37.079
I was like, “Maybe I should have dreams
and pursue them, thank you.”

00:52:37.079 --> 00:52:43.359
So I have not, it would never occur to me
to, like, presume upon her show, Issa Rae.

00:52:43.359 --> 00:52:46.380
But I do, I’m a big fan of the show.

00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:48.930
And I’d be happy to make an appearance,
Issa.

00:52:48.930 --> 00:52:49.930
[Laughter]

00:52:49.930 --> 00:52:54.760
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: So if you want me on
your show, no pressure, but everybody on the

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:56.259
internet would watch it.

00:52:56.259 --> 00:52:57.700
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: I don’t know.

00:52:57.700 --> 00:52:58.910
You should watch the show.

00:52:58.910 --> 00:53:03.410
It’s kind of, I think it’s kind of a weird
question but I, I, I chose to answer it the

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:05.970
way that I did and now it’s part of the
permanent record.

00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:06.970
Good.

00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:08.380
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Who else?

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:09.380
Anyone else?

00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:10.380
Yes?

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:11.380
&gt;&gt;Female #8: I have a question.

00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:12.380
Good afternoon, my name is Charlay.

00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:13.490
First of all, thank you for coming.

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:14.490
I think you’re hilarious.

00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:15.490
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Thank you.

00:53:15.490 --> 00:53:17.099
&gt;&gt; Female #8: I was a little bit weary when
I saw the counter invite.

00:53:17.099 --> 00:53:19.961
I was like, “OK, this guy is gonna tell
me how to be black, I think I already know

00:53:19.961 --> 00:53:20.961
how to do that.”

00:53:20.961 --> 00:53:21.961
[Laughter]

00:53:21.961 --> 00:53:23.700
&gt;&gt;Baratunde Thurston: I don’t need nobody
tellin me how to be black!

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:26.650
&gt;&gt; Female #8: It’s been really great so
thank you.

00:53:26.650 --> 00:53:30.450
My question is, since you are apparently a
foremost expert on blackness.

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:32.609
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Female #8: I wanted to know, I wanted to

00:53:32.609 --> 00:53:36.339
know, in your opinion, what is it that makes
someone black, because like Chastity was mentioning

00:53:36.339 --> 00:53:38.769
culture varies depending on where you live.

00:53:38.769 --> 00:53:41.652
Like, if you don’t speak a certain way,
people might feel like you’re black enough.

00:53:41.652 --> 00:53:45.400
And really it’s not even skin tone anymore
because my cousin, you know, looks like a

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:46.400
white girl.

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:52.350
So I just wanted to know, is there one thing
that makes somebody black, or is it hard to

00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:53.350
define?

00:53:53.350 --> 00:53:57.050
&gt;&gt;Baratunde Thurston: Oh, what makes someone
black?

00:53:57.050 --> 00:54:01.150
Black parents help, at least one.

00:54:01.150 --> 00:54:07.480
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: I would never say that

00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:14.170
it’s some checklist of cultural markers
and knowledge cause that’s, that’s a falsely

00:54:14.170 --> 00:54:16.430
limiting thing.

00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:22.130
But I also, we also know that scientifically
speaking, there’s no such thing as race,

00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:26.690
if you wanna go to the genetic thing and try
to define it that way.

00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:29.369
It’s in between those two falsehoods.

00:54:29.369 --> 00:54:36.780
There’s a truth of blackness which is some
history, which is some phenotypical set of

00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:38.869
things, some, but not exclusively.

00:54:38.869 --> 00:54:40.440
You have very white looking black people.

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:42.519
You have very black looking white peo- no.

00:54:42.519 --> 00:54:44.589
You don’t have any black looking white people.

00:54:44.589 --> 00:54:50.819
But, um, yeah the idea, I also would be very
careful of this idea that anyone can just

00:54:50.819 --> 00:54:52.890
declare themselves to be black.

00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:58.200
I remember there was a rap group, maybe in
the early 90s, Young Black Teenagers.

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:01.299
And they’re like, “Blackness isn’t a
race, it’s a state of mind, man.”

00:55:01.299 --> 00:55:03.450
It’s like, no, it’s not.

00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:07.779
You can’t just write yourself in as a candidate
for blackness.

00:55:07.779 --> 00:55:10.731
And that’s a little, that level of flexibility
is a little dangerous.

00:55:10.731 --> 00:55:16.960
But we’re in some magical times where those
cultural markers are open to so many people.

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:20.040
When you put the popularity of entertainment
especially Hip Hop.

00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:24.890
Hip Hop’s such a global culture started
very black but has grown far beyond that.

00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:26.980
Being in rap doesn’t make you black.

00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:28.609
It makes you really into Hip Hop.

00:55:28.609 --> 00:55:31.769
But it doesn’t change your race.

00:55:31.769 --> 00:55:33.249
This book doesn’t make anyone black.

00:55:33.249 --> 00:55:36.839
It can make you look blacker, I think, by
sharing some of a black experience that you

00:55:36.839 --> 00:55:39.869
may not have heard about and having some fun
with it.

00:55:39.869 --> 00:55:44.680
So I’m gonna ramble through that answer
and say there’s no, there’s no measure

00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:47.530
of black to be in and out.

00:55:47.530 --> 00:55:49.750
You kinda know it, if you are.

00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:54.309
And if you’re not, then that’s cool too.

00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:56.720
[Pause]
&gt;&gt;Baratunde Thurston: You might be the last

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:57.720
one.

00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:59.640
Yeah, you are the last one.

00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:00.640
Congrats.

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:01.640
&gt;&gt; Female #9: I am the last one?

00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:02.640
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Make it amazing.

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:03.640
&gt;&gt;Female #9: Oh, gosh the pressure.

00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:04.640
I don’t know if it is but I’ll see.

00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:08.980
I’m Mary and, um, I was raised, I grew up
in a predominately white area.

00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:09.980
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Yeah.

00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:10.980
&gt;&gt;Female #9: There was about five black families.

00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:12.619
&gt;&gt;Baratunde Thurston: Out of how many?

00:56:12.619 --> 00:56:14.520
&gt;&gt;Female #9: Oh, I don’t know, like 30,000.

00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:15.730
You know, central coast.

00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:19.369
San Luis Obispo County, I don’t know if
you guys know where that is.

00:56:19.369 --> 00:56:20.369
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Okay.

00:56:20.369 --> 00:56:25.950
&gt;&gt; Female #9: I grew up in a beach town and
I don’t know where to swim.

00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:26.950
[Laughter]

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:29.579
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Just a moment of silence.

00:56:29.579 --> 00:56:30.670
&gt;&gt; Female #9: I try, I try, I try.

00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:33.230
But anyway, my parents always taught me to
speak to other black people.

00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:36.550
So if I see other black people, maybe it’s
because it was predominately white.

00:56:36.550 --> 00:56:37.550
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Yeah.

00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:38.550
&gt;&gt; Female #9: You speak to each other.

00:56:38.550 --> 00:56:39.770
They say “Hi.”

00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:43.740
And my white friends always find it funny
because they don’t walk around saying hi

00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:44.799
to each other.

00:56:44.799 --> 00:56:48.250
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Female #9: And I think the younger generation,

00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:52.789
cause I’m older, so who said they were the
oldest in the room?

00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:53.789
I bet I’m older.

00:56:53.789 --> 00:56:54.789
But anyway.

00:56:54.789 --> 00:56:55.789
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: She left, I think.

00:56:55.789 --> 00:56:56.789
It was nap time.

00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:57.789
I'm kidding.

00:56:57.789 --> 00:56:58.789
&gt;&gt; Female #9: She was too old.

00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:59.789
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Female #9: So the younger people don’t

00:56:59.789 --> 00:57:00.789
do it.

00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:03.210
So sometimes I’ll say hi and there like
well ya know?

00:57:03.210 --> 00:57:08.109
I was just wondering did you grow up doing
that, or were you raised to do that?

00:57:08.109 --> 00:57:09.109
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Yeah, that’s.

00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:11.579
Great question, great closing question.

00:57:11.579 --> 00:57:15.230
I did grow up acknowledging other black people,
I still acknowledge other black people.

00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:21.600
I think the folks who don’t do that, I think
it’s very regional, in my experience.

00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:28.711
When I moved from D.C. to Boston I encountered
a level of coldness in the city that I’ve

00:57:28.711 --> 00:57:29.711
never experienced.

00:57:29.711 --> 00:57:33.670
I was always told that New York was a very
rough and cold town and Boston is much more

00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:36.369
distant, you know, much more insider or outsider.

00:57:36.369 --> 00:57:37.900
And not just among black people, with all
people.

00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:39.520
People don’t say hi on the street in Boston.

00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:40.809
Like, “What do you, what do you want?

00:57:40.809 --> 00:57:43.589
“ Like, “Just a human connection.”

00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:44.589
[Laughter]

00:57:44.589 --> 00:57:45.589
&gt;&gt;Baratunde Thurston: “You came to the wrong
city!

00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:46.759
Get out!

00:57:46.759 --> 00:57:47.759
Go back south!”

00:57:47.759 --> 00:57:49.999
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Baratunde Thurston: So I, I actually write

00:57:49.999 --> 00:57:52.569
about this in “How to Be a Black Friend.”

00:57:52.569 --> 00:57:57.910
I say one of the keys on the premise of this
being, you’re a black person, who is friends,

00:57:57.910 --> 00:58:02.579
one of, if not only minority in the group
of non-black people especially white people,

00:58:02.579 --> 00:58:05.930
you have an obligation to acknowledge other
black people.

00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:08.329
Because you’re on a mission, you’re basically
an undercover agent.

00:58:08.329 --> 00:58:11.839
And you’re delivering messages, and communication,
you’re learning, you’re preventing a race

00:58:11.839 --> 00:58:16.009
war by telling your white friends not to touch
your hair or use the “N” word.

00:58:16.009 --> 00:58:21.349
But if you don’t acknowledge other black
people it raises suspicions about your commitment

00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:23.230
to the cause.

00:58:23.230 --> 00:58:28.309
So I was always to, like, at least a head
nod, just a little something.

00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:31.369
Maybe, maybe one of these, you know if you’re
really.

00:58:31.369 --> 00:58:33.329
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Baratunde Thurston: If it’s the day, like,

00:58:33.329 --> 00:58:37.089
if you’ve reached the moment when it’s
like it’s on, you got the memo.

00:58:37.089 --> 00:58:39.839
It's like, “Let’s do it!”

00:58:39.839 --> 00:58:40.839
[Laughter]

00:58:40.839 --> 00:58:41.950
&gt;&gt;Baratunde Thurston: Or maybe just a smile.

00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:44.039
I just needed the subtle eye contact.

00:58:44.039 --> 00:58:49.880
So I have not experienced much of, black people
were comfortable being black people but not

00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:51.160
acknowledging other black people.

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:54.390
I think I have seen that among some that are
like, “I’m kind of undercover here.

00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:57.430
I don’t want people to know that I know
that I’m black.”

00:58:57.430 --> 00:59:00.140
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Baratunde Thurston: So keep doing it.

00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:05.799
We’ll try to train the younger generation
to stay on message and on mission.

00:59:05.799 --> 00:59:10.180
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Baratunde Thurston: I am gonna end my talk

00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:11.180
on this.

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:13.200
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; Baratunde Thurston: Thank you Google, thank

00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:15.510
you black people, thank you all people.

00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:16.170
I’m Baratunde.
