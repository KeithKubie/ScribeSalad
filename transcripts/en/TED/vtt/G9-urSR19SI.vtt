00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:14.351
So, a few years ago,

00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:18.018
I was beginning a new unit on race
with my fourth-graders.

00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:20.226
And whenever we start a new unit,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.934
I like to begin by having all the students
list everything they know about it,

00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:26.643
and then we also list questions we have.

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:31.101
And I had the type of moment
that every teacher has nightmares about.

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:33.976
One of my students
had just asked the question,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.268
"Why are some people racist?"

00:00:36.292 --> 00:00:39.101
And another student, let's call her Abby,

00:00:39.125 --> 00:00:41.893
had just raised her hand and volunteered:

00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:46.417
"Maybe some people don't like black people
because their skin is the color of poop."

00:00:47.542 --> 00:00:48.809
Yeah, I know.

00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:53.643
So, as if on cue,
my entire class exploded.

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:55.684
Half of them immediately started laughing,

00:00:55.708 --> 00:00:57.708
and the other half started yelling at Abby

00:00:57.732 --> 00:00:58.976
and shouting things like,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.351
"Oh, my God, you can't say that,
that's racist!"

00:01:01.375 --> 00:01:04.768
So just take a second
to freeze this scene in your mind.

00:01:04.792 --> 00:01:07.059
There's a class
of nine- and ten-year-olds,

00:01:07.083 --> 00:01:08.934
and half of them are in hysterics

00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:12.851
because they think
Abby has said something wildly funny,

00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:16.476
and the other half are yelling at her
for saying something offensive.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.393
And then you have Abby,
sitting there completely bewildered

00:01:19.417 --> 00:01:22.851
because, in her mind, she doesn't
understand the weight of what she said

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:25.684
and why everybody is reacting this way.

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:27.351
And then you have me, the teacher,

00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:30.559
standing there in the corner,
like, about to have a panic attack.

00:01:30.583 --> 00:01:32.018
So as a classroom teacher,

00:01:32.042 --> 00:01:35.518
I have to make split-second
decisions all the time.

00:01:35.542 --> 00:01:37.958
And I knew I needed to react, but how?

00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:42.018
Consider your fight-or-flight instincts.

00:01:42.042 --> 00:01:47.768
I could fight by raising my voice
and reprimanding her for her words.

00:01:47.792 --> 00:01:50.393
Or flight -- just change the subject

00:01:50.417 --> 00:01:52.684
and quickly start reaching
for another subject,

00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:55.833
like anything to get my students' minds
off the word "poop."

00:01:57.042 --> 00:02:01.643
However, as we know, the right thing to do
is often not the easy thing to do.

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:04.559
And as much as I wanted
this moment to be over,

00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:08.851
and that I knew both of these options
would help me escape the situation,

00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:13.083
I knew that this was far too important
of a teachable moment to miss.

00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:17.268
So after standing there
for what felt like an eternity,

00:02:17.292 --> 00:02:22.268
I unfroze and I turned
to face my class, and I said,

00:02:22.292 --> 00:02:25.167
"Actually, Abby makes a point."

00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:29.226
And my students kind of
looked at each other, all confused.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.976
And I continued,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.351
"One reason why racism exists

00:02:33.375 --> 00:02:37.143
is because people with light skin
have looked at people with dark skin

00:02:37.167 --> 00:02:39.309
and said that their skin was ugly.

00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:44.143
And even use this reason
as an excuse to dehumanize them.

00:02:44.167 --> 00:02:47.768
And the reason why we're learning
about race and racism in the first place

00:02:47.792 --> 00:02:50.768
is to educate ourselves to know better.

00:02:50.792 --> 00:02:53.809
And to understand
why comments like this are hurtful,

00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:55.893
and to make sure
that people with dark skin

00:02:55.917 --> 00:02:59.559
are always treated
with respect and kindness."

00:02:59.583 --> 00:03:03.393
Now, this was a truly terrifying
teachable moment.

00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:05.893
But as we moved forward
in the conversation,

00:03:05.917 --> 00:03:08.226
I noticed that both Abby
and the rest of the kids

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.893
were still willing to engage.

00:03:09.917 --> 00:03:13.601
And as I watched the conversation
really marinate with my students,

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:19.351
I began to wonder how many of my students
have assumptions just like Abby.

00:03:19.375 --> 00:03:22.684
And what happens when those assumptions
go unnoticed and unaddressed,

00:03:22.708 --> 00:03:24.042
as they so often do?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.518
But first, I think it's important
to take a step back

00:03:27.542 --> 00:03:29.667
and even consider
what makes a topic taboo.

00:03:30.457 --> 00:03:32.934
I don't remember receiving
an official list of things

00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.684
you're not supposed to talk about.

00:03:34.708 --> 00:03:38.226
But I do remember hearing,
over and over, growing up:

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.559
there are two things you do not talk about
at family get-togethers.

00:03:41.583 --> 00:03:45.708
And those two things
are religion and politics.

00:03:46.667 --> 00:03:49.309
And I always thought this was very curious

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:53.809
because religion and politics
often are such huge influencing factors

00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:56.934
over so many of our
identities and beliefs.

00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.976
But what makes a topic taboo

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.708
is that feeling of discomfort that arises
when these things come up in conversation.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.518
But some people are extremely fluent
in the language of equity,

00:04:09.542 --> 00:04:12.184
while other people fear being PC-shamed

00:04:12.208 --> 00:04:15.601
or that their ignorance will show
as soon as they open their mouths.

00:04:15.625 --> 00:04:19.518
But I believe that the first step
towards holding conversations

00:04:19.542 --> 00:04:20.809
about things like equity

00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:22.976
is to begin by building a common language.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.393
And that actually starts
with destigmatizing topics

00:04:25.417 --> 00:04:27.976
that are typically deemed taboo.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.434
Now, conversations
around race, for example,

00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:33.434
have their own specific language

00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:35.768
and students need
to be fluent in this language

00:04:35.792 --> 00:04:38.684
in order to have these conversations.

00:04:38.708 --> 00:04:41.476
Now, schools are often the only place

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.809
where students can feel
free and comfortable

00:04:43.833 --> 00:04:45.893
to ask questions and make mistakes.

00:04:45.917 --> 00:04:50.809
But, unfortunately, not all students
feel that sense of security.

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:53.393
Now, I knew that day
in front of my fourth-graders

00:04:53.417 --> 00:04:57.559
that how I chose to respond
could actually have life-long implications

00:04:57.583 --> 00:05:01.851
not only for Abby, but for the rest
of the students in my class.

00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:05.476
If I had brushed her words aside,

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.768
the rest of the class could actually infer
that this type of comment is acceptable.

00:05:09.792 --> 00:05:12.434
But if I had yelled at Abby

00:05:12.458 --> 00:05:15.143
and embarrassed her
in front of all of her friends,

00:05:15.167 --> 00:05:19.351
that feeling of shame associated with one
of her first conversations on race

00:05:19.375 --> 00:05:22.833
could actually prevent her
from ever engaging on that topic again.

00:05:23.542 --> 00:05:30.684
Now, teaching kids about equity in schools
is not teaching them what to think.

00:05:30.708 --> 00:05:33.809
It is about giving them the tools
and strategies and language

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:36.684
and opportunities
to practice how to think.

00:05:36.708 --> 00:05:40.018
For example, think about
how we teach kids how to read.

00:05:40.042 --> 00:05:41.768
We don't start by giving them books.

00:05:41.792 --> 00:05:44.809
We start by breaking down words
into letters and sounds

00:05:44.833 --> 00:05:49.476
and we encourage them to practice
their fluency by reading every single day,

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.184
with a partner or with their friends.

00:05:52.208 --> 00:05:55.184
And we give them
lots of comprehension questions

00:05:55.208 --> 00:05:58.101
to make sure that they're
understanding what they're reading.

00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:00.601
And I believe that teaching
kids about equity

00:06:00.625 --> 00:06:04.309
should be approached
in the exact same way.

00:06:04.333 --> 00:06:07.851
I like to start by giving my students
a survey every year,

00:06:07.875 --> 00:06:11.309
about different issues
around equity and inclusion.

00:06:11.333 --> 00:06:13.934
And this is a sample survey
from one of my kids,

00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.726
and as you can see,
there's some humor in here.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.768
For under the question, "What is race?"

00:06:18.792 --> 00:06:21.559
she has written, "When two or more
cars, people and animals

00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:25.059
run to see who is fastest and who wins."

00:06:25.083 --> 00:06:28.768
However, if you look
at her question, "What is racism?"

00:06:28.792 --> 00:06:32.559
it says, "When somebody says or calls
someone dark-skinned a mean name."

00:06:32.583 --> 00:06:36.226
So, she's young, but she's showing
that she's beginning to understand.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.518
And when we act

00:06:37.542 --> 00:06:41.559
like our students aren't capable
of having these conversations,

00:06:41.583 --> 00:06:45.333
we actually do them such a disservice.

00:06:46.083 --> 00:06:50.268
Now, I also know
that these types of conversations

00:06:50.292 --> 00:06:53.143
can seem really, really intimidating
with our students,

00:06:53.167 --> 00:06:55.101
especially with young learners.

00:06:55.125 --> 00:06:57.809
But I have taught
first through fifth grades,

00:06:57.833 --> 00:06:59.684
and I can tell you, for example,

00:06:59.708 --> 00:07:02.309
that I'm not going to walk
into a first-grade classroom

00:07:02.333 --> 00:07:05.768
and start talking about things
like mass incarceration.

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:10.351
But even a six-year-old first-grader
can understand the difference

00:07:10.375 --> 00:07:15.809
between what is fair --
people getting what they need.

00:07:15.833 --> 00:07:19.101
We identified a lot
of these things in class together.

00:07:19.125 --> 00:07:22.309
And the difference
between fair and equal --

00:07:22.333 --> 00:07:24.559
when everybody gets the same thing,

00:07:24.583 --> 00:07:26.583
especially goody bags at birthday parties.

00:07:27.792 --> 00:07:30.809
Now, first-graders can also
understand the difference

00:07:30.833 --> 00:07:34.018
between a punishment and a consequence.

00:07:34.042 --> 00:07:36.476
And all of these things
are foundational concepts

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.351
that anyone needs to understand

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:39.768
before having a conversation

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:42.851
about mass incarceration
in the United States.

00:07:42.875 --> 00:07:45.768
Some people might think
that kindergarteners or first-graders

00:07:45.792 --> 00:07:48.434
are too young to have
conversations around racism,

00:07:48.458 --> 00:07:50.559
but also tell you that young kids

00:07:50.583 --> 00:07:52.976
understand that there are
many different components

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.309
that make up our identities

00:07:54.333 --> 00:07:56.893
and how people are similar and different,

00:07:56.917 --> 00:08:01.018
and what it means to have power
when other people don't.

00:08:01.042 --> 00:08:03.976
When we have these conversations
with students at a young age,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.351
it actually takes away
some of that taboo feeling

00:08:06.375 --> 00:08:08.542
when those topics come up at a later age.

00:08:09.833 --> 00:08:12.434
I also know that teaching
about these things in schools

00:08:12.458 --> 00:08:15.393
can feel like navigating a minefield.

00:08:15.417 --> 00:08:18.476
For example, what happens
if parents or families

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.976
aren't on board with having
these conversations in schools?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.518
But to these people, I can say:

00:08:23.542 --> 00:08:27.684
these are some examples of things
that students have said to me

00:08:27.708 --> 00:08:29.643
and brought to my attention.

00:08:29.667 --> 00:08:33.309
For example, I had a student come in
and whisper to me,

00:08:33.333 --> 00:08:36.809
"I've heard all these people
use the term LGBTQ,

00:08:36.833 --> 00:08:40.726
but I don't know what it means
and I'm too embarrassed to admit it."

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:44.851
I had a student come in over a weekend
and come up to me and say,

00:08:44.875 --> 00:08:47.433
"You know, I just watched
this movie about Australia,

00:08:47.457 --> 00:08:50.042
and it made me wonder
if they have racism there, too."

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.393
And I always want my students to be
comfortable having these conversations

00:08:55.417 --> 00:08:59.101
because when they're comfortable
talking about it and asking questions,

00:08:59.125 --> 00:09:02.434
they also build comfort in bringing in
their own lives and experiences

00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:05.226
in how they relate to these big topics.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.643
Also, some teachers might be
kind of nervous

00:09:08.667 --> 00:09:11.309
if a student brings up a topic
or asks a question

00:09:11.333 --> 00:09:13.601
and they don't know the answer to it.

00:09:13.625 --> 00:09:16.809
But if a student ever brings
something to my attention

00:09:16.833 --> 00:09:18.476
and I don't know the answer,

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.393
I will always admit it and own it

00:09:20.417 --> 00:09:23.309
because I'm not going to pretend
to be an expert in something

00:09:23.333 --> 00:09:26.518
that I don't have experience in
or I'm not an authority on.

00:09:26.542 --> 00:09:28.518
That same year, I had a student come in

00:09:28.542 --> 00:09:31.559
and ask a question
about the LGBTQ community.

00:09:31.583 --> 00:09:35.351
And I just didn't know enough
to give them an appropriate answer.

00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:37.351
So instead, I encouraged that student

00:09:37.375 --> 00:09:40.809
to reach out and ask that question
to a representative of a nonprofit

00:09:40.833 --> 00:09:44.476
who had come to speak to our class
about that very same issue.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.768
When we admit to our students
that we don't have all the answers,

00:09:47.792 --> 00:09:50.268
not only does it humanize us to them,

00:09:50.292 --> 00:09:53.059
it also shows them that adults
have a long way to go, too,

00:09:53.083 --> 00:09:55.375
when it comes to learning
about issues of equity.

00:09:56.708 --> 00:10:00.976
Now, a little while back,
I wrote a lesson about consent.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.018
And, to some people,
this was very exciting

00:10:03.042 --> 00:10:06.559
because I took this topic
that seemed very taboo and scary

00:10:06.583 --> 00:10:10.559
and I broke it down into a way
that was accessible for young learners.

00:10:10.583 --> 00:10:12.351
However, to other people,

00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:15.559
the idea of consent
is so strongly tied to sex,

00:10:15.583 --> 00:10:18.101
and sex is often considered
a taboo subject,

00:10:18.125 --> 00:10:20.601
that it made them very uncomfortable.

00:10:20.625 --> 00:10:22.726
But my students are third-graders,

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.393
so we're not talking about sex in class.

00:10:25.417 --> 00:10:27.184
Rather, I wanted them to understand

00:10:27.208 --> 00:10:29.559
that everybody has different
physical boundaries

00:10:29.583 --> 00:10:31.476
that make them feel comfortable.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.143
And the social and emotional
intelligence it takes

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:37.059
to read somebody's words
and tone and body language

00:10:37.083 --> 00:10:39.518
are skills that often need
to be explicitly taught,

00:10:39.542 --> 00:10:42.851
the same way we teach things
like reading and math.

00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:47.101
And this lesson is not reserved
for students of one single demographic.

00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:49.316
Things like questioning
and making observations

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.601
and critical thinking

00:10:50.625 --> 00:10:53.143
are things that any student
of any race or ethnicity

00:10:53.167 --> 00:10:58.292
or background or language or income
or zip code should be learning in schools.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:03.518
Also, deliberate avoidance
of these conversations

00:11:03.542 --> 00:11:05.893
speaks volumes to our students

00:11:05.917 --> 00:11:10.601
because kids notice when their teachers,
when their textbooks

00:11:10.625 --> 00:11:15.184
leave out the voices and experiences
of people like women or people of color.

00:11:15.208 --> 00:11:17.750
Silence speaks volumes.

00:11:18.625 --> 00:11:21.018
I recently asked my class of third-graders

00:11:21.042 --> 00:11:23.726
what they would say to adults
who think they're too young

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.351
to learn about issues of equity.

00:11:26.375 --> 00:11:31.309
And while this is a small sample
of my 25 students,

00:11:31.333 --> 00:11:32.601
all of them agreed

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:35.893
that not only are they capable
of having these conversations,

00:11:35.917 --> 00:11:41.559
but they view it, the right to learn it,
as a right and not as a privilege.

00:11:41.583 --> 00:11:43.893
And, in their words:

00:11:43.917 --> 00:11:46.059
"We're big enough
to know about these things

00:11:46.083 --> 00:11:48.934
because these problems
are happening where we live.

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.059
And we have the right to talk about them

00:11:51.083 --> 00:11:54.393
because it will be our life
in the future."

00:11:54.417 --> 00:11:55.684
Thank you.

00:11:55.708 --> 00:12:00.250
(Applause)
