00:00:01.999 --> 00:00:05.600
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: I'm Ben. I work in Corp Eng,
but this is Steven Levy, the author of--

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.600
[applause]

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.099
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Thank you.

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.759
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: the author of "In the Plex: How
Google Thinks, Works, and Shapes Our Lives."

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:21.030
Let me read you the biographical sketch of
Steven that appears at the end of the book.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.250
You're more handsome in person than you are
in the picture.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.510
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Oh, well thank you.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.510
[laughter]

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.510
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: It's a handsome photo.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.510
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: That's a good photographer,
there.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.840
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: It is a good photographer, but
life has been kind to you as well. So--

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.840
[laughter]

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.180
Steven Levy--. That was not insulting. That
was meant in the most complimentary terms.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.180
I feel terrible now.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.180
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: I didn't take it that way.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.180
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried:

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.260
[reads passage]
"Steven Levy has covered Google for more than

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.899
a decade. First at Newsweek, where he was
Senior Editor and Chief Technology Writer,

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:48.430
and now at Wired where he is Senior Writer.
He's also written about Apple, "Insanely Great,"

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.360
and "The Perfect Thing," and is the author
of the classic book, "Hackers: Heroes of the

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.720
Computer Revolution." He lives in New York
with his wife and son."

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.720
[ends passage]

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.039
So, I do have to add, on a personal note,
you've heard me say this before, I think.

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:05.600
But the reason I am here today, like at Google
doing my thing, is because I read this book

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.520
in the year between high school, the summer
between high school and college.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.670
And it changed my life and gave me a sense
of direction and what I wanted to be. And

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.920
so, I reread it every--. The first time I
found out I was gonna meet Steven, I brought

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.710
it with me to show him--I still have the first
edition--how much it means. He was graceful

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.990
enough to sign it. Gracious enough to sign
it. But it was--.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:37.100
That's why I'm here. Anyways, so I think the
thing for us to do is open it up to questions.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.610
Although, I guess by way of introduction,
you did a lot of interviews for this book,

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.610
right?

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.610
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Right. Yeah.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.610
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Over many years.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.810
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Lemme talk, maybe I should
talk about how I went into this book--

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:47.810
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Yeah.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.649
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: and got this. So I've been
covering Google for quite a while. The first

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:58.510
time I actually went to Google was in 1999.
I had seen the search engine, I think, probably

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:06.409
it was around the end of 1998. So, I know
I mentioned it in a story in February 1999.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:13.500
And for a while, Google had a little newsletter
they sent out about their news hits. And in

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.980
the very first one that was sent out, they
mentioned that little mention I did in Newsweek.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.650
But I realized at a certain point during 1999,
this wasn't just a cool product. This was

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.709
something that was transformative. And besides
the product being worth seeing, the company

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.980
itself was something I really should know.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.511
So I called up the head of PR at the time,
who I had known 'cause she had worked at Apple,

00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:45.930
Cindy McCaffrey, and said, "I really wanna
meet these guys." And she said, "Next time

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.150
you're out, come by." And I did that. And
it was October of 1999. I know it was October

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.599
because when I got there, and it was in the
original Googleplex on Bay Shore, everyone

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:59.599
was in costume.

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:00.599
[Ben Fried laughs]

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.160
It was almost Halloween. And Larry was dressed
as a Viking. He had a big furry vest--

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.160
[laughter]

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.580
a hat with big horns out of it. And Sergey
was dressed like a cow.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.580
[laughter]

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.370
And he had these disgusting udders coming
out of his chest.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.370
[Ben Fried laughs]

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.370
[laughter]

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.600
So the Viking and the cow took me into a room
and explained Page Rank to me. And --

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.600
[laughter]

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.530
So I knew that was something different. So
I kept covering Google and I did a cover story

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.060
and other big stories for Newsweek. And always
thought that it would be great to write a

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.659
book about Google. But I know there were a
couple books out around the IPO period and

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:35.220
they did a pretty good job.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:42.549
And I wondered, "How do I do this?" And then,
in the summer of 2007, I took a trip with

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.830
some of the APMs at Google. Do you all know
what the APM is? Yeah, yeah, you all know,

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:54.019
right. And so, there's this trip that Marissa
takes the APMs on, the international trip.

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.930
And in this case, we literally went around
the world.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:03.549
We started in San Francisco, went to Tokyo,
Beijing, Bangalore, and Tel Aviv. And for

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:12.409
16 days, I was 24/7 with these great, young
people--the young leaders of Google, the future.

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:19.370
And being immersed among them was fascinating
to me. I realized there was a dimension of

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.210
Google, which I have never seen portrayed
publicly. There's something else was going

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.290
on inside here.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.380
It was a generational thing. It was a thing
about how people who really understand the

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.889
internet make the use of it and bring it to
all of us. And it's something about the unique

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.080
ambitions and goals and struggles of this
company.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.810
So I thought, "Wouldn't it be interesting
if I could do a whole book from that inside

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:56.340
perspective and as much as possible, learn
firsthand in a deep way, what's going on here

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.530
at Google for the areas that interest me most."

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:08.050
And they're broken up in chapters. It's amazing
how closely these chapters represent the outline

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.870
that I did when I was first pitching the book.
And the people in charge of communications,

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:20.800
then Elliot Schrage, was Head of Communications,
he told me then if I agreed to let Google

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.540
check everything, give Google approval of
everything, he’d give me a badge. I didn't

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.540
get a badge.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:27.540
[Ben Fried laughs]

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:38.050
And but it went up to LSE, which is one of
many acronyms I've learned—Larry and Sergey,

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:44.810
and Eric. And they signed off on it. And I
started seriously in June 2008, just about

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:53.350
the same time I began at Wired, which I left
Newsweek that spring to go full-time at Wired.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:59.500
And I was able to talk to pretty much anyone
I wanted. That was the best part there. And

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:05.789
I could say, "Steve , here's an interesting
person. Could I talk to this person?" Or Karen

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:09.961
Wickre, who was my shepherd there, would say,
"Here's a really interesting person for you

00:06:09.961 --> 00:06:14.580
to talk to." And she would put me together
with like George Salah, who was a head of

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.960
all the facilities there.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.960
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Yeah.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.100
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: And he was the guy who Google
hired. There were a number of hires early

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.350
in Google who were the kind of people a small
start-up had no business hiring, like a facilities

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.300
guy when they had like ten people, right?

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.520
[laughter]

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.520
And he found the places there. And one of
my favorite things that he said to me was

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.419
that "Larry smells things that other people
can't smell." And he was going through and

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:46.541
they were redoing Building 43 and Larry was
very sensitive to non-organic things in there

00:06:46.541 --> 00:06:51.990
or something. But he explained to me the design
philosophy behind Google's buildings and things

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.990
like that.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.919
And of course, I really wanted to spend a
lot of time with people in Search and Ads,

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:02.759
and get an understanding of how those things
went, because to me, these are characters

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:09.130
as much as the people. The leaders are characters.
And learning about how Search works and Ads

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.460
work, you learn a lot about Google's values
and their approach and how they view the world

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.069
and how they view the internet.

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:24.720
So with that access, I was able to do this
book. Otherwise, it was a non-starter there.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.509
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: So it sounds like an unprecedented
level of access. What was kind of the most

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:31.940
surprising or interesting thing that you learned,
or unexpected?

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.090
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Well, there were a lot. You
go into it saying, "I wanna learn stuff."

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:43.340
Right? And one surprising thing was everyone
talks about the chaos at Google. And even

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:51.289
leaders evoke it. And they say, "Well, it's
a creative chaos." Or, "We thrive on disorganization,"

00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:53.360
and things like that.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:08:01.460
And indeed, one engine of that chaos or disorganization,
whatever you wanna call it, was the Montessori

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:07.069
training of Larry and Sergey. I think it was
Marissa who said to me, "You can't understand

00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:11.910
Google unless you know that Larry and Sergey
both went to Montessori." And I asked both

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.720
of them individually about that.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.349
And they -- both of them acknowledge that
had something to do with their outlook and

00:08:17.349 --> 00:08:22.830
the way they still operate in the company.
And I've noticed certainly figures out in

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:26.599
the way that they’re perapatric. They just
kind of go around the company. I think Larry

00:08:26.599 --> 00:08:32.729
is a little bit--. Now that he's the CEO,
may not have the freedom that he and Sergey

00:08:32.729 --> 00:08:36.229
had been enjoying to pretty much go anywhere
they wanted at any time.

00:08:36.229 --> 00:08:45.420
But that was part of it. But also, on the
other hand, Google has a lot of internal structures

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:50.970
to monitor people. Now, I had never heard
of OKRs [Ben Fried laughs] before I went in

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:55.870
this book. And actually, I was quite surprised
considering the degree to which it's part

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:59.300
of Google culture that it had never been written
about.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.810
Just Google "OKRs" in Google, you get very,
very little. And that's surprising because

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:09.630
you folks know it's a big deal here. And people
talk about their OKRs. And there's a whole

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:14.891
formal way you deal with OKRs and there's
a sort of informal scuttlebutt on OKRs. Right?

00:09:14.891 --> 00:09:19.700
You don't want to make your OKRs everyyear
because then you're sandbagging it, right?

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:25.310
And so, for people like us who are YouTubing
this, they're saying, "What's an OKR?"

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:29.570
That stands for Objective and Key Results.
And it's something that John Doerr actually

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:36.510
first suggested when Google was very small,
that they implement. Andy Grove originally

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:43.730
thought of the idea. But Google embraced it
like no other company. And as you know, there's

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:48.580
quarterly OKR's, and there's yearly and sometimes
division or even the whole company will have

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:49.580
an OKR.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.810
And you think about it, it's not that surprising
'cause it's measurable. And Googlers love

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:58.930
to measure things. They love data. And they
love to test and see if the data works. But

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:02.890
it was fascinating to me to see that and the
peer reviews and other things, that there's

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:08.120
all these internal structures that show that
Google is, in a sense, kind of organized.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.170
[pause]

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.890
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Should we take questions from
the audience? I don't know if people have

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:15.870
a lot of questions, if they've read the book.
I could go on asking you questions.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:16.870
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Yeah.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:17.890
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: There's a lot of people here.
I'm wondering if there's--.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.149
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Well maybe folks can come up
to the mic--

00:10:20.149 --> 00:10:23.459
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Come up to the mic if you have
a question. Does anyone have a question?

00:10:23.459 --> 00:10:24.459
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: and maybe we could talk.

00:10:24.459 --> 00:10:26.000
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Otherwise, I'll make them up.
So I advise you to come up to the mic. And

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.560
while you're thinking of coming up to the
mic, I've been asked to remind you all that

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:36.051
Steven has had an unprecedented level of access
to the company, but he's still a member of

00:10:36.051 --> 00:10:37.051
the press.

00:10:37.051 --> 00:10:38.051
[laughter]

00:10:38.051 --> 00:10:42.970
And so questions, questions that might perhaps
unwittingly reveal things we do not want revealed

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:43.970
should be--

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:44.970
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Right.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:45.970
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: considered before you ask.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:49.100
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: I do have to tell you that
it was, it was an interesting effect going

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:56.190
on there. Because as part of the ground rules
of the book, I was allowed to see stuff that

00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:04.440
members of the press could not see. There
was an overall NDA to the book itself where

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:08.850
anything I gathered during the course of my
research was understood that it was gonna

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.279
be embargoed until the book came out.

00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:18.620
And people at Google knew when the book was
coming out. So I could then watch the development

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:23.380
of certain products. The other thing that
was part of it was that if a product was not

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:27.940
going to be out by the time my book came out,
I wouldn't be able to write about it. And

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.220
there's one thing in particular--I won't even
say what it is--

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.220
[laughter]

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:37.709
That, that it could not be in my book. And
it was disappointing to me and probably even

00:11:37.709 --> 00:11:39.670
more disappointing to the people who still
haven't finished the product--

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:40.670
[laughter]

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:41.839
that that was the case.

00:11:41.839 --> 00:11:45.890
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: I wonder what that could be.

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:46.890
[laughter]

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:52.060
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: I'm not gonna give a clue.
But actually, there was a sort of a loophole

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:57.370
to that. If both sides agreed that we could
go early with it, we could. And we did that

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:03.790
with Chrome, which I knew about well in advance--the
browser. And we were able to crash a story

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.011
for Wired in a short period of time.

00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:07.011
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Right, right.

00:12:07.011 --> 00:12:09.292
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Which worked out really, really
well to everyone's benefit there.

00:12:09.292 --> 00:12:13.270
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: What was the thing that was hardest
to keep your tongue bit about, right? Of all

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:18.279
the two plus years, two and a half. '08 to
'11, that's three years really almost. What

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:22.950
was the thing that you knew was coming that
was hardest to bite your tongue about or not

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:23.950
to try to publish or tell friends about or
something?

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:25.251
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: I think just--

00:12:25.251 --> 00:12:28.600
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: You're in the job of sharing
information, not hiding it, right?

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.080
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: I think it wasn't one thing
in particular, but just the idea that there

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.770
was so much good stuff coming out from the
interviews. And I think, I guess the point

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:41.750
I wanted to make from your previous thing
was people knew that I was in some areas where

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:46.810
a reporter's not supposed to be. But sometimes
they assumed I was in other areas where--

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:47.810
[crash noise]

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:49.690
Uh-oh. Now they're finding out.

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:50.690
[laughter]

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:51.720
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Yeah, that's right.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.720
[laughter]

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.870
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: And so, what they would say
is, [beeping noises] "Oh, so you know about

00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:03.779
Chrome." They figured, "You know about Chrome,
so I guess you know about X, Y, or Z." And

00:13:03.779 --> 00:13:07.360
they'll say, "Well, lemme tell you, in the
SkunkWorks project the other day blah, blah,

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.680
blah, blah." [Ben Fried laughs.] And I'd say,
"Hmm, OK."

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.680
[laughter]

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:17.420
But I guess even more than that, because I
mentioned LSE before. There's this whole list

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.930
of acronyms. It's sort of like the government
in a sense that there's acronyms.

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:21.930
[laughter]

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:24.250
And the whole little language of Google, right?

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.230
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Oh, yeah.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:32.829
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: You say [thump noise] just
referring, "I sold 443 and went to the GPA

00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:40.300
and then checked with the OC." And everyone--.
[Ben Fried laughs.] So, the fact that I could

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:46.589
speak to Googlers in that language created
a comfort zone that pretty quickly, within

00:13:46.589 --> 00:13:51.519
an interview, we reached a level of candor
I think.

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:56.010
And I think that this was part of the plan.
It wasn't putting one over on Google. I think

00:13:56.010 --> 00:14:01.149
part of the idea of my doing this, this is,
was the sense that if Google were transparent,

00:14:01.149 --> 00:14:06.100
at least to this writer, people would learn
about it. And what they'd learn would be something

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:10.380
that might make Google less threatening as
it became a big company.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:17.580
So, it's not a question that I'm putting one
over on you folks, but sunlight accrues to

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:24.340
the benefit of Google because it's a company.
And I can say pretty confidently, people here

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:29.100
believe that they're doing the right thing,
that it's a company very much based on moral

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.100
principles.

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:35.750
And actually, there's a big, big thread in
my book about how these moral principles play

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:42.620
out and how Google tries, and sometimes struggles,
to uphold those moral principles--being a

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:50.620
big company, dealing in areas like China.
And to me it's a great drama. And I think

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:55.050
it's terrific that these still matter at Google.
And I think they do.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:56.200
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: A question.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:00.529
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Steve thanks for
coming here. Now that the book's out and people

00:15:00.529 --> 00:15:04.639
like Charlie Rose are quizzing you about it,
what's the most common, or what are the most

00:15:04.639 --> 00:15:09.269
common things that you get about, "Wow. I
did not know about that about Google," or,

00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:11.630
"Wow. I never would have guessed that about
Google."

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:16.329
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Well, people talk about a couple
things. One would be, and the book is just

00:15:16.329 --> 00:15:20.390
getting out now. Literally yesterday was the
publication day. So, people have just been

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.930
seeing it for a week. There was an article
in the New York Times that came out that sort

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:28.339
of summarized some things, but I don't think
we get the whole context of even the things

00:15:28.339 --> 00:15:31.580
that they mentioned, they seized on the China
thing.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:37.630
And really, there's new information. There's
a lot in that China section. And I was really

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:42.769
glad that I spent a lot of time on that. I
knew I wanted to do a very big internal, international

00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:48.529
component to the book. In general, reporters
I think in the United States, don't write

00:15:48.529 --> 00:15:53.360
enough about the international aspects of
the companies that they cover.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:16:00.120
Google isn't alone of having a huge percentage
of their revenues and operations overseas.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:06.959
But people in the US, 'cause we're Americans,
we don't focus on that stuff more. But I knew

00:16:06.959 --> 00:16:12.160
I wanted to write about something international
and I chose China as an interesting case in

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:20.509
point to focus on. And that turned out to
be a rich area, let's say.

00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:24.440
And I was able to tell that story. And so,
some of the things there were things that

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:30.620
might surprise people. I think also, and I'd
done some of this for Wired, just knowing

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:36.660
how Search and Ads work in a little more detail,
the level--. And Google I know has been trying

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:40.500
to address this with videos and other things
and being a little more open.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:47.759
There's probably no two words more offensive
to Google than "black box." I know those words

00:16:47.759 --> 00:16:54.709
aren't popular around here. But so, maybe
to try to decode that a little, how those

00:16:54.709 --> 00:17:00.240
things work, and try to explain it in lay
terms and add my explanations to the ones

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.580
that you folks have been doing, are sometimes
surprising.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:08.439
People don't really get for instance, the
way Ads might work. The idea that there's

00:17:08.439 --> 00:17:12.910
this auction that you bid on, but that the
high bid isn't always the winner. How good

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:17.750
the ad is actually fits into all that. And
to me, and to a lot of people, is totally

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:22.780
novel, even after all those years of--. How
old is that product now? Nine years old?

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:29.110
But it's worth explaining and getting into
because from that equation of AdWords, so

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:36.030
many things fall out. And in the space of
a book, I had time to really talk about how

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:39.799
those things all work together, where the
science in Search and the science in ads,

00:17:39.799 --> 00:17:46.980
the science of AI, and the testing and the
data from users all come together because

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:52.730
there is this holistic thing going on here
that takes big arms to grasp and lots of pages.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.830
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Thank you.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:59.420
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Hi. Thanks for
being here. My question is about what--. One

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:04.620
of the things that I love about working here
is our culture. And I'm curious what really

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:11.040
struck you about our culture and what thoughts
you might have on us keeping that culture

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:15.280
and maintaining it going forward 'cause it's
a challenge we face?

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:19.450
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Right. Well, obviously I've
addressed the culture a lot and one of the

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:24.260
things, just talking about with George about
how he set up the offices and the roots of

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:29.600
that. Actually, he even went back to Susan
Wittgiske, who said that in the original Google

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:35.140
office, which was her house, one day, some
guy came to deliver a refrigerator to her

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:36.280
and her husband.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:40.000
But Larry and Sergey just signed for it and
said, "Put it in here." They put it on the

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.710
Google side of the building.

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:42.710
[laughter]

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:44.970
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Was that the first micro kitchen?

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:45.970
[laughter]

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:51.130
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Yes. Yeah. In a word and that
was the beginning of free food at Google.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.130
So--

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.470
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Special thanks to Susan I guess.

00:18:54.470 --> 00:19:00.330
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Yeah, yeah. Well, to her credit
she went with it and I think Google's been

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.789
good to Susan. So --

00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:05.490
[laughter]

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:10.789
And vice versa. But the parts of the culture--.
It's interesting 'cause when it was a small

00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:17.460
company, of course, everyone spent time with
Larry and Sergey. And Google, to a large extent,

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.630
channels Larry and Sergey's values.

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:25.450
And as you get to a bigger company, it gets
tougher and tougher to do that. So that, the

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:32.170
question is how do you eventually do that?
I was at -- I spoke at a gathering of the

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:37.900
Geo Group. A couple times I've been asked
to talk to Google groups. And since Google's

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:43.500
talked to me so many times, I felt the least
I could do was agree to those requests there.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:47.210
And someone asked me, "Well, what's Larry
really like?" And I thought, "What a weird

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:51.860
question. You work in the company there. I'm
just a journalist going in there." But of

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:57.490
course, when you're talking about a company
of 24,000 people, how many people really see

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:01.539
and spend time with the executives there?

00:20:01.539 --> 00:20:06.200
And especially where's that moment in time
a few years ago where Larry and Sergey dismissed

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:12.669
their assistants. Is this familiar to all
you? Yeah. It's a classic story where--. And

00:20:12.669 --> 00:20:16.480
Larry explained this to me. He said, "Well
people have the ability to say yes to a meeting

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:20.400
and I didn't want that. Meetings are my least
favorite thing."

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:26.809
And they gave themselves the freedom to just
go around the company there. But of course,

00:20:26.809 --> 00:20:30.710
people had to adjust to this because some
people really wanted to talk to Larry and

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:34.610
Sergey, or see them. And I compared it to--.
People would track them. I compared it to

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:41.260
people who, like the aircraft fanatics, who
track planes in airports and mark down the

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.659
numbers of the planes flying.

00:20:43.659 --> 00:20:49.590
People took note of Larry and Sergey sightings
and figured out strategies to stalk them.

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:50.590
[laughter]

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:55.090
And I tell the story of one guy who came out
from Zurich 'cause he really wanted to hear

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:59.420
from Larry about the fate of his project,
whether Larry had an idea of it. And he came

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:05.490
from Zurich and went to a TGIF and actually
talked first, talked to Sergey who said, "You

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:08.940
have to talk to Larry." And went to Larry
in his office there and had a conversation

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:09.940
about that.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:16.410
So, channeling those is a challenge that actually,
I think, people at Google--tell me otherwise

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:21.370
if it's not true--have a pretty good sense
of how they think. Ben?

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:27.289
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: I may get more access to Larry
and Sergey than the average Googler. Although,

00:21:27.289 --> 00:21:31.510
I'm not so sure of that, but I might. But--

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:32.510
[laughter]

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:36.480
I think they're very open about that. Right?
They're singularly open about what's on their

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.150
mind and how they approach the problem. And
they don't just say what they want, but they

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.631
say why they want it and what led to that.

00:21:42.631 --> 00:21:46.240
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Right. Right. But it's like
the values of like scale and speed and ambition,

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.240
which I think are--

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.240
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Yeah.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.940
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: just core to them, I think
do get channeled throughout the company. So

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:55.110
that's interesting. Another aspect of the
culture that I found really interesting was

00:21:55.110 --> 00:22:01.230
the hiring practices. And I can't tell you
how many people I talked to who were in their

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:06.480
middle ages, who were just flabbergasted when
they applied for jobs at Google and had to

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:10.580
come up with their SAT scores, and their GPAs--

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:11.580
[laughter]

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:17.320
And actually, this is kind of interesting
because Google's very, as you know, very data-oriented.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:22.140
And I talked to Stacie Sullivan, the head
of HR. And she said really in the studies

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:29.500
that they've done, they can't really prove
the correlation between a super-high SAT score

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:35.580
and a successful Google employee. Yet that's
something that remains important from what

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:36.590
I understand there.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:41.820
I mean, I also was surprised that Larry signs
off on every single employee, which is amazing

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:47.280
to me. I mean, he explained how he did the
science of how that works, where he--. He

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:51.549
has a sort of like compressed version of the
recruitment package, the hiring package, whatever

00:22:51.549 --> 00:22:58.130
it's called. And he's able to go through it
very quickly, but his eyeballs rest on the

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:02.150
recommendation to hire every single person,
which is remarkable.

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:06.250
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: So I've had a chance
to read the book. I really enjoyed it, so

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:07.250
thank you for writing it.

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:08.250
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Are you a fast reader?

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:13.510
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: A good bit. What
didn't make it into the book, besides all

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:19.460
the confidential stuff? You chose specific
chapters and specific topics. But what else

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.300
would you have wanted to publish?

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:25.870
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Hmm. Well there was quite a
lot, really. I mean, actually one thing that

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:33.520
I spent a little time on that wound up only
a couple paragraphs on, was some of the issues

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:38.500
of Google design and interface, which I think
is really interesting.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.390
So I sort of compressed that discussion. I
really couldn't find a great place to go on

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:51.340
at length about it. But I find it fascinating
how Google has this design philosophy, which

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:59.279
in some areas gets criticism. And those were
from fairly well-publicized conflagrations

00:23:59.279 --> 00:24:05.620
where designers went off in a huff saying,
"Google's not friendly to designers."

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:11.810
But I think I got a great explanation from
Margaret Stewart, who's now at YouTube, who

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:16.470
is a designer. And she used to work with Marissa.
And Marissa once explained that in saying

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:21.870
that, "Basically, we want Google to look like
it might have been designed by a machine."

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:26.029
Because what they wanna convey is that there's
no bias in there.

00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:32.430
So core to Google is the idea that this search
engine is not being biased, that it's taking

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:38.830
the algorithms based on -- where success is
based on how they measure people are happy

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:45.539
in the searches. And the implicit message
then in design has to be well, there's no

00:24:45.539 --> 00:24:51.480
some artist with a long moustache, Dali moustache,
who's making swoops and swooshes and things

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.950
like that. But it's very clean and straightforward.

00:24:54.950 --> 00:25:03.690
So, to me it's worthy of a longer discussion,
but it just didn't make the cut. [pause]

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:08.909
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Hi. I can imagine
that you must have been winding up writing

00:25:08.909 --> 00:25:13.630
the book when the WikiLeaks memos came out
about Google and China. I know there's a few

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:16.789
that were pertinent. I'm kinda interested
in your reaction to those. Like, did it, do

00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:18.791
you feel it changed the story in any significant
way?

00:25:18.791 --> 00:25:23.200
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Well actually, it confirmed
the story in a significant way. And you're

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:30.260
right. It was just around that time. And I
was frantically trying to get hold of more

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:36.740
of those memos that dealt with Google. If
you remember, there was a couple days where

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:42.050
the Times reported on some of it, but there
was a gap between when WikiLeaks actually,

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:48.360
where then the Times produced the content
of the memos themselves.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:54.700
So, I was able to get those in. I don't even
know if there's more to come. But some of

00:25:54.700 --> 00:26:00.480
the things actually did just confirm from
the State Department's point of view what

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:06.380
they were hearing from sources, stuff that
I had already nailed down in China there.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:12.190
So fortunately, it wasn't anything contradictory
there. And also, since their stuff was sometimes

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:16.470
raw intelligence, it wasn't necessarily stuff
you could take to the bank. So, I had to be

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:20.720
careful there in what I put in there and how
I put it. [pause]

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:26.299
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: So, what are we
bad at and what are we doing wrong? And how

00:26:26.299 --> 00:26:28.059
can we do better?

00:26:28.059 --> 00:26:36.049
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: That's a great question. Well,
I think that what I found has been a problem

00:26:36.049 --> 00:26:45.600
in Google products is there's a lot of care
in thinking of products and putting them out.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:52.559
And even though there is, the philosophy is
to get things out and keep working on it,

00:26:52.559 --> 00:26:56.830
but is to deliver, to stick with products.

00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:02.930
So, you take something like Wave, which is
a really innovative product by a very innovative

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:07.830
team. And Google obviously clearly cared a
lot about it and it was the big star of the

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:16.049
IO show. But to me, this was the kind of product
that just would have difficulty finding its

00:27:16.049 --> 00:27:23.669
place just on its own. And I did an interview
at the Churchill Club with Ray Ozzie, not

00:27:23.669 --> 00:27:26.080
long after Wave was announced.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:31.640
They did that amazing demo if you remember
that if you stuck with it for an hour and

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.750
a half, you'd understand the product. And--

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:37.070
[laughter]

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:46.090
but and Ray thought it was, there was a lot
great in the product. He said the simplicity

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:50.630
is real important there and you have to work
through it. And it really was a product that

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:54.590
Notes, which Ray had designed, was a good
analog.

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:59.191
And when Notes came out, they did an incredible
amount of support. They would go into a company

00:27:59.191 --> 00:28:06.559
and work with people. And this wasn't done
with Wave. And I asked Eric about this last

00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:13.260
summer whether that might have been a case
where Google should've varied from its philosophy

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:16.270
of putting things out. If it catches on, great.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:23.309
Otherwise, failure's part of our business.
And he actually stuck to the guns. He said,

00:28:23.309 --> 00:28:29.010
"No, no. This is the way we are. That's just
Google. We'll put out something and if it

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:35.980
doesn't catch on, OK. Failure's built in.
We built our data systems so the servers can

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:41.770
fail and we put out products knowing some
are ambitious and thy're gonna fail."

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:49.429
And I actually feel that it would do Google
well to put more effort into supporting--and

00:28:49.429 --> 00:28:57.321
I know this may be a bad word--marketing products
like that.

00:28:57.321 --> 00:28:59.399
[laughter]

00:28:59.399 --> 00:29:05.850
So that's a point there. And of course, this
is gonna be interesting to see as Google gets

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:11.789
more into Social stuff, too, because I do
write about some of the missteps in Social.

00:29:11.789 --> 00:29:17.731
And I think Orchid's another case where support
could've put Google in a better position there

00:29:17.731 --> 00:29:22.370
though it was pointed out to me that to give
it the support necessary, when Google was

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:26.990
such a small company, you would've really
had to strip out a sizeable percentage from

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:30.960
other teams just to give it the engineers
it deserved, because a lot of the engineers

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:36.130
for Orchid were really concerned at that early
point of moving it from the dot net code base

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:38.140
to what Google normally runs on.

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:44.130
So, but that's one that I can identify. [pause]

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:49.100
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: So, maybe while we're waiting
for another question, I had another question,

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:54.980
which is that I've talked to a lot of people
who started from outside Google and relatively

00:29:54.980 --> 00:30:00.531
recently moved in. And it's interesting to
watch their opinions of the company change

00:30:00.531 --> 00:30:02.640
after they acclimate to the culture and what
it's like to work here and learning what goes

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.580
on behind the development curtain or something
like that.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:10.240
And did you have any experiences like that
where you observed that your opinion of the

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.980
company, or the products or people changed
as a result of the proximity that you got?

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:24.130
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Well, consider that my immersion
into Google began around June 2008 and comes

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:29.050
up to now. One of the changes in Google between
then and now and the changes in Google, the

00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:34.750
perception of Google between then and now,
they're really significant. So that was an

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:35.750
interesting time.

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:40.420
But what I found is that anyone who goes to
Google, two years later,

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:41.420
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Yeah.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:47.159
&gt;&gt;Steve Levy: sees a different Google. Most
people, during Google's history, there was

00:30:47.159 --> 00:30:54.360
sort of a plateau in hiring around late 2008,
2009, so it didn't, for a little period didn't

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:59.549
grow as quickly. And this year, of course,
it's gonna grow again. But if you went to

00:30:59.549 --> 00:31:03.289
Google in 2002, two years later it was twice
the size, different company.

00:31:03.289 --> 00:31:10.540
Same with 2004, right? So no matter when you
got in there, in two years you were like bemoaning

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:16.280
how big it's gotten, right? And then of course,
the people who were there in 2002, would say,

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:23.559
"What were you talking about? Remember then."
Right? So, and I think the big shift that

00:31:23.559 --> 00:31:28.110
came with those years was really coping with
the perception of Google.

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:37.059
Then, it changed. At a certain point, people
saw the degree to which Google affected them,

00:31:37.059 --> 00:31:44.630
that Google's competitors became super energized
and focused on spreading the message about

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:49.230
the possible dangers of Google. And I think
I've done a pretty good job of doing that.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:59.270
And that also because of the belief from the
top down that you, at Google, are doing the

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:06.140
right thing, you're righteous folks, sometimes
you don't always appreciate the degree to

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:12.240
which other people are now worried about the
size and the degree of information about you.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:18.380
And I think the classic example of that is
the repercussions from the Book Search thing,

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:26.700
where even though very smart people here,
intellectually, everyone understands how people

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:31.279
are reacting to it, but there was this--just
at the core--just a disbelief. Don't they

00:32:31.279 --> 00:32:34.559
get that the great thing we're doing for civilization?

00:32:34.559 --> 00:32:42.410
How can they be objecting to this? And you
can see it in what Larry says and the Op Ed

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:43.840
that Sergey wrote for the New York Times.

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:44.840
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Right.

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:48.880
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: I remember they had a press
conference, or a press round table, just right

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:53.210
across the street actually. Right across the
street there, on the day that Sergey did that.

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:56.634
And he was saying, "We're helping people.
Why are they attacking us?"

00:32:56.634 --> 00:33:01.979
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Hi. I was just
wondering if you could compare and contrast

00:33:01.979 --> 00:33:08.620
Google with other large tech companies in
general and maybe things that Googlers might

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:13.470
not themselves be aware of, because we've
been customized to our surroundings.

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:22.590
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Well I guess the classic comparison
comes with Microsoft. So, in the 1990s, Microsoft

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:29.810
was seen as the company that ruled all, right?
And again, it was an engineering company run

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:38.690
by a very strong founder and -- that ran into
trouble because of its power.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:44.450
Now, I covered Microsoft a lot during those
days. And I think there are -- while there

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:48.110
are strong similarities in this sense as I
mentioned, there are essential differences

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:53.929
there. I think there's a philosophically--.
Bill Gates and Larry and Sergey don't just

00:33:53.929 --> 00:33:57.760
resonate to the same tuning fork, let's say.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.710
[laughter]

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:09.289
Google is more of a bottom up company that--.
Microsoft is very much--. The marching orders

00:34:09.289 --> 00:34:17.429
come from above there and indeed, when product
managers typically come from Microsoft to

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:19.570
Google, there's difficulties there.

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:28.050
As a matter of fact, in I think it was 2001.
It was the inability of product managers from

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:35.040
places like Microsoft to fit in well into
Google that led Larry and Sergey to say, "We

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:39.190
gotta get rid of product managers entirely.
Get rid of this whole level there." Which

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:43.960
didn't really take and they came back. But
for a little while, like literally every engineer

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:47.329
was reporting to Wayne Rosing, the head of
engineering.

00:34:47.329 --> 00:34:52.460
And this was a big debate that Larry felt
that people don't wanna be managed. And Bill

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:56.149
Campbell, who had just started to advise them,
said, "No, Larry. You're wrong. People do

00:34:56.149 --> 00:35:02.109
wanna be managed." And they actually called
in people, one by one. It was about 8:00 at

00:35:02.109 --> 00:35:06.220
night. A bunch of people still working there.
And they asked them, "Do you wanna be managed?

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:07.220
Do you wanna be managed?"

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.220
[laughter]

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:10.201
And people said yes, but Larry went ahead
and did it anyway.

00:35:10.201 --> 00:35:12.660
[laughter]

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:19.040
But then, but because of the Microsoft kind
of people there. Now, as it turns out, it's

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:28.390
a big company. You need managers. And everyone
understands that now. But still, Google has

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:32.190
its own kind of culture with this bottom up
thing.

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:36.869
And I think also, just basically, if you look
at just the behavior of the companies in China

00:35:36.869 --> 00:35:41.859
now, you see a difference now. I think, to
its credit, I think the ultimate outcome of

00:35:41.859 --> 00:35:49.260
the China thing was something where the morality
of what was happening there did play a role

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:58.480
in that. And I think particularly, from Sergey's
very passionate stance that he took after

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:02.861
the break-in occurred there, and it was always
part of the equation there.

00:36:02.861 --> 00:36:14.570
And I asked Steve Ballmer at a conference
a few months ago about his company's performance

00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:19.640
in China. Because quite frankly, I was a little
surprised to see--. To me, it was sort of

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:26.329
an easy shot for them to say something supportive
about what Google did instead of just saying,

00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:27.990
"Well we followed the laws of China."

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:33.400
Which is basically what he said. And he answered
me with that, he'd say, "When I went to college,

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:40.589
there was this big debate about apartheid,
about whether companies should support South

00:36:40.589 --> 00:36:49.099
Africa in hopes of changing the system from
within, or whether we should boycott." And

00:36:49.099 --> 00:36:54.599
clearly, he was taking the side of saying,
"Well, we're gonna support that."

00:36:54.599 --> 00:37:01.100
Which I thought was sort of interesting because
of this 2006 hearing in Congress, which was

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:08.480
something--you remember that? It was just
on the eve of Google's entry into China, with

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:17.100
DotSiam and the search engine that was censored.
And the hearing was led by a Congressman who

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:21.400
was the only Holocaust survivor ever to appear
in Congress.

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:27.160
And he took the people from Google, Yahoo,
Microsoft, and Cisco over the coals. Asked

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:32.210
each one--poor Elliot Schrage had to represent
Google--each one asking, "Are you ashamed?

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:37.020
Are you ashamed?" And the book invoked most
during that hearing was this book that had

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:40.980
come out about a year earlier called, "IBM
and The Holocaust."

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:46.579
And that was the analogy that people were
making there. So it seemed to me that Microsoft

00:37:46.579 --> 00:37:53.230
might want to avoid phrases like, "We're just
following the laws of the country there."

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:54.230
Because--

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:55.230
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: The Lieutenant Calley defense.

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:56.230
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: What?

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:57.230
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: The Lieutenant Calley defense,
right?

00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:58.230
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Yeah. Yeah.

00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:59.230
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: The Watergate defense, I guess
actually. I'll do it, I'll follow orders.

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:06.000
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: So I think that – I sort
of lost the thread -- the differences between,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:13.350
but I think that is different. And Google
now, it's a big company and there's this "don't

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:19.410
be evil" thing. I'm surprised we've gone this
far without having that mentioned. But and

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:23.680
it's used quite often as a bludgeon against
Google. Oh, if Google does this. You read

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:26.060
about that Google uses tax break.

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:31.470
Well, don't be evil, huh? That comes all the
time. But, and I know that Cindy McCaffrey,

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:38.260
who was the original Head of Communications,
sort of rues the day that that came out into

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:43.930
the mainstream. She said, "I knew once that
got out, they were goooing to use it against

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:49.640
us there." But surprisingly, I find that in
talking to a lot of people at Google who'd

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.940
been there a long time, they don't regret
that.

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:57.140
They said they still find it useful. People
don't go around saying it necessarily, but

00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:03.700
it is something that's built in there. So
I think in a positive sense, that's a difference.

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:08.600
That's one reason why I'm interested in the
company. That it actually tries, at least

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:14.010
to grapple with these issues. It's not always
as successful as it wants to be.

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:21.150
It doesn't always meet its standards, but
it's in the mix. And I think that's something

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:23.150
special. [pause]

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:32.849
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: So, on a slightly different note,
when David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin get ready

00:39:32.849 --> 00:39:36.700
to make the next great tech company movie--

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:37.700
[laughter]

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:41.490
who should they cast for Larry and Sergey?

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:44.560
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: That's a good one.

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:45.560
[laughter]

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:54.290
That's a good one. Actually, this point came
up before. And I don't know. Jake Gyllenhaal,

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:55.691
would he make a good Larry?

00:39:55.691 --> 00:39:57.320
[laughter]

00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.070
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: I think depending on the hair,
he could be Sergey. Little, little hair on

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:01.070
his--.

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:04.780
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Yeah, yeah. I don't know. I
guess we'd have to google that and figure

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:10.130
out--. Do the image search and figure out
all the good actors. I always thought that

00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:13.930
what I would like to do is make an opera out
of the China experience.

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:14.930
[laughter]

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:16.960
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Sergey in China?

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:23.329
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Yeah. Sergey, he went to China
early, but he never visited Beijing. They

00:40:23.329 --> 00:40:27.800
started an office there. But I picture like
Steve Ballmer and Eric Schmidt, like pitching

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.132
arias across to each other.

00:40:29.132 --> 00:40:34.771
And in the middle there's Kai-Fu Lee singing,
"I choose Google. I choose China." And it

00:40:34.771 --> 00:40:40.740
could be a great scene there. So, if Phillip
Glass is listening, [laughter] here we go.

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:49.650
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: [laughs] [pause] I really gotta
think about that. 

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:57.440
That was deep. [Steven Levy laughs.] [pause]
What's the most interesting question you've

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:00.050
been asked about the book so far? How's that
for a meta-question?

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:05.570
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Yeah. Well, I guess people
wanna know how I got in there, right?

00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:06.570
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Yeah.

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:13.329
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: That's a big question. And
whether Google was worried about what I do.

00:41:13.329 --> 00:41:17.500
And I think what happened was there was a
certain period where I was sort of under the

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:21.960
radar. I mean, even though I was just there
so much that--.

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:26.270
And another thing that was really helpful
to me was the people on that APM trip. I don't

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:33.490
know if there are any here. I saw Prim upstairs
and I saw David Henry yesterday. But there's

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:39.690
some people on that trip who are here in New
York. They were sort of like a shadow network

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:47.069
for me. They weren't necessarily prominent
in the book, though one of them, Dan Siroker

00:41:47.069 --> 00:41:52.920
actually, I wrote about after he left Google
and started to work for Obama for the campaign.

00:41:52.920 --> 00:42:05.050
And I talk about how he used Google techniques
to power change.org. And -- but they fanned

00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:10.941
out to all sorts of interesting places--Chrome
and Book Search, and Ads and other things.

00:42:10.941 --> 00:42:18.869
And I would often just run into them somewhere
and we'd have a really good conversation.

00:42:18.869 --> 00:42:21.470
I'd learn what was happening there.

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:24.340
Not that there should be repercussions to
the people who are still there. Those aren't

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:27.869
the ones who told me things. Hi, Craig.

00:42:27.869 --> 00:42:32.470
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: Hi. So thanks first
for allowing us to indulge in the guilty pleasure

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:33.470
of us asking you questions about us, but--

00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:34.470
[laughter]

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:37.820
I gotta continue on the theme. There's a little
bit of a variation on a theme from an earlier

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:41.500
question, but I think we have a lot of internal
myths about what Google is like and what we

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:46.510
think Google is like. But you actually have
seen across a broader spectrum than most of

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:47.510
us.

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:52.849
What do you think--. Are there things that
you've observed that don't really gibe with

00:42:52.849 --> 00:42:58.600
our self-image? Things that we should know
that actually are not true about Google that

00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.800
we think are true?

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:05.310
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Well, that's a good question.
We talked about some of those things. But

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:12.069
one, I think one thing that is interesting
is that--. So this is an engineering company,

00:43:12.069 --> 00:43:16.520
but there's a lot of people who aren't engineers.
So it's interesting to talk about that divide

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:23.380
there. And we're in New York. I don't know
are there people who are Ad Sales people here?

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:29.930
Anyone? There you go. I actually wanted to
write about some of those 'cause there's an

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:37.100
element--. People, journalists again, don't
write very much about those people at Google

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:41.760
and clearly, they were important. And to me,
it was fascinating at the point. There was

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:47.400
this thing called "Premium Sunset" where the
– in AdWords took over all the ads.

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:52.070
It used to be that some of the ads were paid
by impression and not per click. And that

00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:56.760
was a big transformation in the ad world in
general and the people working here. And I

00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:02.960
talked about that. But also, there's – it's
sort of a class system at Google. The engineers

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:10.030
kinda rule. And this Jeff Levick, who used
to work here, once told me a story.

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:16.490
Early on in Google's history, where they had,
there weren't too many Ad people. They went

00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:22.720
to Mountain View and they were met in some
little conference room in some budget hotel

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:28.560
in Mountain View. And Sergey came to the meeting.
And he spent the whole meeting futzing with

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:31.099
the control panel of the AV thing.

00:44:31.099 --> 00:44:32.770
[laughter]

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:36.190
Basically trying to see how that worked. Right?

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:41.980
And Jeff told me, he said--pardon the language--"That
moment I realized that they don't care a rat's

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:49.500
ass about what we do here. That it's the engineers
here." Right? But of course, they do care.

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:56.710
They realize how important it is for these
people to explain to the clients exactly what's

00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:58.230
happening there and give them support.

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:04.109
It was a different kind of relationship there.
And I actually really enjoyed spending time

00:45:04.109 --> 00:45:07.500
with them. And Tim Armstrong, actually, when
I interviewed him here promised me he would

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:11.349
take me on a sales call to General Motors.
And I was really looking forward to that.

00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:18.609
But for reasons beyond anyone's control, he
never got to take me on that sales call there.

00:45:18.609 --> 00:45:24.069
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #8: On the Book's Search
thread, it seems like we've reached the point

00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:30.370
where there's a lot of skepticism or even
hostility out there in the real world, like

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:36.099
the head of the Harvard Library, Scott Turow
or somebody from the Author's Guild. What

00:45:36.099 --> 00:45:44.110
do you think we could do to reassure the general
public that we're not trying to monetize a

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:47.380
lot of other people's IP, or in general, be
abusive?

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:54.069
Or is it just too late, that we're the Microsoft
of this decade and whatever we do must, because

00:45:54.069 --> 00:45:55.069
we're big--

00:45:55.069 --> 00:45:56.069
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Right.

00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:58.850
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #8: because we have
deep ambitions, whatever we do must be evil?

00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:06.700
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Well, that's a great question.
And I haven't done reporting post-Judge Chin's

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:14.390
decision of what Google actually is thinking
there. Clearly, people are sitting and trying

00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:16.410
to figure out the answer to that question.

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:21.430
What I would say--. And it's interesting you
mentioned the Harvard guy. Personally, I have

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:30.710
to say that as a writer and as an author,
I am excited to see all the world's books

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:37.390
in one corpus that I could search and get
that information, and know that something

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:41.990
is in a book and then maybe offering you the
chance to buy it, or if it's impossible, just--

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:47.070
knowing it's in there and giving you a chance
to find the book. And I don't mind if my book

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:51.340
is in there. And actually, I had a conversation
with the head of the Author's Guild, of which

00:46:51.340 --> 00:47:02.349
I'm a member, about that. And but, Google,
I think, underestimated the degree of hostility

00:47:02.349 --> 00:47:03.800
it would take, that it was Google doing this.

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:08.550
And like you say, the well's been poisoned
to a certain degree. I think one, there's

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:16.400
a couple things that I would just suggest.
I don't know if the people making the decision

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:23.970
care about it, but I'd say that maybe instead
of saying that these books that we've scanned

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:30.470
are gonna remain only in our index, to say
anyone can index them, that we could give

00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:31.470
access to it.

00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:39.510
Maybe if you license it. Even if you let,
would let Bing or wherever else license your

00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:43.740
stuff, maybe that wouldn't be so threatening.
Personally, I thought that the greatest, the

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:48.660
greatest, -- the best thing to do would've
been to just fight the original claim on a

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:54.460
fair use thing. I thought that could've been
something of value for all of us to get the

00:47:54.460 --> 00:48:00.550
fair use thing clarified on whether you could,
whether scanning a book was a fair use just

00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:01.550
for your index there.

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:07.680
But right now, we're sort of in a position.
Everyone's sort of kicked it to Congress and

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:13.200
we all know how efficient a system that is
in getting legislation that fits what the

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:21.780
public need is. So, I imagine it is frustrating.
But I think that in order to do, get the log

00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:27.619
jam out, Google's probably gonna have to make
some concession there and maybe by saying,

00:48:27.619 --> 00:48:33.060
let's say even in theory, and it's easy for
me to say 'cause I didn't spend millions of

00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:37.619
dollars scanning these books, but to say that's
available.

00:48:37.619 --> 00:48:41.540
Look -- most people do their searching from
Google anyway, right? So, and that would be

00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:49.400
sort of non-threatening. You spent the money
already. Right? So, talk is cheap, but mine's

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:52.720
cheap, too. Except for this, of course.

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:53.720
[laughter]

00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:57.760
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: 12.99 on Google Books, available
as of yesterday, I might add.

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.359
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Oh. Very good. [pause]

00:49:00.359 --> 00:49:03.930
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: We've gotta get the pre-ordering
thing down still for that product.

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:04.930
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Excellent.

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:08.570
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: [ ] zoom. Did you have another
question?

00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:16.260
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #9: You compared and
contrasted Google with Microsoft. I think

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:17.930
one thing that Larry and Sergey has never
said that I think Steve Jobs and Bill Gates

00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:25.730
have both said is--to paraphrase somewhat—'That's
the stupidest f-ing idea I've ever heard.'

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:30.180
You talked a little bit about comparing Microsoft
with Google. How would you compare Apple with

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:31.180
Google?

00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:36.190
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Both companies are dramatically
different. Ironically, there was a moment

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:40.829
in time when it looked like this would-- Apple
and Google were gonna be Humphrey Bogart and

00:49:40.829 --> 00:49:44.000
Claude Rains, just marching off into the mist
of a beautiful friendship.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.609
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #9: A beautiful friendship.

00:49:45.609 --> 00:49:46.609
[laughter]

00:49:46.609 --> 00:49:49.600
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Yeah. And but, that didn't
happen.

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:50.800
[laughter]

00:49:50.800 --> 00:50:00.609
And Apple is a consumer electronics company,
essentially. It's very much focused on design--the

00:50:00.609 --> 00:50:07.920
kind of design, which is an editorial statement.
And it's relentless in the kinds of things.

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:12.410
Maybe that's why they're complementary in
those kinds of things which would--.

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:19.119
Supporting the hardware, selling the hardware,
which Google has not shown strength in, traditionally.

00:50:19.119 --> 00:50:25.790
On the other hand, Google understands the
internet, I think, even better than Apple.

00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:34.380
Apple's done a pretty good job on the internet,
but--. So I think, and Google is--to the degree

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:41.770
that they're a bottom up--is a wild contrast
with a very much top down aspect of Apple.

00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:47.740
And Apple, people are pretty much frozen until
they hear what's going on from the top there.

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:52.540
And fortunately, the have a person at the
top who's worth waiting for. His opinions

00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:58.310
are pretty darn good. So, and just the feel
of the company is different. Someone, there

00:50:58.310 --> 00:51:04.700
was a question on Quora that I answered because
someone I thought it was such an apt question

00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:05.700
in that regard.

00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:09.270
Someone said, "What's the difference between
the Google campus and the Apple campus?" And

00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:16.920
both of them are lovely places, but Google
has sort of like a dorm feel to it. It's like

00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:22.250
lots of interesting stuff around that you
have to look at, but it's kind of like messy

00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:26.099
in a sense and there's all this stuff on whiteboards
when you look around you.

00:51:26.099 --> 00:51:32.020
And Apple's so clean you could eat off the
floor, right? It's almost like their stores

00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:38.150
and a product there. So, there's a whole lot
of signifiers of the difference between those

00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:39.150
two companies.

00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:44.100
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #10: Hi. Thanks for
coming to talk with us. So, the earlier success

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:48.710
of Google as with all other companies is a
mix of luck and hard work and brilliance.

00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:54.740
But I get the sense that Google's success
is due slightly less to luck than to other

00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:55.740
companies.

00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:59.809
For instance, I'm probably getting the details
wrong, but I believe Microsoft almost sold

00:51:59.809 --> 00:52:05.950
DOS to IBM and didn't become a company. Whereas
you said, a couple different examples today,

00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:13.300
Google did things very differently from getting
to hire a facilities manager. They tried to

00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:14.450
reduce the layers of management.

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:17.609
So do you think there's any truth into that
statement that Google's success is less due

00:52:17.609 --> 00:52:19.000
to luck and more to planned success?

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:26.940
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Well, I mean any great company
is a mix I think of luck and those sorts of

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:34.660
skills. I could come back with you on Google
and say what if Yahoo or Excite, decided to

00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:40.230
say yes to Larry and Sergey when they wanted
to sell the search engine to them early on?

00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:42.780
Then there would not have been a Google, quite
literally.

00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:49.460
So they got lucky that their product was too
good for the portals to want to adopt. There

00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:51.730
was one meeting I talked about where they
showed it--

00:52:51.730 --> 00:52:53.609
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Coogle. Is this the Coogle conversation?

00:52:53.609 --> 00:52:56.340
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: No, it was George Bell of Excite.

00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:57.530
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Right, right.

00:52:57.530 --> 00:53:03.030
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: They showed it to the head
of Excite, who was not an engineer at that

00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:08.750
point. They brought in adult supervision at
Excite and there's this guy who came from

00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:11.050
East Coast media background.

00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:15.520
And he took a look at the search engine and
was appalled at how good it was. He said,

00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:20.900
"I don't want people to come here and leave
right away. This is too good. We can't buy

00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:25.000
this." And he sent them home.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.000
[laughter]

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:32.500
And it really was only when it became clear
that no one was gonna give them a million

00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:38.711
dollars for their technology that they said,
"Well, we might as well start our own company

00:53:38.711 --> 00:53:41.390
then." So that was a pretty lucky thing to
happen.

00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:50.480
And clearly, it wasn't, Google didn't get
to where it is by just luck, but you need

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:53.690
some luck along the way to be a big success.

00:53:53.690 --> 00:54:02.270
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #11: So, what will
be Google's downfall? I mean, I think the

00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:07.130
popular conception, at least outside Google,
maybe inside Google, is that Social is their

00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:13.060
sort of blind spot. But maybe you can give
us your opinion on what you think the--.

00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:17.990
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: OK, so the way companies like
Google and Microsoft, that dominate in a certain

00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:23.890
category. And they don't just go all at once.
They sort of fade away when you have a big

00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:31.020
successful revenue model, like Microsoft has
with Windows and Office, and like Google has

00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:32.660
with its Ads.

00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:39.640
But the question is are they gonna successfully
get past that innovator's dilemma and be able

00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:45.140
to dominate in the next paradigm? I mean,
Google's done a pretty good job in one paradigm

00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:51.799
of moving over to mobile. It was essential
that Google have a big mobile presence because

00:54:51.799 --> 00:54:55.799
everyone knows at a certain point, maybe it's
even now. I'm not sure. I don't think so.

00:54:55.799 --> 00:54:57.230
The more searches take place--

00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:59.160
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: On a mobile device rather than
desktops.

00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:01.540
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: On a mobile device. Has that
happened yet?

00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:03.150
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: I don't know if we've crossed
over, but if not, it's coming.

00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:10.119
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It will be
here if it isn't already. So, it's not like

00:55:10.119 --> 00:55:19.930
Google has no plausible mobile strategy. We
all know it. But the Social thing is now becoming

00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:23.950
that kind of thing. I think, and we see mobilization
here.

00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:29.350
I think down the road, sometime in the next
ten years, there’s gonna be something big,

00:55:29.350 --> 00:55:33.720
which I don't know what it is. Maybe someone
at Google knows what it is. But some other

00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:38.780
big paradigm shift. It'll be the next thing,
whatever it is. And it'll need a bigger shift

00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:42.589
than the shift to mobile, or the shift to
Social.

00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:47.839
And that's really where--. That's gonna be
the test of whether Google is going to be

00:55:47.839 --> 00:55:54.400
a company that coasts on its successes and
shows good results, but like Microsoft, doesn't

00:55:54.400 --> 00:56:01.410
really have that excitement and the stock
plateaus and things like that. And I think

00:56:01.410 --> 00:56:09.059
one thing, which indicates that Google might
have a shot, is that Larry and Sergey, they're

00:56:09.059 --> 00:56:10.750
into looking ahead.

00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:15.640
They're into thinking ahead. They're looking
to the future there. So to me, some people

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:23.441
criticize Google for things like the autonomous
cars, but I don't think that's crazy. I think

00:56:23.441 --> 00:56:30.480
to me, first of all it's not really un-Googley.
These are cars with information processors

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:36.190
that rely in turn, that they gather information.
They get information from Google in order

00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:37.190
to operate.

00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:41.750
It's AI. To me, it's very much in the spirit
of other Google stuff. But it's also an interesting

00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:47.770
new area. Who knows what could come of that
in those cars gathering information about

00:56:47.770 --> 00:56:56.369
the world there? So I think that taking these
moon shots just might be the way that Google

00:56:56.369 --> 00:56:57.810
takes the next big paradigm on.

00:56:57.810 --> 00:57:01.700
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Thank you. Are we out of time
now? Is that--. So, that was a great note

00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:02.700
to end the conversation on. Thank you.

00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:03.700
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Thank you, Ben.

00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:05.940
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: That was upbeat and optimistic
and forward-looking.

00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:08.180
[laughter]
You talked about our great strengths. So,

00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:09.670
Steven, thank you so much for coming.

00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:11.470
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: Thank you. I'll be signing
books, then?

00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:12.470
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Yeah. I think we have you--.

00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:13.470
&gt;&gt;Steven Levy: I'd be happy to do that, yeah.

00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:14.470
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: signing books.

00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.471
[applause]
