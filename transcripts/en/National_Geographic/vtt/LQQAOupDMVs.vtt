Sengeh:<i> Hundred percent of
people living with amputations</i>

00:00:03.435 --> 00:00:07.406
<i> experience prosthetic
 socket discomfort.</i>

00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:10.543
<i>It's both a technology problem
and it's a science problem</i>

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.278
<i>because we don't really know</i>

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:13.979
<i> how to connect
 the body to machines.</i>

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:17.050
( applause )

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:19.285 line:0%
There are ten million people

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:21.654 line:0%
living with
amputations globally.

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:24.991
<i> They could have gotten
 those from accidents</i>

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:27.193
<i> victims of war</i>

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:28.694
<i> or diabetes.</i>

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:32.432
<i> They range from people
 who are in the US</i>

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:34.933
<i> to people who are in my
 home in Sierra Leone</i>

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:37.604
<i> to Cambodia,
 all over the world.</i>

00:00:38.404 --> 00:00:40.740
<i>But one thing is constant.</i>

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.675
Hundred percent of them

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:46.813
experience prosthetic
socket discomfort.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.382
That's a residual limb
with bones inside.

00:00:50.382 --> 00:00:52.652
That is very different
for everybody.

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:53.819
The part that connects

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:58.524
that residual limb to the
prosthetic leg is uncomfortable.

00:00:59.124 --> 00:01:01.527
And part of that is because

00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:05.965
the way we conventionally
make prosthetic sockets today

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:12.538
is through an artisanal process
for an ever changing human body

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:15.641
that is so diverse
across the population

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:17.076
and across the whole world.

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:18.978
<i> And the way prosthesis</i>

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:21.147
<i> prosthetic sockets are
 designed today</i>

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:23.682
<i>is you go to a prosthetist
 and they take your leg</i>

00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:26.252
<i>and they squeeze your leg and
ask you, "How does that feel</i>

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:28.488
<i> if I press here a little
 bit does it feel great?</i>

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:30.456
<i>What about that, what about
 your patellar tendon?</i>

00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:31.590
<i> What about this bone
 that's there</i>

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.292
<i> is there a bone in there
 I don't know?</i>

00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:36.095
<i> How did this happen?"
 You get the picture.</i>

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:37.897
It is not repeatable.

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:40.400
It is based on the experience
of the prosthetist.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.939
And the mold that is created is
based on somebody's experience.

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:49.776
<i> You create and alter
 that positive mold</i>

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:51.277
<i> you make a negative mold</i>

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.779
<i>and then you pour another
 positive mold inside</i>

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:56.582
<i>and then you modify that, and
then you make a test socket</i>

00:01:56.582 --> 00:01:58.551
and then the person goes
into the test socket

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:00.486
they give you feedback,
like telling

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:02.154
"Oh, I don't think
it's comfortable here"

00:02:02.154 --> 00:02:03.255
and then you modify it again

00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:05.558
and then you do this
over and over and again.

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:06.793
Until you or the person goes

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:09.095
"Yeah, it's fine,
I can work in this".

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:10.496
( audience laughter )

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:15.335
<i>And when you do get carbon fiber
sockets of single material</i>

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:20.306
<i>you have your residuum get
blisters and pressure sores.</i>

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:23.242
<i>If you look closely around
 the fibular head there</i>

00:02:23.242 --> 00:02:25.144
<i>you can see some blood spots.</i>

00:02:25.144 --> 00:02:28.247
It's both a technology problem
and it's a science problem

00:02:28.247 --> 00:02:31.984
because we don't really know how
to connect the body to machines.

00:02:31.984 --> 00:02:35.988
So, one of the things that I was
interested in with my boss was

00:02:35.988 --> 00:02:37.523
how do you understand
the science

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:39.559
behind designing for comfort.

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:44.196
So, on the left is a fit-socket,
which is an array of indentors

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:46.432
in which the person
inserts their residuum

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:50.503
to capture experimental data of
force, displacement and time

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:55.708
so we can use it to characterize
the model of the person's body.

00:02:55.708 --> 00:03:01.314
I decided that it was
perhaps useful to

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:05.385
link those points with a MRI,
so that we can

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:09.221
create models and we can
link the experimental data

00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:11.223
to the modeling data directly.

00:03:11.223 --> 00:03:14.194
<i>So, we have these markers
that you can see in an MRI</i>

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.963
<i>and you segment that MRI,
 so we define the bones</i>

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:20.300
<i>define the skin, define all
 the other soft tissue.</i>

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.670
<i>And then we can create in
an exact replica, so we can</i>

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.274
<i>ask questions around design of
 the interfaces we have.</i>

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:31.444
<i>And then we can build models
 that is predictive,</i>

00:03:31.444 --> 00:03:36.349
<i>and we can use these to now say
what happens inside the body.</i>

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.319
<i> How is the soft tissue
straining around the bone.</i>

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.455
<i> We can test all of these
 now and go in and say</i>

00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:46.325
"Well, we don't need to make a
single material socket anymore.

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:50.262
We can now take your body with
all those markers that we put

00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:51.997
and that model that we created

00:03:51.997 --> 00:03:54.500
that was validated and
that's predictive

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.769
create an element
all across your body

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.105
<i>with which we create the sockets</i>

00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:01.140
<i> where each color
 is a new material</i>

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.942
<i>and test this hypothesis.</i>

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:05.244
Why does this all matter?

00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:08.347
Why... why does understanding
the science of

00:04:08.347 --> 00:04:11.817
how we connect the body
to machines matter?

00:04:12.084 --> 00:04:14.253
<i> Your shoes still
 give you blisters.</i>

00:04:14.387 --> 00:04:17.489
<i> If you know somebody
 who has scoliosis</i>

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.725
<i>they hate wearing their brace.</i>

00:04:19.725 --> 00:04:25.030
<i>If you have a knee or an ankle
injury, you hate your braces.</i>

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.800
And that's because we don't know

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.236
how to connect the body
comfortably to machines.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.874
And, the science behind
designing for comfort

00:04:35.874 --> 00:04:37.776
really starts from being able to

00:04:37.776 --> 00:04:40.880
merge these experimental
and numerical data

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.751
and build predictive models,
and ask questions around

00:04:45.751 --> 00:04:50.155
how our design actually affects
the behavior of the body

00:04:50.155 --> 00:04:52.558
as we use these machines in time

00:04:52.558 --> 00:04:55.495
and across loads and
across different terrains.
