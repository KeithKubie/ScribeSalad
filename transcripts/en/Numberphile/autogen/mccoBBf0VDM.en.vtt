that's true so i think there was a kind
of shift but you know that's just

we've been doing mathematics for several

we've been doing mathematics for several
 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.099
we've been doing mathematics for several
thousand years and nobody's come up with

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109
thousand years and nobody's come up with
 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:58.990
thousand years and nobody's come up with
any contradiction so that's the good

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000
any contradiction so that's the good
 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.289
any contradiction so that's the good
evidence that it does work but that's

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299
evidence that it does work but that's
 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:03.909

really subtle thing which will crash it
 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.500
really subtle thing which will crash it
and I think that we really had to think

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510
and I think that we really had to think
 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.319
and I think that we really had to think
about this very carefully when Russell

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329
about this very carefully when Russell
 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.240
about this very carefully when Russell

girdle uses the primes very cleverly to
 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.510
girdle uses the primes very cleverly to
produce this coding so essentially every

revelation that mathematics could be
 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.610
revelation that mathematics could be
self referential how could you talk

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620
self referential how could you talk
 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.570
self referential how could you talk
about proving things in mathematics

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580
about proving things in mathematics
 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.160
about proving things in mathematics
mathematically but using this coding

there was a way to do it so for me that

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540
there was a way to do it so for me that
 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.340
there was a way to do it so for me that
was the brilliance of girdle all

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350

coded using these numbers can you give

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810
coded using these numbers can you give
 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.570

me some idea how big these numbers are

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580
me some idea how big these numbers are
 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.630
me some idea how big these numbers are
it's not like a plus size of 7 and a

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:58.640
it's not like a plus size of 7 and a
 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.540
it's not like a plus size of 7 and a
divide sign is a 13 a weekly like mega

numbers they start really small you

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400
numbers they start really small you
 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.410
numbers they start really small you
don't need to

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.420
don't need to
 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.410
don't need to
so the first logical symbol will have

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:08.420
so the first logical symbol will have
 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.700
so the first logical symbol will have
the prime to the second 1 3 5 7 and so

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710
the prime to the second 1 3 5 7 and so
 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.230
the prime to the second 1 3 5 7 and so
but the point is that when you're

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240
but the point is that when you're
 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.240
but the point is that when you're
actually taking a statement or of

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250
actually taking a statement or of
 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.160
actually taking a statement or of
mathematics and looking at its code

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:18.170
mathematics and looking at its code
 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.590

number that will be a product of all of

these Prime's the the pair of the prime
will be also indicating something about

will be also indicating something about
 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.120
will be also indicating something about
the structure of that sentence so once

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130
the structure of that sentence so once
 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.500
the structure of that sentence so once
you start multiplying all of these

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510
you start multiplying all of these
 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.960
you start multiplying all of these
Prime's together you get incredibly huge

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970
Prime's together you get incredibly huge
 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.580
Prime's together you get incredibly huge
numbers um but you're right the

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590
numbers um but you're right the
 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.640
numbers um but you're right the
ingredients are are really the first few

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650
ingredients are are really the first few
 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.129
ingredients are are really the first few
prime numbers so yeah

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:39.139
prime numbers so yeah
 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:40.570
prime numbers so yeah

and so you can write down the proof of
 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.510
and so you can write down the proof of

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160
can actually put either in as an axiom
 

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.880
can actually put either in as an axiom
and if mathematics was consistent before

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:24.890

it's still consistent goodwill

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:27.830
it's still consistent goodwill

together in the morning and he looked at

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:45.320
together in the morning and he looked at
 

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.400
together in the morning and he looked at
the science equations for general

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:48.410
the science equations for general
 

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.650
the science equations for general
relativity and he showed that there's a

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:50.660
relativity and he showed that there's a
 

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.320
relativity and he showed that there's a
solution of those equations where time

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:53.330
solution of those equations where time
 

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.710
solution of those equations where time
is circular so you get these loops

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720
is circular so you get these loops

grandfather paradox you'd be able to go

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:04.340
grandfather paradox you'd be able to go
 

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.460
grandfather paradox you'd be able to go
back and kill your grandfather but it's

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:06.470
back and kill your grandfather but it's
 

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.700

fascinating that girdle again was able

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:09.710
fascinating that girdle again was able
 

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:12.280
fascinating that girdle again was able
to prove these slightly paradoxical

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:12.290
to prove these slightly paradoxical
 

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.440
to prove these slightly paradoxical

relativity the other intriguing thing he

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:16.610
relativity the other intriguing thing he
 

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.610
relativity the other intriguing thing he
did was he took the American

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:18.620
did was he took the American
 

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.670
did was he took the American
Constitution and he discovered a logical

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680
Constitution and he discovered a logical
 

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.350
Constitution and he discovered a logical
inconsistency in that which completely

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360
inconsistency in that which completely
 

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.050
inconsistency in that which completely
invalidated any statement he would make

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:26.060
invalidated any statement he would make
 

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.360
invalidated any statement he would make
and so when he became an American

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:28.370
and so when he became an American
 

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:29.770

actually going to kill him so it's a

life truth value to it but then when I

life truth value to it but then when I
went up to university I realized that

00:13:12.579 --> 00:13:12.589
went up to university I realized that
 

00:13:12.589 --> 00:13:15.010

when I took this course on mathematical
 

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.390
when I took this course on mathematical
logic and we learned about girdle's
