ROBERT RAWSON: I do solemnly
swear--

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.690
SHIRLEY M. TILGHMAN: I do
solemnly swear--

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.200
ROBERT RAWSON: That I
will faithfully,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.740
impartially, and justly--


00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.090
SHIRLEY M. TILGHMAN: That
I will faithfully,

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.260
impartially, and justly--


00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.700 position:56%
ROBERT RAWSON: Perform the duties of
the office of President of

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.960
Princeton University--


00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.720
SHIRLEY M. TILGHMAN: Perform the
duties of the office of

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.520
President of Princeton
University--

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.420
ROBERT RAWSON: To the best
of my ability--

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.770
SHIRLEY M. TILGHMAN: To the
best of my ability--

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.800
ROBERT RAWSON: So help me God.


00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.340
SHIRLEY M. TILGHMAN:
So help me, God.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.340
[APPLAUSE]


00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.570
NANCY MALKIEL: I know the story
that she was a member of

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.540
the search committee, and one
day when she left to go to

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.800
teach, the other members of
the committee took the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.580
opportunity to talk about what
was obviously on their minds,

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.280
which is that they should invite
her to step off the

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.700
committee and be considered
as a candidate herself.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.060
VALERIE SMITH: Shirley brought a
real intellectual generosity

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.640
and openness to the position of
the presidency, and I think

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.310
we see that in the extraordinary
growth and

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.300
expansion of so many different
areas of the campus--

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.640
the arts, the study of
the environment,

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.560
African American studies.


00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.760
The list goes on and on.


00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.890
SHIRLEY M. TILGHMAN: I've often
described the role of the

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.250
president of the university
as someone who is both the

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.280
greatest fan and the
greatest critic.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.920
And I think in the case of
Princeton, one of the most

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.930
challenging things for a
president is to look at the

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.310
University without rose
covered glasses.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.500
KATHRYN HALL: You know, there's so
many things that can happen

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.680
that are unexpected in
any new presidency.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.260
And in fact, Shirley, even
before the official

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.940
installation, had to face, and
the university had to face,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.810
the tragedy of 9/11.


00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.510
But Shirley was able to approach
that tragedy in the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.190
way she that she does everything
with warmth, with

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.950
understanding, with the
capacity to lead our

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.100
university through that very,
very, very difficult and

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.830
troubling time.


00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.360
In fact, we're here today right
now talking in the 9/11

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.070
Memorial Garden where 13 alumni
who died on that day

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.590
are memorialized.


00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.740
SHIRLEY M. TILGHMAN: Today, we
gather as a community to

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:23.010
remember those who are missing
or who have been lost in the

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.230
tragic events in New York,
Washington, and Pennsylvania.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.730
We grieve most especially for
those we knew personally--

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.810
family members, friends,
and colleagues.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.800
NANCY MALKIEL: To have a faculty
member like that, so

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.030
admired and so well-known across
the campus, be selected

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.630
as president was simply
exhilarating, and to have it

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.810
be a woman for the first
time at Princeton was

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.040
just an added bonus.


00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.780
SHIRLEY M. TILGHMAN: Princeton is a
remarkable place, and it has

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.720
been so for many years.


00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.620
But it is really important that
it not fall in love with

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.900
its propaganda, or its history,
or its reputation,

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.040
but be constantly critical of
what we are doing and how we

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.750
can do it so much better.


00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.620
And that's really how I've tried
to think about my 12

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.500
years as president, to be able
to see Princeton clearly and

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.270
to see where the cracks
in the armor are.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.460
CHRISTOPHER L. EISGRUBER: When
I think about Shirley

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.670
Tilghman's legacy, I think about
what she's added to the

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.760
social capital of
our university.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.900
And some of that's been done
through the kinds of programs

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.680
that she's created in the arts
and other initiatives, but

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.070
some of it has been through
force of personality and her

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.630
leadership.


00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.790
She has this stunning
combination of charm and

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.980
engagement and genuine passion
for the mission of Princeton

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.310
University, where she's led by
example by being out there on

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.970
the campus all the time, and I
think you can feel that in the

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.350
spirit of the place.


00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.120
And when I walk around Princeton
and think about what

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.660
Shirley has done for this
university, that's what I

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.030
think about most.


00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.170
JEFF NUNOKAWA: This, as I
understand it, is more or less

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.120
the beginning of what will be
Tilghman Walk, which will

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.720
traverse the world of the arts,
the infrastructure, the

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.040
architectural infrastructure of
the arts, over to the realm

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.010
of the sciences.


00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.160
And that's, for starters, what
Shirley's all about.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.860
I should say that's one of
Shirley's, one could argue, at

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.600
the heart of her accomplishment
as president.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.530
One of the things I think
Shirley has done during her

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.750
tenure as president is draw
together all kinds of

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.380
constituencies, all kinds of
sensibilities, all kinds of

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.230
scholars, all kinds
of energies--

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.820
artistic, scientific energies
which had not been brought

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.570
together before.


00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.910
This is what Shirley does.


00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.560
It's what she knows how to do as
a person, and it's what she

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.730
knew how to do as a president.


00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.160
SHIRLEY M. TILGHMAN: I think from
really day one, the day I

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.250
walked into the office, I knew
that one of the things I was

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.590
going to promote is the growth
in neuroscience.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.520
The surprise for me was what I
discovered in the course of

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.130
walking around, were the
limitations for students who

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.360
wanted to pursue the creative
and the performing arts.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.640
Now, that was an area of the
university I really knew very

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.080
little about when I first
became president, but it

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.020
became pretty clear that we were
not serving our students

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.260
in the creative and the
performing arts to the extent

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.030
that they deserved.


00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.850
And that began a long process
of beginning to understand

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.320
what our programs were, where
we needed to grow, where we

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.840
needed to become stronger.


00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.550
And ultimately, thanks to Peter
Lewis, Princeton's great

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.980
benefactor, we were able to
create the Lewis Center for

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:24.180
the Arts and ultimately expand in
visual arts, theater, dance,

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.410
creative writing, and music
opportunities for students.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.790
So that today when you walk
around this campus, you just

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:37.430
literally cannot avoid
being part of a great

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.680
community of art.


00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:49.460 position:97%
 


00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.080
KATHRYN HALL: When the
financial crisis hit in the

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.970
fall of 2008, Princeton, like
every other institution, had

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.700
to really face some
important choices.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.920
Shirley, with her leadership,
helped Princeton navigate

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.580
through that really
difficult time.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.200
SHIRLEY M. TILGHMAN: Those
headlines in the New York

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:12.240
Times just give you the smallest
idea of the impact of

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.890
the economic recession.


00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:20.470
We have common cause, and that
is that all of us have been

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:25.730
affected by the equivalent of
an economic tsunami, the

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:31.290
perfect storm, where those
institutions with endowments

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.230
have seen a decline
in their value.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:38.930
And all of us who are in the
business of raising resources

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.400
for our institutions know that
this is a very, very difficult

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.300
time to be asking people to give
to the things that they

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.880
care most about.


00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.330
So this is indeed the
perfect storm.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.120
SHIRLEY M. TILGHMAN:
Good evening.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.340
Good evening.


00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.330
Good evening.

[APPLAUSE]


00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:16.320
SHIRLEY M. TILGHMAN: Thank you.


00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.810
Thank you.


00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:20.060
Thank you.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.800
Together, you've helped to
ensure that future generations

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.800
of Princetonians will continue
to receive the finest

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.110
education of its kind, and thus
equipped, will continue

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.460
to make our world a better
place for all.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:45.750
[APPLAUSE]


00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:46.720
SHIRLEY M. TILGHMAN: Thank you.


00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.200
Thank you.


00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:47.690
Thank you.


00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:48.170
Thank you.


00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.620
Thank you.


00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.710
CHRISTOPHER L. EISGRUBER: You
can see Shirley Tilghman's

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:56.920
legacy as you walk through the
Princeton campus with the new

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.750
buildings that have risen during
her time here and the

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.470
extraordinary programs that
reside within them.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:08.130
And I think about everything
from the residential colleges

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:12.300
to the Neuroscience Institute,
the arts project that is

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.900
arising at the edge of our
campus and that will connect

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.900
Forbes to the rest of the
campus, the beautiful Lewis

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.440
Library, and Sherrerd Hall,
for example, up by

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.610
engineering.


00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.520
SHIRLEY M. TILGHMAN: Thinking about
engineering as a problem

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:31.050
solving part of the university
rather than individual

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:35.730
disciplines has been, I think,
a big part of the change and

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.170
the growth in the engineering
school over

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:39.370
the last few years.


00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:44.550
Probably the most important
has been tackling the twin

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:51.600
issues of solving our energy
problems for the future and

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.100
protecting the environment.


00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:57.160
So the Andlinger Center, which
was made possible, again, by a

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:02.830
great benefactor to the
university, Gary Andlinger, is

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:05.640
involving all of the departments
within the

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.540
engineering school, as well as
the Woodrow Wilson School and

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.720
departments in the
natural sciences.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:16.450
The other area where we have
really focused a lot is in

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:20.680
thinking about the university
as one of the world's great

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.440
global universities.


00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:27.950
It is a pleasure for me to be
here in Shanghai to engage in

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:31.710
this conversation that was
really inspired by William

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:36.220
Fung, who was a member of the
Class of 1970 at Princeton and

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.310
currently a trustee
of the university.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:43.680
I think he described brilliantly
the rationale for

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.060
these conferences that we hope
to have in cities around the

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.450
world in the years to come.


00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:52.390
It's really intended to
spark conversation.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:55.180
Whether it's in Asia or in
Europe or in the United

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:58.260
States, Princeton is always
ranked as one of the world's

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.410
great universities, and if
that's going to continue to be

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.670
true, we have to behave like
a global university.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:07.010
We have to think of ourself as
a global university, and that

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.980
means we have to be in the
world and of the world.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:15.690
And so a lot of what we have
done by creating PIIRS

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.320
by creating the Bridge Year
program, by expanding study

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:24.910
abroad, summer global seminars,
on and on and on,

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:30.530
has been to make sure that our
faculty and our students are

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.840
going out into the world, and
that we are bringing the world

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.230
back to Princeton.


00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:38.230
JEFF NUNOKAWA: I saw her at
a meeting of the faculty

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:43.150
recently where the faculty stood
up to acknowledge her.

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:47.960
And what I think was most
impressive to me was the range

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.940
of faculty there to approbate
her, the range of faculty to

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.900
approbate her from the heart.


00:11:53.900 --> 00:12:00.160
This is a woman, a president,
a scholar, who values

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.610
scholarship of all
different kinds.

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:06.470
I just have difficulty imagining
how we could have

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:10.350
been luckier, as a university,
how we could have been luckier

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:13.500
than to have had Shirley at the
moment that we had her,

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.840
especially, I suppose.


00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.240
KATHRYN HALL: It's a
superhuman job, and I think

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.500
that we have been very lucky
to have had Shirley in that

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.180
role, and we are extremely
fortunate to have Chris

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:25.730
Eisgruber coming up as
our 20th president.

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:29.070
SHIRLEY M. TILGHMAN: Has this
been a challenging job?

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:29.860
Absolutely.


00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:33.410
It's been a very challenging
job, but it's been a job that

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:38.830
has been immensely rewarding,
and I think that is what I

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:45.160
have focused in on rather than
focusing in on the challenges

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.100
as a negative, for example.


00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.350
JEFF NUNOKAWA: There's just one
other thing I really want

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.840
to say, because it's
really important.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.050
It's important to lot of us.


00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.160
Shirley Tilghman is returning.


00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.330
She's returning to our ranks.


00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.570
She's returning to where her
heart has never left, and that

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.410
is the faculty of
this university.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:05.240
VALERIE SMITH: I think as a
university, we are very

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.100
fortunate that Shirley will
return to full time teaching

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.200
after her leave.


00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.040
Teaching is so close to her
heart and such an important

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.540
passion for her, and I think
we'll all benefit as a

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:20.640
community from being able to
have her wisdom in that role.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.400
JEFF NUNOKAWA: Shirley's
coming home.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.520
That's what I'd say.


00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.860
She's not retiring.


00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.650
She's coming home.


00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.370
SHIRLEY M. TILGHMAN: I've
loved this job.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:32.690
I've loved it from the moment
I began to, I'm sure, when I

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:35.670
step off the stage on June 30.


00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.940
It's been immensely rewarding.


00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:42.600
It's great to see progress in
real time and to be able to

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.470
see the university get better
each and every day.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:49.630
So I've just taken a lot
of pleasure from it.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:15:12.000
