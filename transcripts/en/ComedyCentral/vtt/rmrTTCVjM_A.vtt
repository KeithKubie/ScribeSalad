(clicks)

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:06.072
- Yeah lets.

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:07.240
- You guys wanna take some
questions from the crowd?

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.441 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Let's do it.
- That'd be awesome.

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:09.376 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Lets do questions
from the crowd.

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:10.310
- We have a microphone here.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.845
We have a microphone back there.

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:14.814
There's a person standing
there with the microphone

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:17.283
and if you'd like to
ask a question just go

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:18.485
- To the microphone.

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:21.321
- Line up way, way,
way, back there.

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:22.489
- Alright.

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:23.289 align:start size:84% position:16%
- That's a great
place to put the mic.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:23.957
We can't see you.

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:24.657
- Alright, okay.

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:26.159
- We cannot see.

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.327 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Are you lining up for
questions or just leaving?

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:27.861 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Move that forward
a little bit.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:28.528
- Yeah.

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:29.863
- Hi back there.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.197
Do you have a question

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.298
for the Workaholics?

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:33.933
- Yeah.

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.569 align:start size:97% position:3%
I was wondering how you guys
can keep a straight face

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:39.506
while you guys are improving

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:42.308
like throughout the show,
'cause on the drunkumentary

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:46.913 align:start size:88% position:13%
you guys said that like
80% is just improv?

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:48.848
- Uh we were drunk
when we said 80%

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:49.783
- 36,
- 36.

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:53.186
- Yeah, it's 36% improv.

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:55.755 align:start position:0%
- But you watched the
Drunkmentary and that's insane.

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:56.723 align:start size:84% position:16%
- That's really cool.
- That is cool.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:57.690
- That's cool.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.225
That is totally incoherent.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.961
The Drunkmentary was a, we
thought it'd be a great idea

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:05.765 align:start size:97% position:3%
to just get black out
drunk and do the commentary

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:07.167
for our show.

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:08.668
(audience laughs)

00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:12.038 align:start size:97% position:3%
And then by episode like three
we were like 11 beers deep.

00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:13.273
- Ma!

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:14.207
- A lot of.

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:15.075
- And it's just us just farting.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.109
- A lot of farting.

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:17.043
- [Kyle] Tons of farting.

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:17.911
- That's where that went.

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:18.711
(burps)

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:19.779
- Ew.

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:20.780
- I think we take a

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.582
- The girls liked that.

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:23.416
- Yeah.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:25.952
- Cool chicks.

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:27.220
- He bear within Anders.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.888
- Cool fans alright.

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:31.257
(audience laughs)

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:32.792
Very cool.

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:35.895
- [Tom] Are any of you
guys drunk right now?

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:38.665 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Uh, #stilldrunk.
- #stilldrunk.

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:39.599
- Okay.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.334
- Do you tweet?

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:42.836 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Tom] Okay, who else
has got a question?

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:44.637
- We keep straight faces
because we're professionals

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:45.605
to answer the question.

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:46.573
- Yeah man it's called acting.

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:47.607
- We're professional actors.

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:49.075
- That's how.
- It's acting.

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:50.710 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Look how straight faced
we can be right now.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.378
Alright, go.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:53.313
- Hey guys,

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:56.049
- [Tom] Go ahead
with your question.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.119 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I'm just wondering when's
the next wizard album?

00:01:59.119 --> 00:01:59.953
- What's that?

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:00.753
- Oh.

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:02.455
- Well.

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:03.556
- Wizards.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:05.592 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I'll let the
professor take that one.

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:07.994 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Uh we're starting to
compile some beats right now

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:10.396
so I mean stay tuned, once
we get a little bit of time

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:14.000
in the studio I think we'll
drop it as soon as we can.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.502
(laughs)

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:16.369
- In six months.

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:17.203
- Yeah.

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:18.138
- In six month.

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:19.906
- Say uh yeah, six months man.

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:22.108 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Six months to four
years, somewhere in there.

00:02:22.108 --> 00:02:23.042
- Yeah.

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:24.410
- Somewhere in between that.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.411 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You know it's like
spaghetti incident or whatever

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:26.579
Guns 'n Roses are calling it.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:27.514 align:start size:84% position:16%
- We have to get
those dudes out here,

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:28.748
and that's kind of a pain.

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:30.817
- Right, they're
in another realm.

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.152 align:start size:84% position:16%
- We have to summon
them, it's a.

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:34.154
- For those of you who
don't know we have a,

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.155
or we don't have actually.

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:36.623
- Adam!

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:39.959
- We have a portal in our home,
opened up from another realm

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.762 align:start size:88% position:13%
and four wizards who
look very similar to us,

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:43.997 align:start size:75% position:25%
coincidentally.
- Yeah.

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:45.965
- Came out of the portal
and they just happened

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:47.433
to be gangster rapping wizards.

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:48.268
- Yes.

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:49.736
- And
- yeah.

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:51.037 align:start size:97% position:3%
- They have an album on iTunes
that you could purchase,

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:52.972
Purple Magic, check it out.

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:54.507
- Yeah, it's 14 tracks for
9.99 that sounds like a deal.

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:55.775 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Whoa.
- Yeah, that's a deal.

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:56.609
- It's a hell of a deal.

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:57.610
- Whoa.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:58.878
- So I don't know.

00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:01.080
- There's a couple music
videos on Youtube too.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.315 align:start size:88% position:13%
You should check it
out 'cause you all know

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:03.249
what Youtube is now.

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:04.817
- Yeah, Pdub, Pdub, Pdub, Pdub.

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:06.486
- Nobody knows what Youtube is?

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:07.987
- [Tom] You guys have
heard of Youtube right?

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:09.189
(audience laughs)

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.657
- Yeah.

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:12.091 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Tom] Okay, who
else has a question?

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:12.926
Do you have a question?

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:14.093
- Tyedye dog.

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:15.328 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Tom] Go ahead, what's
your question sir?

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:17.597
- Where, where's Chris at?

00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:19.165 align:start position:0%
- [Tom] And why are you so
much louder than everyone else?

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:20.733 align:start size:84% position:16%
- What happened?
- Yeah what happened?

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:22.368 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I have a little
more confidence maybe.

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:23.203
- Oh nice.

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:24.037
- Oh!

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:25.438
Next question!

00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:26.806
- [Blake] Fire!

00:03:26.806 --> 00:03:28.808
- [Anders] Next question please!

00:03:28.808 --> 00:03:30.543
- You know what that means?

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:32.445
- Tuck your confidence back
in your fly and walk away.

00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:34.581
- Chris who, Delia?

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:36.749 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Are you talking
about Chris Delia sir?

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.017
- Or Criss Angel?

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:39.252
- Criss Angel?

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:40.220
He's in Vegas.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.654
Baby.

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:43.356
- Criss Angel, we
don't know him.

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:44.857
- We don't know Criss
Angel, I don't know.

00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:46.459 align:start size:84% position:16%
- We would like
for him to be here,

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.894
if was a fan or if.

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:49.862 align:start size:88% position:13%
- We can't hand with
anybody that cut though.

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:50.930
- Yeah, he's too ripped for us.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.398 align:start size:72% position:28%
- You know,
- Very ripped.

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:55.668 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Makes us feel flabby.
- A nice amount of squoosh.

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:57.904
- Alright Gilligan,
what's your question?

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.939
- Dude those that fit.

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.207
- [Blake] Oh yeah.

00:04:01.207 --> 00:04:04.978
- Okay, so Blake you
went on Loiter Squad

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:05.912 align:start size:84% position:16%
for a couple episodes,
- Yeah.

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:07.280
- [Questioner] I was wondering,

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.748
- All right yeah.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:13.319
- If you would have some
more of the Odd Future Crew

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.356 align:start size:84% position:16%
come on Workaholics
maybe for next season.

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:19.325 align:start size:94% position:6%
Do you think that you
might see that happening?

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:21.394
- I would never rule that out,

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:23.896
we had Taco on the
show very briefly

00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:26.299
in the high school
episode, but uh.

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:28.034
- We had Tyler too, but.

00:04:28.034 --> 00:04:29.168
- Yeah he was there.

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:30.103
- He got cut out.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.304
- He was in the front yard.

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:32.472 align:start size:84% position:16%
- But you totally
can't see him at all.

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:34.140 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Blake] Yeah, yeah,
- [Anders] Yup.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.508 align:start size:94% position:6%
- But yeah, no, I
wouldn't be opposed to it

00:04:35.508 --> 00:04:36.743
those guys are pretty nice.

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:38.645
They're just a little,
they're hard to wrangle.

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:39.879
- Mmmhmm.
- Yeah.

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:41.147 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Slippery.
- Yeah.

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:42.715
- Fuckers.
- Rap stars.

00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:44.684
- Is that okay with you?

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:45.952
(audience laughs)

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:47.120
- Great.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.389 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, well, maybe.
- Maybe yeah.

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:50.223
Yeah maybe.

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:51.357
- Gilligan.

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:52.759 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Is this the dumbest
panel all day?

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:53.960 align:start size:84% position:16%
It has to be right?
- Yeah.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.129 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I feel like other
people were like giving

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:00.700 align:start size:94% position:6%
like you guys information
and we're like wawa.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.168
- Tight butt hole.

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:05.538
- All of our answers are
like, I don't know, maybe,

00:05:05.538 --> 00:05:06.506
I don't know.

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:07.340
- We'll see.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.174
- Why are you asking us?

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:09.909
- Yeah we don't know.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.312

00:05:17.216 --> 00:05:18.051
- Yes.

00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:19.619
- Come on.

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:23.890

- No, no, definitely.
- So far.

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.827
- I wouldn't think, I
wouldn't feel worried.

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.128
I think you're doing, great.

00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:30.396 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I would completely
- thank you.

00:05:30.396 --> 00:05:31.531
- You too Tom.

00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:32.365
- It's like church.

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:33.199
- It's great right?

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.100
It's great right?

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.901 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Yeah.

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:36.102
(cheers and applause)

00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:36.769 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You're having a
good time here right?

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:38.237
- Yeah, yeah.

00:05:38.237 --> 00:05:39.172 align:start size:97% position:3%
- How often do you get to
hang out with the Workaholics

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:40.373
live and in person come on!

00:05:40.373 --> 00:05:41.741
- This is true.

00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:43.242
- Unbelievable.

00:05:43.242 --> 00:05:44.677
- I mean if you guys go
to like a Jack in the Box

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:45.611 align:start size:97% position:3%
you'll probably see us
eating burgers or something.

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:46.879
- Yeah.

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:48.114
- We'll probably be
at Jack in the box.

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:49.282
- You can go there
but this is unique.

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:50.316 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Young lady what's
your question?

00:05:50.316 --> 00:05:52.085
- Hi, hello.

00:05:52.085 --> 00:05:52.919
- [Tom] Hello.

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.420
- I was wondering.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.988 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Adam] You were so scared
of your own voice right there.

00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:57.323
(laughs)

00:05:57.323 --> 00:05:58.224
Hi, uh, ah.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.162
- I was wondering

00:06:03.162 --> 00:06:07.633
how your real lives compare
to your characters lives?

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:09.302
- Oh they're like
exactly the same.

00:06:09.302 --> 00:06:10.570
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.238
- It's a reality show
you didn't know that?

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:13.072
- Yeah.

00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:15.541
- It's apples and apples.

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:18.978 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I think we're pretty
similar to our characters.

00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:20.179
I'm just as stupid.

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:21.280
- Yeah.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.782
- I'm just as dumb in real life.

00:06:22.782 --> 00:06:25.752 align:start size:97% position:3%
But like if we did everything
that we did on the show

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:27.820
we would 100% be dead people.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.654
- Yeah.

00:06:28.654 --> 00:06:30.556
- Yeah.
- So.

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:32.125 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Life would have been
cut a little short.

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:33.626 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Hey kids don't do
everything you see on TV.

00:06:33.626 --> 00:06:34.560
- Yeah.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.562
- Talking to you little man.

00:06:36.562 --> 00:06:37.897
- Yeah this dude.

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:38.731
Young blood.

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:39.565
- Stay in school.

00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:40.500
- Stay in school.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.001
- [Tom] What's the question sir?

00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:44.404
- I was wondering if you
guys have ever thought

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.205
about doing a movie together,

00:06:46.205 --> 00:06:47.807 align:start size:84% position:16%
because I mean, you've
had so much success

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:48.741
with the show.

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:49.642
- [Anders] With these guys?

00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:50.810
- Yeah.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:51.844
- Fuck yes.

00:06:51.844 --> 00:06:54.080
(audience laughs)

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.748
Yeah, we're working on

00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:57.417
tightening a script right now.

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:59.318 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Yeah.
- Tighten up that doggie.

00:06:59.318 --> 00:07:01.154
- We're about ready
to get in on that.

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:04.490
- It's not a Workaholics movie.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.092
(shouts from crowd)

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:07.627
- Ah dude, I would yup.

00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:09.662
- Maybe movie number two, if
they allow us to make that.

00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:11.197
- For Crossbows and Mustaches.

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:13.332
- We could do crossbows as a
movie that would be a dream.

00:07:13.332 --> 00:07:14.834
- Yeah.

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:17.103
- It's big action comedy
starring the three of us,

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:19.439 align:start size:84% position:16%
it's not a
Workaholics movie but,

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.207 align:start size:88% position:13%
if you like Workaholics,
you're gonna like it.

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:25.077 align:start size:94% position:6%
We got cool like Seth
Rogen and Evan Goldsberg.

00:07:25.077 --> 00:07:26.345
- Yeah, yeah,

00:07:26.345 --> 00:07:28.481
- And Scott Rudin are
helping us produce it

00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:29.315
so.

00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:30.249
- Yeah.

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:31.417
- You guys see This Is The End?

00:07:31.417 --> 00:07:32.351
It was really funny.

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:33.186
- It was good right?

00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:34.654
- Super good right?

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:35.888
- Great movie, check it out.

00:07:35.888 --> 00:07:37.156
- They knocked it
out of the park.

00:07:37.156 --> 00:07:38.891
- I just really wanna be
in This Is The End two.

00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:40.092
- Yeah,
- Right,

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:41.360
- So.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.763
- Get like mutilated
somehow by an alien?

00:07:43.763 --> 00:07:47.066 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Uh, yeah, no, it'll
be just like the premier

00:07:47.066 --> 00:07:51.237
of This Is The End and the
actual Apocalypse happens.

00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:52.071
- That's cool.

00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:53.005
- That's fucking good.

00:07:53.005 --> 00:07:54.574
- Its levels, it's levels so.

00:07:54.574 --> 00:07:55.808
There's levels to this shit.

00:07:55.808 --> 00:07:56.642
- That's layered.

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:57.510
- That's like twisted.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.411
- Yeah.

00:07:58.411 --> 00:07:59.245
- Wow.

00:07:59.245 --> 00:08:00.179
Mmm.

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:02.014
- [Tom] What's your name sir?

00:08:02.014 --> 00:08:03.282
- [Alex] My name is Alex.

00:08:03.282 --> 00:08:04.650 align:start size:75% position:25%

00:08:06.252 --> 00:08:07.653
- Sick name.

00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:08.721 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Tom] You have a question
for the Workaholics?

00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:10.990
- I do, so I was going to ask,

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.994
so we obviously all
love tight butt hole.

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:16.729
- Yeah, we went over that.

00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:21.267 align:start size:97% position:3%
- But I was hoping if you
could give us a sneak phrase

00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:23.636
or sneak quote from
the next season.

00:08:23.636 --> 00:08:24.804
- Sneak something.

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:26.005
- Sneak phrase.

00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:26.939
- Awesomer.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.209
- It might be just sneak phrase.

00:08:30.209 --> 00:08:31.711
(audience laughs)

00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:33.446 align:start size:97% position:3%
It might be, hey man quit

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:34.680 align:start size:81% position:19%
- You just got it.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.249
- Trying to sneak
a phrase on me.

00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:37.750
- That's I'm feeling that.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.018
- Comedy Central let's get
those printed up on shirts.

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:40.453
- Sneak phrase.
- Sneak phrase.

00:08:40.453 --> 00:08:43.523 align:start size:97% position:3%

trying to drop a sneak phrase.

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:44.757
(audience laughs)

00:08:44.757 --> 00:08:45.858

some sneak phrases.

00:08:45.858 --> 00:08:47.026
- I like that.

00:08:48.928 --> 00:08:51.531
- Are you trying
to sneak phrase me?

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:54.267
- Are you coming at me
with a sneak phrase?

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:57.770
- Don't sneak phrase me
in front of my parents.

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:58.738
- Yeah.

00:08:58.738 --> 00:09:00.072
- My mom's here.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.975
- Sneak phrase it to me.

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:04.443

It's not even a different, it's
