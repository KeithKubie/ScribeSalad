00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.230
For this video, I’m going to show you how
to make colorful and cool looking easter eggs,

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.510
using a few packs of drink crystals you might
already have in the pantry.

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.259
All you need for this project are a few packs
of Kool-Aid and some hard boiled eggs.

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.240
Start by filling 12 containers with 1/2 cup
of water. And if you don’t have 12 glasses

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.410
handy, you could try using a large muffin
tray instead. Now go ahead and open a pack

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.950
of Kool-Aid and pour the whole thing in, making
sure all the drink crystals get dissolved.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.510
When your eggs are cooked and ready for coloring,
look closely and make sure they aren’t cracked,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.679
then carefully lower them into the colored
liquid one at a time.

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:37.760
The moment your egg is completely submerged,
set a timer for 2 minutes exactly, because

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.249
they won’t need to soak any longer than
that.

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:43.249
When the time is up, carefully pull the eggs
out of the cups, and use something like a

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:48.210
paper towel to catch any drips, then simply
leave them out to dry for about 5 minutes.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.920
If you used the same flavors I did here, you’ll
end up with a whole rainbow of different colored

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.809
easter eggs. And instead of stinking like
vinegar, your house will actually smell fruity

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.059
and irresistibly delicious.

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.679
You can see the drink crystals give an awesome
assortment of color to your eggs as long as

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.750
they’re not left in the dyes for too long,
or knocked round too much when they’re wet.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.160
Now if you don’t already have juice crystals
in your pantry, the good news is you can usually

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.240
find them, 5 for a buck, at any local grocery
store. And if you want to keep your project

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.390
to $1 or less, try using just these 5 flavors.
In my experience they’ll give you the brightest

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.800
colors and give the best variety for your
money.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.570
Alright, let’s take our egg dying to the
next level by decorating them with stickers

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.810
and stars. Soak them for 2 minutes like you
did before, but this time you’ll end up

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.590
with a whole new species of easter egg, that
are as fun and unique as your imagination.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.810
And if you decide to peel the stickers off,
you’ll see a white pattern where the stickers

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.880
used to be, making them fun and cool in a
whole different way.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.430
Now if you want to add some decoration but
don’t have any stickers handy, it’s no

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.170
problem. Try drawing on the egg with a white
crayon, or a clear birthday candle instead.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.210
When you pull the egg up out of the dye, your
artwork will magically appear, without any

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.280
extra effort.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.500
Well now you know how to use flavored drink
crystals, to color easter eggs any color of

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.590
the rainbow.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.159
By the way, the juice crystals are non-toxic
and safe to eat, so when you’re done playing

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.540
with the eggs, go ahead and have them for
a snack.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.729
Well that’s it for now. If you like this
video, perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
