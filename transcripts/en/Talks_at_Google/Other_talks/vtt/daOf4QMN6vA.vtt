00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:16.680
&gt;&gt;Joel Constable: Hello everyone. I'd like
to welcome you all to another talk in our

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:32.180
Leading@Google series. My name is Joel Constable
and I work in Leadership Development as part

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.610
of Google.edu. And I'm excited today to introduce
our newest speaker in the series, Joseph Grenny.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.620
Over the past 20 years, Joseph has taught
and advised more than 100,000 leaders on all

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.620
continents.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:52.170
He is the co-author and contributor to eight
different books, including three New York

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.450
Times bestsellers, “Influencer: The Power
to Change Anything", "Crucial Conversations:

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.650
Tools for Talking when the Stake are High”,
and “Crucial Confrontations: Tools for Resolving

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.399
Broken Promises, Violated Expectations and
Bad Behavior.” Today, Joseph will be discussing

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.410
his newest book, “Change Anything: The New
Science of Personal Success.” Pease join

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.600
me in welcoming Joseph.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.600
[applause]

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.310
&gt;&gt;Joseph Grenny: Well, let's see. [pause]
I'll use that so it'll carry me to the back.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.170
Do you hear me OK back there? OK, good. Well,
thank you. It's exciting to be here and this

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.049
is the week that the book launches. So those
of you who do product releases on a regular

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.170
basis, this is our product release and it's
exciting to be able to share some of what

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.249
we've been working on for the past few years
with you.

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:29.420
My goal is pretty ambitious. I want to accomplish
something that you may not think possible

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.959
in an hour. I'd like you to leave with a new
brain. So, my understanding is that you arrived

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:38.569
at Google 'cause you got a pretty good one
already. But I want you to leave with one

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:41.509
that is capable of something entirely new.

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.289
And in order to accomplish that, I'm gonna
need you to get a little bit more engaged

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.459
than you usually would. So, you're gonna need
two things, a writing instrument of some sort,

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:51.499
electronic, manual, whatever you got. So if
you get something handy, I'm just gonna have

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:54.179
you do a couple of very brief, very focused
little tasks.

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.489
The second thing you're gonna need is a learning
buddy. So if you look to your left, right,

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:01.109
front, and back and find a reasonably intelligent
person.

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:04.099
[laughter]

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:10.940
Buddy up. Then you'll have everything you
need for this to be an extremely useful experience

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.940
to you.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.340
[audience chatter]

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.930
Great.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.110
[audience chatter]

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.490
OK, good. So you all got a learning buddy
and a writing instrument, I think you're in

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:34.640
good shape. Let me set the context for the
topic you're to start with and then I'll get

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.290
you busy here. So first of all, let me ask
you to raise your hands if you identify with

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.780
any of these scenarios.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.530
So first of all, how many of you know more
about wellness, relationships, parenting,

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.410
financial planning, than you currently do?
How many of us fall into that category? So

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.181
we all have knowledge that exceeds our current
practice at times in some areas of our lives

00:02:57.181 --> 00:03:00.580
that affects our personal lives. But let's
talk professionally as well.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.260
How many of know more about leadership, career
management, professional effectiveness, than

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.420
we currently express in our habits as well?
So we identify with that also. So the theme

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.650
here is, that very often, understanding is
insufficient. It's what we can translate into

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.110
habits in our lives. How many of you know
other people whose primary obstacle in their

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.931
career, or life, is their own behavior?

00:03:21.931 --> 00:03:23.560
Any of us know people like that?

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.560
[laughter]

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.070
Don't point at them. [laughs] Just, I'm asking
you to think about them. Finally, how many

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.161
of us know an organization, not the present
one, but how many of us know an organization

00:03:32.161 --> 00:03:36.260
that could be significantly more successful
if people would just behave a little bit differently?

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.250
We encountered that same dynamic. So this
is the topic for today.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.240
The topic is that the greatest challenge we
face frequently is not just the learning.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.491
It's the translation of what we understand
into habits, into behavior, in our lives.

00:03:50.491 --> 00:03:56.910
The primary reasons, I contend, that individuals
fail to live up to their potential often isn't

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.770
the lack of ideas. There are a lot of ideas
out there. It's a lack of behavior.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.250
It's a lack of being able to translate that
into practice. The primary reasons organizations

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.180
often fail is not because we don't have a
great strategic direction or a good product

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.430
concept. It's the execution of it. It's developing
habits and behavior that are going to support

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.329
the leveraging of that concept. So let me
step you back for just a second.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.020
We started 25 years ago together studying
human change. About five years ago, said we

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.610
wanna look at just the individual. So we're
gonna separate you today out from your organizational

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.560
context and say, "What about just you, personally?"
And we found, as we talked with HR professionals,

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.550
for example, across the world that there are
a whole lot of Thomas's.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.529
Now this is a puzzling thing because here's
Thomas. Thomas was described as one of the

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:48.930
most loyal employees in his entire organization.
He was described by colleagues as somebody

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.960
you'd really wanna have at your left or right
in a crisis. When things get bad, this is

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.240
somebody who rolls up his sleeves and really
gets the job done.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.120
But secretly, behind his back, his colleagues
would also tell you that the guy can’t manage

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.039
to a schedule. When there's not a crisis,
you can't count on him to get something to

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:13.210
youon time or on budget or on spec. So that's
Thomas. Now, Thomas got a new supervisor and

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.300
his new supervisor decided she was going to
start coaching him in a way that nobody had

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.389
prior to this.

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:23.199
So in year one, in his performance review,
she said, "You really need to learn to manage,

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:27.930
to be a little bit more predictable." And
he was very motivated to change that. So he

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.289
started working on it, but was unsuccessful.
Year two, she said, "You really need to work

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:36.939
on this, or you'll lose your job. This is
important, Thomas. Pay attention."

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:42.490
In year three, he lost his job. So this was
an interesting scenario to us, because here

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:48.330
you've got a guy who has incredible motivation
to change. I mean, your job is at risk, right?

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.069
You really do wanna change, but doesn't change.
And that's what we've been studying for the

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:58.009
past five years. By show of hands, how many
of you believe that you have enormous control

00:05:58.009 --> 00:05:59.580
over your own behavior?

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.319
How many of us believe that that describes
us, that we have great control over our own

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:09.169
choices? My purpose today is to convince you
that you don't.

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:10.590
[laughter]

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.569
So what I want you to get, and if I'm successful,
what you'll walk out understanding is that

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:18.559
you have a heck of a lot less control over
your behavior than you think you do, and that's

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:23.909
why these Thomas stories are so frequently
the case. Now let me take you to a whole different

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:27.389
scenario. So I want you to meet Michael Vitali.

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:31.240
About four years ago, when we started the
line of research that led me to talk to you

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.940
today, we met a whole number of people--I'll
describe them in just a moment-- like Michael.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.229
I want you to listen to his story, here. Michael
had a change challenge.

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:44.270
[plays clip]
&gt;&gt;Michael Vitali: Well, my story starts back

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:54.999
when I was a very young man. I was hopelessly
addicted to drugs and alcohol. I got in serious

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:55.999
trouble, everything from legal trouble, financial
trouble. I lost everything that I owned, all

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:56.999
my personal possessions, my car, all my CDs,
everything that was important to me in terms

00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:57.999
of my material possessions--gone.

00:06:57.999 --> 00:07:01.720
Relationships. I lost a woman that I thought
I was gonna marry and she couldn't handle

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:19.599
my alcoholism. My family, I lost the love
and respect of my family and the people that

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:29.479
mattered to me. And I wound up morally, spiritually,
emotionally bankrupt.

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:31.320
[end clip]

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:38.939
&gt;&gt;Joseph Grenny: So Michael ends up in prison
in Arizona for a 12 year sentence, due in

00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:43.520
large measure to some of these habits in his
life. And so, when I listened to Michael's

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.770
story, I had to ask myself the question. This
is a 20 year story, right? This wasn't a fast

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.309
thing. Thomas's story was a three year long
saga as well.

00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:57.029
The question I put to you is, at what point
do think Michael wanted to change? At what

00:07:57.029 --> 00:08:02.770
point do you think Thomas wanted to change?
You see, the challenge here is, that all of

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:07.069
us believe that if we just want it badly enough
that we have control over our behavior. So

00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:08.210
we ought to be able to change.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:12.559
We're all caught in what we'll call later,
the "will power trap." We believe that will

00:08:12.559 --> 00:08:16.860
power is the predictor of our capacity to
change. And yet, when you look at our lives,

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:22.940
we find that many of us have problems of the
physics that you see in Thomas's and Michael's.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:28.240
What I found is there were 20 rock-bottoms
in Michael's 20 year story.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.190
There were many, many, many points along the
way that he said, "I've gotta change this.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:36.272
This hurts too bad. I've lost this. I'm gonna
change. I've lost this. I'm gonna change."

00:08:36.272 --> 00:08:41.450
But then he didn't change. The definition
of a change problem that I'd like to propose

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:45.080
is a situation where you know you ought to
change.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:50.830
In fact, you even want to change, but you
don't change. And all of us have those. All

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.610
of us have some area in our lives where we're
being kept from something that we'd really

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:59.350
like to achieve in our career, or in our relationships,
or in our personal life, because we're unable

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:02.630
to overcome that kind of a dynamic.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:06.870
And what does it cost? Well, the fact that
we can't handle this particularly well affects

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:12.440
us in our employment situations. 87 percent
of employees in one of our studies suggested

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.920
that they'd suffered economically because
of their own behavior in the workplace that

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.900
they were unable to change.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.250
Financially, we suffer. When we ask how many
people feel like you’re on track for an

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:28.990
eventual retirement, about one in five say,
"I'm where I ought to be." Relationships are

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:34.180
the same. It turns out that even those who
seek advice rarely benefit from it. I can

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.010
listen to a counselor that says, "Do this
differently and your relationships will go

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:41.810
better." But our capacity to absorb that into
our lives is fairly low.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.850
And finally, you look at health. Now, I want
you to think about this from the will power

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:51.380
perspective again. What a remarkable statistic.
Ninety percent of those who wind up in the

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:56.460
hospital for coronary bypass surgery because
habits in their lives have led them there,

00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:00.740
are back to the exact same behavior within
just a couple of years of going under the

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.780
knife.

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:08.320
Could you define or design a more motivating
opportunity for somebody than open heart surgery?

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.521
I mean, these are people leaving the surgery,
who want to change, know they should change,

00:10:13.521 --> 00:10:19.960
but don't change. So what I wanna do is challenge
our naive assumption that just wanting it

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.550
is what it takes to change. That hitting rock
bottom is the predictor of our capacity to

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.550
break out of this.

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:29.570
So about four years ago, we threw a question
out to the universe. The question was, "Are

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:33.880
you struggling to change some habit in your
life?" And five thousand people raised their

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:39.820
hands and said, "Yeah. Yeah, I am." And then
we followed their stories over a period of

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.800
years and said, "Who succeeds and who fails?"

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:48.400
About 4400 of those failed, or at least their
failure's in motion. So they're still struggling,

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.630
but haven't conquered whatever the behavior
changes that they were attempting to bring

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:56.190
about. A few hundred, however, succeeded.
And so what we wanted to do was to say, "What

00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:00.850
can you learn that differentiates, and even
predicts, who ends up in Category Two versus

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:03.120
Category One?"

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.880
Well, there were three principles, two of
which I'll have a chance to elaborate on a

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:12.590
little bit today. Three principles that had
a remarkable predictive power to them. In

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:17.440
fact, we later published some of this research
in the MIT Sloan journal and what we were

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:24.740
able to demonstrate is that the practice of
these three principles predicts at ten times

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.620
who succeeds versus who fails.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:31.220
Those who practice these principles are ten
times more likely to find themselves changed

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:36.370
in a profound, measurable, sustainable way
versus those who don't. So that's what I'd

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:42.700
like to share. Here's the first concept. The
first, most important thing to get into our

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:47.940
heads when we looked at those who succeeded
at change was they broke out of what we came

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.760
to call the "willpower trap."

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.570
The willpower trap is sort of the assumption
that this is the mode that change works in.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:59.280
So, we crunched a whole lot of our numbers,
developed a really sophisticated computer

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.760
simulation to demonstrate how you and I tend
to approach change, and here's what resulted.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:14.430
[sounds of straining and grunting]

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.820
Millions of dollars, folks. There it is. [laughs]

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:17.890
[laughter]

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:23.330
How many of you identify? ]laughs] So we've
all been on that, right? When we tend to approach

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:27.700
change, we see it as this struggle against
some mighty opposition. And as long as we

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:32.530
dig our heels in and hold against it, we can
stay over in the good category. But as soon

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:36.490
as you relax your grip, you get dragged back
in the other direction.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.940
Well, here's your first assignment. So, with
your learning partner, I wanna share with

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:45.370
you a little laboratory experiment we did
with 11 and 12 year old children. We wanted

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:49.670
to subject them to a variety of sources of
influence and see how they'd respond but then

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:53.660
also see if they were aware of what was going
on.

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:58.210
So, with your partner, I'd like you to watch
the experiment and afterwards, just articulate,

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:02.811
what are the implications for change in this
study? So if what we're suggesting here is

00:13:02.811 --> 00:13:08.590
true, what are the implications for how you
and I think about change? Here you go. This,

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:13.690
by the way, was conducted by my son, Hyrum,
for a Science Fair project. So, you'll meet

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:14.690
him in a moment.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:15.690
[plays clip]

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:16.690
[music]

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:22.450
&gt;&gt;Hyrum Grenny: Most of us are just one habit
away from being much happier, healthier, or

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:27.610
wealthier, but we can't change. And if you
ask the average person how much control they

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:33.110
have over their own behavior, they'll tell
you, "A lot." If that's true, then what's

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:34.110
our problem?

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:38.320
Why is it that almost all of us know we should
change some habit. [grunting sounds] We even

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.450
want to change some habit. [grunting sounds]
But we don't change that habit. Conventional

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:48.580
wisdom is that we just lack the willpower.
Well, I wanted to find out. I wanted to see

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:54.460
if success is all about personal motivation,
so I gave a group of 10 year old kids a chance

00:13:54.460 --> 00:14:00.550
to earn 40 dollars. All had big plans for
the money once they left my lab.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:04.910
&gt;&gt;Boy #1: Well, I was wanting to get a new
video game.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.340
&gt;&gt;Girl #1: Maybe a new pair of shoes.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:08.560
&gt;&gt;Boy #2: College money.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:13.430
&gt;&gt;Girl #2: Wait until Christmas comes and
then buy my sister a really cute outfit. [sound

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:14.430
of a harp]

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:19.550
&gt;&gt;Hyrum Grenny: Clearly, they were all personally
motivated to earn and keep their money, right?

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:25.470
Here's how it worked. Over the course of 10
minutes, they would complete four easy tasks.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:30.650
After each task, I'd give them 10 dollars
and a chance to spend it, or save it. The

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:35.440
only temptation they'd face is a bunch of
overpriced junk at my Change Anything store.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.610
[music]

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:44.960
[register sounds]

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:50.220
So we've got kids who really want to save.
They only have to resist temptation for 10

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:55.860
minutes and the only temptation they'll get
is obviously a terrible deal. How hard could

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:59.890
this be? Let's see how the first subjects
do.

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:00.890
[music]

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:07.420
&gt;&gt;Singer on Clip: Well it's bye-bye pretty
baby. Pretty baby, bye-bye.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:10.730
&gt;&gt;Hyrum Grenny: Wait a minute. What happened?

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.620
[singer continues in background]

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:20.820
In spite of rip-off prices, these kids were
spending like it’s bonus day on Wall Street.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:27.580
In fact, this group only saved an average
of 13 dollars. A few of them even went into

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:30.260
debt. What happened to those grand goals to
save money?

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.260
[guitar strumming]

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.910
&gt;&gt;Girl #2: Snickers is my favorite candy,
I can usually get it at a dollar fifty at

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:41.010
a store, but since it’s my favorite candy.
I bought it for six dollars.

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:51.200
&gt;&gt;Hyrum Grenny: And what about this poor kid?
Ten dollars again.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.180
[bass music]

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:59.730
In the end, all but one of these well-intentioned
savers failed. Why would they pay so much

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:03.570
to pay so little when they only had to wait
ten minutes to achieve their goal?

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:04.570
&gt;&gt;Girl #3: I don't know.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:05.570
&gt;&gt;Boy #3: I don't know.

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:07.390
&gt;&gt;Girl #4: There was like, a lot of good stuff
to buy.

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:09.310
&gt;&gt;Boy #1: I'm not sure if I can answer that
question.

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:10.700
&gt;&gt;Hyrum Grenny: Sounds like a willpower problem,
right?

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:18.950
&gt;&gt;Girl #5: I paid six dollars for it because
it didn't come any cheaper.

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:27.650
&gt;&gt;Hyrum Grenny: Well not so fast. Picture
it this way. It turns out that I laced their

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:32.950
experience with six powerful sources of influence;
the same kind you and I face in the real world.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:38.350
And these guys are experts at pulling us in
directions we don't want to go. In fact, each

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:43.870
one of these behavioral bullies worked against
my would-be savers. Here's how.

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:50.000
Everyone got to taste a free sample of their
favorite candy. Yummy. Nobody taught them

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.180
how to track their expenses. They were surrounded
by bad examples and negative peer pressure.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.180
&gt;&gt;Girl #6: You know, there's a lot of awesome
candy over there.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:02.010
&gt;&gt;Boy #5: Dude, you should get a lot; as much
as you can.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:07.870
&gt;&gt;Hyrum Grenny: They spent from a credit account,
which made the spending feel easy. Just grab

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:12.689
whatever you wanna buy. And finally, there
were lots of enticing pictures on the walls.

00:17:12.689 --> 00:17:20.170
I think you adults call that marketing. Wow,
these kids never had a chance.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:24.684
&gt;&gt;Girl #3: I paid four dollars for this, but
I don't know why.

00:17:24.684 --> 00:17:25.684
&gt;&gt;Girl #5: I wish I'd saved more.

00:17:25.684 --> 00:17:28.670
&gt;&gt;Hyrum Grenny: But the real problem is bigger
than just being outnumbered six to one. These

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:33.320
kids were blind to all of it. Why do think
it was so hard to save your money?

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.130
&gt;&gt;Boy #6: I don't know.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:40.351
&gt;&gt;Hyrum Grenny: To be sure I could attribute
their disappointment to these sources of influence,

00:17:40.351 --> 00:17:46.020
I changed them for the second group. I got
them working for the savers, rather than against

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:51.990
them. No free samples, I taught them how to
track their expenses, I turned accomplices

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:53.220
into helpful friends.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.370
&gt;&gt;Girl #7: I'm going to save my money. How
about you?

00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:01.540
&gt;&gt;Boy #5: I think I'm going to save my money.
I think it'd probably be a good idea.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:06.929
&gt;&gt;Hyrum Grenny: I paid them in cash so they'd
feel immediate loss when they bought something,

00:18:06.929 --> 00:18:13.510
and I took down all that marketing mumbo-jumbo.
OK. A new group of kids, with the same jobs,

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:23.300
same pay, and the same opportunity to buy
from my Change Anything store. Now let's see

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.340
what happens.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:27.860
[pause]

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:35.910
Success. These kids walked away with 260 percent
of what the first group saved, but what do

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.110
these subjects attribute their success to?

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:39.280
&gt;&gt;Boy #7: I don't know.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.280
&gt;&gt;Boy #8: I don't know exactly, but.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.750
&gt;&gt;Girl #8: Because I'd rather save it so I
can have it later on.

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:49.901
&gt;&gt;Boy #9: I just thought I shouldn't buy any
more because my goal was 30 dollars and I

00:18:49.901 --> 00:18:50.901
wanted to keep that goal.

00:18:50.901 --> 00:18:52.060
&gt;&gt;Girl #9: I needed the money.

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:56.970
&gt;&gt;Hyrum Grenny: Hmm. Turns out, these kids
were just as blind to the positive sources

00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:01.790
of influence as the other kids were to the
negative ones. So, what's the problem with

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:07.490
that? Well, if you don't know why you succeeded,
you won't be able to fix your failures. And

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:08.490
that's just it.

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:13.610
My dad and his colleagues discovered that
there are six sources of influence all around

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:18.809
us, all the time. And they have enough pull
to determine our behavior and therefore, our

00:19:18.809 --> 00:19:24.210
results. And if we can't see them, we can't
change them. So when they're working against

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:29.550
us, we're blind, outnumbered, and doomed.
So what's the point?

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:34.180
If we're struggling to change tough habits,
we may not have a willpower problem, but a

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:39.350
math problem. The numbers are simply stacked
against us and we don't even know it. But

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:45.330
if we can learn to see and engage all six
sources of influence on our side, change becomes

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.540
almost inevitable. Just think about it.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:53.760
Getting what we really want out of life. Wouldn't
that be great? And it’s a whole lot better

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.760
than the alternative.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.750
&gt;&gt;Boy #10: I didn't want to spend too much
so I could reach my goal. But at the end I

00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:01.530
kind of bought a little more. So, yeah.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.070
[music ends]

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:04.610
[end clip]

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:11.640
&gt;&gt;Joseph Grenny: Isn't that remarkable? Did
you catch the difference in the savings amounts

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.021
between the two groups? What was the increase
in the second group?

00:20:14.021 --> 00:20:16.890
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: 260 percent.

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:18.930
&gt;&gt;Joseph Grenny: Yeah, 260 percent. This is
remarkable. These aren't subtle little differences.

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:22.841
These aren't small. These are profound differences.
What I want you to do though with your partner

00:20:22.841 --> 00:20:27.090
is just articulate, what are the implications
of this for how we think about change? So

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:31.841
just take 60 seconds and what leaps to you
as an implication of this research?

00:20:31.841 --> 00:20:32.841
[pause]

00:20:32.841 --> 00:20:34.880
[audience members chatting]

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:41.280
All right, sorry to interrupt, but let me
pause you. I wanted to get your wheels turning

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:46.510
on that so we can explore and apply for just
a second. I want you to notice in the experiment

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:51.251
we held willpower constant. So the assumption
is, the willpower capacity of the two groups

00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:55.000
was precisely the same. But the outcomes were
entirely different.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.950
The central argument here is that willpower
is not a particularly good predictor of whether

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:05.190
we succeed or fail at change. There's something
else going on. If that's true, then this is

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:10.390
one of the implications. The problem very
often, not all the time, but very often is

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:15.690
not that we're weak. The problem is that we're
outnumbered.

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:20.790
The problem is that it isn't just some magical
rope that there's some invisible opposition

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:26.170
with. There are definable, knowable, identifiable
sources of influence that are on the other

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:31.040
side of that rope, pulling us in the other
direction. The problem is not a willpower

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:36.010
problem. It’s a math problem and it's that
we're secondarily blind to the math problem.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:41.890
We're overwhelmed by these opposing sources.
So here's the upshot. One of the things that

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:46.740
predicted people's succeeding at changes is
their acknowledgement of that second point.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:51.530
Those who were in the second cohort, the ones
who succeeded at changing habits, started

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:56.220
to gain an awareness that they had far less
control over their behavior than they like

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.880
to tell themselves.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.820
What they did acknowledge though, was that
they could have enormous control over the

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:07.190
things that control them. And that's where
they turned their attention. It was less just

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:11.320
about saying, "grit my teeth, grunt hard,
and pull." It was more about starting to become

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:15.960
a student of what was happening to my own
behavior, learning to appreciate and identify

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.300
some of those sources of influence.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:23.600
So, here's the challenge. It's making the
dynamic move from that, to this. The question

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:28.040
is how do we marshal those same forces on
our side of the rope? And that’s when these

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:32.450
people started to turn the corner. That's
when they were not just marginally more successful

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:36.750
at change. They were ten times more likely
to be able to produce change.

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:41.400
So let me give you a little quick opportunity
to play with the concept. Let's imagine, for

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:46.880
a moment, that you're a sales professional.
And what you've figured out is that if you

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.960
start your day hitting some of the toughest
calls that you have to make, your sales increase.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:52.960
So that's what you ought to do.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.490
You really gotta organize your day so that
you hit the phone right away, making some

00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:03.310
of the important contacts for that day. However,
on this particular day, you started your day,

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:07.120
instead of making phone calls, with two hours
of chatting with colleagues, checking out

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.140
news websites and organizing your calendar
before starting on your leads.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:14.000
You ended up blowing the whole morning and
not getting much done. I'm sure programmers

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.540
never have this problem, right? So all of
us have felt that same dynamic. And the question

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:21.940
I want you to answer, I'm gonna give you ten
seconds to do it. All I want you to do, is

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:26.360
off the top of your head with your current
brain, answer the question, why?

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:33.730
So why, when he intended to start his day
with all of those great calls, did he instead

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:37.380
fritter it away in the way that I just described?
So turn to your colleague. First answer off

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:38.810
the top of your head, why did it happen?

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:39.920
[pause]

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:45.860
All right. OK, I want you to put a pin in
that answer. I want you to hang onto it for

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:49.720
a second. So let me get one answer. What's
one reason I might have done that?

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.940
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: It was too hard
to make the call. So I delayed it.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.220
&gt;&gt;Joseph Grenny: OK, good. He says, "I put
it off because it’s too hard. It’s not

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:56.820
fun. I don't really wanna do this." What would
be one more reason?

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:59.290
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: Oh, I said procrastination.

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:03.860
&gt;&gt;Joseph Grenny: OK, good. So I was just procrastinating,
just putting it off. Again, because it's unpleasant.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.580
Let me just get one more. How about from you?

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.750
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #3: Laziness.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:09.630
&gt;&gt;Joseph Grenny: Lazy. All right. I was just
too lazy. Now, what I want you to notice and

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:14.549
sorry about the "gotcha," but I want you to
notice that almost all of our explanations

00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:19.179
for my failure, fall into what we just call
"The Willpower Trap". What we just did with

00:24:19.179 --> 00:24:24.820
our current brains, is explain my behavioral
lapse by saying, "I just didn't want it badly

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:29.250
enough, or I wasn't strong enough to overcome
some of those urges and impulses." Does that

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:30.330
make sense?

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:34.940
That's the problem. That's the problem. When
we try to explain our failures, we do it in

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:40.480
terms of a motivation struggle. Let me broaden
and make this a little bit more complex. What

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:44.960
if it's possible that personal motivation
was an issue? OK? Let's just acknowledge that.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.450
So, it is more fun not doing these calls than
doing them.

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:52.140
So, "Calling leads fills me with anxiety.
Watching kitties fall asleep on YouTube is

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.140
fun.

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:54.140
[laughter]

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:57.860
So, I'll do something more pleasurable." Got
it. Well, what if there were also ability

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:02.960
reasons for it? For example, I don't know
how to change the lethargic feeling I have

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:07.380
when I sit down at the computer. Could that
be a skill gap in part? Are there emotional

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:12.179
management skills that I might lack? What
about social?

00:25:12.179 --> 00:25:17.630
Is it possible that my colleagues are also
part of the problem? So, they come around

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:23.040
and we have fun together and we laugh and
they encourage that distraction and diversion.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:28.080
I mean, is that a possible part of the problem
here? What about others who don't just sort

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.810
of encourage, but also enable? People knock
on my door.

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:35.309
They send me IMs as I'm psyching myself to
get started. There are positive interruptions

00:25:35.309 --> 00:25:39.720
from other human beings. Do you see the problem
here? The problem is far more complex than

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:44.210
just "I didn't want it badly enough." We've
perfectly organized the world to make it so

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:47.559
that you won't. What about incentives?

00:25:47.559 --> 00:25:51.820
Turns out for this particular person, when
he makes a big sale, he relaxes for a while.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:55.170
There's not as much of an economic incentive
to continue pounding the phone because "I

00:25:55.170 --> 00:26:02.430
feel OK for the month." And what about structurally?
Notice how few of us identified this one.

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:06.820
It turns out that as I sit at my desk getting
ready to make phone calls, there are five

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.500
kinds of distractions that are piped right
into me.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:15.630
Do any of you ever notice that in your work?
I can get instant messages, texts, mobile

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:20.559
phones, emails. There are a million other
distractions just a click away. We have perfectly

00:26:20.559 --> 00:26:25.690
structured our physical environment to create
distraction today. But when you try to explain

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:29.620
why I didn't make my calls, all we tend to
look at is, "Well, you didn't want it badly

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:32.480
enough." That's the point.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:37.049
That's what we've got to learn to get past.
Here's why. Because when it comes to these

00:26:37.049 --> 00:26:43.140
six sources of influence, you literally have
only two choices. You can either act on them.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:46.559
You can either identify the ones that are
working against you and marshal them in your

00:26:46.559 --> 00:26:52.530
favor, or you can be acted on by them. If
you don't do the former, you will experience

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:53.530
the latter.

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:57.020
You will be controlled and shaped by these
to the degree you're not conscious of, and

00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:03.000
taking action, to try to move them on your
side. So, point one. Point one is, that we

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.799
have to break out of this simplistic model
that we carry in our brains about human behavior

00:27:07.799 --> 00:27:13.679
that attributes disproportionately our choices
to willpower, to how bad we want something.

00:27:13.679 --> 00:27:19.540
That's an ingredient. But it’s far less
than you might think. Here's the second. The

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:24.090
second big difference between the successes
and the failures were the mode with which

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:28.160
they approached their change challenge. We
call this becoming both the scientist and

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:32.429
the subject. Now you already do this. You're
already pretty good at it, but we don't tend

00:27:32.429 --> 00:27:35.120
to do it as systematically as we should.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:41.530
In fact, I saw a fun, naturalistic example
of this just a while back. This was at Vital

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:45.270
Smarts. I was standing in front of a group
like this. We took a break and I saw an email

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:50.360
come through on my phone and the email said
this. It said, "Hey Everyone! A set of keys

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:54.870
was found in the downstairs refrigerator.
If they are yours, come find Becky." Now this

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:55.870
is Vital Smarts.

00:27:55.870 --> 00:28:01.360
I get the sense the Google culture is kind
of similar. I knew that with that kind of

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:06.480
a setup there would be a dozen smart alec
emails that would follow after this one, coming

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:12.100
from people poking fun. So I waited and sure
enough, the first one came through. "Um can

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:16.070
you please tell us whoever it is that claims
than so we can make fun of them? Thanks, Joe."

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:17.940
Sent to all of the employees at Vital Smarts.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:23.540
What followed this one was, "If you keep them
in the freezer they last longer. Just saying.

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:24.540
Platte."

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:25.540
[laughter]

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:29.000
Very helpful suggestion. Followed by, "it’s
not me-- I only keep my keys in the 2nd or

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.850
3rd floor refrigerators. Rob." So as these
are all coming through and I was enjoying

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:37.380
and appreciating them. Then finally, the mystery
was solved.

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:43.250
Emily wrote in. She says, "They are mine.
I put them on my leftovers so I won't forget

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:45.000
to take them home with me at the end of the
day."

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000
[audience chuckles]

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.120
Isn't that clever? How many of you do something
like that? How many of you use some sort of

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:54.980
a-- my biggest problem is when I stay at hotels,
I always forget my gym clothes cause they're

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:59.830
hanging over the towel bar in the bathroom,
trying to help them dry out a little bit.

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:05.760
And so a few years ago, I realized "Joseph
is too stupid to remember to get his gym clothes,

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:10.670
so you'd better do something to trick Joseph
into remembering". So I go get a laundry bag

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:15.741
out of the closet, lay it across my garment
bag and that reminds me to go get my gym clothes

00:29:15.741 --> 00:29:16.741
and bring them--.

00:29:16.741 --> 00:29:20.660
Does that make sense? What we found is that
people who are really good at change start

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:25.010
thinking of themselves like a lab rat. They
start thinking about themselves in the third

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:30.049
person, and saying, “I know a little bit
about me and here's what I have to do to get

00:29:30.049 --> 00:29:32.730
me to behave differently than I otherwise
would."

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:38.190
Here's a fun illustration. So one of our six
hundred changers was Sharman Went. Sharman

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:44.059
was struggling to lose 120 pounds. She tried
for 20 years to shed this weight. And she'd

00:29:44.059 --> 00:29:50.510
make a little progress and then slip backwards.
And over time, she got so defeated because

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:53.600
of this willpower trap issue that she gave
up.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:57.050
But then something happened inside of her
and she started looking at herself and learned

00:29:57.050 --> 00:30:01.860
a few things about what had caused failures.
And then was able to say, "What might I do

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:07.330
to predict success." Here's one of the conclusions
she drew. She said at the final time when

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:12.040
she approached her weight loss challenge,
she said, "I never promised to always keep

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.040
my diet."

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.530
She said, "I think that was one of the things
I got wrong. I would make some absolute promise,

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:19.730
and then as soon as I would break it, I'd
feel horrible and depressed. And then I would

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:25.621
give up. So this time I didn't do that." But
then watch what she did.

00:30:25.621 --> 00:30:30.919
She said, "I did, however, make an unequivocal
promise to myself that before I broke my diet,

00:30:30.919 --> 00:30:35.990
I would read a three by five card that I carried
with me. That was my promise. That's all I

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:39.780
promised. And then after reading that card,
I would make my choice about whether to break

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:45.380
the diet or not." Now, the first thing I want
you to notice is the way she's thinking about

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:48.370
herself as the object of study.

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:53.670
She's carefully working through what the failure
paths were and then starts to say what interventions

00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:58.570
would help this person called Sharman to behave
differently in the future. See, here's why

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:04.510
this became so important in these people's
success stories. Because social scientists

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:08.870
may have studied a category of change that
you care about, whether it’s changing your

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:12.000
spending habits, improving a relationship,
advancing your career.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.190
So there are books out there that will say,
"Here's what we know from a study of 2000

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:21.990
people in this category." The problem, however,
is that the idiosyncrasies are more important

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:26.830
than the commonalities. That the differences
between you and that average person that was

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:31.120
studied are more profound than what you have
in common with most of them.

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:35.010
That's the difference between social science
and physical science. And no one has ever

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:40.710
studied you. No one's ever done it. So that
diet book probably doesn't apply 90 percent

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:46.480
to you. That relationship book may not have
a lot to say to you. So you have to do the

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.179
research. You have to be the scientist.

00:31:49.179 --> 00:31:54.190
You have to do the first ever study of an
in of 1, of a person called "you" and figure

00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:58.640
out what is unique and idiosyncratic about
your choices and your behaviors. And how then

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:05.220
would you use that to trick you into behaving
differently. How would you do that? In order,

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:10.370
however, to do that well, you need a model.
You need a way of both understanding as well

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:12.640
as influencing your own behavior.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.490
These changers that we studied eventually
succeeded, but many of them took a few years

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:20.560
to get there. What we hope to contribute with
the "Change Anything" book, is to shorten

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:24.780
that learning cycle, to help people have an
explicit model that they can use to study

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:30.190
their own behavior and therefore, create interventions
that are remarkably successful and remarkably

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:31.190
fast.

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:35.620
And here's the model. So what I'm gonna do
in the remaining time we've got, is fly you

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:39.210
through that. I'm gonna have you play with
it as scientists and I want you to notice

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:44.080
how easy it is to overlook various elements
of the model. Here's the first. The first

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:49.539
element that we often misunderstand or fail
to use is the one that is the trap we fall

00:32:49.539 --> 00:32:50.539
into.

00:32:50.539 --> 00:32:56.300
So it’s the personal motivation source of
influence. The problem we often have in attempting

00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:02.200
to change is that bad habits feel really good
and good habits don't feel very good. Is that

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:09.380
true? So, very often the unhealthy behaviors
are very personally motivating. The question

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:14.030
then that you and I have to ask is, is the
only solution digging in our heels and resisting

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:15.100
those impulses?

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:19.820
Is that the only way to approach this? What
we found is that successful changers almost

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:26.150
never take that tack. They use tactics to
help them literally change how they feel about

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:30.560
both the bad behavior and the good. Let me
share with you a little experiment. I need

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:34.460
you to get with your buddy. So with your partner,
you need to decide who is Person A and who

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:38.210
is Person B. Pick an A and a B.

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:39.210
[audience chatter]

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:44.950
There's no big strategy to this, just a simple
assignment. Go for it. All right? So, all

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:49.160
the Person As. Raise your hand if you're Person
A. OK, good. If you're Person A, you now have

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:54.450
ten dollars in your hand, OK? It’s an imaginary
ten dollars I've given to you. So you have

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:59.429
ten dollars in your hand. Person B, you are
going to get an offer from Person A.

00:33:59.429 --> 00:34:03.410
This is called "The Ultimatum Game" in behavioral
economics, if any of you are familiar with

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:08.620
it. So person A is going to offer to split
that ten dollars with you. He or she can offer

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:14.620
you anywhere from zero to ten dollars. After
they make the offer, you are going to either

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:16.760
accept or reject their offer.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:21.379
So if I offered you one dollar, you could
now either accept or reject it. If you accept

00:34:21.379 --> 00:34:25.770
it, you get one dollar, I get nine and we're
done. If he rejects it, neither of us get

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:32.260
anything. We both lose. Does everybody understand
the rules? OK, so Person A, I want you to

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:35.910
decide how much you're going to offer right
now and as soon as I say go, you turn and

00:34:35.910 --> 00:34:36.910
make your offer.

00:34:36.910 --> 00:34:41.300
And then Person B, I want you to immediately
either accept or reject it, OK? So Person

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:46.330
A, give it some thought. Give it some thought.
Figure it out. What's your offer? OK. Ready,

00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:47.530
set, go. Make your offer.

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:54.200
[audience chatter]

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:59.952
OK, good. Accept or reject. All right. How
many of you rejected the offer? Did any of

00:34:59.952 --> 00:35:02.020
you reject it? Just got one. How much did
he offer you?

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:03.260
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: One dollar.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.859
&gt;&gt;Joseph Grenny: One dollar.

00:35:04.859 --> 00:35:05.859
[laughter]

00:35:05.859 --> 00:35:09.231
No, it’s interesting because a rational
person would do what? What would you do? Accept

00:35:09.231 --> 00:35:10.231
or reject a dollar?

00:35:10.231 --> 00:35:11.231
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: Accept it.

00:35:11.231 --> 00:35:14.140
&gt;&gt;Joseph Grenny: It's a dollar more than you
would've had a moment ago, right? But something

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:19.380
in us gets us to reject it 'cause you're a
creep, right? For offering my only one dollar.

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:20.510
[laughter]

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:23.750
There's something else going on here, something
value-driven. Now, this is the interesting

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:27.680
experiment that was set up by Lee Ross at
Stanford. We did a replication of this a little

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:32.970
while back in a mall. Had people play the
game. And in that game, we framed it two different

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:36.430
ways. I want you to listen to how subtle and
small these differences were.

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:41.830
In Round 1 of the game, we called it what
you see on the sign here. We said, "You and

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:47.230
your colleague here are going to play the
Wall Street Game. And you are going to decide

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:57.280
how much to offer to your opponent." You follow?
In Round 2, we called it the "Community Game".

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:01.310
"You and your colleague will be playing the
Community Game and you have to decide how

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:03.240
much to offer you partner."

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:10.381
Do you think just changing a couple of words
would change the outcome? Yeah, yeah. It was

00:36:10.381 --> 00:36:15.840
remarkable. Sixty percent more people offered
even splits when we just called it the Community

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:22.430
Game. You and I were willing to give up money,
which can feel physically painful to us. We're

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:27.740
willing to surrender money if we just have
a little different mental frame for the choice

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:29.040
that we're making.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:34.940
It's remarkable. So how does this work? Remember
the problem. Bad habits feel good. Good habits

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:40.430
feel bad. So, how to change is deal with that
problem? Here's what Sharman did. Sharman

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:44.760
promised that before she broke her diet, she
would read a little card. That's all she promised

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:52.680
to do. Now, Sharman's biggest downfall was
chimichangas. Sharman loves chimichangas.

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:59.200
She said she'd be sitting in a restaurant
and would see chimichanga on the menu and

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:04.350
a whole train of mental and physiological
processes would start to take place. Her mouth

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:11.050
would water. She could recall the melted cheese
and the tasty, delicious, soft pork in the

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:14.650
middle of the--. She hadn't even ordered the
thing yet and she's already experiencing the

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:15.760
chimichanga.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:19.859
So this became her crucial moment. And in
that moment, she said she'd made a promise

00:37:19.859 --> 00:37:24.349
that she wouldn't always keep her diet, but
she'd read the card. So she'd retrieve this

00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:30.650
three by five card and she would read line
one. Line one said, in her own penmanship,

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:36.720
"I'd like to feel healthier." And then she'd
take a breath and she'd pause.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:45.560
And then she'd read line two, which said,
"I'd like to like the way I look in the mirror."

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:49.210
And she'd take a breath. And then line three,
"I'd like to have more physical stamina."

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:56.270
Line four, "I'd like to model healthy living
for my grandkids." Line five, "I'd like my

00:37:56.270 --> 00:38:03.000
husband to be proud of how I look." She said
somewhere between lines three and four, something

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.609
strange would happen inside of her.

00:38:05.609 --> 00:38:13.450
She said the chimichanga felt different. She
said somewhere in there, suddenly, she would

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:17.080
not want the chimichanga quite as much as
she did before. Now, this didn't work every

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:21.850
time, but frequently it was the case. She
felt differently towards the chimichanga.

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:26.900
She says, in fact, later on as she worked
with this, she would actually feel disgust

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:28.369
for the chimichanga.

00:38:28.369 --> 00:38:34.720
It would feel like a sellout to her. Is that
possible? And not only is it possible, it

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:39.180
was remarkably predictive. Now I want you
to notice what she just did. Not only did

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:45.100
she succeed in losing 120 pounds and has kept
if off now for many years, what she did was

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:50.619
she acted like a scientist studying her, trying
to figure out, "Could I create an intervention

00:38:50.619 --> 00:38:54.440
that would change how I felt about my choices
in crucial moments?"

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:59.340
And then she developed one using a tactic
we call "creating a personal motivation statement."

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:04.690
What we describe in the book are 22 different
tactics that people seem to stumble upon.

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:09.990
They eventually discovered that helped them
accomplish things like this. So if we have

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:14.820
professional challenges, we often have habits
and behaviors that are tough for us to change

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:16.680
because they're emotional barriers.

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:22.369
We have emotions we have to change. But the
truth is that it is possible for us to use

00:39:22.369 --> 00:39:27.830
little interventions like this to help us
change how we feel, to love what we hate,

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:33.480
to have different feelings towards positive
and negative behaviors. So that's one. The

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.599
second area where you have to be a pretty
good scientist is illustrated by this.

00:39:36.599 --> 00:39:41.330
So with your partner, I want you to help out
Mary Gordon. Mary Gordon was concerned about

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:46.970
proactive bullying that happened in schools.
So, proactive aggression is defined as, not

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:51.420
just we're mad at each other so we push each
other, but somebody who seeks somebody out

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:55.690
as a victim and targets them for punishment.

00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:59.960
So she wanted to try to have an influence
on proactive aggression in schools and in

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:06.130
fact, was remarkably successful in over 12,600
classrooms. So here's what I want you to do.

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:09.650
I want you to turn to your partner and I want
you to come up with one thing that you would

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:13.640
do if you were a school principal to try to
reduce bullying in your school.

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:18.609
How would you get bullies to stop doing that?
One idea. Ready. Set. Go.

00:40:18.609 --> 00:40:19.750
[pause]

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:22.030
All right.

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:24.310
[audience chatter]

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:30.270
OK, now. I want you to examine the idea you
came up with. So I don't care about the content

00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:33.750
of the idea and you're not gonna be probably
moving anywhere with that. I want you to notice

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:39.080
what category of influence we tend to rely
on. So when we're explaining my ineffectiveness

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:42.310
at making sales calls, we tend to look at
motivation.

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:47.520
I want you to notice if the idea you came
up with had to do with compliance, accountability,

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:52.320
punishment, holding them to--, giving them
some sort of consequence. And what we tend

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:56.490
to do very often, is move in the motivation
direction. And that's not what Mary Gordon

00:40:56.490 --> 00:41:02.260
did. Mary brought kids who were struggling
with proactive aggression into a classroom

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:05.609
with a baby, a little infant.

00:41:05.609 --> 00:41:11.590
And she taught them skills. She just had them
practice just reading the expressions of the

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:17.300
baby and trying to label how the baby felt.
How is the baby feeling right now? Put a word

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:22.520
to it. She taught them skills for recognizing
and identifying a baby's behaviors. And then

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:26.310
taught them skills for changing a baby's behaviors.

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:30.599
She tried to coach them so that they would
have strategies to try to both understand

00:41:30.599 --> 00:41:35.150
other people's emotions and relate to them
in a different way. The consequences of this,

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:40.030
and a number of other interventions, were
remarkable. Eighty-eight percent of those

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:43.580
who had struggled previously with proactive
aggression stopped.

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:51.330
And three years later, stayed stopped. Here's
the point. The point is that new habits almost

00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:57.990
always require new skills. The issue here
is that there are emotional, interpersonal,

00:41:57.990 --> 00:42:02.900
mental and physical skills that when we're
in the throes of bad habits, we tend not to

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:07.109
develop. But when you and I try to approach
change, we almost never look at the ability

00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:08.339
side of the model.

00:42:08.339 --> 00:42:12.470
We think it’s primarily a motivation issue
and we run ourselves down that side. So, think

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:17.339
about Michael Vitali, the guy I introduced
to you earlier. Twenty years of drug addiction.

00:42:17.339 --> 00:42:21.930
Most of us would say that Michael will finally
give up drugs when he's motivated enough,

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:25.080
when he wants it, when he hits rock bottom,
right? That's the predictor.

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:31.330
Well, baloney. Because it turns out that over
20 years, he had crafted a whole set of skills

00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:35.710
that helped him to be an addict. And if I
asked you to make a list, if we had time,

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:40.790
it's an interesting exercise, there are quite
a few. You have to be a world-class liar.

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:44.710
You have to be a pretty competent thief. You
have to be pretty good at identifying drugs

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:47.430
and mixing drugs and negotiating for it.

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:50.240
You're gonna have to work out where you're
going to sleep at different times. He got

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:55.109
really good at dumpster diving over this period
of time and that is a skill. It's an actual

00:42:55.109 --> 00:43:00.140
skill. Where would you find food when you
had no money? Over time, he had crafted a

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:04.050
whole set of skills that adapted him perfectly
to a certain lifestyle.

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:09.500
He had none of them for the corollary lifestyle.
Absolutely none. And what you and I do, is

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:13.470
say, "Well, Michael, when you want it badly
enough, you'll succeed over there." No, it

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:18.500
doesn't work like that. What happens is, he
wants it badly enough, he tries, fails, and

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:25.710
then says, "This is the only life I'm competent
for." Well, what about Thomas?

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:29.850
Thomas has a four person production team and
he's not meeting schedules and budgets. He

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:35.350
was fired for those chronic inabilities. What
we know is that there were skill gaps. It

00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:39.790
wasn't just "Do you want it badly enough,
Thomas?" It's, "Do you have skills for organizing,

00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:44.150
planning, holding people accountable, holding
crucial conversations when necessary, or a

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:49.190
whole variety of things that people who are
good at this tend to be able to do?"

00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:54.130
What we know is that any attempt to motivate
the unable doesn't create change. It creates

00:43:54.130 --> 00:44:00.150
depression. And you and I tend to approach
change with a motivation first kind of an

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:04.910
approach. Now let me move to the last couple
of categories here very quickly. This is AJ

00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:08.810
Wagner. She had a two-pack a day smoking habit
and was struggling to try to change.

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:12.380
And I want you to listen to something that
was common in the narratives of most of these

00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:13.380
people.

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:14.550
[plays clip]
&gt;&gt;AJ Wagner: I've always been a daddy's girl.

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:18.680
I spent most of my childhood idolizing my
father, who's a heavy smoker. And [pause]

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:28.120
one of the things I needed to do was limit
my exposure to smoke. And so, our long talks

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:33.050
in a smoking environment were gonna have to
come to a screeching halt. And our long talks

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:39.070
on the phone with both of us on the other
end smoking were going to have to slow down

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:40.070
as well.

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:43.940
And it wasn't a difficult, it was a difficult
process rather. It wasn't easy at all. And

00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:48.530
it hurt a little and we tried to maintain
communication. We didn't sever the relationship.

00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:52.339
But it was obviously strained for a while.
And there was a lot of question and answer

00:44:52.339 --> 00:44:58.339
as I tried to learn how to have a conversation.
And ultimately, we've come through the rough

00:44:58.339 --> 00:44:59.339
times.

00:44:59.339 --> 00:45:05.530
We speak relatively regularly. We still love
one another. But the relationship had to change

00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:09.300
in order to maximize my own personal change
and my own health needs, and the subsequent

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:12.140
health changes that have happened in my husband
and children and, hopefully, grandchildren

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:13.520
in the future.

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:14.520
[end clip]

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:19.300
&gt;&gt;Joseph Grenny: Isn't that interesting? Well,
one of the things that many of them recognized

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:25.630
is that bad habits are a team sport. That
there are almost always other people that

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:30.270
are playing a role in my continuing to behave
the way I do. Some of them may not even be

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:34.410
conscious of the role they're playing. You
don't have to have an agenda to have an influence.

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:39.731
So, what almost all of them experienced was
they had to change the mix of what we call

00:45:39.731 --> 00:45:43.950
"accomplices and friends" in their lives.
Accomplices are those who are either enabling

00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:48.339
or encouraging the bad habits and the friends
are those who are supportive of the positive

00:45:48.339 --> 00:45:52.859
change. Now again, I'm not gonna have any
time to elaborate on this. But I wanna illustrate

00:45:52.859 --> 00:45:55.470
how subtle sometimes the social influences
can be.

00:45:55.470 --> 00:46:01.450
Bob Mues was struggling to lose about 150
pounds and he didn't even realize that he

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:06.480
should struggle for many, many years because,
well, let me explain why. Here's how he discovered

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:11.880
he shouldn't. One day, he was on Google Earth
and saw a new feature called Google Street

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:17.150
View. And on Google Street View, he said,
"I wanna look at Longwell Green, England and

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:18.150
see my house."

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:23.690
And so he went to his house and he said there
was this looming massive structure in front

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:28.109
of his house that he didn't quite recognize.
He said that the image was grainy enough that

00:46:28.109 --> 00:46:33.160
he wasn't sure what and who it was until he
finally recognized, "It's me and I'm huge."

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:34.160
[laughter]

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:38.599
He said it was at that moment when he realized
he could be seen from outer space.

00:46:38.599 --> 00:46:40.420
[laughter]

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:45.960
That he thought, "I probably have something
I ought to address here." Very often, you

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:50.810
and I sort of blend into our environment because
those around us are modeling the very behavior

00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:54.860
that we're struggling to get out of. He didn't
know he was overweight because everybody around

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:55.880
him was overweight.

00:46:55.880 --> 00:47:01.740
Everybody at the pub looked just like he did.
There's a problem today of awareness about

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:06.530
many of our bad habits because there are accomplices
that model things around us. One of the things

00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:10.770
that we hope you get out of the book is the
capacity to start differentiating the roles

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:15.810
people play and how to get them on your side
in support of change. Here's the last.

00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:19.790
The last category of influence I wanna address,
I'm gonna give you as a problem to help me

00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:25.480
solve. So this is one of our changers who's
had his third heart attack. His name is Jim.

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:28.839
Jim was told after his first heart attack
that you need to change your diet or you're

00:47:28.839 --> 00:47:33.920
gonna have another heart attack. And he did
for about a week.

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:38.099
And then he started slipping back in the other
direction. And then he had a second heart

00:47:38.099 --> 00:47:42.230
attack and he changed his habits again for
about a month. And now he's had his third

00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:47.510
heart attack. So he comes to you and he asks
for one piece of advice. How can he help himself

00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:49.599
change his eating habits forever?

00:47:49.599 --> 00:47:54.010
What's one piece of advice you'd give him
right now off the top of your head? So, share

00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:55.010
that with your partner.

00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:56.010
[pause]

00:47:56.010 --> 00:47:57.920
[audience chattering]

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:05.480
All right. Good. So again, I want you to lock
that in your mind right now. Remember my original

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:08.710
goal was I want us to have a different brain.
I want us to have a different way of thinking

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:09.710
about these problems.

00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:15.400
So I want you to notice what category of influence
you just drew upon. So if you had a suggestion

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:19.829
for how to stay motivated, that's a good one.
If you had a suggestion about ability, that's

00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:24.030
a good category. If you had a suggestion about
social influence, that's a whole other one.

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:27.020
How do you get people on your side and supportive?

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:31.070
But if you didn't have this category of influence,
we missed one of the most simple ones to go

00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:37.400
after. So a colleague of ours, Brian Wansink
at Cornell University, inspired this experiment.

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:41.190
We brought a bunch of kids together, had them
play soccer for an hour and a half until they

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:47.300
were good and hungry. And then afterwards,
brought them in for a wonderful feast of macaroni

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:48.300
and cheese.

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:53.320
We randomly assigned the 14 kids to either
one table or another, as you see. And I want

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:58.089
you to see if you can notice a difference
between the plates. I understand this is common

00:48:58.089 --> 00:49:01.900
knowledge at Google. It's a good thing for
you to be aware of. So one table had plates

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:08.380
the size of hubcaps. The other had these petit
little plates about three inches smaller in

00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:10.400
diameter. Do you think that would make a difference?

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.410
&gt;&gt;Audience Members: Yeah.

00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:15.020
&gt;&gt;Joseph Grenny: Yeah. Now I want us not just
to think about plates, though. I want you

00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:19.400
to generalize. At the conclusion, we asked
all the kids, "Are you full? Did you get enough

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:24.349
macaroni and cheese?" Every one of the kids
said, "I'm full. I'm happy." They weren't

00:49:24.349 --> 00:49:29.520
denying themselves. It wasn't a struggle.
And then we weighed the two bowls to see what

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:31.630
the difference was in consumption.

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:38.960
One table ate 73 percent more than the other
table and both groups of kids reported being

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:45.700
equally full. Now here's the problem. We learned
something about plates, but we don't generalize

00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:51.200
it. So Thomas understood that his physical
environment affected his relationships and

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:54.410
therefore, his ability to hold people accountable
and finish his work on time.

00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:59.500
In his subsequent job, he became a scientist.
He began trying to apply that knowledge to

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:05.099
his own behavior. So what did he do? He started
changing where he ate lunch. He started eating

00:50:05.099 --> 00:50:09.570
where his colleagues ate. That changed the
quality and strength of his relationships.

00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:13.190
That helped him deal with issues a little
bit more effectively with them.

00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:19.380
What you gotta learn to do is control your
space. Now the problem is that very often,

00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:23.910
we're blind to the effect our physical environment
has on our choices. Do you catch the irony?

00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:26.200
[laughter]

00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:31.890
Yeah. This is from Google Street View probably,
here. Most of us riding the escalator up are

00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:36.710
unconscious of the fact that I'm about to
go stand on a treadmill for 45 minutes. I

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:42.079
mean, where's the sense in this? Our physical
environment suddenly and invisibly shapes

00:50:42.079 --> 00:50:47.000
our choices. So what do you have to learn
to do? You gotta learn to see it.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:52.400
You gotta learn to see ability gaps, social
influence, structural influences. If you use

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:57.079
tools and fences, cues, autopilots, distance,
there are things we can do in changing our

00:50:57.079 --> 00:51:01.340
environment. The best piece of advice you
could have given Jim about his third heart

00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:05.240
attack, is get smaller plates. Use smaller
spoons.

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:09.930
Make some physical changes because it immediately
affects our choices. And it isn't just around

00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:15.010
consumption. It's around every category of
influence that we need to go after. So what

00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:20.120
do we have to learn to do? We've gotta develop
tactics that help us deal with personal motivation

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:23.680
challenges. You better address ability gaps.

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:27.870
You better get social influence working on
your side. You better deal with incentives.

00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:31.359
That's a category we didn't address today.
You better deal with the physical environment

00:51:31.359 --> 00:51:37.010
and how it affects your choices. That's what's
causing us to fail. Most of us know we should

00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:41.040
change, want to change, but don't change.
And we're hoping that access to this kind

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:44.910
of science helps us to understand a little
bit more of our own choices and take control

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:45.910
of those.

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:48.950
So, thank you very much. I got a couple more
minutes for questions and will be happy to

00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:57.450
address anything you got and I appreciate
you being here today.

00:51:57.450 --> 00:51:58.540
[applause]

00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:00.990
Any questions or comments? Happy to entertain
anything you got. Yes.

00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:05.790
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: Do you think, in
large part, our economy is based on people

00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:06.990
not understanding these principles?

00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:11.630
&gt;&gt;Joseph Grenny: Yeah. He says is the economy
in large part based on people not understanding

00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:15.490
these principles. I think so. But the people
who do understand them are the people trying

00:52:15.490 --> 00:52:21.310
to exploit that opportunity. So the economy
is perfectly organized now to help us be subject

00:52:21.310 --> 00:52:26.490
to a lot of these sources of influence and
unless we're armed the same way, it's an unfair

00:52:26.490 --> 00:52:32.230
fight. And I think that's an important point.
Other questions? Yes.

00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:36.200
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #7: Is it just as difficult
to see the good influences as the bad influences?

00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:37.200
&gt;&gt;Joseph Grenny: Say again?

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:41.060
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #7: Is it just as difficult
to see the good influences as the bad influences?

00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:44.510
&gt;&gt;Joseph Grenny: Yeah, this is an insightful
question. He says is it just as difficult

00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:49.201
to see the good influences as the bad influences.
I did a lecture on this a little while back

00:52:49.201 --> 00:52:53.400
and a woman said, "Well, I quit smoking and
I just went cold turkey and it was all willpower."

00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:56.660
And I said, "Congratulations. That's great
to hear."

00:52:56.660 --> 00:53:01.890
And after hearing more about the model, she
said, "Oh, I now realize that the fact that

00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:07.180
my husband quit smoking a month before me
may have helped. The fact that my workplace

00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:12.140
went smoke-free about two months before that
and I had to smoke outside in a freezing cold

00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:16.270
Kansas winter may have helped." She started
going through one after another and started

00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:19.339
seeing what had been going on that she had
been the beneficiary of.

00:53:19.339 --> 00:53:23.170
So I think you're absolutely right because
if we don't learn from our successes, we can't

00:53:23.170 --> 00:53:29.650
fix our failures. So, very important part
of what we're trying to help advance.

00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:30.650
[pause]

00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:33.710
Looks like we're at one o'clock. Thank you
very much. It was great to spend time with

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:34.710
you.

00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:35.710
[applause]

00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:35.712
Good luck.
