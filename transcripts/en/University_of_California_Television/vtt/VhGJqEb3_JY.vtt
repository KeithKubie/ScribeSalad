- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape:
bipedal, naked, large brain. Long the

00:00:31.347 --> 00:00:37.544
master of fire, tools and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:37.544 --> 00:00:47.428
Aware that death is an inevitable, yet
filled with optimism. We grow up slowly.

00:00:47.428 --> 00:00:55.776
We hand down knowledge. We empathize and
deceive. We shape the future from our

shared understanding of the past. CARTA
brings together experts from diverse

- [Richard] I am absolutely thrilled to be
here. But more so I'm thrilled as skin

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.450
researcher for the last 20 years and as
chair of the department of dermatology

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.670
that this group has decided to focus on
skin and recognize the benefits of this

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.880
organ to understand more about who we are
and what ourselves really are made of.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.320
And, of course, the first picture I'd like
to do is to show a couple different hands

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.690
that we have in our cover. And these are
the types of hands we like to look at. The

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.700
type of skin we like to look at. We have
impressions about ourselves and our health

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.850
that's really dictated by the skin. Now,
of course, we recognize ourselves by our

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.930
skin. And that's the most obvious function
of all, of what the skin is. There's no

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.800
doubt that this is a different species,
perhaps a chimp. And years ago, in the

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.460
field of dermatology, there was a very
well-known dermatologist in the name of

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.340
William Montagna did quite a bit of
comparative anatomy. Looking at the

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.470
histology of different species. And
published a series of fascinating papers

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.700
which described many similarities and many
differences between different species in

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.920
terms of elements of the skin. And perhaps
what was most interesting about this work

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.630
is that this focus of those papers were
really specifically to try to understand

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.890
more about ourselves by studying skin
because of primates. Because at that time,

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.150
it was easier for him to get primate skin
than it was for him to get human skin. We

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:38.700
also have more rare disorders that, and
somehow, perhaps emphasizes our common

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.690
origin, evolutionarily. On the left is an
unfortunate gentleman in China with

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.340
something called a large, hairy congenital
nevus. And on the right, is a primate that

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.520
has alopecia.
And you wonder if there's some convergence

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.020
here, when you look at these types of
photos. And then our government and the

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.150
technology-rich world around us exploits
the skin for many things that you may or

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.190
may not be aware of. And this is an image
that shows assessing blood flow and

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.930
temperature in skin of individuals in an
airport. And it's used actually as a

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.200
covert lie detection system to look for
people who might be flushing, nervous. And

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.370
it's also used during disease outbreaks
for disease surveillance. This was

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.520
particularly prevalent during the SARS
epidemic; trying to pick people who might

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.320
have a fever out of a crowd. So the skin
has been exploited by many, many different

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:43.730
ways just from the outside. Sometimes,
looks can be deceiving, and the skin can

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.360
fool you. And we take it for granted in
terms of what's going on underneath there.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.050
So I'd like to show you, as skin
biologists, some of the techniques and the

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.350
approaches that we use to understand more
about the skin. And to do that, we need to

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.380
look more closely what's down deep within
the skin. This is an illustration of what

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:08.450
would happen if you cut a little cube out
of the skin, captured four hair follicles.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.460
The top here is the surface of the skin.
And as we look below the surface, we see

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.920
many, many different cell types. In fact,
this is probably the most complex organ

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.640
that we have in our body with blood
vessels, nerves, endocrine functions, it

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.950
can sweat, it can produce oils, it does
all of this and it must do it in a way

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.960
that protects itself from the outside
environment. And as we look more closely,

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.150
we see wonderful things going on in these
different cell types within the skin. On

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.120
the right, here, is a time-lapse
photography of a live hair follicle

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.560
showing how the cells are constantly in
motion, constantly differentiating,

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.930
actually regenerating the organ over and
over again. And much of what we've learned

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.370
about basic developmental biology, about
stem cells, comes from studying some of

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.680
the phenomenal interactions that cells
undergo in this simple little thing of a

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.460
hair.
Another way to look at the skin, instead

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.220
of cutting through the skin vertically, is
to cut across the top of the surface of

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.890
the skin horizontally. And if you did
that, you shave just the top of the skin

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:18.600
and stained what's in there, you see this
network of immune cells. These are called

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:25.110
dendritic cells. And our entire surface of
our skin is covered by this net of cells

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:31.410
that's interacting with the outside
environment. And the classic thoughts

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.670
about how those cells interact with the
environment is illustrated in this little

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:41.230
movie. Maybe some of you have seen this.
This actually was a film made in the 1950s

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:46.650
and it was really the dawn of our
understanding of host-immune defense and

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:51.860
how immune cells work. And it shows a
macrophage-like cell, and this little dot

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:58.170
over here, is a bacterium. And it's basic
concept of the time is that we device

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:04.420
specific cells that went out and could
recognize bacteria as bad, as an external

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:09.090
part that we don't want, could chase it
down, as you could see in this movie, the

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.830
macrophage is actually changing direction
while it's swimming amongst all these

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:17.800
blood cells and chasing down the bacteria
until it finally can engulf it and kill

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:27.000
it. Well, what we learned about 20 years
ago, now, is that our system that our skin

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.350
uses to defend against the outside
environment is more than just specific

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:36.630
cells that are tracking down bacteria. But
that our skin surface also produces

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:42.440
natural antibiotics, we've named these
AMPs, or antimicrobial peptides. And this

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.960
is a slide from some work I did when I
was, I guess about 5 years old, because it

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:54.810
was 20 years ago, that shows a brown
staining of the first known mammalian skin

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.260
antibiotic.
And this isn't produce by specific immune

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:03.610
cells, but it's actually produced by the
cells that form the surface of the skin,

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:07.120
suggesting that there's more to the way
the skin interacts with the outside

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:12.680
environment that we may otherwise think.
In fact, I want to show you an example of

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.350
a wonderful experiment that demonstrates
just how important those surface

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:25.310
antibiotics are to us. And on one side
here, you see a picture of an agar plate

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:29.600
and the way this experiment is done, is
they investigate a very carefully washed

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:35.340
the surface of their hands, touched a
bacteria. And in one case, the bacteria is

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:39.970
Staph.aureus. That's a bacteria that
normally can make infections on the skin.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:45.110
We know it's dangerous to our skin. And if
you touch those bacteria, wait a few

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:49.890
minutes and then go back later and touch a
plate, you'd see that the bacteria were

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:54.280
able to live on the surface of the skin,
that's why the fingerprints show up, all

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.470
those little dots are the bacteria that
lived on the surface of the skin and that

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:03.670
got transferred to the plate. But if you
do the exact same experiment, but now when

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:08.910
you wash your hands instead of touching a
skin bacteria, you touch an intestinal

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:13.690
bacteria like E.coli. This is a pathogen,
too, but it doesn't cause disease in the

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:19.250
skin. You see that when you go back later
and touch your fingers to a plate, all the

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:24.020
E.coli are dead. So this is a great
example and somewhat explains certain

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:30.120
diseases. It explains why Staph.aureus can
be a disease causing organism on skin

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:36.400
because it survives, and why E.coli is
never found as a disease causing organism

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.810
in the skin situation, because the skin
makes specific antimicrobials. What's

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:44.160
particularly interesting about this
experiment, though, is the all-important

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.160
control. And the scientists love controls.
And that is to do the same experiment but

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:54.240
have sterile surgical gloves on.
So you see what happens, when you have

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.040
sterile gloves on and you'd touch
Staph.aureus, and wait a while, and touch

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:03.800
your glove-covered bacteria on the plate,
some of the Staph.aureus survived but

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.790
they're not as, they're not doing so well.
They actually missed the fact that they

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:12.150
were on the surface of our skin. But look
at what happened with the E. Coli. These

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:18.460
gloves touched the same number of E.coli
as the bare fingertips did. And you can

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:24.750
see the E.coli survive very, very well
when the gloves are on your hand. So, what

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:29.050
does that mean practically for our
everyday life, thinking about the skin?

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:40.370
Well, it means that gloves protect
bacteria from us. Particularly, bacteria

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:45.810
that cause intestinal diseases. And you
should think about that when you go

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:53.050
through the cafeteria line. So, that's my
segue into some of our research that I

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:57.300
like to talk about, I hope you'll agree
with me, or at least think about the fact

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:01.510
that perhaps how we think about ourselves
as humans shouldn't just be this

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:07.060
antagonistic relationship between us
defending against them. But as you'll hear

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.800
later in the afternoon, there's quite a
bit of information that's coming from the

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:16.170
field of microbiome research that says
that these bacteria that are on us,

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:21.990
perhaps they're not all so bad. And is it
possible that a lot of the skin bacteria

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:28.250
that normally survive on us are not just
bystanders? And what I want to lead to is

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:32.650
to ask you to think about the question,
"Should we really completely rethink

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:37.680
established approaches to the study of
human origin based on these observations

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:42.450
made in the skin?" Classically, we think
about this type of tree of life in

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:48.290
evolution where single-cell organisms
evolved into complex organisms like

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:51.830
humans.
But I propose to you, that perhaps we

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:59.220
should flip this on it's head and think
about it, really, that we have evolved to

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:04.860
serve the master microbes. And we're all
these little different types of organisms,

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:10.810
some dropped off the evolutionary tree,
and some survive. But we're here, in part,

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:15.460
to serve the microbe and perpetuate it's
survival. And I think you would agree that

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:19.880
with the expansion of humans, the
expansion of the microbes that we carry is

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:25.680
going to be just as successful, so it's
good for them, too. So what's the evidence

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:30.670
to support this kind of crazy thinking?
Well, has human skin and microbe really

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:37.470
co-evolved to serve each other? Are the
microbes one of our own cells, not just

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:42.470
something foreign, but is this part of us?
And there's lots of evidence now to

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:48.790
really, I think, very clearly show us that
specific types of bacteria, specific

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:54.090
microbes on the skin are absolutely
essential to human health. How could this

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:58.450
be? Well, one way we understood this is
when we realize that the microbes aren't

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:02.400
just living outside on the surface.
They're not outside the door but they're

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:07.870
really integral in that little piece of
skin that I illustrated to you earlier.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:12.690
This is some work done by a couple of
scientists in my lab over the last few

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:17.340
years showing how microbes are not just at
the surface, and that's these little tiny

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:22.220
purple dots, and the epidermis is the top
layer of the skin. And if you look down in

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:26.830
the hair follicle, you see lots of
microbes, that wasn't such a surprise. But

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:30.880
what was a surprise to us and many others
is that if you look in areas that we

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.990
thought were sterile, even in healthy skin
that hasn't been injured, that's normally

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:41.760
working, there's collections of microbes
that live down amongst our inner fat, in

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:46.080
the tissues between our blood vessels. And
they're there in a place where they could

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:51.910
be interacting with the rest of our body.
One of the ways that microbes benefit us

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:55.320
on our skin can be illustrated by an
experiment just like the one I showed you

00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:00.040
before, but with a little bit of a twist.
So, this is an experiment, again those

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:05.280
three lines are fingertips. And now the
investigator was a graduate student in my

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.830
lab, Anna Cogen, who washed her hands very
carefully of the normal bacteria and

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:14.930
touched a type of bacteria known as Group
A Streptococcus. This is also known as the

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:19.690
flesh-eating bacteria. So normal ones
would be very dangerous. This was a type

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:24.570
of bacteria that we attenuated so it's
relatively safe. Well, why we used these

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:28.230
bacteria is that they are a pathogen, so
they're a foreign bacteria, we don't want

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:33.350
them. And secondly, that they have a
unique capacity to lyse red blood cells.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:38.550
So, you can see them really obviously when
you touch a plate that has blood in it. It

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:44.230
lyses it, that's why it's all clear. So
what happens if she has on her fingertips

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:49.160
not the bad guys, the flesh-eating
bacteria, but these are normal fingertips

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:53.600
colonized with a type of bacteria that you
all have on your skin right now at a

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.680
concentration of somewhere between 10,000
and 100,000 per square centimeter. You

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:04.020
have a lot of these bacteria, known as
Staph.epidermidis, epidermis for the skin.

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:09.000
So these are not disease, this isn't
dirty, this was normal. And if you touch

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.260
this plate with skin that's populated with
those, you can see those bacteria because

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:19.830
they make these little tiny dots here,
shadows. So now, here's the question. What

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:25.980
happens if Anna, instead of washing her
hands really carefully before touching the

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.380
flesh-eating bacteria, just had let the
normal bacteria survive on her skin, the

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:37.170
healthy type of bacteria? Well, this is
what happens. She touched the same amount

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:43.940
of bacteria, it's on the far right here.
But now, in this case with your healthy

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.550
bacteria there, it's fighting, it's
helping you resist the flesh-eating

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:51.870
bacteria. And she'd gone on to actually
identify new antibiotics from these types

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:54.100
of bacteria.
And there are many hundreds of new

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:58.810
antibiotics that can be discovered just
within our own ecosystem, on our surface

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:04.520
of the skin. Another way that bacteria
control us, is they influence how much of

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:08.500
a rash, or how much inflammation you can
have. And this is a very dramatic

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:15.560
experiment, again, using this model of the
skin cartoon that shows if you cut your

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:19.450
skin or scratch your skin, and it's
absolutely sterile and you have no

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:24.500
bacteria on it, the amount of swelling and
redness and scaliness is much, much

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:29.500
greater than if the skin has a normal
microbiome. And you can see that here in

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:36.680
this microscopic image how thick a sterile
wound it as opposed to non-infected but a

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:41.860
normal skin wound with a normal microbial
community. So the microbes are defending

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:45.820
us against flesh-eating bacteria, some
microbes are controlling our immune

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:51.950
system. And this is some very recent work
that we've done to look at a very common

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:56.550
type of disease known as atopic
dermatitis. Here's a picture of a child in

00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:00.350
the corner here on the bottom with a
complication of this disease. It's a type

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:03.920
of eczema and these patients
unfortunately, very often get

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:07.770
Staph.infections, that was that bacteria
that we showed you in the glove

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:12.790
experiment. And when you look at normal
population, this is several thousand

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:19.370
samples, most of the normal bacteria on
healthy individuals produce these

00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:26.230
antibiotics that kill Staphylococcus
disease causing bacteria. But in patients

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:32.060
with eczema, there's very few, actually,
of the normal type of bacteria. They're

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:37.900
displaced by another bacteria. It's
neither disease causing, nor normal. It's

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:43.850
kind of inert. It doesn't do us any good.
And when that happens, these individuals

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:48.120
then start to get Staph.infections.
There's a very, very strict correlation

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.070
between the capacity to get a
Staph.infection and whether or not you

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:55.980
have these bacteria.
So, what can you do with this type of

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:59.920
realization? Well, you can try to help
people, which is ultimately why we do our

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.340
research. And this is showing an
experiment, this is beginning of a large

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:08.540
clinical trial, we're doing a number of
cities. This is now eight patients, but

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:14.140
kind of show you what happens. This is the
average result. And on the blue side is

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:19.000
before treatment. And then amount of
Staph.aureus. And the red side is after

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.430
you put a treatment on. So, first is the
control, you just put a moisturizing cream

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:27.320
on. And you see the amount of the infected
bacteria, if anything it goes up a little

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.610
bit, doesn't really change. And what if
you put one of these inert bacteria like

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:37.420
are found in patients with the disease?
Oh, nothing happens. If you put a cream

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.520
that has those bacteria on it, the
patients stay the same, they still have

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:45.750
less, a lot of Staph.aureus. But now
here's strain two. This is a bacterial

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:51.210
strain from a normal person, that's
transplanted onto the disease skin. And

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:57.470
you can see this bacterial strain just in
a single application causes over 100 fold

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:01.610
decrease in the amount of infectious
bacteria. This has worked actually to

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:05.160
every single patient we tried so far. So
we better stop the study now, right?

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.370
Before we find out it doesn't work. But
we're very excited about it. And I think

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:14.860
it's further showing how some microbes,
not all microbes, are our friends. And

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:20.410
some microbes are clearly our enemies. So,
how should be think about this in this

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:26.000
conference? Well, I'd like to propose to
you the concept of the super organism. We

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.740
probably only inherit, of our total
genetic makeup in our bodies, probably

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:35.170
only about 10% of it really comes from our
parents, because 90% of the organisms that

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:40.260
we carry around from us are microbes. So
that means, when you think about it, most

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:44.060
of the genetic material we're carrying
around, we can exchange. We're not stuck

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:48.240
with the things our parents gave us. We
can exchange bacteria just by shaking

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:55.220
hands. And if anybody is really healthy
here, I'd like to shake hands with you.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.440
And what it really also means of course,
we realize this already, but our

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:03.310
environment can directly influence who we
are. And this now starts to get us to a

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:07.210
molecular and genetic explanation for
something we've observed for a very long

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:11.780
time. Certain environmental situations
affect health and that might be because

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:16.310
those environmental situations are
affecting the health of the cells on us

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:22.100
that are microbes. So with that, I'd like
to suggest that understanding the pro- and

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:28.780
anti-microbial systems of primates and
humans can better define who we are. And

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.996
thank you very much for your time.
