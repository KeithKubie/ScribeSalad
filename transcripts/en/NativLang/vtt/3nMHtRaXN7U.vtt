00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.200
These days. I'm thinking in animating about messages.

2
00:00:03.201 --> 00:00:08.090
We cannot read on cracked codes, if you will. Apparently this topics in the air,

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.040
what with the release of the imitation game this month that films about Alan

4
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.950
Turing and crypt analysis of those German enigma machines during World War II.

5
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.680
I say cryptanalysis and not cryptography or where do you may know better because

6
00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:24.950
cryptography is about sending a message securely by changing it,

7
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.560
often changing it so it looks meaningless.

8
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.790
This is obviously useful when there's a way for the receiver to change it back

9
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.560
and see the original message.

10
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.300
Crypt analysis on the other hand works out ways to understand and break those

11
00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:42.560
systems to understand how the message is being changed by the system so that you

12
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.840
unintended recipient with your prying eyes can read the original message,

13
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.510
but this is all my brother's field.

14
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.390
I should grab him and Youtube can chat about it sometime.

15
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.880
It's all separate from decipherment,

16
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.660
which is an attempt to recover messages in an unknown writing system.

17
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.130
Crypt analysis works with texts that were meant to allude you.

18
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.660
Decipherment works with messages that were once plainly readable but aren't

19
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.150
anymore. Thanks to accidents of history.

20
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.190
So as you'll see in next Friday's video, which contains both hidden codes,

21
00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:21.191
often use characters we recognize to hide a secret message on deciphered scripts

22
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.150
have characters we can't even read or identify that stand between us and a not

23
00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:30.920
so secret or not intentionally secret message. Of course,

24
00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:34.880
there is that Pesky Voynich manuscript, which may be both.

25
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.830
With all this in mind,

26
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.830
you've got a bit of background you appreciate next week's video.

27
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.680
I'd like to take the time to welcome all new subscribers.

28
00:01:42.681 --> 00:01:45.050
You're making it so much fun to talk about language here.

29
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.490
Big smiles for all of you.

30
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.120
And let me know in the comments if you're interested in continuing this topic

31
00:01:50.121 --> 00:01:53.690
with the short series that looks deeper at the decipherment of writing systems

32
00:01:53.691 --> 00:01:54.980
like Egyptian and Myon.
