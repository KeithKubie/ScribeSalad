00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.600
In the last video we
were able to set up

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.080
this definite integral using
the shell or the hollow cylinder

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.280
method in order to
figure out the volume

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.100
of this solid of revolution.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.260
And so now let's just
evaluate this thing.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.250
And really the main
thing we have to do here

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.130
is just to multiply
what we have here out.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.860
So multiply this expression out.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.210
So this is going to be equal
to-- I'll take the 2 pi out

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.260
of the integral.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.614
2 pi times the
integral from 0 to 1.

00:00:26.614 --> 00:00:28.030
Let's see, 2 times
the square root

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.210
of x is 2-- I'll write it
as 2 square roots of x.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.920
But I'll write it
as 2x to the 1/2.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.830
It'll make it a
little bit easier

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.996
to take the antiderivative
conceptually, or at least

00:00:35.996 --> 00:00:36.810
in our brain.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.730
So two times the square
root of x is 2x to the 1/2.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.000
2 times negative x squared
is negative 2 x squared.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.090
And then we have negative x
times the square root of x.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.200
Well, that's x to the
first times x to the 1/2.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.830
That's going to be negative
x to the 3/2 power.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.260
And then we have negative
x times negative x

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.960
squared that's going to be
positive x to the third power.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.420
And all of that dx.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.900
And so now we're ready to
take the antiderivative.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.080
So this is going to be equal to
2 pi times the antiderivative

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.410
of all of this business
evaluated at 1 and at 0.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:21.260
So the antiderivative
of 2 times x to the 1/2

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.600
is going to be 2-- it's
going to be-- let's see.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.950
We're going to take x
to the 3/2 times 2/3.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.120
So it's going to be
4/3 x to the 3/2.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.950
And then for this
term right over here

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.280
it's going to be negative
2/3 x to the third.

00:01:39.357 --> 00:01:40.940
And you could take
the derivative here

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.271
to verify that you
actually do get this.

00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:45.770
And then right over here, let's
see, if we incremented this,

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.680
you get x to the 5/2.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.840
And so we're going to
want to multiply by 2/5.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.726
So minus-- let me do
this in another color.

00:01:55.726 --> 00:01:58.520
Let's see, so this one
right over here, it's

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:05.380
going to be minus 2/5
x to the 5/2 power.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.770
Yep, that works out.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.270
And then finally you're going
to have x to the fourth over 4

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.890
plus-- let me do that
in a different color--

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.390
plus x to the fourth over 4.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.127
That's this term
right over here.

00:02:24.127 --> 00:02:25.960
And now we just have
to evaluate at 1 and 0.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.230
And 0, luckily, all of these
terms end up being a 0.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.450
So that's nice and cancels out.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.661
And so we are just
left with-- we're

00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:34.910
just-- [INAUDIBLE] cancel out.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.030
It just evaluates to 0.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.110
So this is just 2 pi times when
you evaluate all this business

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.100
at 1.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:54.010
So that's going to be 4/3
minus 2/3 minus 2/5 plus 1/4.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.630
And the least common
multiple right over here

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.790
looks like 60, so
we're going to want

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.730
to put all this over
a denominator of 60.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.110
So it's going to be 2 pi
times all of this business

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.570
over a denominator of 60.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:18.060
And 4/3 is same thing as 80/60.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.320
Negative 2/3 is the same
thing as negative 40/60.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.180
Negative 2/5 is the same
thing as negative 24/60.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.700
And then 1/4 is the
same thing as 15/60.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.917
So this is equal to--
and actually this

00:03:33.917 --> 00:03:35.500
will cancel over
here, and you'll just

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.139
get a 30 in your denominator.

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.680
So in your denominator,
you get a 30.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.070
And up here 80 minus 40 is 40.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.275
40 minus 24 gets us to 16.

00:03:46.275 --> 00:03:49.510
16 plus 15 is 31.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.970
So we get 31 times pi
over 30 for the volume

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.170
of the figure right over there.
