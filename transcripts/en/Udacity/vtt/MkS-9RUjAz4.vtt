00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.525
We've talked a lot about working with numbers, how to compute with them, how to

00:00:03.525 --> 00:00:08.205
read them, how to display them, and you're written quite a few programs. But

00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:12.365
there's one important point that I'd like to talk about for a few minutes, and

00:00:12.365 --> 00:00:18.490
that is, first do things by hand before you open the programming environment.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.390
The natural urge of every programmer is to go ahead and open BlueJ, or whatever

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.050
environment you're using, and start typing code. But that's rarely productive.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.764
Let me give you an example problem, and show you how I would work it out by

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:36.240
hand. So, here's the problem. We're supposed to be putting tiles white and red

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.570
ones alternating along a wall, and we are told the total width of the wall. We

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.213
are also told the tile size. The architect tells us, we are suppose to start

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:51.233
and end with the tile of the same color, and the question is how many tiles

00:00:51.233 --> 00:00:57.293
does one need to order? It's pretty clear that you need one more white tile

00:00:57.293 --> 00:01:02.636
than the red tiles. But how many clearly depends on the size of the tiles and

00:01:02.636 --> 00:01:07.547
the total width of the wall. So, let's say that your assignment is to write a

00:01:07.547 --> 00:01:13.040
computer program that helps the builder with this problem. Like I said, this is

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.003
not the time to open your coding environment. Instead, do a couple of these by

00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:21.879
hand first so you get a feel for what the computations really are.
