00:00:00.507 --> 00:00:02.840
SAL: This is Sal again, and
this part four on the series

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.673
that we're doing at
Stanford Medical School,

00:00:04.673 --> 00:00:05.565
with Doctor Connolly.

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:07.689
DR. CONNOLLY: All right
Sal, we're back here again.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:09.620
This is now the
fourth of the slides.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.490
And this would be
now the business

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.980
for why that segment
of colon was removed.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.100
This is the colon cancer.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.760
SAL: Wow, wow.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.550
DR. CONNOLLY: And
so just to orient,

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.840
we'll go now to the drawing.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.810
Which is, like you were
saying before, up here

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.300
this is the lumen.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.800
SAL: Right.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.950
DR. CONNOLLY: Up here.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:28.877
Out here, that's the--

00:00:28.877 --> 00:00:30.460
SAL: Lumen is the
inside of the colon.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.830
DR. CONNOLLY: The inside.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.580
That's the inside.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.990
Out here, this is the
rest of your belly.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.490
SAL: Right.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.198
DR. CONNOLLY: Where
the bowel is all kind

00:00:36.198 --> 00:00:37.820
of rotating around
in the abdomen.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:38.802
And so--

00:00:38.802 --> 00:00:40.760
SAL: Is there a word for
like intra-abdominal--

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.051
DR. CONNOLLY: Yeah, peritoneal.

00:00:42.051 --> 00:00:43.040
SAL: Peritoneal, OK.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.650
DR. CONNOLLY: The
peritoneal cavity

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.120
is where all the bowel loops are
kind of just moseying around.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.090
And then what we
have here is, this

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.850
is an important
part, which is this

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.360
is the muscle that
allows peristalsis.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.800
SAL: Yes, that's the peri-- I
learned that in high school.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.040
That's the kind of moving,
the undulating motion

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.010
to the push stuff.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.760
DR. CONNOLLY: Yep.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.590
It'll go and it'll
sort of milk it along

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.260
in order for the
contents to move along.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.549
So you can see, the muscle
looks all fine there.

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.090
That's how thick
it's supposed to be.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.502
And it all looks fine over here.

00:01:12.502 --> 00:01:14.210
SAL: Just on a scale,
what scale is this?

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.170
Like how thick is that muscle?

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.880
DR. CONNOLLY: So
we're now, once again,

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.500
our tiny little red blood cells
are those little dots there.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.850
SAL: Right.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.080
DR. CONNOLLY: So we're
talking about the thickness

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.227
here as a few millimeters.

00:01:22.227 --> 00:01:24.060
SAL: That muscle is
about a few millimeters.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.726
DR. CONNOLLY: Remember
back to this guy,

00:01:25.726 --> 00:01:27.580
that was about six millimeters.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.760
So that's about six--

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.261
SAL: OK, OK.

00:01:29.261 --> 00:01:30.593
DR. CONNOLLY: Millimeters thick.

00:01:30.593 --> 00:01:31.670
That's actually strong.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.730
That's a very,
very strong muscle.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.590
And you can kind of
see it goes up here,

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.860
it kind of comes
around here, but it's

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.400
looking like it's troubled
all along this area.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.900
SAL: Yes.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.501
And this stuff, all this stuff,
this once was probably a polyp,

00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:47.750
and now it's turned into a
kind of this massive polyp?

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.580
DR. CONNOLLY: Yeah, so we
have the normal over here,

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.780
for the lining.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.190
This is where it's
going dysplastic.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.480
It's looking a
little bit bad there.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.434
There's where it's
going dysplastic.

00:01:59.434 --> 00:02:00.850
And so now what
happens is, you've

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.877
got these edges of dysplasia--

00:02:02.877 --> 00:02:04.960
SAL: When people in the
medical field say plastic,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.280
they're saying, that
word means tissue?

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.780
DR. CONNOLLY: Well plastic in
general, like plastic surgery,

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.180
or the plastics as far
as a material science,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.970
means moldable.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.470
SAL: I see.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.640
DR. CONNOLLY: But it also
means you can grow with it,

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.590
and it can change shape.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.820
SAL: Right.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.080
So when you call something
plastic it's moldable tissue.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.310
DR. CONNOLLY: It's
the shape change.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.740
SAL: It's a shape change.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.239
I see.

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.840
DR. CONNOLLY: And so the
shape changes were wrong.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.490
SAL: I see.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.990
DR. CONNOLLY: And
actually dysplasia

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.620
can refer to a cell, a tissue,
an organ, or an entire limb.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.130
SAL: Oh, OK.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.004
DR. CONNOLLY: So it just
means it grew wrong.

00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:35.560
Or molded wrong.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.090
So now this is where we
have the cell dysplasia.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.790
This is all the bad stuff.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.950
And it basically started
probably somewhere up there,

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.850
and is invading in all
of these directions.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.914
SAL: This one cell
up there just started

00:02:49.914 --> 00:02:50.955
dividing uncontrollably--

00:02:50.955 --> 00:02:51.310
DR. CONNOLLY: That's right.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.230
SAL: And it's descendants.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.310
DR. CONNOLLY: It could
have started from one cell

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.370
being very bad.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.170
It often though starts--
and I'm going to change now,

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.900
so we'll lose our art, and
so what I'm going to do

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.810
is change this-- that
it often starts, though,

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.130
from one of these.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.980
Meaning maybe a cell went
bad right around there.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.707
And now really is
starting to grow.

00:03:10.707 --> 00:03:12.832
SAL: And when you say grow,
it's not just one cell,

00:03:12.832 --> 00:03:14.230
it's all of its descendants.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.521
DR. CONNOLLY: It's descendants.

00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:17.860
And billions of
cells are growing.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.210
Billions and billions
are growing downward

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.520
in order to now, in this case,
grow all the way through.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.280
SAL: Wow.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.950
DR. CONNOLLY: And so you can see
the scale is, it not only grew

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.610
a little bit, it went
right through the muscle.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.990
So going back to this
guy here, this is now--

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.370
SAL: And there
are some, the body

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.100
does have things to fight this
off, but it was unsuccessful.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.350
DR. CONNOLLY: Oh that's right.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.940
And so there are
certain conditions

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.200
where if you decrease the immune
functions, you'll get cancer.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.700
And so it's still argued
though whether it's

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.250
that your immune system is
decreased, you got a virus,

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.320
and then the virus
caused the cancer.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.157
Or whether there's a
lot of surveillance

00:03:57.157 --> 00:03:58.240
there to eliminate cancer.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.656
SAL: And the whole notion that
viruses-- it's fascinating.

00:04:00.656 --> 00:04:03.060
It's because viruses
are messing with our--

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.900
isn't a significant chunk of our
own DNA from ancient viruses?

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.650
DR. CONNOLLY: Yep.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.450
And I think there's a couple
big categories is that viruses

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.260
can get into your DNA and
really screw up the DNA.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.810
Like getting integrated into it.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.649
But they also, like we said
before, can lead to irritation.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:20.055
And then more cell growth
and have trouble there.

00:04:20.055 --> 00:04:20.940
SAL: Makes sense, makes sense.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.481
DR. CONNOLLY: So
now we're back here,

00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:24.970
in which we're
looking at the cancer.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.990
Which probably, like
you said, started here.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.807
And is growing,
including spreading out

00:04:29.807 --> 00:04:31.140
all the normal tissue around it.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.790
SAL: Wow.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.690
DR. CONNOLLY: And so we're
going to look now at the cells.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.460
So zoom in.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.010
Zoom time.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.449
Hang on to your hat.

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.490
OK, so what we're going
to do is first-- probably

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.750
go into a lower power here--
is look at the edges of this.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.970
So once again, we find normal.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.810
And so this is even
not perfectly normal,

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.820
you can see it's a
little bit dividing

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.290
and a little bit irritated.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.170
So this is irritated
along the edge.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.244
SAL: Hyperplasia.

00:04:55.244 --> 00:04:56.160
DR. CONNOLLY: Exactly.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.140
SAL: I'm like, I'm
learning something.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.460
DR. CONNOLLY: All right.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.610
So then what we have now
is, as you go in deeper,

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.380
these are the areas
which are normal,

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.345
but this is all
kind of coming out.

00:05:05.345 --> 00:05:06.720
Like we were saying
up here, kind

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.690
of growing out in
all directions.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.720
This is now where you can see
the cancer, next to the normal.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.720
You know we had talked
before about dysplasia.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.034
This is really bad.

00:05:15.034 --> 00:05:15.950
SAL: With a capital B.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:16.700
DR. CONNOLLY: Yep.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.159
Small children off
the street could

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:19.700
be able to tell you
that this is bad.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.260
SAL: Right.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.020
After they watch this video.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.250
DR. CONNOLLY: Exactly.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.840
And so these are
the normal ones.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.670
They're doing their J-O-B job.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.090
Making the mucin,
nuclei at the bottom.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.180
What is this guy doing?

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.220
It's just chaos.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.700
So before we talk
about carcinoma

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.350
in situ, a cancer in spot.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.557
If you saw cells this bad, you'd
say do not let them go far.

00:05:40.557 --> 00:05:42.390
Because they will have
a tendency to invade.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.810
They're crazy.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.980
So this right here's a
bunch of the cells, that's

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.290
a bunch of the cells,
they're these guys here.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.080
You can see they're really
haphazard, they're growing,

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.550
they're not doing their--

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.360
SAL: So if we found a polyp
that had this stuff that

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.870
didn't cross that boundary line
yet, we still would say no,

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.790
we've got to take this-- Well
I guess we already took it out.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:03.998
DR. CONNOLLY: We took it out.

00:06:03.998 --> 00:06:06.440
So cancer of the colon
is one of the ones where

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.550
surgical cure is
still a classic.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.790
Cut it out, and you're
probably in pretty good shape.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:11.900
And so there you'd
say, well if it's

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.320
the tip of the polyp
that looked like this,

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.470
I think we got it out.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.350
But you'd say to yourself,
we better watch this person.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.760
SAL: I see.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.635
So if the whole polyp
kind of looked like that,

00:06:18.635 --> 00:06:20.060
you're like, oh let's
cut out a bigger section.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.780
DR. CONNOLLY: Yeah
then you might.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.380
So if it's going
down into the neck,

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.088
or getting a little
further, or if you've

00:06:24.088 --> 00:06:26.240
cut across it at the
margin, then watch out.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.630
But here's the problem.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.520
Is remember how I said up
here it's not a big deal,

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.180
but once you get down near
the veins and arteries?

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.171
These guys are running amok
down by the veins, the arteries.

00:06:37.171 --> 00:06:39.670
SAL: And so you can actually
see these cells have split off.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:40.730
And they're infiltrating.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.880
Wow.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.370
DR. CONNOLLY: So you
can see these guys here.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.920
So that's one little
nest of cells.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.300
There's one.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.290
That's probably, right
there, a cancer cell

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.364
just dying to get
into that little vein.

00:06:49.364 --> 00:06:51.780
SAL: So this is actually, I
can never say the word, meta--

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:52.340
DR. CONNOLLY: Metastasis.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:52.840
SAL: This is it.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.580
We're seeing it.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.640
DR. CONNOLLY: This is
where it would come from.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.730
SAL: This is where it's
starting to happen.

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.688
DR. CONNOLLY: So these
guys are the bad actors.

00:06:57.688 --> 00:07:00.860
They're growing in next to
these very fragile little blood

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.280
vessels, and so that guy
is knocking on the door.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.380
Once he gets in here, that's a
venule, meaning a little vein.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.340
That's the road out.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:08.600
SAL: Right.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.275
And it just looks like a
circle here because it's

00:07:10.275 --> 00:07:11.710
a two-dimensional
cross-section of it,

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.770
but you can imagine it popping
in and out of our screen.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:13.970
DR. CONNOLLY: Yes.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:14.800
It would be popping in
and out of our screen.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.740
So this guy would kind of
go in and out of the screen,

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.880
connect to this one, and
then it would go out.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.463
SAL: And it's
officially-- I can never

00:07:20.463 --> 00:07:22.400
say the word--
metastasized once it's

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.835
found a beachhead
someplace else?

00:07:23.835 --> 00:07:24.960
DR. CONNOLLY: That's right.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.030
So it's considered
a metastasis where,

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.710
let's say, the cell got into the
vessel, if it left the region.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.260
So it went to the
lung, the liver.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.930
This is looking
like you really are

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.490
worried that this
could metastasize.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:36.800
SAL: Right.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.424
DR. CONNOLLY: And so
what's interesting

00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:40.910
about this is that when you
look at something like this,

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.065
there's such a thing
called, for cancer, grade.

00:07:44.065 --> 00:07:45.690
And what grade is,
is basically what we

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.520
we've been just talking
about, how bad does that look?

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.190
SAL: Right.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.780
DR. CONNOLLY: And so the grade
is, wow, that looks nasty.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:51.420
I think that--

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.866
SAL: Is nasty a technical term?

00:07:52.866 --> 00:07:54.740
DR. CONNOLLY: Actually
we use it quite a bit.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:55.810
Some people say, oh what
did that tumor show?

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:56.840
We say it was nasty.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.850
When we talk about nastiness,
it's a lack of behavior.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.800
If you can get a cell where
the nucleus gets that big,

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.010
or sometimes it's that
big, there's chaos.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.140
And there's chaos not
just in nuclear size,

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:08.985
but how it behaves.

00:08:08.985 --> 00:08:10.360
SAL: And I guess
the nuclear size

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.390
is a telltale, because that
means that the cell is devoting

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.602
a lot of its resources
for replication and--

00:08:15.602 --> 00:08:17.060
DR. CONNOLLY: It's
for replication,

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.660
but it also means, to me, that
normally things in the cellar

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:20.850
are very orderly.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:24.310
You do not divide your DNA
until these things are already

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:24.980
[INAUDIBLE].

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.040
And now it's just
left and right.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.010
So yeah, this would
be a high grade tumor.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.990
And then stage is
the other main thing.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.240
SAL: Yes, I've heard of stage.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.960
DR. CONNOLLY: Stage means,
where is it in the body?

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:41.770
So in this case, if it's these
nasty cells at the very top,

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.960
it's actually a lower stage
then if they're nasty cells

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.960
and they've come all
the way down here.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.622
SAL: So in situ carcinoma
would still get a stage.

00:08:49.622 --> 00:08:50.830
DR. CONNOLLY: It's a stage 0.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:51.660
SAL: Stage 0.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.760
DR. CONNOLLY: So it's
basically you're nowhere.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.870
And then if you begin to
just cross over, like here,

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.830
and invade, then
you're in stage 1.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.980
And then there are depths
as you go for stages.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.720
And then there's
always the other thing,

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.160
where did it go off to
other parts of your body.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.780
And that's the
very highest stage.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.490
SAL: And so this
isn't a-- and this

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:10.500
is true of all cancers, when
people about breast cancer,

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.000
I've heard it in
that context a lot.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.520
Stage 1, or stage 0 through 4.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.740
So it isn't just the size.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:20.700
If the cancerous tissue is big,
but if it's in a safe place,

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.317
it could still be
stage 1 or stage 0.

00:09:22.317 --> 00:09:23.150
DR. CONNOLLY: It is.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.060
What's interesting about staging
is almost the whole world

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.490
has agreed to do the
same kind of staging.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:34.750
And that staging is
what we're calling TNM.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:38.390
And T has to do with how
big it is, and the one site,

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.280
and how much it's
crossed any barriers.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:40.780
SAL: Right.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.700
But the barrier crossing sounds
like the most important thing.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.616
DR. CONNOLLY: It does.

00:09:43.616 --> 00:09:45.800
Although this one here is,
are they in lymph nodes?

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.530
SAL: Oh, right.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:47.905
DR. CONNOLLY: And
the lymph nodes

00:09:47.905 --> 00:09:50.020
are nearby structures
where the lymph goes.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.960
And so that's one road out.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.170
And the other one is metastases.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.260
And so yeah, the staging
has to do with all three.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:57.970
SAL: I see.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.917
And metastases always
happens through

00:09:59.917 --> 00:10:02.250
the circulatory system--
Through the blood, the vessels?

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:04.000
Or does it also happen
through the lymph network?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.980
DR. CONNOLLY: And
so it's something

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.690
where going through the lymph
nodes, for something like this,

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.290
is one of the first steps.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.500
But getting to the
liver and the lung,

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.290
it's got to get into the
blood vessels somehow.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:17.850
The lymphatic in your colon
connects to a local lymph node,

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.300
but does not connect through
lymph only to the lung.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:20.800
SAL: I see.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.350
DR. CONNOLLY: So it must have
gone into the blood somewhere.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:25.530
So that's the way it looks here.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:28.110
And then the final thing here,
when looking at this cancer,

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:33.410
is if we go over here, this is
the greatest depth of invasion.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.060
You had asked me about the
body's immune function.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.600
Well if you look here, now
you see how it's kind of loose

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.434
and there are all these
little immune cells?

00:10:41.434 --> 00:10:42.558
That's what these guys are.

00:10:42.558 --> 00:10:43.150
Those are--

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:43.740
SAL: What's the immune cell?

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.460
DR. CONNOLLY: These guys here.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.549
See the little round guys?

00:10:45.549 --> 00:10:46.465
Those are lymphocytes.

00:10:46.465 --> 00:10:46.965
SAL: I see.

00:10:46.965 --> 00:10:49.030
I should circle it, actually.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.610
How can you tell the difference
between the lymphocytes

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.030
and the cancer cells?

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.880
DR. CONNOLLY: That's
because I'm a pathologist.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.130
SAL: That's because you've
had many years of training.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.296
DR. CONNOLLY: No, but they're
the little round ones.

00:10:58.296 --> 00:11:00.140
So this one right here
is a classic cell,

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.510
which is called a plasma
cell, in which there's

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.532
a nucleus here, and all the rest
of this is making antibodies.

00:11:05.532 --> 00:11:06.990
SAL: You're not
circling that area?

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:08.480
DR. CONNOLLY: No,
I'm just drawing.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:08.585
SAL: Oh, OK.

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:09.418
You're just drawing.

00:11:09.418 --> 00:11:11.320
DR. CONNOLLY: So
this guy is this one.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.070
I drew him right--

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:13.640
SAL: OK, you're
zooming in on this.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.420
DR. CONNOLLY: Yeah,
zooming in on that.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.420
So yeah, that's a plasma
cell, meaning it's a nucleus--

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:18.760
SAL: I just want to clarify,
what you've circled there,

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.759
just because it could be
a little bit confusing,

00:11:20.759 --> 00:11:22.940
but we have this big circle
is maybe we [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.060
DR. CONNOLLY: This is why I
should leave it to the pros.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.720
SAL: No, just because
I'm getting confused.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.060
You're not circling that area.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:27.930
DR. CONNOLLY: No, no,
I'm not doing that.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:29.940
SAL: You were just showing
what it looks like zoomed in.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.505
DR. CONNOLLY: Right, so
that's a plasma cell.

00:11:31.505 --> 00:11:32.730
SAL: That's a plasma cell.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:34.729
DR. CONNOLLY: That's
making antibodies, probably

00:11:34.729 --> 00:11:35.700
against the tumor.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.797
And so that's the immune
response in that spot.

00:11:38.797 --> 00:11:40.880
SAL: And how do you know
that's-- That looked very

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.022
similar to the
cancerous cells to me.

00:11:43.022 --> 00:11:44.980
DR. CONNOLLY: This one's
a little hard to tell.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.410
And if you had a real microscope
you'd turn up the light.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:50.260
And we'd have a very
specific look to the nucleus.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.615
And then these guys over here
have little pink granules

00:11:52.615 --> 00:11:56.080
in them, which is a
type of immune cell.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.767
And so when looking
through here--

00:11:57.767 --> 00:11:59.850
SAL: On this depth, which
ones are cancerous here?

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:02.240
DR. CONNOLLY: OK, so now
let me just get over here,

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.820
to this one here, and then
come out just a little bit.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.880
Let me go over here.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.360
Is that when looking
at these guys,

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.760
these are all inflammation.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.310
The nearest cancer cell
where I could bet the farm

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:14.270
are these guys up here.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:14.690
SAL: Oh, OK.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:16.620
See, when you see on this
view it becomes more obvious.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:17.560
They definitely look different.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.210
DR. CONNOLLY: They
look different.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.330
And so then when you come
out here, you can see,

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:21.650
there's the cancer.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.160
This is the body's reaction
to the cancer right there.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:24.940
SAL: I see.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.490
DR. CONNOLLY: At
the deepest zone.

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:28.180
And there are therapies
based on trying

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.420
to get more of this
immune response.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.910
SAL: That's amazing.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.700
Very cool.
