okay we'll talk about systems of linear

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:08.520
okay we'll talk about systems of linear
 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:17.710
okay we'll talk about systems of linear
equations now remember that an equation

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720
equations now remember that an equation
 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:27.019
equations now remember that an equation
is the application of a rule so every

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029
is the application of a rule so every
 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.429
is the application of a rule so every
pair of numbers which satisfies that

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439
pair of numbers which satisfies that
 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.640
pair of numbers which satisfies that
equation satisfies the rule the

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650
equation satisfies the rule the
 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.220
equation satisfies the rule the
underlying function now you may well

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230
underlying function now you may well
 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.850
underlying function now you may well
have many different rules you may have

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860
have many different rules you may have
 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.770
have many different rules you may have
therefore many different conditions that

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780
therefore many different conditions that
 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.569
therefore many different conditions that
have to be satisfied and it's precisely

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579
have to be satisfied and it's precisely
 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.790
have to be satisfied and it's precisely
in analyzing problems with many

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800
in analyzing problems with many
 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.639
in analyzing problems with many
different rules that need to be

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649
different rules that need to be
 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:04.010
different rules that need to be
simultaneously satisfied that we use

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020
simultaneously satisfied that we use
 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.990
simultaneously satisfied that we use
systems of linear equations or

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000
systems of linear equations or
 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.039
systems of linear equations or
simultaneous equations actually systems

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049
simultaneous equations actually systems
 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.609
simultaneous equations actually systems
of equations they may not be linear

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619
of equations they may not be linear
 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.910
of equations they may not be linear
today we'll just talk about linear ones

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920
today we'll just talk about linear ones
 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.910
today we'll just talk about linear ones
okay so here we've got two equations y

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920
okay so here we've got two equations y
 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.530
okay so here we've got two equations y
equals 4x minus 14 and y equals x plus 5

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540
equals 4x minus 14 and y equals x plus 5
 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.480
equals 4x minus 14 and y equals x plus 5
I guess these are the equations we just

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490
I guess these are the equations we just
 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:37.210
I guess these are the equations we just
worked out solving this set of equations

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220
worked out solving this set of equations
 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.770
worked out solving this set of equations
we're just going to do an example with

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780
we're just going to do an example with
 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.950
we're just going to do an example with
two but there could be any number of any

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960
two but there could be any number of any
 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.350
two but there could be any number of any
finite number of equations that we might

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360
finite number of equations that we might
 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.149
finite number of equations that we might
need to solve solving means finding the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159
need to solve solving means finding the
 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.780
need to solve solving means finding the
values of X&amp;Y that's the pair of x and y

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790
values of X&amp;Y that's the pair of x and y
 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.130
values of X&amp;Y that's the pair of x and y
such that both equations are valid okay

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140
 
 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.720
 
so

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730
 
 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.090
 
when we're talking about linear

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100
when we're talking about linear
 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.740
when we're talking about linear
equations there are just three

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750
equations there are just three
 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.350
equations there are just three
possibilities that is there's a unique

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360
possibilities that is there's a unique
 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.910
possibilities that is there's a unique
solution when we're talking about linear

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920
solution when we're talking about linear
 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.520
solution when we're talking about linear
equations and we're only talking about

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530
equations and we're only talking about
 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.270
equations and we're only talking about
two equations no more than two then

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280
two equations no more than two then
 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.430
two equations no more than two then
there's either a unique solution that is

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440
there's either a unique solution that is
 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.730
there's either a unique solution that is
the two lines cross at exactly one point

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740
the two lines cross at exactly one point
 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.650
the two lines cross at exactly one point
because their linear they can only cross

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660
because their linear they can only cross
 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.240
because their linear they can only cross
once it's possible that they never cross

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250
once it's possible that they never cross
 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.850
once it's possible that they never cross
and why why might that be the case why

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860
and why why might that be the case why
 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.650
and why why might that be the case why
might they never cross yes what's your

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660
might they never cross yes what's your
 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.100
might they never cross yes what's your
name same slope same slope so they would

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110
name same slope same slope so they would
 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.940
name same slope same slope so they would
be parallel lines or there are

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950
be parallel lines or there are
 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.700
be parallel lines or there are
infinitely many solutions that is the

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710
infinitely many solutions that is the
 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.550
infinitely many solutions that is the
two lines happen to be exactly the same

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560
two lines happen to be exactly the same
 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.640
two lines happen to be exactly the same
they coincide it may not be obvious when

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650
they coincide it may not be obvious when
 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.830
they coincide it may not be obvious when
you look at the equations that they are

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840
you look at the equations that they are
 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.710
you look at the equations that they are
the same but when you plot out their

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720
the same but when you plot out their
 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.680
the same but when you plot out their
graphs you realize that they are the

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690
graphs you realize that they are the
 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:21.449
graphs you realize that they are the
same ok so the happy situation where you

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459
same ok so the happy situation where you
 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:27.479
same ok so the happy situation where you
have two equations that cross once with

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489
have two equations that cross once with
 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.729
have two equations that cross once with
a particular solution let's say the

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739
a particular solution let's say the
 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:41.880
a particular solution let's say the
solution is X star and y star X star

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890
solution is X star and y star X star
 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.270
solution is X star and y star X star
refers to a particular value of x y star

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280
refers to a particular value of x y star
 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.090
refers to a particular value of x y star
refers to a particular value of y ok ok

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100
refers to a particular value of y ok ok
 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.640
refers to a particular value of y ok ok
this is generally the kind of problem

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650
this is generally the kind of problem
 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.940
this is generally the kind of problem
we're trying to solve ok the graphical

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950
we're trying to solve ok the graphical
 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.540
we're trying to solve ok the graphical
method of solving works only when there

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550
method of solving works only when there
 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.360
method of solving works only when there
are two unknowns so and therefore two

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370
are two unknowns so and therefore two
 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.560
are two unknowns so and therefore two
equations you simply graph the two

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570
equations you simply graph the two
 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.260
equations you simply graph the two
equations the same way that we've done

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270
equations the same way that we've done
 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.720
equations the same way that we've done
so far and you look for the values of

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730
so far and you look for the values of
 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.520
so far and you look for the values of
X&amp;Y where they intercept so

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530
X&amp;Y where they intercept so
 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.190
X&amp;Y where they intercept so
x star and y star this is the point of

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200
x star and y star this is the point of
 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.720
x star and y star this is the point of
intersection and here is the solution

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730
intersection and here is the solution
 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.420
intersection and here is the solution
for the two graphs that we just worked

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430
for the two graphs that we just worked
 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:41.000
for the two graphs that we just worked
out in the previous section okay okay of

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010
out in the previous section okay okay of
 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.159
out in the previous section okay okay of
course it's not convenient to always use

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169
course it's not convenient to always use
 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.460
course it's not convenient to always use
the graphical method so you might need

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470
the graphical method so you might need
 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.390
the graphical method so you might need
to substitute and so the way the

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400
to substitute and so the way the
 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.870
to substitute and so the way the
substitution method is is really a

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880
substitution method is is really a
 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.140
substitution method is is really a
process of illumination what you do is

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150
process of illumination what you do is
 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.950
process of illumination what you do is
you solve one of the equations so that

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960
you solve one of the equations so that
 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.880
you solve one of the equations so that
you have either X or Y alone on one side

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890
you have either X or Y alone on one side
 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:16.370
you have either X or Y alone on one side
so you're expressing X in terms of the

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380
so you're expressing X in terms of the
 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.010
so you're expressing X in terms of the
other variable Y or Y in terms of the

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020
other variable Y or Y in terms of the
 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.290
other variable Y or Y in terms of the
other variable X and then you substitute

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300
other variable X and then you substitute
 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.760
other variable X and then you substitute
that expression for X into your

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770
that expression for X into your
 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.940
that expression for X into your
remaining equation so that you end up

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950
remaining equation so that you end up
 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.840
remaining equation so that you end up
with one equation in one unknown and you

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850
with one equation in one unknown and you
 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.700
with one equation in one unknown and you
all know how to solve that algebraically

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710
all know how to solve that algebraically
 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.090
all know how to solve that algebraically
so a common technique in mathematics as

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100
so a common technique in mathematics as
 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.120
so a common technique in mathematics as
always to take a complex problem and to

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130
always to take a complex problem and to
 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.670
always to take a complex problem and to
reduce its complexity by one level and

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680
reduce its complexity by one level and
 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.620
reduce its complexity by one level and
then to take that simplified problem and

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630
then to take that simplified problem and
 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.779
then to take that simplified problem and
reduce the complexity by one level and

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789
reduce the complexity by one level and
 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.560
reduce the complexity by one level and
so on by a process of iteration okay two

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570
so on by a process of iteration okay two
 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.750
so on by a process of iteration okay two
thousand years ago people took a

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760
thousand years ago people took a
 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.330
thousand years ago people took a
lifetime to do this sort of thing

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340
lifetime to do this sort of thing
 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.360
lifetime to do this sort of thing
nowadays we have Excel or or MATLAB or

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370
nowadays we have Excel or or MATLAB or
 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:12.610
nowadays we have Excel or or MATLAB or
or other other iterative programs okay

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620
 
 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:18.440
 
okay so here we are simply trying to

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450
okay so here we are simply trying to
 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:24.380
okay so here we are simply trying to
solve the two equations these two

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.390
solve the two equations these two
 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.969
solve the two equations these two
equations this one and that one via the

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979
equations this one and that one via the
 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:30.750
equations this one and that one via the
substitution method

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760
substitution method
 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:38.340
substitution method
okay so we've got y equals 4x minus 14

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350
okay so we've got y equals 4x minus 14
 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.110
okay so we've got y equals 4x minus 14
we actually don't need to do anything

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120
we actually don't need to do anything
 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.570
we actually don't need to do anything
here because we've got y expressed in

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.580
here because we've got y expressed in
 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.330
here because we've got y expressed in
terms of X there's no y on the

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.340
terms of X there's no y on the
 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.930
terms of X there's no y on the
right-hand side so we could simply take

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940
right-hand side so we could simply take
 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:55.900
right-hand side so we could simply take
this expression and substitute it into

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:55.910
this expression and substitute it into
 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.770
this expression and substitute it into
the other equation the other equation is

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780
the other equation the other equation is
 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:05.529
the other equation the other equation is
y equals x plus 5 so instead of why i

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:05.539
y equals x plus 5 so instead of why i
 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:09.070
y equals x plus 5 so instead of why i
have here for x minus 14 the reason we

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.080
have here for x minus 14 the reason we
 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.689
have here for x minus 14 the reason we
put the star here is to indicate that

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:12.699
put the star here is to indicate that
 

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:16.450
put the star here is to indicate that
this equality only holds for a

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:16.460
this equality only holds for a
 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.950
this equality only holds for a
particular value of x which satisfies

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960
particular value of x which satisfies
 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.870
particular value of x which satisfies
both equations ie this X star here right

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:24.880
both equations ie this X star here right
 

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.580
both equations ie this X star here right
so here I'm solving for a particular

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:27.590
so here I'm solving for a particular
 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.750
so here I'm solving for a particular
value of x which is called X star and I

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:31.760
value of x which is called X star and I
 

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.480
value of x which is called X star and I
just algebraically manipulate till i get

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:34.490
just algebraically manipulate till i get
 

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:39.279
just algebraically manipulate till i get
x star is equal to six and a third okay

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:39.289
x star is equal to six and a third okay
 

00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:43.930
x star is equal to six and a third okay
and then i could substitute x star back

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:43.940
and then i could substitute x star back
 

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.659
and then i could substitute x star back
into either into this equation or that

00:07:46.659 --> 00:07:46.669
into either into this equation or that
 

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:50.850
into either into this equation or that
equation to get what why start so let's

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:50.860
equation to get what why start so let's
 

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.940
equation to get what why start so let's
let's do a quick application quick and

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:54.950
let's do a quick application quick and
 

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.339
let's do a quick application quick and
simple application and then we'll talk

00:07:57.339 --> 00:07:57.349
simple application and then we'll talk
 

00:07:57.349 --> 00:07:59.860
simple application and then we'll talk
about more interesting things okay so a

00:07:59.860 --> 00:07:59.870
about more interesting things okay so a
 

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:05.650
about more interesting things okay so a
very common problem is is supply and

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:05.660
very common problem is is supply and
 

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.689
very common problem is is supply and
demand in economics we very often

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:09.699
demand in economics we very often
 

00:08:09.699 --> 00:08:20.860
demand in economics we very often
describe the quantity supplied and the

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:20.870
describe the quantity supplied and the
 

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.980
describe the quantity supplied and the
quantity demanded in a marketplace as a

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:23.990
quantity demanded in a marketplace as a
 

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.939
quantity demanded in a marketplace as a
function of price price is the

00:08:27.939 --> 00:08:27.949
function of price price is the
 

00:08:27.949 --> 00:08:30.129
function of price price is the
independent variable the input variable

00:08:30.129 --> 00:08:30.139
independent variable the input variable
 

00:08:30.139 --> 00:08:32.500
independent variable the input variable
and quantity demanded or quantity

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:32.510
and quantity demanded or quantity
 

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:35.680
and quantity demanded or quantity
supplied is the dependent variable the

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:35.690
supplied is the dependent variable the
 

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:38.880
supplied is the dependent variable the
output variable now so far this is a

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:38.890
output variable now so far this is a
 

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:42.850
output variable now so far this is a
quick that you should get used to so far

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:42.860
quick that you should get used to so far
 

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.590
quick that you should get used to so far
i have always display

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:44.600
i have always display
 

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:51.069
i have always display
why on the vertical axis and X on the on

00:08:51.069 --> 00:08:51.079
why on the vertical axis and X on the on
 

00:08:51.079 --> 00:08:54.189
why on the vertical axis and X on the on
the horizontal axis and X was the input

00:08:54.189 --> 00:08:54.199
the horizontal axis and X was the input
 

00:08:54.199 --> 00:08:58.269
the horizontal axis and X was the input
variable and why was the output variable

00:08:58.269 --> 00:08:58.279
variable and why was the output variable
 

00:08:58.279 --> 00:09:02.170
variable and why was the output variable
for historical reasons economists have

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:02.180
for historical reasons economists have
 

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:07.420
for historical reasons economists have
always shown price on the vertical axis

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:07.430
always shown price on the vertical axis
 

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:11.129
always shown price on the vertical axis
even though it is the input variable and

00:09:11.129 --> 00:09:11.139
even though it is the input variable and
 

00:09:11.139 --> 00:09:14.949
even though it is the input variable and
quantity on the horizontal axis even

00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:14.959
quantity on the horizontal axis even
 

00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:17.559
quantity on the horizontal axis even
though quantity is actually the output

00:09:17.559 --> 00:09:17.569
though quantity is actually the output
 

00:09:17.569 --> 00:09:22.300
though quantity is actually the output
variable okay so generally all supply

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:22.310
variable okay so generally all supply
 

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:42.400
variable okay so generally all supply
and demand curves that you will see

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:42.410
 
 

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:47.189
 
look like this this is a demand curve

00:09:47.189 --> 00:09:47.199
look like this this is a demand curve
 

00:09:47.199 --> 00:09:53.379
look like this this is a demand curve
this is a supply curve and price is

00:09:53.379 --> 00:09:53.389
this is a supply curve and price is
 

00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:55.150
this is a supply curve and price is
actually the independent variable and

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:55.160
actually the independent variable and
 

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.420
actually the independent variable and
quantity demanded or supplied as a

00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:58.430
quantity demanded or supplied as a
 

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.100
quantity demanded or supplied as a
function of price is the dependent

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:00.110
function of price is the dependent
 

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:10.869
function of price is the dependent
variable okay so that's why the way this

00:10:10.869 --> 00:10:10.879
variable okay so that's why the way this
 

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:17.889
variable okay so that's why the way this
is the way this is shown the way I've

00:10:17.889 --> 00:10:17.899
is the way this is shown the way I've
 

00:10:17.899 --> 00:10:23.850
is the way this is shown the way I've
expressed this queue as a function of P

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:23.860
 
 

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.350
 
shows the underlying functional

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:26.360
shows the underlying functional
 

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:32.610
shows the underlying functional
relationship but Q is not on the y-axis

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:32.620
 
 

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:38.340
 
okay this is just a quick that sadly

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:38.350
okay this is just a quick that sadly
 

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:42.040
okay this is just a quick that sadly
creates all sorts of confusion so it's

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:42.050
creates all sorts of confusion so it's
 

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:46.809
creates all sorts of confusion so it's
just something to watch out for okay so

00:10:46.809 --> 00:10:46.819
just something to watch out for okay so
 

00:10:46.819 --> 00:10:53.040
just something to watch out for okay so
here suppose that we have a demand curve

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:53.050
 
 

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.050
 
quantity demanded is equal to 300 minus

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:56.060
quantity demanded is equal to 300 minus
 

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.679
quantity demanded is equal to 300 minus
6 p and quantity supplied is equal to

00:10:59.679 --> 00:10:59.689
6 p and quantity supplied is equal to
 

00:10:59.689 --> 00:11:04.360
6 p and quantity supplied is equal to
quarter p okay all the intuition that I

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:04.370
quarter p okay all the intuition that I
 

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:08.079
quarter p okay all the intuition that I
gave you earlier about a steep slope and

00:11:08.079 --> 00:11:08.089
gave you earlier about a steep slope and
 

00:11:08.089 --> 00:11:11.860
gave you earlier about a steep slope and
a shallow slope has to get reversed

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:11.870
a shallow slope has to get reversed
 

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.689
a shallow slope has to get reversed
because of this problem because this

00:11:13.689 --> 00:11:13.699
because of this problem because this
 

00:11:13.699 --> 00:11:16.929
because of this problem because this
really is a mirror image or

00:11:16.929 --> 00:11:16.939
really is a mirror image or
 

00:11:16.939 --> 00:11:23.980
really is a mirror image or
transformation so look at this this is

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:23.990
transformation so look at this this is
 

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:28.990
transformation so look at this this is
minus 6 p it would look like a large a

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:29.000
minus 6 p it would look like a large a
 

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.069
minus 6 p it would look like a large a
very steep negative slope but when you

00:11:33.069 --> 00:11:33.079
very steep negative slope but when you
 

00:11:33.079 --> 00:11:36.670
very steep negative slope but when you
draw it because the axes are reversed it

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:36.680
draw it because the axes are reversed it
 

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:40.259
draw it because the axes are reversed it
will look like a shallow negative slope

00:11:40.259 --> 00:11:40.269
will look like a shallow negative slope
 

00:11:40.269 --> 00:11:49.420
will look like a shallow negative slope
okay okay so when you try to when you

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:49.430
okay okay so when you try to when you
 

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:53.319
okay okay so when you try to when you
try to solve this you won't have to

00:11:53.319 --> 00:11:53.329
try to solve this you won't have to
 

00:11:53.329 --> 00:11:54.510
try to solve this you won't have to
worry about that you

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:54.520
worry about that you
 

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.470
worry about that you
have to worry about the geometric

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480
have to worry about the geometric
 

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:02.490
have to worry about the geometric
intuition you simply carry out the

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:02.500
intuition you simply carry out the
 

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.470
intuition you simply carry out the
process of substitution that which we

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:04.480
process of substitution that which we
 

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:11.880
process of substitution that which we
talked about earlier okay so okay so

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:11.890
talked about earlier okay so okay so
 

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:15.810
talked about earlier okay so okay so
let's see so suppose that we have this

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:15.820
let's see so suppose that we have this
 

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.910
let's see so suppose that we have this
demand function in this supply function

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:17.920
demand function in this supply function
 

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.710
demand function in this supply function
and we want to find the point of

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:19.720
and we want to find the point of
 

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:25.100
and we want to find the point of
equilibrium well we can simply set the

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:25.110
equilibrium well we can simply set the
 

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:28.260
equilibrium well we can simply set the
demand function equal to the supply

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:28.270
demand function equal to the supply
 

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:33.660
demand function equal to the supply
function q d equals Q s and solve for P

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:33.670
function q d equals Q s and solve for P
 

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:38.130
function q d equals Q s and solve for P
or are the P star we get a value for P

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:38.140
or are the P star we get a value for P
 

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:46.350
or are the P star we get a value for P
or 48 a value for Q of 12 and we don't

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:46.360
or 48 a value for Q of 12 and we don't
 

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.300
or 48 a value for Q of 12 and we don't
we don't have to worry about what what

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:48.310
we don't have to worry about what what
 

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:52.860
we don't have to worry about what what
that looks like okay so yes any

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:52.870
that looks like okay so yes any
 

00:12:52.870 --> 00:13:01.830
that looks like okay so yes any
questions no okay good ok I think we're

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:01.840
questions no okay good ok I think we're
 

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.950
questions no okay good ok I think we're
doing very well here so we're probably

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:04.960
doing very well here so we're probably
 

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.950
doing very well here so we're probably
going to finish early we have we're

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:07.960
going to finish early we have we're
 

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.870
going to finish early we have we're
going to talk about nonlinear functions

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:09.880
going to talk about nonlinear functions
 

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:17.820
going to talk about nonlinear functions
and okay so this is a repetition of a

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:17.830
and okay so this is a repetition of a
 

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:22.140
and okay so this is a repetition of a
slide from earlier on by definition a

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:22.150
slide from earlier on by definition a
 

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:24.240
slide from earlier on by definition a
nonlinear function is one whose slope

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:24.250
nonlinear function is one whose slope
 

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:28.650
nonlinear function is one whose slope
changes for different values of x by

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:28.660
changes for different values of x by
 

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.660
changes for different values of x by
definition linear function is one whose

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:30.670
definition linear function is one whose
 

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:34.080
definition linear function is one whose
slope is constant okay so this is a

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:34.090
slope is constant okay so this is a
 

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:36.600
slope is constant okay so this is a
nonlinear function this is a linear

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:36.610
nonlinear function this is a linear
 

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:44.700
nonlinear function this is a linear
function okay now in nonlinear functions

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:44.710
function okay now in nonlinear functions
 

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:50.850
function okay now in nonlinear functions
the slope is constantly changing and in

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:50.860
the slope is constantly changing and in
 

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:57.230
the slope is constantly changing and in
order to carry out analyses about

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240
order to carry out analyses about
 

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.880
order to carry out analyses about
nonlinear functions which have

00:13:59.880 --> 00:13:59.890
nonlinear functions which have
 

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:04.290
nonlinear functions which have
constantly changing slopes we could

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:04.300
constantly changing slopes we could
 

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.560
constantly changing slopes we could
simply do graphical analysis we could

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:07.570
simply do graphical analysis we could
 

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:08.540
simply do graphical analysis we could
simply if we

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:08.550
simply if we
 

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:11.329
simply if we
new the equation of the nonlinear

00:14:11.329 --> 00:14:11.339
new the equation of the nonlinear
 

00:14:11.339 --> 00:14:14.420
new the equation of the nonlinear
function we could draw a graph we could

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:14.430
function we could draw a graph we could
 

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:17.150
function we could draw a graph we could
plot a graph and find out its behavior

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:17.160
plot a graph and find out its behavior
 

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.250
plot a graph and find out its behavior
and that's that's one of the things that

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:19.260
and that's that's one of the things that
 

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.710
and that's that's one of the things that
you do before you start doing calculus

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:21.720
you do before you start doing calculus
 

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:26.720
you do before you start doing calculus
but because we can't always do that we

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:26.730
but because we can't always do that we
 

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.990
but because we can't always do that we
use calculus as a shorthand for

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000
use calculus as a shorthand for
 

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.949
use calculus as a shorthand for
describing how the slope of a nonlinear

00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:33.959
describing how the slope of a nonlinear
 

00:14:33.959 --> 00:14:38.269
describing how the slope of a nonlinear
function changes so calculus liberate

00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:38.279

the X when X is equal to 0 is 1 because

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:15.020
the X when X is equal to 0 is 1 because
 

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.940
the X when X is equal to 0 is 1 because
any number raised to the power 0 is

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:18.950
any number raised to the power 0 is
 

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:25.000
any number raised to the power 0 is
equal to 1 okay so the the y-intercept

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:25.010
equal to 1 okay so the the y-intercept
 

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:29.950
equal to 1 okay so the the y-intercept
is equal to 1 it is an exponentially

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:29.960
is equal to 1 it is an exponentially
 

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.310
is equal to 1 it is an exponentially
rising function so you'll see that it's

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:33.320
rising function so you'll see that it's
 

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:44.049
rising function so you'll see that it's
slope increases as x increases and you

00:19:44.049 --> 00:19:44.059
slope increases as x increases and you
 

00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:46.660
slope increases as x increases and you
know so it has a shape similar to other

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:46.670
know so it has a shape similar to other
 

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:52.480
know so it has a shape similar to other
exponential functions it has the feature

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:52.490
exponential functions it has the feature
 

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:55.450
exponential functions it has the feature
that its inverse is equal to the natural

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:55.460
that its inverse is equal to the natural
 

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.210
that its inverse is equal to the natural
log function and you should get used to

00:19:58.210 --> 00:19:58.220
log function and you should get used to
 

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.130
log function and you should get used to
this shape too because it's very useful

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:00.140
this shape too because it's very useful
 

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:04.660
this shape too because it's very useful
in many applications and here you'll see

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:04.670
in many applications and here you'll see
 

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:09.430
in many applications and here you'll see
that it starts off at minus infinity for

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440
that it starts off at minus infinity for
 

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:17.890
that it starts off at minus infinity for
X equal to 0 and Rises but unlike the

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:17.900
X equal to 0 and Rises but unlike the
 

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:22.500
X equal to 0 and Rises but unlike the
exponential function its slope gets more

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:22.510
exponential function its slope gets more
 

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:28.990
exponential function its slope gets more
shallow as x increases okay so that's a

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:29.000
shallow as x increases okay so that's a
 

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:29.930
shallow as x increases okay so that's a
useful

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:29.940
useful
 

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.930
useful
point to start thinking about inverse

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:32.940
point to start thinking about inverse
 

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:36.320
point to start thinking about inverse
functions okay so what's an inverse

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:36.330
functions okay so what's an inverse
 

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:43.009
functions okay so what's an inverse
function remember I said that a function

00:20:43.009 --> 00:20:43.019
function remember I said that a function
 

00:20:43.019 --> 00:20:48.799
function remember I said that a function
is a rule it assigns an output to an

00:20:48.799 --> 00:20:48.809
is a rule it assigns an output to an
 

00:20:48.809 --> 00:20:51.889
is a rule it assigns an output to an
input one thing that I left unstated is

00:20:51.889 --> 00:20:51.899
input one thing that I left unstated is
 

00:20:51.899 --> 00:20:56.710
input one thing that I left unstated is
that it assigns a unique output to an

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720
that it assigns a unique output to an
 

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:02.749
that it assigns a unique output to an
input okay so it assigns a unique value

00:21:02.749 --> 00:21:02.759
input okay so it assigns a unique value
 

00:21:02.759 --> 00:21:08.210
input okay so it assigns a unique value
Y to each value of x it doesn't mean

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:08.220
Y to each value of x it doesn't mean
 

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:12.860
Y to each value of x it doesn't mean
that each value of y has associated with

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:12.870
that each value of y has associated with
 

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:16.700
that each value of y has associated with
it a unique value of x okay so that

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:16.710
it a unique value of x okay so that
 

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:19.789
it a unique value of x okay so that
means that two values of x could lead to

00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799
means that two values of x could lead to
 

00:21:19.799 --> 00:21:24.350
means that two values of x could lead to
the same why but one value x is only

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:24.360
the same why but one value x is only
 

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:28.340
the same why but one value x is only
going to give you one why everybody see

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:28.350
going to give you one why everybody see
 

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:47.160
going to give you one why everybody see
that and pictorially

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:47.170
 
 

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:51.970
 
you

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:51.980
 
 

00:21:51.980 --> 00:22:07.289
 
ok so let's say this is the number 10

00:22:07.289 --> 00:22:07.299
 
 

00:22:07.299 --> 00:22:15.330
 
so if if you give me an x value of 2 i'm

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:15.340
so if if you give me an x value of 2 i'm
 

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.820
so if if you give me an x value of 2 i'm
going to give you a y-value of 10 and

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:17.830
going to give you a y-value of 10 and
 

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:24.239
going to give you a y-value of 10 and
only 10 but if you give me another x

00:22:24.239 --> 00:22:24.249
only 10 but if you give me another x
 

00:22:24.249 --> 00:22:28.919
only 10 but if you give me another x
value i might also give you 10 whatever

00:22:28.919 --> 00:22:28.929
value i might also give you 10 whatever
 

00:22:28.929 --> 00:22:30.869
value i might also give you 10 whatever
x values you give me i'm only going to

00:22:30.869 --> 00:22:30.879
x values you give me i'm only going to
 

00:22:30.879 --> 00:22:36.330
x values you give me i'm only going to
give you one associated y value but if

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:36.340
give you one associated y value but if
 

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.369
give you one associated y value but if
you were to give me a y-value i may give

00:22:38.369 --> 00:22:38.379
you were to give me a y-value i may give
 

00:22:38.379 --> 00:22:41.669
you were to give me a y-value i may give
you more than one associated x value the

00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679
you more than one associated x value the
 

00:22:41.679 --> 00:22:43.590
you more than one associated x value the
definition of a function and that's why

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600
definition of a function and that's why
 

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:48.060
definition of a function and that's why
a function is not necessarily to where

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:48.070
a function is not necessarily to where
 

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.669
a function is not necessarily to where
write a function is a rule that takes X

00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:50.679
write a function is a rule that takes X
 

00:22:50.679 --> 00:22:53.759
write a function is a rule that takes X
as an input and gives you a unique value

00:22:53.759 --> 00:22:53.769
as an input and gives you a unique value
 

00:22:53.769 --> 00:22:59.099
as an input and gives you a unique value
Y as an output now a monotonic function

00:22:59.099 --> 00:22:59.109
Y as an output now a monotonic function
 

00:22:59.109 --> 00:23:04.159
Y as an output now a monotonic function
is one that's always increasing or

00:23:04.159 --> 00:23:04.169
is one that's always increasing or
 

00:23:04.169 --> 00:23:09.989
is one that's always increasing or
always decreasing is this a monotonic

00:23:09.989 --> 00:23:09.999
always decreasing is this a monotonic
 

00:23:09.999 --> 00:23:13.919
always decreasing is this a monotonic
function no right it sometimes

00:23:13.919 --> 00:23:13.929
function no right it sometimes
 

00:23:13.929 --> 00:23:17.359
function no right it sometimes
increasing sometimes decreasing so a

00:23:17.359 --> 00:23:17.369
increasing sometimes decreasing so a
 

00:23:17.369 --> 00:23:21.930
increasing sometimes decreasing so a
monotonic function would be one that

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:21.940
monotonic function would be one that
 

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:26.340
monotonic function would be one that
looked for example like that such as the

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:26.350
looked for example like that such as the
 

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.889
looked for example like that such as the
log function that I just showed you ok

00:23:28.889 --> 00:23:28.899
log function that I just showed you ok
 

00:23:28.899 --> 00:23:35.580
log function that I just showed you ok
now for monotonic functions you could

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:35.590
now for monotonic functions you could
 

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:40.849
now for monotonic functions you could
think of them as two-way rules because

00:23:40.849 --> 00:23:40.859
think of them as two-way rules because
 

00:23:40.859 --> 00:23:43.710
think of them as two-way rules because
if you have a monotonic function for

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:43.720
if you have a monotonic function for
 

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.489
if you have a monotonic function for
every value of y there is only a single

00:23:47.489 --> 00:23:47.499
every value of y there is only a single
 

00:23:47.499 --> 00:23:54.799
every value of y there is only a single
value of x that is associated with it ok

00:23:54.799 --> 00:23:54.809
value of x that is associated with it ok
 

00:23:54.809 --> 00:23:59.279
value of x that is associated with it ok
now the rule that it finds that single

00:23:59.279 --> 00:23:59.289
now the rule that it finds that single
 

00:23:59.289 --> 00:24:04.950
now the rule that it finds that single
or unique value of x to every value of y

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960
or unique value of x to every value of y
 

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:10.229
or unique value of x to every value of y
is called the inverse function so you

00:24:10.229 --> 00:24:10.239
is called the inverse function so you
 

00:24:10.239 --> 00:24:12.509
is called the inverse function so you
could think of the inverse function as

00:24:12.509 --> 00:24:12.519
could think of the inverse function as
 

00:24:12.519 --> 00:24:17.249
could think of the inverse function as
the rule that reverses the effect of the

00:24:17.249 --> 00:24:17.259
the rule that reverses the effect of the
 

00:24:17.259 --> 00:24:19.779
the rule that reverses the effect of the
original function

00:24:19.779 --> 00:24:19.789
original function
 

00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:24.810
original function
so we started out with the function 2x

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:24.820
so we started out with the function 2x
 

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.869
so we started out with the function 2x
that's a rule that says give me X

00:24:27.869 --> 00:24:27.879
that's a rule that says give me X
 

00:24:27.879 --> 00:24:31.149
that's a rule that says give me X
multiply X by 2 and I'll give you an

00:24:31.149 --> 00:24:31.159
multiply X by 2 and I'll give you an
 

00:24:31.159 --> 00:24:35.219
multiply X by 2 and I'll give you an
output equal to 2x what's the rule that

00:24:35.219 --> 00:24:35.229
output equal to 2x what's the rule that
 

00:24:35.229 --> 00:24:41.879
output equal to 2x what's the rule that
reverses that function yeah x over to

00:24:41.879 --> 00:24:41.889
reverses that function yeah x over to
 

00:24:41.889 --> 00:24:49.629
reverses that function yeah x over to
write half x okay so if Y is equal to

00:24:49.629 --> 00:24:49.639
write half x okay so if Y is equal to
 

00:24:49.639 --> 00:24:55.450
write half x okay so if Y is equal to
two x then x is equal to y over 2 so I

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:55.460
two x then x is equal to y over 2 so I
 

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:58.089
two x then x is equal to y over 2 so I
just switched the notation so as to keep

00:24:58.089 --> 00:24:58.099
just switched the notation so as to keep
 

00:24:58.099 --> 00:25:01.440
just switched the notation so as to keep
it simple so as to keep x and y in the

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:01.450
it simple so as to keep x and y in the
 

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:04.599
it simple so as to keep x and y in the
same domains but you could certainly say

00:25:04.599 --> 00:25:04.609
same domains but you could certainly say
 

00:25:04.609 --> 00:25:10.869
same domains but you could certainly say
x over 2 also okay okay now is there an

00:25:10.869 --> 00:25:10.879
x over 2 also okay okay now is there an
 

00:25:10.879 --> 00:25:12.639
x over 2 also okay okay now is there an
inverse function for the function y

00:25:12.639 --> 00:25:12.649
inverse function for the function y
 

00:25:12.649 --> 00:25:16.330
inverse function for the function y
equals x squared I'm sure you remember

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:16.340
equals x squared I'm sure you remember
 

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:25.450
equals x squared I'm sure you remember
this dilemma from so anybody remember

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:25.460
this dilemma from so anybody remember
 

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:30.430
this dilemma from so anybody remember
the the graph of x squared right this is

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:30.440
the the graph of x squared right this is
 

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:38.379
the the graph of x squared right this is
x squared okay so what's the inverse of

00:25:38.379 --> 00:25:38.389
x squared okay so what's the inverse of
 

00:25:38.389 --> 00:25:44.320
x squared okay so what's the inverse of
this function okay so we have one vote

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:44.330
this function okay so we have one vote
 

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:51.700
this function okay so we have one vote
four square root of x any other case of

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:51.710
four square root of x any other case of
 

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:57.639
four square root of x any other case of
x square root of Y okay so that

00:25:57.639 --> 00:25:57.649
x square root of Y okay so that
 

00:25:57.649 --> 00:25:59.950
x square root of Y okay so that
certainly reverses the process of

00:25:59.950 --> 00:25:59.960
certainly reverses the process of
 

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:05.340
certainly reverses the process of
squaring

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:05.350
 
 

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:10.299
 
it could be minus right so remember this

00:26:10.299 --> 00:26:10.309
it could be minus right so remember this
 

00:26:10.309 --> 00:26:16.419
it could be minus right so remember this
is not a monotonic function so the

00:26:16.419 --> 00:26:16.429
is not a monotonic function so the
 

00:26:16.429 --> 00:26:19.049
is not a monotonic function so the
natural inclination to reverse the rule

00:26:19.049 --> 00:26:19.059
natural inclination to reverse the rule
 

00:26:19.059 --> 00:26:23.350
natural inclination to reverse the rule
doesn't work in this case because we

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360
doesn't work in this case because we
 

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.759
doesn't work in this case because we
don't have a monotonic function because

00:26:26.759 --> 00:26:26.769
don't have a monotonic function because
 

00:26:26.769 --> 00:26:30.789
don't have a monotonic function because
there are negative 4x in the negative

00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799
there are negative 4x in the negative
 

00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:35.159
there are negative 4x in the negative
domain they also give you this x squared

00:26:35.159 --> 00:26:35.169
domain they also give you this x squared
 

00:26:35.169 --> 00:26:40.210
domain they also give you this x squared
so you can't simply reverse it because

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:40.220
so you can't simply reverse it because
 

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.490
so you can't simply reverse it because
remember for an inverse function to

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:42.500
remember for an inverse function to
 

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.940
remember for an inverse function to
exist it has to be that for every value

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:45.950
exist it has to be that for every value
 

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:52.110
exist it has to be that for every value
of y I have only a unique value of x so

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:52.120
of y I have only a unique value of x so
 

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:56.110
of y I have only a unique value of x so
here I now have two potential values of

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:56.120
here I now have two potential values of
 

00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:01.870
here I now have two potential values of
x so when i take the square root there

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:01.880
x so when i take the square root there
 

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.850
x so when i take the square root there
are two potential routes right there's a

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:03.860
are two potential routes right there's a
 

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:07.899
are two potential routes right there's a
plus and a minus root so taking the

00:27:07.899 --> 00:27:07.909
plus and a minus root so taking the
 

00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:10.509
plus and a minus root so taking the
square root it is not actually a

00:27:10.509 --> 00:27:10.519
square root it is not actually a
 

00:27:10.519 --> 00:27:12.879
square root it is not actually a
function since it gives me two answers

00:27:12.879 --> 00:27:12.889
function since it gives me two answers
 

00:27:12.889 --> 00:27:18.399
function since it gives me two answers
to potential answers right and so that's

00:27:18.399 --> 00:27:18.409
to potential answers right and so that's
 

00:27:18.409 --> 00:27:20.680
to potential answers right and so that's
why an inverse function doesn't exist

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:20.690
why an inverse function doesn't exist
 

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:30.370
why an inverse function doesn't exist
for 4x squared and so you know and you

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:30.380
for 4x squared and so you know and you
 

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:32.379
for 4x squared and so you know and you
might say well this is our king you know

00:27:32.379 --> 00:27:32.389
might say well this is our king you know
 

00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:38.320
might say well this is our king you know
why do I care about this but the kinds

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:38.330
why do I care about this but the kinds
 

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:42.460
why do I care about this but the kinds
of places you you'll certainly see it

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:42.470
of places you you'll certainly see it
 

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:45.100
of places you you'll certainly see it
used but I'll give you a flavor for it

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:45.110
used but I'll give you a flavor for it
 

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:51.730
used but I'll give you a flavor for it
now generally when you observe phenomena

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:51.740
now generally when you observe phenomena
 

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.080
now generally when you observe phenomena
and you think that there's some

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:53.090
and you think that there's some
 

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:55.779
and you think that there's some
relationship between one phenomenon and

00:27:55.779 --> 00:27:55.789
relationship between one phenomenon and
 

00:27:55.789 --> 00:28:02.350
relationship between one phenomenon and
another you you will be in situations

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:02.360
another you you will be in situations
 

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.690
another you you will be in situations
where you only observe one phenomenon

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:04.700
where you only observe one phenomenon
 

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:08.980
where you only observe one phenomenon
and don't observe the other okay so for

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:08.990
and don't observe the other okay so for
 

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:12.340
and don't observe the other okay so for
example you'll only observe why and not

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:12.350
example you'll only observe why and not
 

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:16.029
example you'll only observe why and not
X and so you have to surmise what X

00:28:16.029 --> 00:28:16.039
X and so you have to surmise what X
 

00:28:16.039 --> 00:28:17.310
X and so you have to surmise what X
might have been

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:17.320
might have been
 

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.909
might have been
if you are sure about the rule the

00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:20.919
if you are sure about the rule the
 

00:28:20.919 --> 00:28:25.560
if you are sure about the rule the
function then and you are and you're

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:25.570
function then and you are and you're
 

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:28.320
function then and you are and you're
able to work out an inverse then you

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:28.330
able to work out an inverse then you
 

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:30.480
able to work out an inverse then you
will be able to surmise what that X is

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:30.490
will be able to surmise what that X is
 

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:35.970
will be able to surmise what that X is
if if you are in a problem where there

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:35.980
if if you are in a problem where there
 

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.100
if if you are in a problem where there
is no inverse because there are multiple

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:38.110
is no inverse because there are multiple
 

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:41.580
is no inverse because there are multiple
ways of getting to that why that you

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:41.590
ways of getting to that why that you
 

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:45.120
ways of getting to that why that you
observed then you won't be able to

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:45.130
observed then you won't be able to
 

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:51.960
observed then you won't be able to
conclude the presence of X just by

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:51.970
conclude the presence of X just by
 

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:55.950
conclude the presence of X just by
observing why ok so this looks very dry

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:55.960
observing why ok so this looks very dry
 

00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:01.889
observing why ok so this looks very dry
and technical but it has very very real

00:29:01.889 --> 00:29:01.899

this a lot is of course in law right so

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:12.840
this a lot is of course in law right so
 

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:15.600
this a lot is of course in law right so
this is directly related to the

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:15.610
this is directly related to the
 

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:22.440
this is directly related to the
prosecutors policy if you see you know

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:22.450
prosecutors policy if you see you know
 

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:27.799
prosecutors policy if you see you know
if you see some some set of acts which

00:29:27.799 --> 00:29:27.809
if you see some some set of acts which
 

00:29:27.809 --> 00:29:31.860
if you see some some set of acts which
are circumstantially linked then you

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:31.870
are circumstantially linked then you
 

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:34.590
are circumstantially linked then you
think that a certain person has

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:34.600
think that a certain person has
 

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:38.340
think that a certain person has
committed a crime but in criminal law of

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:38.350
committed a crime but in criminal law of
 

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:39.659
committed a crime but in criminal law of
course you have to have a very high

00:29:39.659 --> 00:29:39.669
course you have to have a very high
 

00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:43.259
course you have to have a very high
standard of proof and it may well be

00:29:43.259 --> 00:29:43.269
standard of proof and it may well be
 

00:29:43.269 --> 00:29:45.299
standard of proof and it may well be
that there are a number of potential

00:29:45.299 --> 00:29:45.309
that there are a number of potential
 

00:29:45.309 --> 00:29:47.789
that there are a number of potential
hypotheses which are correct that would

hypotheses which are correct that would
 

00:29:47.799 --> 00:29:50.970
hypotheses which are correct that would
be exactly the same as not having an

be exactly the same as not having an
 

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:54.450
be exactly the same as not having an
inverse function multiple x's that give

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:54.460
inverse function multiple x's that give
 

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:59.009
inverse function multiple x's that give
you the same why ok and that's exactly

00:29:59.009 --> 00:29:59.019
you the same why ok and that's exactly
 

00:29:59.019 --> 00:30:04.950
you the same why ok and that's exactly
how it is used in science and you'll see

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960
how it is used in science and you'll see
 

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:09.690
how it is used in science and you'll see
that hopefully in your classes ok ok

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:09.700
that hopefully in your classes ok ok

let's keep going so the inverse function

00:30:15.259 --> 00:30:15.269
let's keep going so the inverse function
 

00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:19.379
let's keep going so the inverse function
I had given you the exponential function

00:30:19.379 --> 00:30:19.389
I had given you the exponential function
 

00:30:19.389 --> 00:30:23.519
I had given you the exponential function
and the long function these two are

00:30:23.519 --> 00:30:23.529
and the long function these two are
 

00:30:23.529 --> 00:30:29.340
and the long function these two are
related in that the natural log is the

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:29.350
related in that the natural log is the
 

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:30.310
related in that the natural log is the
inverse of the

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320
inverse of the
 

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:35.529
inverse of the
exponential function and vice versa okay

00:30:35.529 --> 00:30:35.539
exponential function and vice versa okay
 

00:30:35.539 --> 00:30:38.620
exponential function and vice versa okay
and you can see this when you put the

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:38.630
and you can see this when you put the
 

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:41.110
and you can see this when you put the
two next to each other just imagine for

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120
two next to each other just imagine for
 

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:45.340
two next to each other just imagine for
a second that I would have rotate if i

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:45.350
a second that I would have rotate if i
 

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:50.700
a second that I would have rotate if i
were to strip this white square out from

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:50.710
were to strip this white square out from
 

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:54.940
were to strip this white square out from
the screen out this way so i would take

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:54.950
the screen out this way so i would take
 

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:58.299
the screen out this way so i would take
this point and put it somewhere here

00:30:58.299 --> 00:30:58.309
this point and put it somewhere here
 

00:30:58.309 --> 00:31:01.570
this point and put it somewhere here
this is not you pull it out towards you

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:01.580
this is not you pull it out towards you
 

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:05.970
this is not you pull it out towards you
okay and then i would to turn it around

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:05.980
okay and then i would to turn it around
 

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:10.659
okay and then i would to turn it around
so that the ex ended up up here and the

00:31:10.659 --> 00:31:10.669
so that the ex ended up up here and the
 

00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:13.629
so that the ex ended up up here and the
y ended up down here of course this

00:31:13.629 --> 00:31:13.639
y ended up down here of course this
 

00:31:13.639 --> 00:31:15.700
y ended up down here of course this
would end up looking just like that

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:15.710
would end up looking just like that
 

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:18.549
would end up looking just like that
notice that this cross is the y axis at

00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559
notice that this cross is the y axis at
 

00:31:18.559 --> 00:31:24.249
notice that this cross is the y axis at
one this crosses the x-axis and one okay

00:31:24.249 --> 00:31:24.259
one this crosses the x-axis and one okay
 

00:31:24.259 --> 00:31:28.509
one this crosses the x-axis and one okay
and this goes off towards minus infinity

00:31:28.509 --> 00:31:28.519
and this goes off towards minus infinity
 

00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:34.659
and this goes off towards minus infinity
as does this okay this is actually

00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:34.669
as does this okay this is actually
 

00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:38.919
as does this okay this is actually
actually this is not drawn at y equal to

00:31:38.919 --> 00:31:38.929
actually this is not drawn at y equal to
 

00:31:38.929 --> 00:31:40.629
actually this is not drawn at y equal to
0 which is why this looks like it's

00:31:40.629 --> 00:31:40.639
0 which is why this looks like it's
 

00:31:40.639 --> 00:31:44.289
0 which is why this looks like it's
touching but it shouldn't be touching in

00:31:44.289 --> 00:31:44.299
touching but it shouldn't be touching in
 

00:31:44.299 --> 00:31:46.029
touching but it shouldn't be touching in
other words this the height of this is

00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:46.039
other words this the height of this is
 

00:31:46.039 --> 00:31:47.889
other words this the height of this is
not zero it it's something higher than

not zero it it's something higher than
 

00:31:47.899 --> 00:31:59.710
not zero it it's something higher than
zero okay okay okay quickly an implicit

zero okay okay okay quickly an implicit
 

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:06.669

function very often and this is this

00:32:06.669 --> 00:32:06.679
function very often and this is this
 

00:32:06.679 --> 00:32:09.970
function very often and this is this
this is more of a computational problem

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:09.980
this is more of a computational problem
 

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:15.490
this is more of a computational problem
rather than a semantic distinction like

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:15.500
rather than a semantic distinction like
 

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:19.379
rather than a semantic distinction like
the one between the inverse function an

00:32:19.379 --> 00:32:19.389
the one between the inverse function an
 

00:32:19.389 --> 00:32:22.659
the one between the inverse function an
implicit function often usually and so

00:32:22.659 --> 00:32:22.669
implicit function often usually and so
 

00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:24.369
implicit function often usually and so
far we've defined all functions

00:32:24.369 --> 00:32:24.379
far we've defined all functions
 

00:32:24.379 --> 00:32:28.090
far we've defined all functions
explicitly that is y is equal to x

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:28.100
explicitly that is y is equal to x
 

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:34.320
explicitly that is y is equal to x
squared plus X minus 10 let's say but

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:34.330
squared plus X minus 10 let's say but
 

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:37.779
squared plus X minus 10 let's say but
sometimes you will have two variables

00:32:37.779 --> 00:32:37.789
sometimes you will have two variables
 

00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:43.510
sometimes you will have two variables
related in a very complex way and it's

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:43.520
related in a very complex way and it's
 

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.180
related in a very complex way and it's
it's difficult to take one of the

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:46.190
it's difficult to take one of the
 

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:48.520
it's difficult to take one of the
variables and put it on one side and

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:48.530
variables and put it on one side and
 

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:50.680
variables and put it on one side and
strip it away so you might have

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:50.690
strip it away so you might have
 

00:32:50.690 --> 00:33:00.430
strip it away so you might have
something that looks like this this is a

something that looks like this this is a
 

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.160
something that looks like this this is a
function of x and y this is an

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:03.170
function of x and y this is an
 

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:05.400
function of x and y this is an
expression that includes x and y and

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:05.410
expression that includes x and y and
 

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:08.860
expression that includes x and y and
that's equal to a particular number so

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:08.870
that's equal to a particular number so
 

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:12.910
that's equal to a particular number so
you'd have to put y on one side or x on

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:12.920
you'd have to put y on one side or x on
 

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.950
you'd have to put y on one side or x on
one side but if you did that if you try

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960
one side but if you did that if you try
 

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.430
one side but if you did that if you try
to do that you'd have to solve a

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440
to do that you'd have to solve a
 

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.320
to do that you'd have to solve a
third-order polynomial for y and a

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:20.330
third-order polynomial for y and a
 

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:23.920
third-order polynomial for y and a
second-order polynomial for x so you'd

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:23.930
second-order polynomial for x so you'd
 

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:25.990
second-order polynomial for x so you'd
end up with a complicated expression on

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000
end up with a complicated expression on
 

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.500
end up with a complicated expression on
the right-hand side with many roots and

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:29.510
the right-hand side with many roots and
 

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:31.300
the right-hand side with many roots and
of course as you know from our

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:31.310
of course as you know from our
 

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:34.900
of course as you know from our
discussion about roots roots don't have

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:34.910
discussion about roots roots don't have
 

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:38.620
discussion about roots roots don't have
unique values and so you wouldn't end up

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:38.630
unique values and so you wouldn't end up
 

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:42.990
unique values and so you wouldn't end up
with an actual function okay however

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:43.000
with an actual function okay however
 

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.610
with an actual function okay however
however this condition nevertheless

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:47.620
however this condition nevertheless
 

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:55.210
however this condition nevertheless
defines a set of X's and Y's which meet

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:55.220
defines a set of X's and Y's which meet
 

00:33:55.220 --> 00:34:00.850
defines a set of X's and Y's which meet
that condition okay and very often they

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:00.860
that condition okay and very often they
 

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:04.900
that condition okay and very often they
will have some graph even though that

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:04.910
will have some graph even though that
 

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:07.330
will have some graph even though that
graph may not be the graph of a function

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:07.340
graph may not be the graph of a function
 

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:11.399
graph may not be the graph of a function
a very common implicitly defined

00:34:11.399 --> 00:34:11.409
a very common implicitly defined
 

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:19.970
a very common implicitly defined
function is

00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:19.980
 
 

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:22.070
 
anybody know what the graph of this

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:22.080
anybody know what the graph of this
 

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:28.130
anybody know what the graph of this
implicitly defined function looks like a

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:28.140
 
 

00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:35.220
 
circle right okay so that's not a

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:35.230
circle right okay so that's not a
 

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:40.140
circle right okay so that's not a
function for any value of x I have two

00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:40.150
function for any value of x I have two
 

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:43.110
function for any value of x I have two
potential values of Y it certainly

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:43.120
potential values of Y it certainly
 

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:45.420
potential values of Y it certainly
doesn't have an inverse I have the same

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:45.430
doesn't have an inverse I have the same
 

00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:49.410
doesn't have an inverse I have the same
problem but nevertheless this condition

00:34:49.410 --> 00:34:49.420
problem but nevertheless this condition
 

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:55.110
problem but nevertheless this condition
is useful because it limits the sets of

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:55.120
is useful because it limits the sets of
 

00:34:55.120 --> 00:35:00.060
is useful because it limits the sets of
paired X wise which satisfy that

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:00.070
paired X wise which satisfy that
 

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:03.660
paired X wise which satisfy that
condition and so once again you might

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:03.670
condition and so once again you might
 

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:06.890
condition and so once again you might
observe phenomena in the world which

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:06.900
observe phenomena in the world which
 

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:10.410
observe phenomena in the world which
satisfy this condition it may not follow

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:10.420
satisfy this condition it may not follow
 

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:15.720
satisfy this condition it may not follow
a functional rule but it tells you or it

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:15.730
a functional rule but it tells you or it
 

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:18.900
a functional rule but it tells you or it
limits the set of observations that you

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:18.910
limits the set of observations that you
 

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:23.970
limits the set of observations that you
might expect to see okay okay so keep

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:23.980
might expect to see okay okay so keep
 

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:27.990
might expect to see okay okay so keep
implicit functions in mind once you have

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000
implicit functions in mind once you have
 

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.100
implicit functions in mind once you have
calculus you are able to do some things

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:32.110
calculus you are able to do some things
 

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:33.780
calculus you are able to do some things
with implicit functions in particular

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:33.790
with implicit functions in particular
 

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:36.810
with implicit functions in particular
you're able to determine rules which

00:35:36.810 --> 00:35:36.820
you're able to determine rules which
 

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:42.600
you're able to determine rules which
tell you what the slope of that locus of

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:42.610
tell you what the slope of that locus of
 

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:46.650
tell you what the slope of that locus of
points is at a particular value of x or

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:46.660
points is at a particular value of x or
 

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:49.920
points is at a particular value of x or
y okay and that may be a useful piece of

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:49.930
y okay and that may be a useful piece of
 

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:57.630
y okay and that may be a useful piece of
information

00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:57.640
 
 

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.700
