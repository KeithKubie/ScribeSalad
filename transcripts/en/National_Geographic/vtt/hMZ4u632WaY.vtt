[music playing]

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.900
TIM SAMUELS: If turning
the clock back to the 1950s

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.533
wasn't far enough for
me and my cushion tush,

00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:09.800
I have a date with
another popular school.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.300
One that draws its inspiration
from caveman times.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.033
Valentina Vychushanina's
class encourages men and women

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:19.600
to tap into their
primordial instincts

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.266
by summoning up the
inner Flintstone.

00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:38.166
[russian speech]

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.200
You are strong.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.500
I am with you.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.667
And I am believing you
are powerful every time,

00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:49.033
and you are my king and the
most powerful man in my life.

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:51.066
And I know you are.

00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.100
That's unbelievable.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.100
I need that as my ring tone.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.934
Can you-- can you record
this for me later?

00:00:56.934 --> 00:00:59.100
I need to listen to
this every morning.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.166
I need to wake up to this.

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.400
Deep inside, woken
from a slumber

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.000
of Western egalitarianism,
my inner Fred Flintstone

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.166
began to stir.

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.033
[speaking russian]

00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:13.500
[roars]

00:01:18.367 --> 00:01:19.333
A wild beast?

00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:20.133
Yeah.

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.233
Oh, OK. [growls]

00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:22.033
Yeah.

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:23.200
Yeah.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.900
Wow.

00:01:27.633 --> 00:01:29.834
Like an epic 007 fight scene.

00:01:29.834 --> 00:01:32.934
A British hero fends off the
Russian villain from reaching

00:01:32.934 --> 00:01:35.767
the beautiful woman.

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:37.700
Eh, maybe more Mr. Bean.

00:01:43.867 --> 00:01:44.567
Darling.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.333
I kept him away from you.

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:54.834
[growls] This is-- it's
like being a caveman again.

00:01:54.834 --> 00:01:55.767
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:55.767 --> 00:01:56.967
Exactly.

00:01:56.967 --> 00:01:59.233
Because it's nature of
power inside of your body.

00:01:59.233 --> 00:02:00.100
Yes.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.000
It's always there.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.333
How do you feel?

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:04.567
I feel like a new man.

00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:06.433
And how do you feel?

00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:09.166
I like when you feel
the strong inside of you,

00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:10.767
and you become more--

00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:11.567
Manly.

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:12.834
--strong man.

00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:13.900
Yes.
I like it.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.700
You like it.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.500
Yeah.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.033
So should we get married?

00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:17.734
Yeah?

00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:24.300
That's what the
course is, isn't it?

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.533
And what could be more
manly than draping

00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:29.400
an awkward arm around a
girl, who it turns out,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.400
already had a boyfriend.
