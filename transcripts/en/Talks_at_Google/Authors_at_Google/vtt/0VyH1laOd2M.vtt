[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.310
SPEAKER: We are very pleased
to welcome Howard Schubiner

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.070
at our talks at Google Seattle.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.340
Howard is a doctor.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.240
He's an internist at
Providence Hospital in Michigan

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.190
and also a professor at
Wayne State University

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.966
College of Medicine--

00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.340
HOWARD SCHUBINER:
Michigan State.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.270
SPEAKER: Michigan
State, oh, yeah.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.520
HOWARD SCHUBINER: We switched.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.340
SPEAKER: Oh, OK--

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.186
Michigan State University.

00:00:31.186 --> 00:00:34.320
He has published two books
now, "Unlearn Your Pain"

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.620
and "Unlearn Your
Anxiety and Depression."

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.060
And he's coming out
with a third book soon.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.054
And Yeah, please welcome
Howard Schubiner.

00:00:44.054 --> 00:00:45.220
HOWARD SCHUBINER: Thank you.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.184
Thank you.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.890
That's kind.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.090
Thank you.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.710
I'm going to tell you a story.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.710
It's a uniquely American story.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.740
And to borrow a
phrase from a TV show

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.200
that I've never
seen but heard of,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.890
it's an American horror story.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.570
This is a guy, 41
years old, who I saw

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.350
for low back pain, seven years.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.760
It started-- he was 34.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.590
So he was running.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.680
He had no injury.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.310
But he started having
pain in his back

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.080
while he was running one day.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.310
It was kind of a dull ache.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.500
It kind of came and
went, not a big deal.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.740
But it just gradually
got worse over time.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.970
Eventually, it became constant,
mainly on the lower-left side

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.860
of his spine in the lumber area.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.650
But sometimes it would be kind
of more on the right side.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.100
Sometimes it would
shoot down to his butt.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.590
He started having
trouble sleeping,

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.690
because he was in pain.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.650
There was no
neurological impairment,

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.740
meaning reflexes are normal.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.840
Strength is normal in his legs.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.010
Sensation is normal.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.440
No evidence of any nerve damage.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.320
That was good.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.210
EMG is a test to test
for nerve damage.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.480
That was normal.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.370
So he had an MRI.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.370
That's going to tell us
what's wrong with him, right?

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.540
Maybe.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.850
He had degenerative
disk disease.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.260
And he had a moderate
disk bulge at L4-5.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.320
So he started to get
treatment, physical therapy,

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.120
another course of
physical therapy--

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.690
not helping-- pain
management specialist,

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.390
injections in the spine--

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.950
not helping-- Botox injections,
piriformis injections--

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.320
is in the butt--

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.960
more injections, a TENS unit.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.000
Let's try to distract your
brain from pain by giving you

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.270
this electrical stimulation.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.410
He got Duloxetine.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.780
That's an anti-depressant.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.930
He got gabapentin.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.740
That's a nerve pill,
kind of like Lyrica.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.050
Someone gave him opiates.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.332
Is that a good idea?

00:02:56.332 --> 00:02:57.790
Well, but he wasn't
getting better.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.530
So he said, well,
I'll go another route.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.760
Let's try acupuncture.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.740
I'll take yoga.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.600
Two years later,
nothing's working.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.890
So he goes to the surgeon.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.850
The Surgeon says, oh, we can fix
that disk, L4-5 bulging disk,

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.080
no problem.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.500
He gets a fusion
L4-5, doesn't help.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.310
Years go by.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.040
Another year after
that, another doctor

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.080
says, well, your
SI joint, the joint

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.060
that's connecting the
sacrum and the pelvis--

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.840
SI joint is kind of like a
joint connecting your ribs

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.560
to your sternum.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.700
It's not much of a joint.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.160
But there's some
arthritis there.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.110
We can fuse that.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.380
He had that surgery--

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.980
not better.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.060
When he was 42, he
started having neck pain.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.650
Now we got a whole other
thing to worry about.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.350
The MRI of his neck, facet
degeneration, disc space

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.780
narrowing, a small disk bulge.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.670
That doesn't sound good.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.270
He goes to see the neurosurgeon.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.630
He says, well, you're
not a candidate

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.110
for surgery in your neck,
but epidural injections.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.470
He decided he already tried
that in his lower back.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.060
He didn't want to do that.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.060
And his pain just continued.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.230
So he has lower back pain.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.256
He's got neck pain.

00:04:14.256 --> 00:04:15.630
And then within
the last year, he

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.600
started having some stomach
sensations, this fluttering

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.880
sensation in his stomach.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.490
So now he goes to a
pain psychologist.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.890
And they give him
relaxation exercises.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.220
He basically doesn't have a
lot of hope of getting better

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.690
at this point.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.040
That's the horror
part of the story.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.710
So we have a problem
in this country.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.720
More people are
affected by chronic pain

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.270
now than the combined
total of diabetes,

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.690
heart disease, and cancer.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.920
Millions of people are suffering
a lot of back pain, headache

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.950
pain, stomach pain, pelvic
pain, widespread pain

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.730
that we call fibromyalgia.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.990
Certain professions get
repetitive strain injury.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.760
They get neck strain.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.000
They may have trouble
with squinting,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.339
because they're looking
at screens all the time.

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:10.380
Does that sound familiar?

00:05:13.452 --> 00:05:15.160
And we're going to
talk a little bit more

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.390
about that in a minute.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.660
And the treatment is often
completely ineffective.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.510
Pain management seems
like a good idea.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.250
But do you want
to really manage?

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.690
Do we want to manage our pain?

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.180
That's not what
most people want.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.590
How many randomized
control trials show

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.830
that back surgery is
better than either exercise

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.734
or conservative therapy?

00:05:39.734 --> 00:05:41.400
How many studies have
shown that surgery

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.190
is better than any
non-surgical intervention?

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.580
Zero, not a single
study to show that.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.860
How about back injections?

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.000
A large number of studies, meta
analysis of these studies--

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.540
and when you compare
back injections

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:03.630
versus placebo injections, the
result, not much difference.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.240
How about opiates for pain?

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.020
It's a national disaster.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.350
So let's work on the brain,
psychological therapies

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.380
for pain.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.390
The main psychological
therapies for pain,

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.810
cognitive behavioral therapy,
mindfulness therapy, acceptance

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.000
and commitment therapy.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.280
None have been shown to be
any better than the other.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.488
And none have been shown to
be better than relaxation

00:06:27.488 --> 00:06:29.960
therapy, which is what he got.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:36.320
The effects are small, and
people continue to suffer.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.070
So what are the things
that weren't taught

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.870
in medical school, and
are still not being

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.050
taught in medical school?

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.842
I'm working with
three medical schools

00:06:44.842 --> 00:06:46.800
trying to get more of
this into the curriculum.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.220
Well, the power of the mind
and the control that our brain

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.380
actually has over
our experiences.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.620
A conversion disorder
is when someone

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.970
has a sudden onset
of inability to speak

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:05.400
or paralysis of the arm or leg.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.940
And what happens is is
that the arm is paralyzed,

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.010
and that you say,
well, try to move it.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.105
And they can't.

00:07:12.105 --> 00:07:14.490
It's completely paralyzed.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.290
But in a conversion
disorder, there's

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.630
no medical cause
for this problem.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.880
It's psychologically-induced
paralysis.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.600
I saw a teenager one time
who had a lot of problems

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.890
leading up to this.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:28.810
And at one point, his
arm just became dead.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.030
He had a huge medical work-up.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:32.380
And he started getting better.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.880
But he would wake
up in the morning,

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.690
his arm would be fine, eating
breakfast, drive to school.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:42.040
Gets in the parking lot of
his high school, arm dead.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.170
3:30 in the afternoon,
the bell rings,

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.700
gets out of school,
arm fine again.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:52.450
Unbelievable, the power of
the brain to induce that.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.010
Can symptoms be contagious?

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.800
Can you catch
something from somebody

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.170
called social contagion?

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.970
One of the main
symptoms that's been

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:05.110
found have social contagion
is repetitive strain injury.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:10.990
In the 1980s in Australia,
there was an epidemic of RSI.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.630
People were typing, and
it got worse and worse.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.347
And more and more people got it.

00:08:15.347 --> 00:08:17.680
And at one point, the government
had to step in and say,

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.350
no more disability for RSI.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.780
And it started going down.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.480
How much is typing?

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.034
We had RSI since computers.

00:08:27.034 --> 00:08:27.700
So we're typing.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.840
We're going like this.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.730
Have you ever typed on
a manual typewriter?

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:33.870
You know what that's like?

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:34.980
Crunch.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.440
That's a lot more strenuous.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.299
And we didn't have RSI when
people were doing that.

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:45.720
I know a guy who
went to grad school.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.180
And as he was going
to grad school,

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.561
he was kind of tense, a
lot of things going on.

00:08:49.561 --> 00:08:50.560
And he had this thought.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.055
I hope I don't get RSI.

00:08:52.055 --> 00:08:53.750
I hope I don't get RSI.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.170
I hope I don't get RSI.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.520
Guess what happened?

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.350
He got RSI.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.390
And then his hand's hurting.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:01.980
And his wrists are hurting.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.020
And it goes from one arm,
goes to the other arm.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.530
And he becomes kind
of incapacitated.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:12.570
And he eventually found the
work that I'm telling you about.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.530
He's fine now.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.284
But for example, I
had a woman who had--

00:09:17.284 --> 00:09:18.700
and you'd think
it was structural.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.240
Everyone thinks that
all pain is structural.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.670
And I had this woman who
had pain with typing.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.950
Monday, Tuesday, it got
worse as her week went on.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:28.816
By Friday, it was excruciating.

00:09:28.816 --> 00:09:30.190
So that sounds
pretty structural.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:34.556
Because the more she's
typing, the more it hurts.

00:09:34.556 --> 00:09:36.430
And I asked her, does
it hurt any other time?

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.670
And she said, yeah,
Sunday evening.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.500
Are you typing on Sunday?

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.950
No.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.660
What's going on?

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.710
Her brain is anticipating it.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:47.900
And that was the moment.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.000
That's the "House" moment.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.880
I go back to the '70s-- the
"Colombo" moment, the "Sherlock

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.170
Holmes" moment, where you go,
OK, now we know what this is.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:58.520
And she's fine now.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.990
How many of you have
regular hallucinations?

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.900
Is that common?

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:03.540
Not really.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.940
Yeah, join the group.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:11.449
We think of hallucinations
as being crazy.

00:10:11.449 --> 00:10:13.490
But how many of you have
had the experience where

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:17.180
you felt the vibration of
your cell phone in your pocket

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.180
when it wasn't vibrating?

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.350
There we go.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.270
That's a hallucination.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.340
One study showed 90%
of college students

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.920
had that hallucination.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.311
The brain commonly creates
a whole range of experiences

00:10:31.311 --> 00:10:32.810
that I'm going to
talk to you about.

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:34.935
And do you know where you
hold stress in your body?

00:10:34.935 --> 00:10:36.380
Do you know, when
you're stressed,

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.940
where you feel it in your body?

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.070
Do you have any sense of that?

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.380
Most people do.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.760
But we think of that as a
different category than what

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.470
this guy I was
telling you about has,

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:49.880
because his problem is severe.

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:56.330
So our brains construct
our experience.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:57.770
Vision is constructed.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.140
Have you ever tried to find
an icon on your cell phone

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.200
when it was in a
slightly different place,

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.690
or when you're not expecting
the color, or whatever it is?

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.148
You don't know
exactly where it is.

00:11:07.148 --> 00:11:10.670
And you're looking at
it, but you can't see it.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.700
We see with our visual cortex.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.750
And about 10% of the fibers
that go to our visual cortex

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.750
come from our eyes,
from the retina.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.420
90% come from within our brain.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.584
I'm sure you've seen
this picture before.

00:11:25.584 --> 00:11:26.250
What do you see?

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:34.030
It's interesting how what we see
is actually a neural pathway,

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.620
kind of what we expect to see.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.700
Can you switch it?

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.616
Do you know what I'm
talk-- does everyone see?

00:11:38.616 --> 00:11:40.510
There's a younger
woman, an older woman.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:41.680
And can you switch it?

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.870
Can you just try to look at one?

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.370
Or sometimes you get
stuck in one mode.

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:49.910
Oftentimes, we get
stuck in one mode.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.029
And we have to say, what
mode are you stuck in?

00:11:52.029 --> 00:11:54.070
If you're stuck, which
one, the older or younger?

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.800
See, the chin of the
older woman is down here.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.925
And the nose of the
younger woman is up here.

00:12:03.925 --> 00:12:04.800
And her ear is there.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.405
And so, as soon as you see
it, then your brain can shift.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.370
When people are an
eyewitness to a crime,

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.500
who do they pick
out of the lineup?

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.050
They pick out the
person that their brain

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.990
tells them is most likely to
have committed the crime based

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:26.374
on their understanding
of crime and criminals.

00:12:26.374 --> 00:12:27.290
And that's been shown.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.470
So now we talk about pain.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:33.340
This looks painful.

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:37.240
A friend of mine inadvertently
shot a nail in his hand.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.560
He had zero pain.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.010
Pain only occurs if the brain
activates a danger alarm

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.540
mechanism--

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.342
no danger alarm
mechanism, no pain.

00:12:47.342 --> 00:12:48.550
Kids skin their knee and cry.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:50.549
Other times, they skin
their knee and don't cry.

00:12:50.549 --> 00:12:53.300
Or they cry when they see
a concerned parent running.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:57.980
Our brain has to activate pain
in order to experience pain.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.220
The body doesn't send
pain signals to the brain.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.510
It sends signals.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.480
And our brain has to interpret
if that signal is actually

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.070
a danger or not.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:08.390
Our brain controls pain.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:11.720
All pain is in the brain.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.330
This guy was written up in
"The British Medical Journal,"

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.700
jumped off a
scaffolding onto a nail.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.460
Nail impaled itself
through his boot.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.890
Rushed him to the
hospital, a lot of pain.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:23.330
They hurriedly
took his boot off.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:24.121
What did they find?

00:13:24.121 --> 00:13:26.450
The nail was
positioned precisely

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:30.620
between his toes,
no injury at all.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:34.290
His brain had activated
pain as a warning mechanism.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:38.270
But it was completely
mistaken about the risk.

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:40.710
I met a doctor a few years
ago who told me this story.

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.460
He was in the Vietnam
War as a young man.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.440
His company got
ambushed one day.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.240
He took shrapnel
wound to his leg.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:51.050
He had a lot of pain,
got medevaced out.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:53.090
Comes home stateside,
his injuries heal.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:54.320
What happens to injuries?

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.090
All injuries heal.

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:59.260
His brain turned off the
danger alarm mechanism.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.810
And now he's fine.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:04.840
20 years later roughly, he's
walking down the street.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.720
He gets startled by the sound
of a helicopter coming up

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.770
from behind.

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:15.770
And he gets the same pain in
his leg after all those years.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:17.570
How do we snap our fingers?

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:19.070
How do we ride a bike?

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:24.410
How do we do silly
things like that?

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:27.890
These things happen because
our brain forms connections.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:30.110
Millions of brain cells
connect themselves

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.320
into neural circuits or a neural
pathway for a specific purpose.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.420
That's how we live our lives.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:38.210
And his brain learned
pain from the injury,

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:40.520
remembered it all those
years as a neural pathway,

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.770
and then activated
it later in life

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.650
upon the mental association
of the helicopter.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:52.230
We now know that, when someone
gets an emotional injury,

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.060
the parts of the brain
that are activated

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.280
are identical to
those that happen when

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.040
someone gets a physical injury.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.040
This is the mechanism
by which emotional pain

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.330
can cause physical pain.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:10.680
And children who grow up feeling
unsafe for whatever reason,

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.134
parental abuse, or neglect,
or all sorts of things

00:15:14.134 --> 00:15:15.300
that can happen to children.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.480
The feeling of growing
up unsafe sensitizes

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.865
that danger and alarm
mechanism in the brain

00:15:20.865 --> 00:15:23.730
that then can be
activated later in life

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:27.660
by another life stressful
event or by a physical injury,

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.400
such as a car accident.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.660
And so this whole
variety of pain syndromes

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.370
that are the commonest
pain syndromes

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:43.060
we have are all associated
with childhood adversity.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:49.480
And when you scan the brain
of people who have back pain,

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.380
what happens is--

00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:55.730
these are people who had back
pain that was persistent,

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:56.780
chronic.

00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:01.820
And the somatosensory areas of
the brain go down to normal.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.420
But the emotional laden
areas of the brain go up.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:11.300
In chronic pain, it's not
particularly a physical problem

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:15.400
for most people,
which is shocking.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.700
And so there's this
whole range of syndromes

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.860
that all hang together.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.810
The chance that a
tension or migraine

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:26.570
headache is due to a
structural problem in the brain

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:30.290
is 2% or 3%.

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:32.900
The vast majority of people
with tension migraine headaches,

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:36.170
fibromyalgia, irritable bowel,
most pelvic pain syndromes

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:40.640
do not have structural
problems in their body.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.190
And studies show that
approximately 85%

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:45.890
of people with neck
or back pain do not

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:48.560
have a clearly identifiable
structural cause

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.620
for that pain--

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.367
85%.

00:16:51.367 --> 00:16:52.200
And that's shocking.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:01.770
So what happens is, is that
you may have somebody who is--

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:03.660
let's say their father was--

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:04.770
I'll exaggerate a little.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:10.470
My father-- I'm
talking about me now--

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.079
was kind of critical,
and could be

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:14.819
judgmental, a little bit harsh.

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:16.379
And you have a
sensitive young boy

00:17:16.379 --> 00:17:17.670
growing up in that environment.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:19.440
It certainly wasn't abusive.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:23.560
But the danger pathway becomes
a little bit sensitized.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:27.599
And then you get to internship.

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:31.534
So first day of my internship,
I'm a terrified young doctor.

00:17:31.534 --> 00:17:32.575
I start getting diarrhea.

00:17:32.575 --> 00:17:34.560
It lasts for six months.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.080
Something about being a doctor
simply scared the crap out

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.670
of me.

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:44.350
And so the danger mechanism,
then, is producing a symptom.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:47.860
Then I decide, oh,
here's a good idea.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:50.490
I'll have kids.

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:54.110
I'll try to get
promoted in my job.

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:56.610
I'll start doing research.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.490
I'll start working on national
committees, great idea.

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:01.770
All of these things
are great ideas.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:02.880
But they cause stress.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.860
And then my neck starts to hurt.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.470
And I wake up in the morning,
and I go to work like this.

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:09.320
You ever see anybody
go to work like this?

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.710
It's pretty common.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:12.810
And what do they all say?

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:13.830
I slept on it wrong.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.750
That's what I said for years.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:18.540
And my MRI shows these
bulging disks, and arthritis,

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.100
and all this stuff.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.140
And I still have these
bulging disks in my neck.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.920
But I don't have any pain now.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.800
And then what if I
get in a little car

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.530
accident, fender bender?

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:34.980
And then I begin to
get other things,

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.440
or something else
happens in your life.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.120
And then it can just
spiral from there.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.440
Because what happens is that
the experience of having pain

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.620
further activates the danger
alarm mechanism, which

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.850
activates more pain.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:52.410
So it's a vicious cycle of
pain, leading to fear of pain,

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:54.120
leading to more pain.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.730
And that describes why many
people with chronic pain

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:58.690
get worse over time.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:02.130
And their pain tends to spread,
like from their lower back

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:04.590
to their middle back, or to
their neck, or to their belly,

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:06.900
like the guy that I
was telling you about.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.139
And so what I explain to
people is injuries send signals

00:19:12.139 --> 00:19:12.680
to the brain.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.150
And the brain has to decide.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:16.250
When I say the brain,
these are processes

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:18.050
that are happening
completely outside

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:19.940
of our conscious awareness.

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.880
That's why American horror
stories is apt analogy.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.110
Because people move
into this house.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:26.510
It's haunted.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:27.890
And everything is
out of control.

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:29.970
Things are happening to them.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:32.090
And people stuck in this
spiral, like the patient

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:33.650
I was telling you
about, feel like things

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:35.420
are happening to them
that are completely

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.260
outside of their control.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.270
And it's their brain
that is doing it

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:42.400
at a subconscious level.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.850
And emotional injury can
activate the danger signal

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.417
in exactly the same
way as physical injury.

00:19:47.417 --> 00:19:49.500
And then pain becomes
learned as a neural pathway.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:57.060
So when I evaluate
patients with pain--

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:59.490
and I should
mention other things

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:00.670
that are connected to this.

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:08.740
So people with fatigue,
insomnia, anxiety, depression

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.030
are common ones.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:14.330
But if we're talking about
pain, my job, number one,

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:20.000
is this a structural problem,
like, you fell on your wrist,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.160
it's broken, you need a cast?

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.040
Or is it a neural
pathway problem?

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.930
Because pain is a message
that our brain is giving us.

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:29.740
It's our job to encode it.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:33.400
I saw a woman a few years ago
who had pain in her butt right

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.181
here.

00:20:34.181 --> 00:20:35.680
And I said, well,
when did it start?

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.660
She said, well, right about
the time my husband retired.

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.690
And if you think about it--

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.400
you guys aren't
thinking about it.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.170
Are you thinking about it?

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:49.590
That's a very different message.

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.810
So my first job is to rule
out a structural disorder.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:54.180
The guy that we're
talking about,

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.980
he had had everything
done to him

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.360
that could be done structurally.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.664
Nothing had helped.

00:20:58.664 --> 00:20:59.580
He had a bulging disk.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:00.660
They already fixed it.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.451
They fixed things that
weren't even broken.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.570
And so he had no
evidence of nerve damage.

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:10.280
There was no evidence that
he had a structural problem.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.830
So now my second
job is to say, well,

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:14.650
if we can rule out a
structural problem,

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:17.230
maybe we can rule
in a neural pathway

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:20.504
or a brain-induced problem.

00:21:20.504 --> 00:21:24.060
Well, this is a very
important slide.

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.010
It's a meta analysis,
3,300 people,

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:28.080
a bunch of studies
lumped together.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:33.400
If you take completely
healthy, pain-free 30-year-olds

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:39.360
and you give them MRIs, 50% of
them have disc degeneration.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:43.200
40% have bulging disks
completely pain-free.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:47.040
If you take 50-year-olds,
those numbers are 80% and 60%.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.560
And if you get to be the
ripe old age like me,

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.020
we're talking
about 90% of people

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:56.250
have degenerative disk, DDD,
Degenerative Disk Disease

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:57.240
like it's a disease.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.450
The vast majority of
adults have abnormal MRIs

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.170
that are not the cause of pain.

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:05.780
And doctors know
this information.

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:07.040
It's not a secret.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.740
They just don't know what to do
with it, how to interpret it,

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:13.390
how to apply it, in general.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:16.660
And so what were the messages
that this patient that I

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.360
was telling you about was
getting from his doctors?

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.590
The messages were,
you're damaged.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.650
There is a problem here.

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:25.737
It might be genetic.

00:22:25.737 --> 00:22:26.320
We don't know.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.778
We tried to fix
it, but we couldn't

00:22:27.778 --> 00:22:29.980
fix it, which leads to no hope.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:34.100
No hope leads to more pain,
because of the vicious cycle.

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.320
So what are the clues?

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:39.580
So we're looking at, do
people have a variety

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.130
of symptoms over time?

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:43.480
It was headaches, and
then it was stomach pain,

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.960
and then it was back pain,
or neck pain, or insomnia.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.730
Do people have adverse
childhood events

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:50.740
that maybe has primed
that danger alarm

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.180
mechanism in their brain?

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.000
And do people have
this tendency to want

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.840
to please, to be
perfectionistic,

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.830
to care what other people
think about them, to be overly

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:05.680
conscientious and responsible--

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.630
kind of like you
guys, kind of like me.

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:10.380
And that's good.

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.005
Those are the best
people in the world.

00:23:12.005 --> 00:23:15.780
But when we put more
pressure on ourselves,

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:19.650
we have more tendency to
activate this fear and danger

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.890
mechanism, the danger
alarm mechanism.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:25.470
And then we're looking
at, what was going on

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:28.800
in your life or their
life at the time

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.550
that symptom A started, at the
time that symptom B started,

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:33.701
et cetera?

00:23:33.701 --> 00:23:35.700
And then we're looking
at a distribution pattern

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.750
from a medical point of view.

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:37.500
Someone has pain.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.709
It starts in the left top
of the head, the left side.

00:23:39.709 --> 00:23:42.208
It goes all the way down to the
left torso, all the way down

00:23:42.208 --> 00:23:43.180
the left leg.

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.590
There is no disease
that does that.

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.412
There's no disease that has
pain from in the morning,

00:23:48.412 --> 00:23:50.370
and then it goes away by
2:00 in the afternoon,

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:51.994
and then it's gone
the rest of the day.

00:23:51.994 --> 00:23:53.650
There's no disease
that does that.

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:57.220
And so we have to understand
that we can evaluate people

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.530
and rule in brain-induced pain.

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:02.650
So what happens with an injury?

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:03.400
You get an injury.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.210
It hurts.

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:06.610
And then it gets better
over two days, or five days,

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:07.630
or a couple of weeks.

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:10.850
Fractures take
six weeks to heal.

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:12.020
But what we see--

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:15.860
and you can diagnose people
in your family and friends

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.440
very easily by saying, oh, I
got an injury, it never healed.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.330
Well, how likely is that?

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:21.970
Probably not.

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:24.280
If the pain is continuing
and worsening over time

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:28.900
after a fairly mild injury,
that's not the normal pattern.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:33.280
That's not
structurally-induced pain.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.500
The pain shifts from one
area of the body to another.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.810
Fibromyalgia is
classic for that.

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:38.890
The pain is in the arms.

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:40.570
And then the next
day, it's in the legs.

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:41.890
It can shift on a dime.

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:44.325
Because neural pathways
can turn on and turn off,

00:24:44.325 --> 00:24:45.700
which is the beauty
of what I do.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.170
Because people can get better.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.460
Symptoms spread, as I mentioned,
often bilateral lateral.

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.310
The brain often says, well,
I hurt my right wrist.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:57.560
And now my left
wrist is hurting.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.960
That's a red flag for me.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.820
Social contagion, we
talked about that.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.380
There is a study from Germany.

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:06.080
The Berlin Wall came
down in 1989, I believe.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:09.560
In 1991, they started studying
back pain in East Germany

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.651
and West Germany,
these two populations.

00:25:11.651 --> 00:25:13.400
And the West German
back pain was up here.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.870
And the East German
back pain was down here.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.536
And over time, the
East German back pain

00:25:16.536 --> 00:25:18.740
just rose to the level
of West German back pain

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.444
as those cultures mixed.

00:25:20.444 --> 00:25:22.610
And the conclusion of the
article was that back pain

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:25.690
is a contagious disorder--

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.770
interesting.

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:29.660
Not all cultures have
the amount of back pain

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.390
that we have in this culture.

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:33.289
A friend of mine was
a doctor in Iraq.

00:25:33.289 --> 00:25:35.330
And when he came here, he
said, why does everyone

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:36.800
have back pain here?

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.451
People don't come to the
doctor for back pain in Iraq.

00:25:39.451 --> 00:25:39.950
I know.

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:42.350
Maybe they have other
problems, but they

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:44.630
did come to the doctor
for their other problems.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.270
They just didn't
come for back pain.

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:50.220
So that's the kind
of work that I do.

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.250
So back to this guy, our friend.

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:53.095
He's an engineer.

00:25:53.095 --> 00:25:54.470
He's from Detroit--
so everyone's

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:57.590
an engineer-- but not a computer
engineer, auto engineer.

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:00.050
Of course, a lot
of auto engineers

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:02.270
actually are computer
engineers now.

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:03.530
His wife works part-time.

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:04.580
He's got two kids.

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:08.030
He didn't have a particularly
adverse childhood.

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:09.412
But he was sensitive.

00:26:09.412 --> 00:26:11.120
He noticed he had
stomach pains before he

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:14.000
had to do school presentations.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.720
The onset of his headaches
and the buttock pain

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:21.770
coincided with his first
position in his new job.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:23.720
The marriage was rocky at times.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.620
But about eight years
ago, when the back pain

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.620
started, which
spread to neck pain,

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:30.050
his company was sold,
increase in workload,

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:31.740
concern about keeping his job.

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.960
There was the recession, puts
a lot of pressure on himself.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:38.180
He started going to work,
7:00 AM, and then 6:00 AM,

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:41.090
and then 5:00 AM.

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:43.340
And he started getting
pain, because his brain

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:46.170
was sending him a message.

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:48.770
So here's the kicker for him.

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:52.500
He goes on vacation,
pain goes away.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.440
That's solid evidence.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.980
He spent a week camping
on a hard ground

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.510
and his back was fine.

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.280
And that tells me everything
that I need to know.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.360
The other thing he
noticed is is that he

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.110
didn't notice that his
back pain was worse

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:08.340
in stressful situations.

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.100
But he did notice that
his stomach discomfort

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:15.309
was related to stressful
situations at work or at home.

00:27:15.309 --> 00:27:17.100
And he also noticed,
when his stomach hurt,

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:18.960
his back didn't hurt.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.810
And that's another
more positive evidence

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:23.320
for neural pathway pain.

00:27:25.742 --> 00:27:27.200
I want to shift
gears for a second.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:31.840
This is a study we
published last week.

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.180
It's an NIH-funded trial.

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.370
It was directed by an
extraordinary colleague

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:39.610
that I have, Mark Lumley
at Wayne State University.

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:42.880
And we randomized 230
people with fibromyalgia,

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.280
who have severe and chronic
pain but no tissue damage

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:48.490
in the body, to three groups.

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:50.830
And this was a three-arm study.

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:54.670
The first group, the first arm
got education for fibromyalgia

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:56.270
as a control group.

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:59.740
The second arm got the
standard pain psychology,

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:02.800
cognitive behavioral
therapy done

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.890
by our excellent colleagues
at the University of Michigan,

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:08.920
specifically designed
for fibromyalgia.

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.872
And the third arm was an
arm that Mark and I devised.

00:28:11.872 --> 00:28:14.080
And we based it on the work
of one of our colleagues,

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:18.790
Dr. Allan Abbass,
And in this group,

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:20.650
we talked to people
about the connection

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:22.880
between emotions and pain.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.450
And we asked them to
do the difficult work

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:30.280
of looking at, recognizing,
experiencing, and expressing,

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.590
and processing emotions
that they may have avoided

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:37.974
in their lives such as anger,
guilt, sadness, and compassion.

00:28:37.974 --> 00:28:39.640
And we didn't know
if people were really

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.770
going to engage in this
kind of thing anyway.

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:43.870
Because it's not the standard.

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:45.940
In cognitive behavior
therapy, the idea

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:49.500
is to help you cope
better with the pain.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:54.090
We're talking about getting
to an underlying mechanism.

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:56.340
What we found was striking.

00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:02.040
At a six-month follow-up
after the treatment,

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.890
the people in the emotional
expression and awareness group

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:09.060
had significantly higher rates
of dramatic, more than 50%,

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:13.570
pain reduction compared
to the other two groups.

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:20.130
And I don't know how much you
know about medical statistics.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:22.770
But the number needed
to treat was 7.

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:26.911
So if you go to your doctor
and your cholesterol is high--

00:29:26.911 --> 00:29:28.410
and you've never
had a heart attack.

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:29.760
Your cholesterol is high,
and your doctor says,

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.590
here, I want to
take this medication

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:32.934
to lower your cholesterol.

00:29:32.934 --> 00:29:35.100
What's the chance that that
medication will actually

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.560
help you?

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:41.410
In that situation, the number
needed to treat is 100.

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:46.080
That means 1 out of 100 would
be likely to not get the heart

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.800
attack.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.380
So we do that every day.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.150
This is a number
needed to treat of 7.

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:57.030
It's a very powerful effect, in
terms of medical interventions.

00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:00.390
And we also found that
changes in widespread pain

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:03.600
index, the emotional
awareness and expression arm

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:07.010
was better than the CBT arm.

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:11.210
And in terms of the percentage
of people who actually still

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:13.670
met the criteria
for the disorder

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:17.120
at the end of the
study, was much less

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.750
in the emotional expression arm.

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:21.680
This is the first large-scale
study to our knowledge

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.350
to show that one psychological
intervention for pain

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:28.220
is actually superior to
any other psychological

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:31.560
intervention.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.940
So what have we learned?

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:36.320
Well, a lot of people with
pain have issues in their lives

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.360
from childhood and onward.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.910
Pain is connected to emotions.

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:46.700
And this kind of therapy does
better than the standard.

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:48.980
And this, we think,
is a landmark study

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.490
in a lot of ways.

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:52.760
And this study doesn't even
include the whole range

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:56.060
of therapy that I'm going
to talk to you about that we

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.410
give for this guy.

00:30:57.410 --> 00:30:59.360
This is another study,
just an outcome study

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:03.770
we published from data from
my work and my program.

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:07.070
And in these people with
roughly half with back pain,

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:10.370
half of with fibromyalgia , the
average duration of pain was

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:11.120
nine years.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.554
The average duration of pain
in this sample was nine years.

00:31:14.554 --> 00:31:16.970
And these people, when they
go to pain management clinics,

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:22.530
usually don't get much in the
way of actual pain reduction.

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:26.160
But in our sample, 2/3
of them had at least 30%

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:26.910
pain reduction.

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:33.300
And over half had more
than 50% pain reduction.

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.600
So it's a different paradigm.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:39.620
The paradigm that all pain
is due to injury in the body

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:42.470
and is simply
reflected in the brain

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:46.140
is not working for people
with brain-induced symptoms.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.300
We need a different paradigm.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.660
And if you're aware of
the history of science,

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.820
paradigms don't shift easily.

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:55.940
It can take decades
for a paradigm,

00:31:55.940 --> 00:32:00.470
for an idea that
initially seems completely

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:06.160
counter-intuitive to
go to totally obvious.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.740
Plate tectonics, the idea
that the continents were

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.515
all together and
one thing, you can

00:32:10.515 --> 00:32:11.890
see-- if you look
at the map, you

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:14.380
can see how they fit together
like a puzzle, right?

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:17.950
It took 50 years for
scientists to agree that that's

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:20.040
what had happened, 50 years.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:20.990
And it's obvious.

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:23.150
You can see it.

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:26.770
So the symptoms of
this disorder are real.

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:28.630
But they're not damaging.

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:30.160
The brain has been sensitized.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.760
And the brain has the
power to produce even very

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.250
severe symptoms.

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:38.320
And most people have,
at least to some degree.

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.900
It's a very common phenomenon.

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.570
We believe that the majority
of people with chronic pain

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:46.990
have this phenomenon and
are being treated by an old.

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:48.630
paradigm.

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:51.850
Yet skepticism
continues to abound.

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:53.562
What do we do?

00:32:53.562 --> 00:32:55.270
The interventions are
straightforward and

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:57.040
inexpensive.

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.852
The most important
one is understanding

00:32:59.852 --> 00:33:01.060
that this is what's going on.

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:05.020
Because people who get
it, who understand, like,

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.610
oh, my goodness,
I'm not damaged,

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:08.740
I'm not broken,
I can get better,

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:14.895
that allows them to do the work
of detaching from the symptoms.

00:33:14.895 --> 00:33:17.520
Whereas people who are under the
belief that they were actually

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:21.190
damaged, it's very
hard to do that.

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:24.630
And so the idea is that people
need to really understand.

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:27.660
And that's why I spend so
much time examining people,

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:30.090
and listening to their
story, and looking

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:33.960
for those details that are
going to make or break the case,

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.730
so to speak.

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:39.550
So this is a woman
who I never met.

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:42.690
She says, 21 months
post-op, third back surgery,

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:44.010
3-level fusion--

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:45.540
doesn't sound good--

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:48.900
21 months trying every therapy
to get out of enormous,

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:52.740
unrelenting back pain, on
top of 22 years of chronic,

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:55.050
limiting back pain, no success.

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:57.330
My doctor sent me a
link to your website.

00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:59.640
That's my website-- six days.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:02.850
I considered the possibility
that this could apply to me.

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:03.414
I came back.

00:34:03.414 --> 00:34:04.080
I read it again.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.730
I said, oh, my god, that's me!

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:06.240
I see it.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.060
It's obvious-- paradigm shift.

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:11.310
And what happened to her pain?

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:13.820
It just went down.

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:16.587
Most people don't have
that kind of response.

00:34:16.587 --> 00:34:18.920
But when you have the response
that you actually get it,

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.739
and you see the paradigm shift,
and you see what's going on,

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:26.449
then you have the opportunity
to get completely better.

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:28.940
And she had a dramatic effect
just from understanding

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:30.860
and learning about this model.

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.810
And then she said,
well, I started walking.

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:34.768
Before I could barely
walk around the building.

00:34:34.768 --> 00:34:35.900
But I kept telling myself--

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:37.310
what did she tell herself?

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:38.659
I can walk.

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:39.880
I can walk.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.199
I'm OK.

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:42.650
I'm not damaged.

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:44.630
And she starts walking.

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:47.929
And she says, well, forgive
me for being effusive.

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:52.000
But going from crippled,
to fearful, bewildered,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.889
discouraged, bordering on
despair to regaining my life,

00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:59.700
this is kind of a minor miracle.

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:03.810
So once people get the idea
and understand what's going on,

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:08.250
then they can begin to reduce
the danger alarm mechanism.

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:12.270
They can begin to worry
less about the pain,

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:15.450
stop anticipating it,
stop monitoring it,

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:17.760
stop allowing the
pain to dominate their

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.400
every thought and
every action, begin

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.760
to reengage in physical and
social activities despite pain,

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.256
knowing that they
actually can, knowing

00:35:26.256 --> 00:35:27.630
that they're not
damaged, knowing

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:30.170
that they can get better.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:33.129
And I'm going to talk about
mindfulness in a minute.

00:35:33.129 --> 00:35:33.920
So this is a woman.

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.924
She said, I had a
huge success today.

00:35:35.924 --> 00:35:37.340
I was determined
to go for a walk,

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:38.580
but my back was killing me.

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.600
So I said to my brain, I'm
going for a walk today.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:45.480
You can either make this easy
or you can make this difficult.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.099
But we're going.

00:35:47.099 --> 00:35:48.890
It's kind of like those
old gangster movies

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:50.181
they say you're, going to talk.

00:35:50.181 --> 00:35:52.260
You can either make
it easy or difficult,

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.840
but you're going to talk.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.370
And she's saying
to her brain, look,

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:56.578
this is how it's going to be.

00:35:56.578 --> 00:36:00.020
We have the ability to
change our neural pathways.

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:02.750
Because the brain
neural-plastic.

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:06.150
As we think differently,
as we act differently,

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:09.274
we can sooth the brain
and calm that danger alarm

00:36:09.274 --> 00:36:10.940
mechanism, which is
kind of like calming

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:13.250
a child who's really upset.

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:14.810
And if you keep
doing it, and you

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:19.470
keep working at it, what happens
is most people get better.

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:21.500
And then there's
emotion-focused techniques.

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:24.260
And I don't have time to
talk too much about that.

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:26.840
But one of the simplest
things that anybody can do

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:30.020
is get out a piece of
paper and start writing.

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:32.300
You can write a letter
to anybody you want,

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.705
dead or alive.

00:36:33.705 --> 00:36:34.580
And you can shred it.

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.970
So you can say
anything you want.

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:40.087
And it's a very healing process.

00:36:40.087 --> 00:36:41.420
This is a woman who wrote to me.

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:46.430
This is a woman in Germany
who was working this program.

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:50.590
And she said, well, I did my
first writing exercise, tears

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:52.580
streaming down my face.

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:55.300
I was finished, my whole
body was screaming with pain,

00:36:55.300 --> 00:37:00.580
no, you can't stand facing that
So she had activated emotions.

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:03.710
And her pain went
from here to here.

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:05.830
And then she did
something brilliant.

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:09.640
She wrote a letter to her brain
saying, yes, I can face it.

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.440
I'm capable of doing this.

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:12.070
It's OK.

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:15.260
I am allowing myself
to feel emotions.

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:17.170
We're afraid of emotions, often.

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:19.270
And we avoid them at all costs.

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:22.120
And then her pain
just dissipated

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.260
as she did this work.

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.360
It's amazing.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:29.520
And this kind of
thing, it's really hard

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.190
to understand unless it's
actually happened to you.

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:34.410
When it's happened to you,
you go, oh, my god, that's

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:36.239
unbelievable.

00:37:36.239 --> 00:37:37.780
But in the abstract,
it's like, yeah,

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:39.363
that's probably true
for other people.

00:37:39.363 --> 00:37:40.870
But my pain's real.

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:46.620
And so mindfulness
is everywhere.

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.970
I've been a teacher of
mindfulness for 17 years now.

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:51.430
And I'm passionate about it.

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:53.970
I think everyone should
learn mindfulness.

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:56.540
But the data on mindfulness
for chronic pain

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.370
shows it has small effects.

00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:00.620
It's not particularly effective.

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:02.060
And the reason is
the same reason

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:04.250
that cognitive behavioral
therapy suffers.

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:06.930
Because we're not looking
at the underlying cause.

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:10.040
So we're using mindfulness to
cope better with chronic pain,

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.820
as opposed to understanding
that mindfulness can actually

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:18.380
be the key to relieving
it, to resolving it,

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:23.470
once you know that it's
actually a product of the mind.

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:26.860
If the pain is a product of the
mind, then mindfulness works.

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:30.500
Because now you're noticing
it with detachment.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:32.480
Now you're noticing that
you're tolerating it.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.500
You're accepting it.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.270
And it doesn't bother you.

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:37.190
You don't care as much anymore.

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:39.770
And that turns off the
danger alarm mechanism.

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:42.350
Is a very powerful intervention.

00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:43.880
And then lastly,
sometimes people

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.340
need to make changes
in their life.

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:48.230
They need to do something.

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:55.910
If there's a difficult
marriage, or a job, or neighbor

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:57.650
situation, or
something, sometimes you

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:02.530
have to take action and deal
with it as best as possible.

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:04.620
So what about our friend?

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:06.260
Well, initially, it
was kind of hard.

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:08.820
It's like, people have been
telling me for eight years

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:11.940
how damaged I am,
how bad my back is.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:14.250
And it takes time to
go over the evidence,

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:18.720
and explain, and apply
it, and personalize it,

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:23.370
and to care, and to show
that you actually care,

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:28.060
and that you're doing
everything that you can.

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:30.580
And when he sees
that, he's much more

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:34.770
likely to trust you
and believe you.

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:36.572
And so we started
doing that work.

00:39:36.572 --> 00:39:37.780
And he had his ups and downs.

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:41.400
Initially, his pain
got worse as he

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.680
started to do this work,
because he's shaking things up

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:48.000
and this danger alarm-- like
the woman with the writing.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.310
But he persisted
in the conviction

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:52.770
that he wasn't damaged,
that he could get better.

00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:55.710
And about four months later,
he was basically pain-free.

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:58.890
He was fine after eight
years, back pain, neck pain,

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:04.690
and stomach pain all caused by
the same underlying mechanism.

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:06.370
And these would
recur at odd times.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:07.510
Every now and then,
all of the sudden,

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:09.468
he would get an ache, or
a twinge, or whatever.

00:40:09.468 --> 00:40:11.560
And what's going on?

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:17.010
His brain just going, like,
oh, I remember that, zing.

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:18.570
And then you get the pain.

00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:20.910
But he knows what it is now.

00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:24.350
He doesn't immediately go to
fear, or frustration, or worry.

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:27.660
He says, oh, that's
my brain, no big deal.

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:29.730
Goes on, it goes away.

00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:33.060
Or when he has a
stressful life event,

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:36.130
the pain comes as a message.

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:38.390
We need pain.

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:40.160
Pain is very important.

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:43.930
And so it serves as a
protective mechanism.

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:46.450
Children who grow up without
the ability to feel pain

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:50.240
often die at an early age.

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.100
So we need pain.

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:54.980
And in his case, he's
got a great barometer.

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:56.844
Whenever his stomach
is bothering him,

00:40:56.844 --> 00:40:58.760
he's going, like, oh,
maybe I should check out

00:40:58.760 --> 00:40:59.960
what's going on in my life.

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.160
Because something
is bothering me.

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.020
And that's a gift.

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.470
So research now
confirms that all pain

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:10.520
is a protective mechanism
by neural pathways.

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:12.530
It can be triggered
by structural disorder

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:17.660
or by simply the neural
pathways in the brain.

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:20.090
And a significant proportion
of pain that we have

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:21.650
is brain-induced.

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:25.250
MRI findings are often
not correlated with pain.

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:28.940
And we can make this distinction
between structural pain

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:31.130
versus nonstructural
pain. or sometimes

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:33.670
it's a combination of the two--

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:36.230
because the treatments
are radically different.

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:38.110
And reversal of
this syndrome can

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:41.890
occur when you combine
an understanding of it,

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:44.380
when you combine the
cognitive, behavioral,

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:49.260
and the emotional interventions,
the results can be dramatic.

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:51.944
So as I said, paradigms
don't shift easily.

00:41:51.944 --> 00:41:53.610
As Sherlock Holmes
said, there's nothing

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:56.100
more deceptive than
an obvious fact.

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.990
You just hearing what
you heard today--

00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:00.600
and maybe you knew
all this stuff.

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:05.550
But you will run into people
with this syndrome frequently.

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:06.990
It's that common.

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:09.240
And it's easy to
recognize when you just

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:11.530
know what you're looking for.

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:13.250
And how are most
people going to react

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:16.000
if you happen to mention it?

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.690
Disbelief and outright
rejection, that's happens.

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:22.870
But the more people who
understand pain the way

00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:25.795
you do now, the more likely
the paradigm will shift.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.990
This website, the TMS Wiki is a
nonprofit website clearinghouse

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:34.940
for information on this.

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:42.290
The next URL is for a
three-minute, animated video

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:44.720
made by my colleague,
John Gordon.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:48.620
And there's a bunch of
books that all explain this.

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:50.850
And what happens,
a lot of times,

00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:52.560
is people initially
reject the idea.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:53.990
But then they hear
about it from somebody.

00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:55.410
And then somebody else
happens to mention.

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:56.951
And somebody else
happens to mention.

00:42:56.951 --> 00:42:59.620
Eventually, they take a look.

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:02.660
And eventually, they
look at themselves.

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:06.240
And it's hard to
do, to self-reflect.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:09.160
But the bottom line is
that the rain of pain

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:11.890
lies mainly in the brain.

00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:15.580
So thank you for
letting me be here.

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:18.795
And I'll be happy
to answer questions.

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:26.223
Yeah?

00:43:26.223 --> 00:43:27.973
AUDIENCE: How can we
help our children not

00:43:27.973 --> 00:43:30.720
follow these patterns
in the first place?

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:34.500
HOWARD SCHUBINER: Yeah, they've
got to find their own way.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:41.575
Well, I mean, children
mirror what their parents do.

00:43:41.575 --> 00:43:43.700
And if the parent has always
got a bad back, that's

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.230
going to set up
in the kid's mind,

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:46.974
like, oh, yeah, when
I have a problem,

00:43:46.974 --> 00:43:48.140
my back was started hurting.

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:52.430
So we have to be
careful about that.

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:57.675
We have to be careful about
giving a pill for everything.

00:43:57.675 --> 00:43:59.300
There's a woman in
Maryland who came up

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:01.301
with obecalp, which is
placebo spelled backward,

00:44:01.301 --> 00:44:03.633
to give to kids when they had
a tummy aches to give them

00:44:03.633 --> 00:44:04.250
a pill.

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:04.970
It's a placebo.

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:07.440
Like, why would you do that?

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:11.020
I have a friend who was
on vacation with his son.

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:12.970
And the parents were divorced.

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:14.310
And they were doing this hike.

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:15.945
And the kid's stomach
started hurting.

00:44:15.945 --> 00:44:17.320
And they're going,
like, what did

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:20.840
you eat, through every physical
thing that you can think of.

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:23.810
And finally, he says,
OK, I got to ask.

00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:26.680
I've got to say, is there
something bothering you, buddy?

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:28.570
No, no, everything's fine.

00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:29.184
OK.

00:44:29.184 --> 00:44:30.850
Is there something
bothering you, buddy?

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:32.545
No, no, everything's fine.

00:44:32.545 --> 00:44:34.660
Is something on your mind?

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:37.920
He goes, I miss my mom.

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.900
And so just the idea
of understanding

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.180
that-- and he goes,
yeah, I miss her, too.

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.672
But you'll be seeing her soon.

00:44:43.672 --> 00:44:44.880
And we'll write her a letter.

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:47.850
And we'll save FaceTime
her tonight or whatever.

00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:51.160
And then he's running
around, and he's fine.

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:53.790
And so the more we
understand, the more

00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:56.940
we can bring our kids
up to understand.

00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:57.610
Other questions?

00:44:57.610 --> 00:44:58.110
Yeah?

00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:00.195
AUDIENCE: Is there
other methods that you

00:45:00.195 --> 00:45:02.600
found that we can use to,
like, reframe the way the

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.170
we interpret structural pain?

00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:07.140
HOWARD SCHUBINER:
Are you saying that,

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:10.560
can we use the mind to help
structurally-induced pain?

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:11.610
Is that the question?

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:12.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's correct.

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:13.650
HOWARD SCHUBINER: Yeah, well,
you can use the same things.

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:14.970
I mean, the brain--

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:16.886
you know, the guy with
the needle in his hand.

00:45:16.886 --> 00:45:18.900
The brain can, actually,
reduce structural pain.

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:22.090
And so studies
show, for example,

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:27.410
when someone gets a
pain that's intentional,

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:30.550
it hurts a lot more
than if it's accidental.

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:37.640
And there's something else
I was going to tell you.

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:41.480
We know that you can
tolerate a severe pain if you

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:42.650
think it's for a short time.

00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:46.010
But it's almost intolerable
to tolerate a minor pain

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:47.850
if you think it's forever.

00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:54.330
And so framing how we view the
pain as, how damaging is it,

00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:56.720
and how much can we
do, and how much do we

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.697
want to focus on living
our life, as opposed

00:45:58.697 --> 00:46:00.030
to letting the pain dominate it?

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:03.230
So at least what we can do with
structure of pain is, at least,

00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:04.790
hopefully, prevent
it from falling

00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:07.100
into the vicious cycle of
it getting worse and worse

00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:12.500
over time because of increased
fear, monitoring, anticipation,

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.858
and worrying about it.

00:46:14.858 --> 00:46:16.290
Yeah?

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:17.572
Yeah?

00:46:17.572 --> 00:46:24.691
AUDIENCE: The example you
gave of the [INAUDIBLE] pain

00:46:24.691 --> 00:46:25.930
from the shrapnel.

00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:28.359
HOWARD SCHUBINER: Yeah,
yeah, the Vietnam veteran.

00:46:28.359 --> 00:46:29.984
AUDIENCE: You said
it sort of came back

00:46:29.984 --> 00:46:31.390
in a very small period of time.

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:32.348
HOWARD SCHUBINER: Yeah.

00:46:32.348 --> 00:46:35.660
AUDIENCE: How does he solve
that, and puts that kind of--

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:38.950
HOWARD SCHUBINER:
It came and went.

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:40.900
His brain just turned
it on for that moment

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:44.980
by that association,
so that, for him, it

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:46.240
wasn't an ongoing pain.

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.520
It was just a short-lived.

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:50.170
It just is a great
illustration of how

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:53.890
the brain learns pain, remembers
pain, and then can activate it.

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:55.750
A lot of pain is triggered.

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:57.760
It becomes a
conditioned response.

00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:00.460
So I say, I know I have
a problem with my back

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:02.420
because every time I turn here.

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:06.844
But the way the brain works is a
model called predictive coding.

00:47:06.844 --> 00:47:09.010
So if the brain thinks
something is going to happen,

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:10.480
it will create it.

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:13.830
So we used to think
that, when you stand up,

00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:17.167
that as you stood up, there's
a sensor in the carotid artery

00:47:17.167 --> 00:47:19.000
that would send signals
to the brain to say,

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.390
oh, you're standing up.

00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:24.160
Brain, send more blood to
the brain so we don't faint.

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.130
It turns out, when you
think about standing up,

00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:29.390
the brain activates
that mechanism.

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:34.330
So the brain is predicting ahead
of time what it needs to do.

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:37.780
And so every time you bend over,
your brain is predicting pain.

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:39.190
And it will do it.

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:42.160
So people with typing, the brain
is predicting pain with typing.

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:45.070
Brain is predicting pain
when they're sitting.

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:47.980
And these are conditioned
responses, Pavlovian responses,

00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:51.170
actually, that we can
work to eradicate.

00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:52.280
I had a lot of back pain.

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:54.370
And every time I
bent over, it hurt.

00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:57.010
And when I figured
out that it wasn't

00:47:57.010 --> 00:48:00.380
my back, every time I bent
over, I just said to myself,

00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:00.880
I'm fine.

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:01.420
I'm OK.

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:02.690
This won't hurt.

00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:06.220
And you do that enough
times, and your brain finally

00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:06.940
gets the message.

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:11.060
And it turns off that
conditioned response.

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:12.225
It's fascinating.

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:15.860
Yeah?

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:18.458
AUDIENCE: Is there any concern
that this kind of treatment

00:48:18.458 --> 00:48:23.290
will impair people from feeling
necessary or useful pain?

00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:25.150
HOWARD SCHUBINER:
You can't stop pain.

00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:27.077
I mean, people get
pain all the time.

00:48:27.077 --> 00:48:29.410
The main thing is that people
always ask, who say, well,

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:30.640
how do I know if
it's real or not?

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:31.410
How do I know?

00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:32.620
And we say, use common sense.

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:34.280
If you fell, you hurt yourself.

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:36.730
And when I get pain and
I don't know what it is,

00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:39.100
I go to the doctor
and try to make sure.

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:42.900
But with common sense, if
it's not getting better,

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:47.780
or you just kind of investigate
it, then you can tell.

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:52.410
But pain is not going
away any time soon.

00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:57.120
That mechanism is pretty
well wired, so to speak.

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:02.510
So I have a couple more
things I can tell you,

00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:04.650
a couple of more little
stories, if you don't mind.

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:05.740
And then we can wind up.

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:06.530
We'll be on time.

00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:08.930
We'll be even early.

00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:14.211
So I flew here
yesterday from Detroit.

00:49:14.211 --> 00:49:16.840
I get up early in the
morning, get in my car,

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:18.550
drive to the airport,
get on the plane.

00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:19.840
Everything's fine.

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:20.610
I'm on the plane.

00:49:20.610 --> 00:49:22.330
I'm walking up and down.

00:49:22.330 --> 00:49:25.690
I get my bag, get in the
car, get to the hotel.

00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:27.270
Everything's fine.

00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:31.240
I get out of the car at my
hotel, and I start walking.

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:34.420
And all of the sudden,
I have this sharp pain

00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:37.240
in the bottom of my big
toe and my right foot.

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:38.970
It's like a needle
is sticking in it.

00:49:38.970 --> 00:49:41.080
This is a sharp pain.

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:43.465
And every time I
step down, it hurts.

00:49:43.465 --> 00:49:45.010
And I'm like, what the heck?

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:49.400
What could possibly be wrong
from all day it was fine,

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:51.650
and all of the sudden, I've
got this needle-like pain?

00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:56.080
So my mind-body-doctor brain is
going, like, OK, what's wrong?

00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:57.700
You don't like the hotel?

00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:59.590
Or you're giving
a talk tomorrow,

00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:01.250
maybe you're nervous about that.

00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:03.500
What's going on?

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:07.860
And then my medical
doctor side says, god,

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:12.040
it feels like you got
something in your foot.

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:16.390
And then by my human side
says, dang, this hurts.

00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:17.340
So I go up.

00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:18.590
And I get into the hotel.

00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:19.690
I'm at the registration.

00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:20.742
I check in.

00:50:20.742 --> 00:50:21.700
And I'm standing there.

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:23.500
And then I put a little
pressure on my toe.

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:25.280
And it's fine.

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:26.390
And I push harder on it.

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:28.397
And it's fine like
it's gone away.

00:50:28.397 --> 00:50:30.230
And then you're like,
OK, that was my brain.

00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:33.140
Because if it was
something there,

00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:35.480
it wouldn't just
go away like that.

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:36.680
So I get my key.

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:37.770
I got up in my room.

00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:38.270
I'm walking.

00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:39.920
Now it starts hurting
again, every step.

00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.294
And by the time I got to my
room, I'm working on my heel,

00:50:42.294 --> 00:50:45.372
because I don't want to put
any pressure my big toe.

00:50:45.372 --> 00:50:46.580
And so I get inside the room.

00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:50.300
And I perform a diagnostic test.

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:52.250
What was the test?

00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:53.180
Look.

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:55.070
So I pull off my shoe.

00:50:55.070 --> 00:51:02.070
And this is what I
found, a shard of glass

00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:04.940
sticking in my sock.

00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:08.750
How the heck did
it not bother me

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:10.640
all day until I just got there?

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:13.820
But as we say,
you've got to look.

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:18.412
You've got to rule out
structural causes first.

00:51:18.412 --> 00:51:19.370
I was giving a lecture.

00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:21.036
I was thinking about
this the other day.

00:51:21.036 --> 00:51:24.530
I gave a lecture a couple of
years ago in London, actually.

00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:26.780
And at the end, this guy got up.

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:32.730
And he said, in my culture, pain
is viewed as a gift from God.

00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:37.040
What do you think about that?

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:41.800
And I go, well, yeah, it is.

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:46.450
However we were formed, we
have this ability to have pain.

00:51:46.450 --> 00:51:50.920
And it's a barometer
of our structural body.

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:55.240
And it's a barometer of our
brain and all the experiences

00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:58.010
that we bring to this moment.

00:51:58.010 --> 00:51:59.720
And when pain occurs--

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:02.230
or other symptoms
that I mentioned--

00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:05.170
when pain occurs,
something is going on.

00:52:05.170 --> 00:52:06.860
And it's our job to encode it.

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:08.830
It's our job to learn from it.

00:52:08.830 --> 00:52:10.960
And it's a complete gift.

00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:13.730
And people who've been
through-- like this guy.

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:15.700
He's going to be so
much better in his life.

00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:19.000
Because now, he
understands himself better.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.130
He understands,
what triggers him?

00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:23.050
What are some of the
issues in his life?

00:52:23.050 --> 00:52:26.180
He can take action
and do the work

00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:30.730
to deal more effectively
with what life brings.

00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:33.280
And sometimes people need to
make big changes in their life.

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:39.060
But there's an experience that
is not that well known, which

00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:42.110
is post-traumatic growth.

00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:46.070
Not all trauma leads to
post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:47.990
Trauma can lead to
post-traumatic growth

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:50.660
if we know how to use it, if
we know how to interpret it,

00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:54.530
if we have the tools to
help us grow as people.

00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:58.260
And I think that's kind
of what life is all about.

00:52:58.260 --> 00:52:59.750
So with that, I'll leave you.

00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:02.150
And thanks a lot.
