duct tape suit as I had to build it fast
yeah<00:05:25.320><c> I'll</c><00:05:25.500><c> get</c><00:05:25.710><c> little</c><00:05:25.980><c> things</c><00:05:26.010><c> like</c><00:05:26.220><c> the</c><00:05:26.340><c> tie</c>

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll get little things like the tie
 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.100 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll get little things like the tie
is<00:05:26.700><c> actually</c><00:05:27.000><c> duct</c><00:05:27.210><c> tape</c><00:05:27.390><c> to</c><00:05:27.630><c> that</c><00:05:27.660><c> I</c><00:05:27.840><c> painted</c>

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 align:start position:0%
is actually duct tape to that I painted
 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.950 align:start position:0%
is actually duct tape to that I painted
red<00:05:28.350><c> and</c><00:05:29.250><c> there's</c><00:05:29.460><c> a</c><00:05:29.550><c> wire</c><00:05:29.760><c> in</c><00:05:30.000><c> it</c><00:05:30.150><c> so</c><00:05:30.810><c> that</c><00:05:30.930><c> I</c>

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
red and there's a wire in it so that I
 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.540 align:start position:0%
red and there's a wire in it so that I
could<00:05:31.020><c> animate</c><00:05:31.860><c> the</c><00:05:32.130><c> tie</c><00:05:32.340><c> too</c><00:05:34.250><c> but</c><00:05:35.250><c> that's</c>

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 align:start position:0%
could animate the tie too but that's
 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.700 align:start position:0%
could animate the tie too but that's
basically<00:05:35.880><c> it</c><00:05:36.540><c> I'll</c><00:05:36.870><c> show</c><00:05:37.470><c> you</c><00:05:37.560><c> a</c><00:05:37.590><c> little</c>

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 align:start position:0%
basically it I'll show you a little
 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.060 align:start position:0%
basically it I'll show you a little
armature<00:05:38.750><c> to</c><00:05:39.750><c> kind</c><00:05:39.990><c> of</c><00:05:40.080><c> give</c><00:05:40.530><c> you</c><00:05:40.590><c> an</c><00:05:40.680><c> idea</c><00:05:40.740><c> of</c>

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 align:start position:0%
armature to kind of give you an idea of
 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.890 align:start position:0%
armature to kind of give you an idea of
what<00:05:41.400><c> it</c><00:05:41.520><c> looks</c><00:05:41.730><c> like</c><00:05:41.880><c> before</c><00:05:42.060><c> I</c><00:05:42.270><c> covered</c><00:05:42.780><c> it</c>

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
what it looks like before I covered it
 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:43.250 align:start position:0%
what it looks like before I covered it
up

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 align:start position:0%
up
 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.790 align:start position:0%

but<00:05:43.920><c> the</c><00:05:44.460><c> heads</c><00:05:44.670><c> themselves</c><00:05:44.880><c> I</c><00:05:45.600><c> sculpted</c><00:05:46.530><c> with</c>

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
but the heads themselves I sculpted with
 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
but the heads themselves I sculpted with
white<00:05:47.670><c> sculpey</c><00:05:48.510><c> just</c><00:05:48.750><c> the</c><00:05:48.990><c> Skokie</c><00:05:49.560><c> original</c>

once I I wanted the original color once
 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.450 align:start position:0%
once I I wanted the original color once
I<00:05:57.120><c> fired</c><00:05:57.450><c> it</c><00:05:57.630><c> in</c><00:05:57.810><c> the</c><00:05:57.930><c> oven</c><00:05:58.230><c> I</c><00:05:58.710><c> kind</c><00:05:59.160><c> of</c><00:05:59.220><c> gave</c><00:05:59.430><c> it</c>

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 align:start position:0%
I fired it in the oven I kind of gave it
 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
I fired it in the oven I kind of gave it
that<00:05:59.790><c> sort</c><00:06:00.270><c> of</c><00:06:00.450><c> almost</c><00:06:00.870><c> bone</c><00:06:01.940><c> kind</c><00:06:02.940><c> of</c><00:06:03.150><c> color</c>

that sort of almost bone kind of color
 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.370 align:start position:0%
that sort of almost bone kind of color
used<00:06:04.290><c> a</c><00:06:04.470><c> really</c><00:06:04.860><c> thin</c><00:06:05.450><c> mixture</c><00:06:06.450><c> of</c><00:06:06.720><c> paint</c><00:06:07.230><c> and</c>

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
used a really thin mixture of paint and
 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.010 align:start position:0%
used a really thin mixture of paint and

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
little hat to that kind of I could
 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
little hat to that kind of I could
switching<00:06:18.720><c> between</c><00:06:18.900><c> puppets</c><00:06:19.820><c> but</c><00:06:22.340><c> the</c><00:06:23.340><c> way</c><00:06:23.460><c> I</c>

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 align:start position:0%
switching between puppets but the way I
 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:24.740 align:start position:0%
switching between puppets but the way I
made<00:06:23.700><c> the</c><00:06:23.820><c> clown</c><00:06:24.030><c> puppet</c><00:06:24.300><c> is</c><00:06:24.390><c> a</c><00:06:24.510><c> little</c><00:06:24.660><c> bit</c>

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 align:start position:0%
made the clown puppet is a little bit
 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:25.310 align:start position:0%
made the clown puppet is a little bit

00:09:59.300 --> 00:09:59.310 align:start position:0%
little knot so I could pop the head back
 

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.630 align:start position:0%
little knot so I could pop the head back

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.070 align:start position:0%
that jazz and mouth so pretty cool now
initially<00:10:12.180><c> I</c><00:10:12.210><c> thought</c><00:10:12.420><c> I</c><00:10:12.480><c> was</c><00:10:12.660><c> gonna</c><00:10:12.780><c> have</c><00:10:13.050><c> to</c>

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
initially I thought I was gonna have to
 

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
initially I thought I was gonna have to
do<00:10:13.830><c> the</c><00:10:13.950><c> entire</c><00:10:14.070><c> thing</c><00:10:14.280><c> green-screen</c>

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:15.210 align:start position:0%
do the entire thing green-screen
 

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:20.390 align:start position:0%
do the entire thing green-screen
so<00:10:15.870><c> Barney</c><00:10:16.440><c> and</c><00:10:16.830><c> Rob</c><00:10:17.700><c> Walker</c><00:10:19.070><c> actually</c><00:10:20.070><c> they</c>

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
so Barney and Rob Walker actually they
 

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
so Barney and Rob Walker actually they
built<00:10:20.730><c> that</c><00:10:21.150><c> set</c><00:10:21.690><c> that</c><00:10:21.720><c> you</c><00:10:21.960><c> see</c><00:10:22.140><c> with</c><00:10:22.260><c> the</c>

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:22.290 align:start position:0%
built that set that you see with the

got the the the large tree we actually
 

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.020 align:start position:0%
got the the the large tree we actually
we<00:11:31.560><c> had</c><00:11:31.650><c> to</c><00:11:31.740><c> make</c><00:11:31.920><c> a</c><00:11:31.950><c> door</c><00:11:32.250><c> so</c><00:11:32.640><c> that</c><00:11:32.670><c> the</c><00:11:32.850><c> cloud</c>

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:33.030 align:start position:0%
we had to make a door so that the cloud
 

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:36.820 align:start position:0%
we had to make a door so that the cloud
steps<00:11:33.420><c> out</c><00:11:34.010><c> yeah</c><00:11:35.010><c> so</c><00:11:35.190><c> this</c><00:11:35.339><c> is</c><00:11:35.400><c> the</c><00:11:35.820><c> door</c><00:11:36.060><c> that</c>

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:36.830 align:start position:0%

cardboard tube the back cut out so that
 

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.750 align:start position:0%

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
I could animate the puppet from within

sort of strapped for time so it was kind

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
of an old trick basically shut this one
 

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
of an old trick basically shut this one
was<00:13:39.230><c> 12</c><00:13:39.560><c> images</c><00:13:40.250><c> per</c><00:13:41.120><c> second</c><00:13:41.600><c> so</c><00:13:41.930><c> we</c><00:13:42.050><c> doubled</c>

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:42.410 align:start position:0%
was 12 images per second so we doubled
 

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
was 12 images per second so we doubled
up<00:13:42.560><c> the</c><00:13:43.370><c> amount</c><00:13:43.700><c> of</c><00:13:43.910><c> images</c><00:13:44.330><c> so</c><00:13:44.930><c> then</c><00:13:45.080><c> it</c><00:13:45.200><c> still</c>

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:45.410 align:start position:0%
up the amount of images so then it still
 

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:50.680 align:start position:0%
up the amount of images so then it still
has<00:13:45.560><c> the</c><00:13:46.660><c> 24</c><00:13:47.660><c> frames</c><00:13:48.520><c> but</c><00:13:49.520><c> that's</c><00:13:50.030><c> all</c><00:13:50.270><c> quiet</c>

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:49.820 align:start position:0%
have to erase the rod I know that it
 

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.900 align:start position:0%
have to erase the rod I know that it
were<00:14:49.880><c> a</c><00:14:49.910><c> huge</c><00:14:50.780><c> pain</c><00:14:51.020><c> on</c><00:14:51.170><c> maybe</c><00:14:51.350><c> chef</c><00:14:51.620><c> yeah</c><00:14:52.490><c> it</c>

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:52.910 align:start position:0%
were a huge pain on maybe chef yeah it
 

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.610 align:start position:0%
were a huge pain on maybe chef yeah it
would<00:14:53.060><c> have</c><00:14:53.090><c> been</c><00:14:53.270><c> possible</c><00:14:53.780><c> to</c><00:14:53.840><c> really</c><00:14:54.410><c> do</c>

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:54.620 align:start position:0%
would have been possible to really do
 

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.110 align:start position:0%

because<00:14:54.860><c> the</c><00:14:55.040><c> rod</c><00:14:55.550><c> would</c><00:14:55.670><c> have</c><00:14:55.790><c> been</c><00:14:55.880><c> blocking</c>

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
