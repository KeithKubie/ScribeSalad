answer nowadays that we give to
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.359

everybody about this is it's a spectrum

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369
everybody about this is it's a spectrum

I don't know about you but I have known
a great many gay men who are married who

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640
a great many gay men who are married who
 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.730
a great many gay men who are married who

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740
have babies who have kids
 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.910
have babies who have kids
so I apparently I'm not an authority on

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920
so I apparently I'm not an authority on
 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.710
so I apparently I'm not an authority on
this I'm observer of the human condition

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720
this I'm observer of the human condition
 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.679
this I'm observer of the human condition
apparently there's a spectrum some

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689
apparently there's a spectrum some
 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.510

people are more inclined to have sex

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520
people are more inclined to have sex
 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.280
people are more inclined to have sex
with people of their same sex than

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290
with people of their same sex than
 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.410
with people of their same sex than
others and I think if you just watch the

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420
others and I think if you just watch the
 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.600
others and I think if you just watch the
news right now you can see that for

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610
news right now you can see that for
 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.399
news right now you can see that for
yourself

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409
yourself
 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.090
yourself
and so being somewhere on the spectrum

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100
and so being somewhere on the spectrum
 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.149
and so being somewhere on the spectrum
of heterosexual with homosexual being on

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159
of heterosexual with homosexual being on
 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.880
of heterosexual with homosexual being on
that is not genetically lethal you still

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890
that is not genetically lethal you still
 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.580
that is not genetically lethal you still
have kids anyway and you'll hear people

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590
have kids anyway and you'll hear people
 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.740
have kids anyway and you'll hear people
talk about the feminine side you'll hear

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750
talk about the feminine side you'll hear
 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.600
talk about the feminine side you'll hear
two people talk about the masculine side

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610
two people talk about the masculine side
 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.630
two people talk about the masculine side
you'll hear women use the expression

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640
you'll hear women use the expression

while she's got a lot of balls which I

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759
while she's got a lot of balls which I
 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.850
while she's got a lot of balls which I
can't literally be true if we're using

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860
can't literally be true if we're using
 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.479
can't literally be true if we're using
balls in that conventional construction

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489
balls in that conventional construction
 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.570
balls in that conventional construction
so I would say that it

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580
so I would say that it
 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.490
so I would say that it
something that happens in nature and I

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500
something that happens in nature and I
 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.650
something that happens in nature and I
remember very well in this book now I

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660
remember very well in this book now I
 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.180
remember very well in this book now I
haven't read it in a long time but man

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190
haven't read it in a long time but man
 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.230
haven't read it in a long time but man
it was a big deal

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240
it was a big deal
 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.530
it was a big deal
openly talking about sex in the 1960s

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540
openly talking about sex in the 1960s
 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.040
openly talking about sex in the 1960s
was a big deal that he claimed that

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050
was a big deal that he claimed that
 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.370
was a big deal that he claimed that
there was more homosexuality in zoos

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380
there was more homosexuality in zoos
 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.220
there was more homosexuality in zoos
than he observed in nature and that

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230
than he observed in nature and that
 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.470
than he observed in nature and that
maybe just because he had we happen to

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480
maybe just because he had we happen to
 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.760
maybe just because he had we happen to
capture a couple of homosexual bonobos

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770
capture a couple of homosexual bonobos
 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.860
capture a couple of homosexual bonobos
or whatever in other words the sample

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870
or whatever in other words the sample
 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.060
or whatever in other words the sample
size is way too small to extrapolate so

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070
 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.460
let's let's celebrate being alive

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470
let's let's celebrate being alive
 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.900
let's let's celebrate being alive
everybody apparently it's just something

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910
everybody apparently it's just something
 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.400
everybody apparently it's just something
that happens in nature and look we're

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410
that happens in nature and look we're
 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.860
