00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.760
So far, we've reminded ourselves of
the basics of linear programming

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.330
by examining it in just two dimensions.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.110
Then we built up some vocabulary and

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.370
notation that allows us to extend
these notions to n dimensions.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.760
Now we're ready for
the culmination of all this work

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.290
in the fundamental theorem
of linear programming.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.040
Which captures the idea that optimal
solutions should be at the corners,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.200
also called extreme points
of the feasible region.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.850
And that tells us that we need only
consider basic feasible solutions.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.940
Precisely, the theorem states that given
a linear program in this standard form,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.100
where A is an m x n matrix of rank m.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.190
Then if there's a feasible solution,
there is a basic feasible solution.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.569
And if there is an optimal
feasible solution,

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:49.620
there is an optimal
basic feasible solution.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.760
We'll start by proving the first point.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.210
Let x be a feasible solution, and we'll
consider only the positive entries.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.030
Without loss of generality,
let's assume that those are the first p.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.580
Then it must be the case
that this linear combination

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.560
of the columns a1 through
ap is equal to b.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.160
That is after all,
part of what it means to be feasible.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.490
There are two cases.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.490
First, suppose that the columns a1
through ap are linearly independent.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.480
Then it's not possible that
p should be greater than m,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.040
recall that these vectors
are only m elements long.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.220
If p is equal to m, well then x
is basic already and we're done.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.270
P could be less than m,
that would mean that x is degenerate.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.840
But then we can just add columns to
form a linearly independent basis and

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.190
we would be all right.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.680
So that then covers the case where
these columns are linearly independent.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.400
Next, suppose that those
columns are linearly dependent.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.850
Well, that means they
are coefficients y1 through yp.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.710
Such that this linear combination of
the columns is equal to 0 with at

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.570
least one of the coefficients,
yi positive.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.288
Then we're going to choose this
parameter epsilon in a very clever way.

00:02:08.288 --> 00:02:11.495
So that it's the minimum
of these ratios,

00:02:11.495 --> 00:02:17.730
xi/yi among all these i's
such that yi is positive.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.160
Then multiplying this
equation by this epsilon, and

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.490
subtracting it from this one,
we end up with this equation here.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.380
These coefficients must represent
another feasible solution.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.230
But by our choice of epsilon,

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.080
we've set at least one of
these coefficients to zero.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.520
All of the others have
remained positive.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.880
So we've reduced the number
of positive entries in x.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.340
And we can repeat this over and
over until case 1 is reached,

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.510
where a1 through ap
are linearly independent.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.922
Now onto part two of the theorem, this
will feel similar to the first part.

00:02:55.922 --> 00:02:59.060
We want to show that if there
is an optimal feasible solution,

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.880
there is an optimal
basic feasible solution.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.490
We let x be an optimal feasible solution
with non-zero entries x1 through xp.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.510
Well it's feasible,

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.160
so this linear combination of the
columns of a then must be equal to b.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.530
And because it's optimal,
it's objective value,

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.670
c transpose x must be the maximum
over all possible feasible x.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.846
Again, we first consider the case
where the columns a1 through ap

00:03:28.846 --> 00:03:34.218
are linearly independent, and
the situation is the same as before.

00:03:34.218 --> 00:03:39.280
P being greater than m is impossible,
equal means that it's a basic solution,

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.771
and less just means that
it's a degenerate solution.

00:03:42.771 --> 00:03:44.610
This case is simple.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.880
If these columns are linearly dependent,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.320
then there exists a set of
coefficients y1 through yP.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.740
Such that the linear
combination of the columns

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.920
is equal to 0 with at least
one of the y's being positive.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.190
Note however, for epsilon sufficiently
close to zero in both the positive and

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.940
the negative direction.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.720
X minus epsilon y is still feasible.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.910
Multiply epsilon times this equation,
and add it to this equation, and

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.505
we end up still with a set
of coefficients equal to b.

00:04:18.505 --> 00:04:21.945
Thus, c transpose y
has to be equal to 0.

00:04:21.945 --> 00:04:26.935
If it weren't, then c transpose
x would be strictly less than

00:04:26.935 --> 00:04:31.015
c transpose times x minus epsilon y.

00:04:31.015 --> 00:04:36.870
We can choose the right sign on epsilon,
so that this inequality holds.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.800
But this is impossible
because x is optimal.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.750
We conclude that c transpose
y is equal to 0 and

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.370
then we can choose epsilon to be
the same thing we chose it before.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.250
It'll still give us
an optimal feasible solution,

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.020
only this time it will
have smaller support.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.260
Because we're able to choose it
to set one of the coefficients of

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.140
this vector here to zero,
that wasn't zero before.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.280
And we can repeat playing this game over
and over until we've reached the case

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.150
where a1 through ap
are linearly independent.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.170
We've just seen how the fundamental
theorem of linear programming

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.770
tells us that we can always
achieve an optimal value for

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.700
the program with a basic solution.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.690
Moreover, basic solutions come
from the choice of m linearly

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.860
independent columns for the bases.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.350
Remember this key point going forward.
