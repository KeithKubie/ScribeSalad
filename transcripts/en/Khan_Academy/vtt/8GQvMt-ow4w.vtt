00:00:00.238 --> 00:00:02.695
- When we observe what we call fire

00:00:02.695 --> 00:00:04.707
we have this combustion reaction going on

00:00:04.707 --> 00:00:07.206
and then we see these flames

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:08.628
what we're really observing

00:00:08.628 --> 00:00:12.571
are the three forms of thermal energy transfer.

00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:17.246
We're observing conduction, conduction,

00:00:17.246 --> 00:00:21.789
convection, convection,

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.268
convection,

00:00:24.268 --> 00:00:27.968
and thermal radiation all at the same time.

00:00:27.968 --> 00:00:32.870
So I'll do this, thermal, thermal radiation,

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.999
thermal radiation.

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:37.218
And I could say thermal conduction,

00:00:37.218 --> 00:00:39.616
thermal convection, and thermal radiation,

00:00:39.616 --> 00:00:41.281
and the word thermal is just relating to things

00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:43.760
dealing with temperature.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.118
So what is the conduction going on?

00:00:46.118 --> 00:00:49.733
Well what we have going on in the fuel for our fire,

00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:52.375
so down here the fuel for our fire

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:54.508
we have our classic combustion reaction

00:00:54.508 --> 00:00:56.174
and I encourage you to watch the video on that

00:00:56.174 --> 00:00:59.079
in our chemistry playlist, or chemistry section

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.704
if you're interested in it.

00:01:00.704 --> 00:01:05.296
But you're taking carbon molecules and their bonds

00:01:05.296 --> 00:01:07.979
and then in the presence of oxygen and some heat

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.726
you have a combustion reaction

00:01:09.726 --> 00:01:12.693
producing carbon dioxide and producing water

00:01:12.693 --> 00:01:15.617
and even more energy than you put into it,

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:18.258
so it's producing a lot of energy.

00:01:18.258 --> 00:01:20.371
And that energy is going to excite

00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:21.673
the molecules that are around it,

00:01:21.673 --> 00:01:24.536
so you have these molecules,

00:01:24.536 --> 00:01:25.918
you have these molecules

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:27.929
that end up getting a lot of kinetic energy.

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:30.103
And remember, temperature is proportional

00:01:30.103 --> 00:01:32.094
to average kinetic energy.

00:01:32.094 --> 00:01:34.532
And so the ones that just combusted,

00:01:34.532 --> 00:01:36.767
or the molecules right near the reaction,

00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:38.636
or maybe the ones that were part of the reaction,

00:01:38.636 --> 00:01:39.998
they're gonna have this really high,

00:01:39.998 --> 00:01:43.614
they're gonna have this really high average kinetic energy

00:01:43.614 --> 00:01:45.382
'cause all of this energy was released

00:01:45.382 --> 00:01:47.455
from that combustion reaction.

00:01:47.455 --> 00:01:50.054
And then they're going to bump into other molecules

00:01:50.054 --> 00:01:53.244
that might not have quite as high kinetic energy,

00:01:53.244 --> 00:01:55.724
but then they're going to transfer that kinetic energy

00:01:55.724 --> 00:01:57.186
through these collisions.

00:01:57.186 --> 00:01:59.442
And we have a whole video on thermal conduction,

00:01:59.442 --> 00:02:00.559
but that's what's happening.

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:01.900
Things with higher kinetic energy

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.951
are bumping into things with lower kinetic energy

00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:06.025
and transferring some of that kinetic energy

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:07.872
and they're transferring some of that momentum.

00:02:07.872 --> 00:02:09.538
So that is definitely happening

00:02:09.538 --> 00:02:12.058
when we look at a fire like this,

00:02:12.058 --> 00:02:13.969
that neighboring molecules are bumping

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:16.996
into other molecules and transferring energy.

00:02:16.996 --> 00:02:19.617
Now convection, this is around the idea

00:02:19.617 --> 00:02:22.075
that hot air is less dense.

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:25.305
So if we have a bunch of air particles here,

00:02:25.305 --> 00:02:28.333
so let's say this is the cool air up here,

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:30.668
and it makes sense why cool air

00:02:30.668 --> 00:02:33.167
is going to be more dense than hot air.

00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:36.926
'Cause hot air, these particles have a much higher

00:02:36.926 --> 00:02:39.670
kinetic energy and so they're gonna bump

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.498
into each other and they're gonna push each other

00:02:41.498 --> 00:02:45.743
much further away and get more seperation

00:02:45.743 --> 00:02:50.234
from each other because of that high average kinetic energy.

00:02:50.234 --> 00:02:53.952
But because the hot area is less dense,

00:02:53.952 --> 00:02:59.173
this area right over here is less dense, less dense,

00:02:59.173 --> 00:03:01.692
than the white area, these might be all the same molecule,

00:03:01.692 --> 00:03:03.136
I just made them in different colors to show

00:03:03.136 --> 00:03:05.147
the less dense area and the more dense area,

00:03:05.147 --> 00:03:07.950
it is going to rise, it is going to rise.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:08.945
Or you can even think of it

00:03:08.945 --> 00:03:10.775
as a more dense area.

00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:13.090
The more dense area is gonna fall around it,

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.443
it's gonna fall around it, or try to go under it,

00:03:16.443 --> 00:03:17.784
because it is more dense,

00:03:17.784 --> 00:03:21.359
and then the less dense area is going to rise.

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:22.436
And by doing that,

00:03:22.436 --> 00:03:27.415
you have the hotter molecules are moving upwards

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:29.973
and then the cold molecules can go down

00:03:29.973 --> 00:03:33.285
to maybe the source of heat, the source of heat,

00:03:33.285 --> 00:03:35.196
the source of energy right over here

00:03:35.196 --> 00:03:36.577
to get heated up more.

00:03:36.577 --> 00:03:39.783
So this right over here is, so hot air rises,

00:03:39.783 --> 00:03:44.185
let me write this, the hot, hot air rises.

00:03:44.185 --> 00:03:44.930
And when we think about it

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.148
it makes room for the cool air to come down

00:03:47.148 --> 00:03:48.505
and then get heated up again.

00:03:48.505 --> 00:03:50.334
And that's what's going on in the fire here.

00:03:50.334 --> 00:03:52.488
You see the combustion reaction,

00:03:52.488 --> 00:03:54.722
combustion reaction occurs right over there,

00:03:54.722 --> 00:03:56.104
let me just hit a different color,

00:03:56.104 --> 00:03:58.298
combustion reaction is occurring in the fuel,

00:03:58.298 --> 00:04:01.387
that super hot air, it's going to rise.

00:04:01.387 --> 00:04:02.810
And that's why it looks like these flames

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.902
are kind of, they're moving upwards,

00:04:04.902 --> 00:04:06.893
they're kind of flickering upwards.

00:04:06.893 --> 00:04:08.498
And you'll also see, and actually we're gonna

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:10.224
talk about this in thermal radiation,

00:04:10.224 --> 00:04:13.090
is that they also change color as they move upwards.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.016
But this whole idea of fire moving upwards

00:04:16.016 --> 00:04:17.274
and the hot air,

00:04:17.274 --> 00:04:19.326
if you put your hand up here it's gonna be much hotter

00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:24.263
than if you were to put your hand, say, right here,

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:27.048
even though in theory this is closer to the flame

00:04:27.048 --> 00:04:30.075
than up here and that's because the hot air,

00:04:30.075 --> 00:04:33.101
the hot air is rising and it's making room for cold air,

00:04:33.101 --> 00:04:35.500
or cooler air, I guess I could say,

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.511
to come down here and be part

00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:38.871
and get heated up again,

00:04:38.871 --> 00:04:40.762
and then it would rise up again.

00:04:40.762 --> 00:04:42.245
And so this convection,

00:04:42.245 --> 00:04:43.789
this idea of the hot air rising

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:45.008
or the cold air falling,

00:04:45.008 --> 00:04:48.284
this is another form of heat transfer.

00:04:48.284 --> 00:04:50.255
Now the last form that we're observing

00:04:50.255 --> 00:04:53.303
when we're looking at fire is thermal radiation.

00:04:53.303 --> 00:04:55.193
And this is all around the idea

00:04:55.193 --> 00:04:58.585
that if you have charged particles being accelerated

00:04:58.585 --> 00:05:01.937
they're going to release electromagnetic radiation.

00:05:01.937 --> 00:05:03.746
And so you might say, Wait, wait, charged particles,

00:05:03.746 --> 00:05:05.899
where are those being accelerated here?

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:07.260
Well, we have these molecules that are

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.968
constantly being accelerated as they bump

00:05:08.968 --> 00:05:09.983
into each other,

00:05:09.983 --> 00:05:11.446
the one that's gonna transfer kinetic energy

00:05:11.446 --> 00:05:13.681
from, let's say this one bumps into that,

00:05:13.681 --> 00:05:15.225
it's going to accelerate that in different direction

00:05:15.225 --> 00:05:17.256
and even this one might go in another direction

00:05:17.256 --> 00:05:20.019
and acceleration is a change in velocity

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:21.564
so it could be the magnitudinal velocity

00:05:21.564 --> 00:05:23.860
or your directional velocity.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.424
So as they're colliding you have all of these

00:05:25.424 --> 00:05:27.395
accelerational charged particles,

00:05:27.395 --> 00:05:28.817
so let me write this down,

00:05:28.817 --> 00:05:33.408
you have acceleration, acceleration

00:05:33.408 --> 00:05:38.737
of charged particles, charged particles,

00:05:39.036 --> 00:05:40.459
particles,

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:44.075
and then that releases, that releases,

00:05:44.075 --> 00:05:46.187
electromagnetic radiation,

00:05:46.187 --> 00:05:48.869
that releases electromagnetic radiation.

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:50.008
I know what you're thinking, Wait wait,

00:05:50.008 --> 00:05:51.165
hold on a second, Sal.

00:05:51.165 --> 00:05:54.173
Okay, I can buy that we have molecules

00:05:54.173 --> 00:05:55.452
that are being accelerated,

00:05:55.452 --> 00:05:57.260
but where is this charged,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.695
where are you getting this charged particles business?

00:06:00.695 --> 00:06:02.299
Well we have to remember these molecules

00:06:02.299 --> 00:06:04.514
are made up of atoms and atoms are made up of

00:06:04.514 --> 00:06:07.439
charged particles, are made up of protons and electrons.

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:08.922
And so as you accelerate these

00:06:08.922 --> 00:06:10.182
and the more that you accelerate these

00:06:10.182 --> 00:06:13.860
the more radiation you are going to release.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:14.769
And you might say, Okay,

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:16.405
you said I'm observing that in fire,

00:06:16.405 --> 00:06:18.372
where am I observing radiation?

00:06:18.372 --> 00:06:20.648
Well just the very fact that you can see the fire,

00:06:20.648 --> 00:06:22.639
the light emitted from the fire,

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:25.626
that is electromagnetic radiation,

00:06:25.626 --> 00:06:27.840
that is electromagnetic radiation.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.242
It's just the electromagnetic radiation

00:06:29.242 --> 00:06:31.497
in the wavelengths that your eye

00:06:31.497 --> 00:06:32.980
considers to be visible light,

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.910
or that your eye considers to be light.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.861
Even the particles up here,

00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:38.303
so even the particles up here

00:06:38.303 --> 00:06:39.665
that are still quite hot,

00:06:39.665 --> 00:06:43.078
they are also emitting electromagnetic radiation

00:06:43.078 --> 00:06:44.480
because they're all bumping into each other

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.572
and their electrons and their protons

00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:49.031
are all getting accelerated in different ways,

00:06:49.031 --> 00:06:51.611
they're also releasing electromagnetic radiation,

00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:53.602
but it is at a slower wavelength

00:06:53.602 --> 00:06:57.056
than your eye is capable of perceiving as light.

00:06:57.056 --> 00:07:00.185
If you had an infrared camera

00:07:00.185 --> 00:07:02.663
you would see the flames being much larger.

00:07:02.663 --> 00:07:06.361
You would see them go all the way, all the way up here.

00:07:06.361 --> 00:07:08.982
And if you were to look at the flame closely

00:07:08.982 --> 00:07:11.339
you would see down here right where the

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:13.472
combustion reaction is happening,

00:07:13.472 --> 00:07:15.280
the flame looks blue.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.149
And that's because the blue light

00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:18.409
is higher energy light,

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:20.685
and that's because the particles are being accelerated

00:07:20.685 --> 00:07:21.721
more down here,

00:07:21.721 --> 00:07:24.951
and then it goes from blue to kind of a white

00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:28.568
to a yellow, to a red or to an orange, to a red,

00:07:28.568 --> 00:07:31.717
and then it, to your regular eyes, it disappears.

00:07:31.717 --> 00:07:34.094
But everything, everything that has some temperature

00:07:34.094 --> 00:07:36.715
is releasing electromagnetic radiation.

00:07:36.715 --> 00:07:38.726
And you're like, Okay, well that's all fine,

00:07:38.726 --> 00:07:41.510
I can see it but how is that a form of energy transfer?

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.826
Well, if you're ever sat next to a flame

00:07:43.826 --> 00:07:45.309
you will feel the heat.

00:07:45.309 --> 00:07:48.397
In fact, even if the air between you and the flame is cold

00:07:48.397 --> 00:07:52.196
you would still feel like you're getting warm.

00:07:52.196 --> 00:07:55.447
So if this is a flame right over here,

00:07:55.447 --> 00:07:59.673
so that is fire, and let's say you have cold air,

00:07:59.673 --> 00:08:02.111
cold air, let's say you're at a campfire right over here,

00:08:02.111 --> 00:08:04.996
maybe it's 30, this air right over here is 30 degrees,

00:08:04.996 --> 00:08:09.161
if you are standing right over here

00:08:09.161 --> 00:08:11.172
you would still feel heat,

00:08:11.172 --> 00:08:13.306
you would still feel like you're getting warmed up.

00:08:13.306 --> 00:08:16.495
And that's because that electromagnetic radiation

00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:18.710
is being emitted from the air particles

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.168
that we perceive as fire

00:08:21.168 --> 00:08:23.220
and then that can actually excite particles

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.500
on your skin

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.999
and it will transfer energy to your skin

00:08:26.999 --> 00:08:30.981
and so you feel like you are actually getting warmed up.

00:08:30.981 --> 00:08:33.501
I remember once, this is kind of a strange story,

00:08:33.501 --> 00:08:35.472
but I was on the highway

00:08:35.472 --> 00:08:36.832
and there was a car on fire

00:08:36.832 --> 00:08:39.758
and I was literally, we drove to the far lane

00:08:39.758 --> 00:08:40.774
because it was on fire,

00:08:40.774 --> 00:08:42.054
we're three lanes away from it

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:43.517
and it kind of exploded.

00:08:43.517 --> 00:08:45.163
I don't think anyone was in it,

00:08:45.163 --> 00:08:46.280
hopefully no one was in it,

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.702
but I remember right when it exploded

00:08:47.702 --> 00:08:50.851
it was an intense, immediate heat that we felt

00:08:50.851 --> 00:08:52.517
through the window of the car,

00:08:52.517 --> 00:08:55.565
and that was electromagnetic radiation.

00:08:55.565 --> 00:08:57.312
That was thermal radiation being released

00:08:57.312 --> 00:08:58.999
by these accelerated particles

00:08:58.999 --> 00:09:01.335
in the air around that explosion,

00:09:01.335 --> 00:09:04.118
which we perceived as a an explosion, or fire,

00:09:04.118 --> 00:09:08.857
but then it was warming up particles on my skin.
