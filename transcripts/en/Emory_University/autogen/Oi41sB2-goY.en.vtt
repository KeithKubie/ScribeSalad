University

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:08.300
 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.220
close to a cure I will not say that I I

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230
close to a cure I will not say that I I
 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.060
close to a cure I will not say that I I
will say that certainly we have to work

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070
will say that certainly we have to work
 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.720
will say that certainly we have to work
on it and there is new new hope let's

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730
on it and there is new new hope let's
 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.339
on it and there is new new hope let's
say we have a proof of concept today of

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349
say we have a proof of concept today of
 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.820
say we have a proof of concept today of
HIV cure

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830
 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.729
you probably heard about what we call

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739
you probably heard about what we call
 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.900
you probably heard about what we call
the Berlin patient this patient that was

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910
the Berlin patient this patient that was
 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.890
the Berlin patient this patient that was
hiv-positive he's originally from United

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900
hiv-positive he's originally from United
 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.970
hiv-positive he's originally from United
States and was staying in in Germany and

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980
States and was staying in in Germany and
 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.720
States and was staying in in Germany and
he developed leukemia and the the

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730
he developed leukemia and the the
 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.759
he developed leukemia and the the
physician in Germany at the idea for

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769
physician in Germany at the idea for
 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.330
physician in Germany at the idea for
treating the patient for his leukemia to

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340
treating the patient for his leukemia to
 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.469
treating the patient for his leukemia to
make a bone-marrow transplant with a

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479
make a bone-marrow transplant with a
 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.700
make a bone-marrow transplant with a
donor that as the deletion invitation in

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710
donor that as the deletion invitation in
 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.780
donor that as the deletion invitation in
one of the co-receptor of HIV the ccr5

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790
one of the co-receptor of HIV the ccr5
 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.990
one of the co-receptor of HIV the ccr5
molecule so he got the bone marrow

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000
molecule so he got the bone marrow
 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.170
molecule so he got the bone marrow
transplant and he's what he was at a

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180
transplant and he's what he was at a
 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.270
transplant and he's what he was at a
time and antiretroviral treatment of

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280
time and antiretroviral treatment of
 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.180
time and antiretroviral treatment of
course because he was HIV positive but

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190
course because he was HIV positive but
 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.310
course because he was HIV positive but
then after the bone marrow transplant

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320
then after the bone marrow transplant
 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.030
then after the bone marrow transplant
and of course he was treated also with

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040
and of course he was treated also with
 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.940
and of course he was treated also with
drug for immunosuppressive drug like

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950
drug for immunosuppressive drug like
 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.240
drug for immunosuppressive drug like
always for a bone marrow transplant it

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250
always for a bone marrow transplant it
 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.760
always for a bone marrow transplant it
turned out that the virus became not

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770
turned out that the virus became not
 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.420
turned out that the virus became not
detectable at all in that patient and

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430
detectable at all in that patient and
 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.010
detectable at all in that patient and
still today the Berlin patient is living

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020
still today the Berlin patient is living
 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.290
still today the Berlin patient is living
without any integrity of our treatment

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300
without any integrity of our treatment
 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.470
without any integrity of our treatment
and the virus is not detectable in a

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480
and the virus is not detectable in a
 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.230
and the virus is not detectable in a
different compartment of his body so

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240
different compartment of his body so
 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.520
different compartment of his body so
this is a proof of concept that a cure

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530
this is a proof of concept that a cure
 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.410
this is a proof of concept that a cure
should be possible and of course the

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420
should be possible and of course the
 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.020
should be possible and of course the
approach of making bone marrow

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030
approach of making bone marrow
 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.020
approach of making bone marrow
transplant with Delta 32 deletion and

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030
transplant with Delta 32 deletion and
 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.699
transplant with Delta 32 deletion and
ccr5 so finding the donor and so on we

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709
ccr5 so finding the donor and so on we
 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.640
ccr5 so finding the donor and so on we
cannot use that at very large scale but

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650
cannot use that at very large scale but
 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.790
cannot use that at very large scale but
it's a very nice proof of concept

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800
 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.340
I'm personally I'm very positive for at

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350
I'm personally I'm very positive for at
 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.320
I'm personally I'm very positive for at
least what we call a functional cure

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330
least what we call a functional cure
 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.170
least what we call a functional cure
which means that we will not totally

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180
which means that we will not totally
 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.630
which means that we will not totally
eradicate the virus but at least we

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640
eradicate the virus but at least we
 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.580
eradicate the virus but at least we
should be able to control persistent

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590
should be able to control persistent
 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.160
should be able to control persistent
persistently control the virus in the

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170
persistently control the virus in the
 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.600
persistently control the virus in the
body why I'm so optimistic is because we

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610
body why I'm so optimistic is because we
 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.210
body why I'm so optimistic is because we
have also few cases you know less than

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220
have also few cases you know less than
 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.780
have also few cases you know less than
0.3 percent of people living with HIV

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790
0.3 percent of people living with HIV
 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.090
0.3 percent of people living with HIV
they never receive any antiretroviral

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100
they never receive any antiretroviral
 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.660
they never receive any antiretroviral
treatment and they are able to control

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670
treatment and they are able to control
 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.330
treatment and they are able to control
naturally control their infection

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340
naturally control their infection
 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.840
naturally control their infection
we call them elite controllers and those

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850
we call them elite controllers and those
 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.030
we call them elite controllers and those
elite controllers we know that a group

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040
elite controllers we know that a group
 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.320
elite controllers we know that a group
of them have a very strong t-cell

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330
of them have a very strong t-cell
 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.460
of them have a very strong t-cell
response capable to suppress the

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470
response capable to suppress the
 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.230
response capable to suppress the
infection and we are learning from a

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240
infection and we are learning from a
 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.150
infection and we are learning from a
server group of elite controllers

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160
server group of elite controllers
 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.280
server group of elite controllers
showing that they have a restriction of

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290
showing that they have a restriction of
 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.050
showing that they have a restriction of
infection of their cd4 cells and

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060
infection of their cd4 cells and
 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.660
infection of their cd4 cells and
macrophages and we are trying to

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670
macrophages and we are trying to
 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.180
macrophages and we are trying to
understand the mechanism of this

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190
understand the mechanism of this
 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.120
understand the mechanism of this
restriction of HIV infection of target

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130
restriction of HIV infection of target
 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.770
restriction of HIV infection of target
cells

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780
 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.210
so I mean there is new avenue let's say

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220
so I mean there is new avenue let's say
 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.270
so I mean there is new avenue let's say
for research today on HIV cure and the

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280
for research today on HIV cure and the
 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.130
for research today on HIV cure and the
reason why at the International

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140
reason why at the International
 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.760
reason why at the International
associate II we decide like it is you're

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770
associate II we decide like it is you're
 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.650
associate II we decide like it is you're
the role of the society to try to

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660
the role of the society to try to
 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.470
the role of the society to try to
promote stimulate and connect scientists

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480
promote stimulate and connect scientists
 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.590
promote stimulate and connect scientists
at international level to work together

at international level to work together
 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:22.550
at international level to work together
on this direction of HIV cure
