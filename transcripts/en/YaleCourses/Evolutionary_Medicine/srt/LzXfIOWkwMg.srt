1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,220
Every cancer is a case
of clonal evolution.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:11,090
Evolution is involved in every
single patient who develops cancer.

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:15,511
No.

4
00:00:15,511 --> 00:00:20,150
Cancer evolution is a different kind of
evolution in the sense that it is short

5
00:00:20,151 --> 00:00:21,740
sighted and it's selfish.

6
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,490
The clones originate through mutations
and then they compete for resources and

7
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:29,020
for space within the patient.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,970
Two of the key genes that are involved,

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,020
or p 16 in [inaudible] 53 they control,

10
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:42,021
so the cell cycle in Dna repair among
other things and damage to DNA repair

11
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:44,220
increases mutation rate.

12
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,940
The greater the genetic
diversity in a tumor,

13
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,580
the more likely that it
will progress to malignancy.

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,280
So cancer evolution is not something
that is passed from a parent to an

15
00:00:59,711 --> 00:01:03,520
offspring with very, very
few exceptions. There are,

16
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:08,521
there's a tumor in Tasmanian devils and
there's one other that can actually be

17
00:01:09,011 --> 00:01:09,700
transmitted,

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,700
but 99.99% of all cancers are not
passed from parents to offspring.

19
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,830
Their entire evolution occurs within
the body and the lifespan of a single

20
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:22,450
individual human being.

21
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,950
The revolution is short sighted
because they die with their hosts.

22
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,790
Here's selection is operating
on cell clones over.

23
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:35,090
No more than about 40
to 50 cell generations.

24
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,650
And that's not enough selective events
to produce any precise adaptation,

25
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:42,860
but it can produce a rough
adaptation to a local environment.

26
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,800
So a metastasis to the liver,
for example,

27
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,460
can have different characteristics
in a metastasis to along,

28
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,390
and you can show that those differences
have something to do with those two

29
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:54,224
environments.

30
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,543
Okay?

31
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,480
This lovely picture is from Charlie,
none.

32
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,950
Somatic evolution is actually
orthogonal to germline evolution.

33
00:02:03,951 --> 00:02:08,951
So this green tree down
here shows births of,

34
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,720
for example, your birth,
the birth of your children,

35
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:18,250
the birth of your grandchildren, and
then each individual looks like a tree.

36
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:22,360
These are all of the somatic cells that
are growing up out of the single cell of

37
00:02:22,361 --> 00:02:23,194
the Zygote.

38
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,950
And a cancer is going to be a branch
or a twig on one of these trees.

39
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,670
It's produced by competition among
clonal lineages generated by somatic

40
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:39,504
mutation,

41
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,550
okay.

42
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:46,550
And these lineage to let these lineages
are extremely genetically heterogeneous

43
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,380
and that's been detected
with many methods.

44
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,870
There are changes that range
from nucleotide sequences
and methylation patterns

45
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:00,010
to chromosome numbers.
Cancer cells are

46
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,130
competing for nutrients and to evade.
The immune system

47
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:08,590
and the genetic variants that are better
at those functions increase in number

48
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:12,940
and frequency. So there are two
very important things going on here.

49
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:17,680
One is that there's a huge amount of
genetic diversity being generated and the

50
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:22,480
second is that that genetic diversity is
being trimmed and shaped by competition.

51
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:27,481
So it's a standard micro evolutionary
scenario where genetic variation is the

52
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:30,280
fuel for a selection process.

53
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,193
The

54
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,850
two genes in which mutations
are particularly important
are p 16 which is all so

55
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,800
called CD K and two a. This is a
cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor.

56
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:52,320
It produces two splicing variances.
One of them inhibit CDK four kinase,

57
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:57,321
which is important for cell
cycle progression and the
other stabilizes p 53 by

58
00:03:57,991 --> 00:04:02,991
sequestering a protein that
degrades p 53 p 53 producers,

59
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,250
a transcription factor that regulate
cell cycle and also suppresses tumor

60
00:04:08,251 --> 00:04:11,910
formation.
It can activate DNA repair proteins,

61
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:16,890
it can arrest the cell cycle when it
recognizes Dna damage and you can initiate

62
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,980
a pop ptosis if DNA damage
is likely to be irreparable.

63
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,581
Interestingly,

64
00:04:23,581 --> 00:04:28,581
people who inherit only one functional
copy of the TPMT TP 53 gene will almost

65
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,790
certainly developed
tumors in early adulthood.

66
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,640
This is a disease known
as Li Fraumeni Syndrome.

67
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,720
More than 50% of human tumors contain
a mutation or deletion and the TP,

68
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:42,714
53 g

69
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:50,310
clonal expansions of p 16 and p 53 lesions
have been found in cancers of skin,

70
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,600
long breast, head, neck, bladder,
brain, kidney, prostate, colon,

71
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:58,000
stomach, and esophagus. In other words,

72
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:03,690
these two genes are found to have mutated
in a very wide and important range of

73
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:06,814
cancers,

74
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,720
expansions of these in
clones or signatures.

75
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:19,730
That natural selection is favoring clones
that have mutations in these genes.

76
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,190
And so here are papers that you can look
up documenting such expansions of p 53

77
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:31,110
and p 16 in skin, lung, breast,
head, neck, bladder, brain,

78
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:33,660
kidney, prostate, colon,
and stomach cancer.

79
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:42,270
An important finding is that the genetic
diversity in a pre malignant tumor

80
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:44,290
predicts progression to malignancy.

81
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,160
So Barrett's Esophagus is a condition
of inflammation on the esophagus that

82
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:54,910
predisposes for a cancer called
Esophageal Adenocarcinoma.

83
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,730
Carlo Maley and his collaborators used
measures for species diversity from

84
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:06,731
ecology and evolution to measure how
genetically diverse these clones in

85
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:13,220
Barrett's esophagus war. They
used numbers, different clones,

86
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:16,490
the Shannon index of diversity
and genetic divergence,

87
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:18,650
how genetically different
than mutants were.

88
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,780
And all three of these measures predicted
the patients that were more likely to

89
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:24,770
develop cancer.

90
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,420
So here is the incidents of
Esophageal Adenocarcinoma.

91
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,420
So that's the cancer resulting from
Barrett's Esophagus as a function of the

92
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:39,370
genetic diversity of the,
uh,

93
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,890
inflammations of verus found
in Barrett's esophagus.

94
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,160
This is the number of years
the patients were followed up.

95
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,330
And what you see on the graph is the
message that the patients that were in the

96
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,500
upper core tile for genetic diversity,
embarrass Esophagus,

97
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,150
uh,

98
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:01,150
we're also those that have the highest
incidents of esophageal Adenocarcinoma.

99
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,720
Those that were in the lower three core
tiles were much less likely to progress

100
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,703
to cancer.

101
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:12,610
So the genetic diversity of the conal
system instead of evolving cones,

102
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,270
which is providing the
fuel for natural selection,

103
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,490
is also a predictor of how likely those
clones will result in full on cancer.

104
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,820
Let's take a look at what clonal evolution
looks like and how it looks in cancer.

105
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,110
So here is a picture of
clonal evolution in general.

106
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,250
You'll note that clone a though.

107
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,150
Basically what you see is how much of
space is being occupied by a clone.

108
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,080
Here you have cone,
a Columbian.

109
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:49,150
See clone a is competitively
superior and it is excluding clone,

110
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:54,470
be in quote and see. And
it's also including excluding
clone AC. They all pop up,

111
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:58,460
but they disappear because they're
out competed by A. However,

112
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,740
a B is superior to a.

113
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:05,741
And so when the bee mutation arises
in a cell that already has a,

114
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,320
it spreads and excludes the others.
However,

115
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:13,040
the best combination is a, B, and c.

116
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:17,600
And when the c mutation arises in
a clone that already has a and B,

117
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,730
it spreads notice.

118
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:24,731
Then the clone a has interfered with clone
ac and it's slowed down the spread of

119
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:26,191
the scene.

120
00:08:26,191 --> 00:08:31,100
Mutan because the sea is not
effective until B has come along.

121
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:35,180
If we now look in
Barrett's esophagus here,

122
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,290
the orange background is uh,

123
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:43,310
in indicating a region of tissue where
there is the inflammation of Barrett's

124
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:48,620
esophagus. The Gray mutants are
neutral. They pop up and disappear.

125
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:54,190
Then a p 16 Mutan arises and it spreads
and takes over a neutral Mutan pops ups

126
00:08:55,231 --> 00:08:56,460
in a disappears.

127
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,140
Then there is a p 53 deletion.
However,

128
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:04,830
the p 16 Muneton out
competes the p 53 deletion.

129
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,370
The p 16 then gets to munes.

130
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:13,371
It's now homozygous for deletions of p
16 it spreads and takes over and within

131
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:17,010
that background,
a p 53 deletion arises.

132
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,460
It is within that stem,

133
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,480
that set of cells that have both the p
16 double deletion and a p 53 deletion

134
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,500
that esophageal adenocarcinoma arises.

135
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,830
You notice the two pictures look
fairly similar. In other words,

136
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:36,690
clonal evolution is going on and there
is a process of colonial interference

137
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:41,520
that can be documented in
Barrett's esophagus and you
can also see that you need

138
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:45,780
a sequence of mutations
to get to full on cancer.

139
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,950
So this view now has become standard.

140
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:54,390
The idea is that there are normal cells.

141
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,560
Then there are what are
called driver mutations.

142
00:09:57,561 --> 00:10:00,930
So they're viewed as being
causal in the spread of cancer,

143
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:05,931
but it takes a sequence of them until you
get a most recent common ancestor of a

144
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:15,501
cell that expands and it's clonal lineage
managers to take over and out of this

145
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:22,350
expanded clone come some that
conform distant metastasis.

146
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,370
So this is now become a
standard view of cancer. It's,

147
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:32,450
it's a process of clonal evolution and
requires a series of mutations and at a

148
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:37,530
certain time point a mutation will
occur which allows metastasis.

149
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,290
So to summarize,

150
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,810
cancer starts when a combination of
germline and somatic mutations produces

151
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:50,640
cells that slip out of cell cycle control,
increase in numbers,

152
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,930
and acquire the ability to move and
to insert themselves into tissues.

153
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,690
Cancers are genetically heterogeneous
sets of clones that are competing with

154
00:11:00,691 --> 00:11:03,900
each other for resources and space.
This is critical.

155
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,920
This is a critical part of how
we visualize what a cancer is.

156
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:12,360
It's not a single thing. It's a
genetically heterogeneous set of clones.

157
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,880
Competition among the clones generates
natural selection that favors clones that

158
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:20,790
can grow faster. They can
disperse in the kin, invade

159
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,900
this evolution is short
sighted and selfish.

160
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:29,580
The cancer is going to die
with the patient. It is not
transmitted to offspring.
