and...
[laughter]

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:45.771
A couple of years ago, I was
dating this woman,

00:01:45.804 --> 00:01:47.807
and she was way out of my
league, and I knew it,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.610
and she knew it, and I was
uncomfortable the whole time,

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:52.111
'cause I met her when I was
skinny,

00:01:52.144 --> 00:01:53.980
and I knew the fat she was
gonna drop,

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:55.615
and I was gonna get fat again.

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:57.316
I just knew it.

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:59.619
I knew it, and a year and a
half into the relationship

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:01.287
it happened.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.922
You know, you get comfortable
after a year and a half.

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:06.092
You gain that Netflix 15 or
whatever.

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.027
And that's what happened.
I got fat again

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.197
and had a sneaking suspicion
that she wanted to leave me

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.367
because I looked at her phone
when she was in the shower.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.968
[laughter]

00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:17.703
And this is what she told her
friend.

00:02:17.736 --> 00:02:20.039
She texted her friend.
She was like, "Hey,

00:02:20.072 --> 00:02:22.642
I think I'm gonna leave Chris."

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:24.277
And her friend was like, "Why?"

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.778
And she was like, "He's
starting to look like

00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:27.513
a fat Peter Dinklage.

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:29.982

00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:31.951

00:02:31.984 --> 00:02:33.986
Like, Peter Dinklage is
handsome, but Fat Dink

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.489
is not what I'm going for.

00:02:36.522 --> 00:02:38.691
So I freak out; I was like,
"I've got to lose some weight.

00:02:38.724 --> 00:02:40.193
"I've got to lose weight fast.

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:41.994
I want to stay with this girl,
you know."

00:02:42.027 --> 00:02:43.796
And I looked at the back of the
weekly paper,

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.998
and there's was an ad for a
boxing boot camp.

00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:47.800
And I was like, "That seems
like a good idea."

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:49.869
It's eight weeks,

00:02:49.902 --> 00:02:52.305
five days a week, 6:00 a.m. to
8:00 a.m.

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:56.175
And it was taught by these,
like, Irish gold glove boxers.

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:58.344
Like, fresh off the boat Irish
guys.

00:02:58.377 --> 00:03:00.346
I didn't understand a fucking
word they said.

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.182
They were just like...
[speaking gibberish]

00:03:03.215 --> 00:03:05.184
And it was, like, the sounded
like fuckin'

00:03:05.217 --> 00:03:07.920
Bono in reverse, right?

00:03:07.953 --> 00:03:09.822
But they were really good
trainers,

00:03:09.855 --> 00:03:12.024
and I was really into it, so I
started, like, training.

00:03:12.057 --> 00:03:14.193
I start boxing.
I'm, like, jumping rope.

00:03:14.226 --> 00:03:15.761
I'm running; I'm starting to,
like,

00:03:15.794 --> 00:03:17.230
cut weight and all this
stuff.

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:18.864
I'm really into it.

00:03:18.897 --> 00:03:21.867
My girlfriend leaves her laptop
in my apartment

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.269
with her G-chat open.

00:03:23.302 --> 00:03:25.271
I had to take a snoop.

00:03:25.304 --> 00:03:27.540
I had to, and I took a look,

00:03:27.573 --> 00:03:29.242
and she told her friend,
she was like,

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:33.179
"Hey, I think I'm gonna fuck
this DJ."

00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:36.048
And I was like, "You're gonna
fuck a DJ?

00:03:36.081 --> 00:03:40.219
Have fun having bedbugs and
paying for his fucking rent.

00:03:40.252 --> 00:03:41.354
That's some bullshit."

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:42.922
And I get mad, right?

00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:46.092
And I look him up, and this guy
is beautiful.

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:48.894
This guy is fucking fine as
fuck.

00:03:48.927 --> 00:03:51.397
He looks look Persian Common.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.898
[laughter]

00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:54.734
Imagine handsome-ass Common
with, like,

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:57.403
a hookah in his mouth; that
shit was sexy.

00:03:57.436 --> 00:03:58.971
[laughter]

00:03:59.004 --> 00:04:00.239
He's, like, a very beautiful
man, and I'm like,

00:04:00.272 --> 00:04:01.941
"Fuck this shit."

00:04:01.974 --> 00:04:04.076
And this is very embarrassing,
but this is what I did.

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.112
I went on his Facebook page,
and I printed out a picture

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:09.749
of him, and I put it in my
locker...

00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:11.550
[laughter]

00:04:11.583 --> 00:04:13.152
At the gym.

00:04:13.185 --> 00:04:14.920
It was a moment of weakness,
but I needed motivation.

00:04:14.953 --> 00:04:16.422
I need to lose weight, and I
was like,

00:04:16.455 --> 00:04:18.424
"I'm gonna put a picture of
this motherfucker

00:04:18.457 --> 00:04:19.992
up in my locker."

00:04:20.025 --> 00:04:21.594
I do that; this gay guy in my
class is like,

00:04:21.627 --> 00:04:23.396
"Is that your boyfriend?
He's beautiful."

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:24.930
[laughter]

00:04:24.963 --> 00:04:28.968
I'm like, "No, it's not my
fucking boyfriend.

00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:31.504
I'm gonna beat that guy off--
I mean, up."

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:33.105
Fuck!"

00:04:33.138 --> 00:04:34.640
[laughter]

00:04:34.673 --> 00:04:36.108
I'm getting all amped.

00:04:36.141 --> 00:04:37.943
I'm getting really into this
class.

00:04:37.976 --> 00:04:39.478
I'm, like, I've conflated these
two things, like,

00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:41.013
becoming a boxer and getting my
girl back,

00:04:41.046 --> 00:04:42.615
and one day I'm in class,
right,

00:04:42.648 --> 00:04:44.116
and there's, like--I'm
sparring.

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:45.985
And you spar with random
people.

00:04:46.018 --> 00:04:47.586
This one day I sparred with
this guy who's, like,

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:49.188
6'2", right?

00:04:49.221 --> 00:04:51.624
He's, like--I'm, like,
5-Dinklage, you know.

00:04:51.657 --> 00:04:53.426
I am not tall.

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:55.961
This guy's very tall, and--but
we're just doing body blows.

00:04:55.994 --> 00:04:57.430
We're sparring; we're only
allowed to hit each other

00:04:57.463 --> 00:04:59.031
in the body and stuff, and I'm,
like,

00:04:59.064 --> 00:05:00.800
a little intimidated,
but whatever.

00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:02.335
I'm trying to beat up Persian
Common right now.

00:05:02.368 --> 00:05:04.003
I don't give a fuck.

00:05:04.036 --> 00:05:05.938
So I'm punching this guy in the
stomach, right,

00:05:05.971 --> 00:05:08.808
and he blocks himself really
close to his stomach,

00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:11.677
and I punch him, and I punch
him in the nuts.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:12.845
And he's like, "Watch it, bro.

00:05:12.878 --> 00:05:14.280
You punched me in the nuts."

00:05:14.313 --> 00:05:16.315
And I'm like, "I didn't punch
you.

00:05:16.348 --> 00:05:18.317
"I punched you in the stomach,
but you're blocking too close

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.352
"to your body.

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:21.153
This is too close.

00:05:21.186 --> 00:05:23.155
"If you block right here, I'm
gonna punch you in the nuts.

00:05:23.188 --> 00:05:24.824
You need to block out here."
He was like, "Whatever, bro."

00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:26.826
I punch him again, boom, in the
nuts.

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:28.361
He was like, "You punched me in
the nuts."

00:05:28.394 --> 00:05:30.296
I was like, "No, you punched
you in the nuts."

00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:32.965
And then he comes, and he
sucker punches me in the face.

00:05:32.998 --> 00:05:34.500
And my face explodes.

00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:36.669
And there's just blood
everywhere down my shirt.

00:05:36.702 --> 00:05:38.237
I'm like, "Fuck you, dude."

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.072
Boom, and I take this crazy
swing at him,

00:05:40.105 --> 00:05:41.674
and we're just taking these
weird haymakers

00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:42.742
at each other.

00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:44.176
The class stops.

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:45.845
The class stops, circles around
us.

00:05:45.878 --> 00:05:47.346
One of the Irish coaches is
like,

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:50.483
"Finally some fuckin' boxin' in
here."

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:54.320
[laughter]

00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:57.356
And I'm like, "Fuck yeah, I
love this shit."

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:00.192
After the class, the boxing
coach is like, "Hey,

00:06:00.225 --> 00:06:03.729
after the eight weeks, we open
up the gym for a fight night."

00:06:03.762 --> 00:06:05.531
[laughter]

00:06:05.564 --> 00:06:08.868
"We invite a couple of the
boxers from the class to fight.

00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:10.703
"You can invite your friends

00:06:10.736 --> 00:06:12.571
"and your family and stuff.

"We have ringsider girls and
announcers and referees.

Would you want to participate
in that?"

00:06:19.912 --> 00:06:22.748
And I was like, "Yeah.

00:06:22.781 --> 00:06:24.283
"I want to do that.

00:06:24.316 --> 00:06:26.185
"I'm gonna invite my
girlfriend.

"I'm gonna get in a boxing
ring.

"I'm gonna beat some
motherfucker up.

00:06:29.254 --> 00:06:31.257
And I'm gonna win her back."

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.558
That was my plan.

00:06:32.591 --> 00:06:35.060
I show up the day of the fight.

00:06:35.093 --> 00:06:36.429
I ask my coach, "Who am I
fighting?"

00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:37.730
He was like, "Oh, you're
fighting the guy

00:06:37.763 --> 00:06:39.398
you punched in the nuts."

00:06:39.431 --> 00:06:41.233
I'm like, "Fuck, this guy's
6'2"."

00:06:41.266 --> 00:06:45.237
He's--he's like a blond, buff,
6'2" blond guy.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.239
He was buff when he got into
the class.

00:06:47.272 --> 00:06:48.908
If he was in an '80s movie, his
name would be, like,

00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:51.710
Rad Chad Masters.

00:06:51.743 --> 00:06:53.279
And I already pissed him off.

00:06:53.312 --> 00:06:54.880
I'm like, "This guy's gonna
fucking murder me.

00:06:54.913 --> 00:06:56.315
This is not what I'm going
for."

00:06:56.348 --> 00:06:58.417
You know what I mean?
And I'm nervous.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.119
And I was like, "I don't know
what to do."

00:07:00.152 --> 00:07:02.555
It's the day of the fight.
I call my dad.

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:04.723
My dad's an old Cuban man.

00:07:04.756 --> 00:07:06.792
Cubans love boxing.

00:07:06.825 --> 00:07:09.428
He's like my own Mr. Miyagi.

00:07:09.461 --> 00:07:11.764
Señor Miyagi.

00:07:11.797 --> 00:07:13.299
So I call my dad.
I'm like, "Papi."

00:07:13.332 --> 00:07:14.600
That's what I call him, 'cause
he's my dad,

00:07:14.633 --> 00:07:15.935
not 'cause he's Pitbull.

00:07:15.968 --> 00:07:19.138
I say...I say, "Papi, my
fight's tonight.

00:07:19.171 --> 00:07:20.840
I need some advice.
What do I do?"

00:07:20.873 --> 00:07:22.608
He's like, "Oh, yeah, no
problem.

00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:24.577
He's like, "Rack-a-tah,
Rack-a-tah, boom, boom, boom."

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.814
[speaking Spanish]

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:32.117
"That's it.
You beat the motherfucker up.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.119
That's all you need to do."

00:07:34.152 --> 00:07:37.356
[laughter and applause]

00:07:42.227 --> 00:07:43.963
And I'm like, "That's great,
Dad.

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:45.798
"The guy's 6'2", and he's like,
"Oh, okay.

00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:46.832
Yeah, you're gonna lose."

00:07:46.865 --> 00:07:48.534
[laughter]

00:07:48.567 --> 00:07:49.969
"You've got no chance, man.

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:51.437
"You're not gonna beat this guy
up.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.938
"I don't know; do the sign of
the cross

00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:55.474
"or some<i> brujerí</i> or some shit.

00:07:55.507 --> 00:07:57.276
"Actually, you know what?

00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:59.979
"The only way you're gonna beat
him is psychologically.

00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:03.315
"You need to get inside the
guy's head, okay?

00:08:03.348 --> 00:08:05.518
"He's more scared to lose to
you

00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:07.953
"than you are to lose to him,
okay?

00:08:07.986 --> 00:08:10.122
"So do some crazy shit.
Get in his head.

00:08:10.155 --> 00:08:11.790
"If he thinks he's gonna lose
to you,

00:08:11.823 --> 00:08:12.858
"at least you have a little
window of opportunity

00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:14.994
to fuck him up."

00:08:15.027 --> 00:08:18.163
And I was like, "Okay, thanks."

00:08:18.196 --> 00:08:20.499
So I was, like, that's kind
of--that's all I've got.

00:08:20.532 --> 00:08:21.867
What am I gonna do?

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.335
This guy's fuckin huge, you
know.

00:08:23.368 --> 00:08:26.839
And I'm like, "All right, be
weird

00:08:26.872 --> 00:08:28.173
"and crazy.

00:08:28.206 --> 00:08:29.842
Act like an idiot."

00:08:29.875 --> 00:08:32.077
So I was like, "I've got a day,
and so I was like,

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.179
"All right, I'm gonna buzz my
head."

00:08:34.212 --> 00:08:37.583
I buzz my head with a beard
trimmer.

00:08:37.616 --> 00:08:40.019
Like a fugitive running from
the fucking law.

00:08:40.052 --> 00:08:41.086
[laughter]

00:08:41.119 --> 00:08:42.588
I looked all crazy.

00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:44.990
I wore these dirty, bloody
basketball shorts

00:08:45.023 --> 00:08:46.525
from when he punched me.

00:08:46.558 --> 00:08:48.360
I never washed them.
They're down to here.

00:08:48.393 --> 00:08:51.196
I wore mismatched socks all the
way up to my knees

00:08:51.229 --> 00:08:54.199
like a fucking rodeo clown.

00:08:54.232 --> 00:08:56.035
I wore these dirty Chucks.

00:08:56.068 --> 00:08:58.938
I was the only boxer that did
not wear a shirt that night.

00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:00.439
I've got a tattoo and some
scars.

00:09:00.472 --> 00:09:02.174
I looked crazy.
I looked like a fucking

00:09:02.207 --> 00:09:03.742
out-of-work Juggalo.

00:09:03.775 --> 00:09:06.111
[laughter]

00:09:06.144 --> 00:09:07.713
And so I show up.

00:09:07.746 --> 00:09:09.081
I get in the ring.

00:09:09.114 --> 00:09:10.616
My girl's there.
My friends are watching.

00:09:10.649 --> 00:09:12.284
There's comedians there.

00:09:12.317 --> 00:09:14.019
I was like, "I better win or
I'm gonna get fucking

00:09:14.052 --> 00:09:15.421
heckled or dumped or some shit,
right?"

00:09:15.454 --> 00:09:19.558
So I show up; I'm in the ring.

00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:21.360
The announcer comes over, and
he's like,

00:09:21.393 --> 00:09:23.228
"Hey, what do you want me to
say about you?"

00:09:23.261 --> 00:09:25.898
And I was like, "Call me the
Cuban Missile Crisis."

00:09:25.931 --> 00:09:29.068
[laughter]

00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:30.436
And he announces me, and he's
like,

00:09:30.469 --> 00:09:35.140
"Chris 'The Cuban Missile
Crisis' Garcia."

00:09:35.173 --> 00:09:39.211
And I'm like, "Yeah!"

00:09:39.244 --> 00:09:42.314
And I--part of my crazy plan
was to, like,

00:09:42.347 --> 00:09:44.583
I'm not gonna look--before the
fight when we knock gloves,

00:09:44.616 --> 00:09:46.952
I'm not gonna look this
motherfucker in the eye.

00:09:46.985 --> 00:09:50.422
He's gonna look down at me by 6
inches and just be like,

00:09:50.455 --> 00:09:52.091
"I got you.

00:09:52.124 --> 00:09:54.159
You punched me in the nuts;
I'ma kill you, motherfucker."

00:09:54.192 --> 00:09:56.295
So I just, like, ignored his
face.

00:09:56.328 --> 00:09:59.264
And I just fucking
"Sling Blade'd" my face,

00:09:59.297 --> 00:10:02.601
and I just--I ended up staring
at his fucking nuts.

00:10:02.634 --> 00:10:05.137
I was just like...

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.640
[laughter]

00:10:07.673 --> 00:10:09.441
The fight starts.

00:10:09.474 --> 00:10:11.810
I'm too mesmerized by his nuts,
and he's just, like, boom,

00:10:11.843 --> 00:10:15.014
punches me, like, uppercut,
two uppercuts,

00:10:15.047 --> 00:10:16.582
and I'm, like, "Uhh," and
there's blood just

00:10:16.615 --> 00:10:18.951
going down my chin and just
down my chest,

00:10:18.984 --> 00:10:21.253
and I'm like, "Ah, fuck,"
and I'm like--

00:10:21.286 --> 00:10:23.455
this is not what I'm going for
right here.

00:10:23.488 --> 00:10:25.624
I'm not trying to get beat up
in front of this fool.

00:10:25.657 --> 00:10:27.026
So I get--I get close.

00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:28.794
I'm just running around all
crazy.

00:10:28.827 --> 00:10:31.130
And then he comes close, and I
punch him in the nuts.

00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:32.631
And he's like "Dude."

00:10:32.664 --> 00:10:34.500
He's like, "You fucking
nut-puncher!"

00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:36.201
And he pushes me across the
ring,

00:10:36.234 --> 00:10:37.870
and I'm like, "Ahh!"

00:10:37.903 --> 00:10:39.705
And I'm feeling--I don't
know if you've been in a fight

00:10:39.738 --> 00:10:41.707
before,
but your adrenaline is insane.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.344
And I see my girl and stuff,
and I'm like, "Ahh!"

00:10:45.377 --> 00:10:48.480
And I run towards the guy,
and I'm just like, "Ahh!"

00:10:48.513 --> 00:10:51.016
Flailing at him, and I hug him,
and I start punching him

00:10:51.049 --> 00:10:52.184
in the back of the head like
this.

00:10:52.217 --> 00:10:53.352
Like, he's, like, this tall.

00:10:53.385 --> 00:10:56.188
It was like this.
"Ahh!"

00:10:56.221 --> 00:10:57.956
It was fucking nuts.

00:10:57.989 --> 00:10:59.992
And the referee pulls me aside,
and he's like--he's like,

00:11:00.025 --> 00:11:01.627
"Stop it.
You're out of control."

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.662
And I spit my bloody mouthguard
out.

00:11:03.695 --> 00:11:05.864
I just go...and then I go,
"Fuck you!

00:11:05.897 --> 00:11:07.866
He's bigger than me!"

00:11:07.899 --> 00:11:09.068
And the crowd's like, "Yeah!"

00:11:09.101 --> 00:11:11.336
And I'm like, "Yeah.

00:11:11.369 --> 00:11:14.173
I'm a comedian.
I love this noise," you know?

00:11:14.206 --> 00:11:15.808
[laughter]

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:18.377
My boxing coach brings me into
the corner,

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.179
and he's like, "Hey, come over
here.

00:11:20.212 --> 00:11:22.681
You need to relax."

00:11:22.714 --> 00:11:24.049
[laughter]

00:11:24.082 --> 00:11:26.985
And I was like, "Okay, I'll
relax.

00:11:27.018 --> 00:11:28.353
Fine."
And he's like,

00:11:28.386 --> 00:11:29.822
"I put you against this guy,

00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:31.690
"'cause I think you could beat
him up.

00:11:31.723 --> 00:11:34.326
"You have a lot of heart, and
you put a lot into this.

00:11:34.359 --> 00:11:37.730
"Also, you're left-handed,
and he's right-handed.

00:11:37.763 --> 00:11:39.665
"So he's only used to boxing
right-handers.

00:11:39.698 --> 00:11:42.401
"You kind of have an advantage
in this weird way.

00:11:42.434 --> 00:11:44.369
"So when he comes in with a
hook,

00:11:44.402 --> 00:11:47.606
"you duck it, you enter, like,
toward the stomach,

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:49.341
"and you just punch him in the
guts.

00:11:49.374 --> 00:11:52.878
"Punch him--not in the nuts,
in the guts.

00:11:52.911 --> 00:11:54.880
Just bust his fucking guts."

00:11:54.913 --> 00:11:56.782
And I was like, "All right."

00:11:56.815 --> 00:11:58.684
I come in; he comes in with the
hook.

00:11:58.717 --> 00:12:00.519
"Oh, fuck."

00:12:00.552 --> 00:12:02.121
[laughter]

00:12:02.154 --> 00:12:03.589
"God damn it."

00:12:03.622 --> 00:12:05.124
And then we start fighting some
more.

00:12:05.157 --> 00:12:06.558
We're pushing each other
around.

00:12:06.591 --> 00:12:08.460
It's kind of crazy, and I'm
like,

00:12:08.493 --> 00:12:10.362
"All right, I'm just waiting
for this hook to come in."

00:12:10.395 --> 00:12:12.631
He comes, he punches me again,
and he punches me again,

00:12:12.664 --> 00:12:16.068
and my eye just immediately
swells up.

00:12:16.101 --> 00:12:19.972
It looks like a fucking raw
hamburger paddy slash butthole.

00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:21.440
[laughter]

00:12:21.473 --> 00:12:23.308
I could see it.
My eye was too closed.

00:12:23.341 --> 00:12:25.644
I was just like this, and I was
like, "Oh, dude,"

00:12:25.677 --> 00:12:29.248
and, like, time froze, and I'm
just looking at my girlfriend,

00:12:29.281 --> 00:12:30.816
and she was like, "No!"

00:12:30.849 --> 00:12:33.752
And I'm like, "Well, it was
nice knowing you.

00:12:33.785 --> 00:12:36.388
I'm about to lose, and this is
gonna be fucking terrible."

00:12:36.421 --> 00:12:38.123
I'm imagining here.

00:12:38.156 --> 00:12:41.293
I'm imagining Persian common
just fucking her super hard

00:12:41.326 --> 00:12:42.828
and just fucking ramming her.

00:12:42.861 --> 00:12:45.397
I'm thinking about my dad being
like,

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:47.766
"You fucking disappointment,
man.

00:12:47.799 --> 00:12:51.270
I came to America for this
bullshit, you know?"

00:12:51.303 --> 00:12:54.139
And I'm like, "All right,"
we box some more.

00:12:54.172 --> 00:12:55.574
He comes in with a hook,

00:12:55.607 --> 00:12:58.143
and I just fucking bust him in
the gut.

00:12:58.176 --> 00:12:59.778
I bust him in the gut.

00:12:59.811 --> 00:13:02.681
And then I hit him right--
right above the dick.

00:13:02.714 --> 00:13:06.785
Super--like, right here, and he
goes, "Ahh," like this,

00:13:06.818 --> 00:13:10.088
and he's like, "Don't punch me
in the nuts.

00:13:10.121 --> 00:13:11.523
Don't punch me in the nuts."

00:13:11.556 --> 00:13:13.692
And his hands are down here.

00:13:13.725 --> 00:13:16.361
And he's, like, right in front
of my face.

00:13:16.394 --> 00:13:17.796
And his face is exposed.

00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:21.533
His gloves and down, and I just
go boom.

00:13:21.566 --> 00:13:23.969
And I clocked his ass,
and he fell,

00:13:24.002 --> 00:13:25.804
and I beat him.

00:13:25.837 --> 00:13:28.874
[cheers and applause]

00:13:31.243 --> 00:13:35.147
Psychologically.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.783
He's just laying there flopping
around like fucking fish.

00:13:37.816 --> 00:13:40.285
And they call the fight, and it
was over.

00:13:40.318 --> 00:13:41.887
And I'm like, "Oh, shit.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.722
Ahh."

00:13:43.755 --> 00:13:47.292
And my girlfriend walks--she,
like, runs around towards me,

00:13:47.325 --> 00:13:49.194
like Adrian and Rocky or
whatever, and she's like,

00:13:49.227 --> 00:13:51.029
"Christian!"

00:13:51.062 --> 00:13:54.166
And she comes, and she throws
her arms around me,

00:13:54.199 --> 00:13:56.468
and she's all horny.

00:13:56.501 --> 00:13:58.003
She got super horny.

00:13:58.036 --> 00:13:59.671
She just saw me beat up some
big-ass dude.

00:13:59.704 --> 00:14:01.807
She gets all horny, and she's
like,

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.343
"Where'd you get these muscles
from?"

00:14:04.376 --> 00:14:06.511
And she starts grabbing these
weird muscles

00:14:06.544 --> 00:14:08.313
that are gone now, but she was,
like,

00:14:08.346 --> 00:14:10.849
grabbing these weird muscles,
and I realized, I was like,

00:14:10.882 --> 00:14:13.685
"You haven't touched me in over
two months."

00:14:13.718 --> 00:14:16.688
So that night, I took her home.

00:14:16.721 --> 00:14:20.525
I showed her what the Cuban
Missile Crisis was all about.

00:14:20.558 --> 00:14:21.693
I won her back.

00:14:21.726 --> 00:14:23.195
And then I broke up with her.

00:14:23.228 --> 00:14:28.867
[cheers and applause]

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.235
You guys have been great.

00:14:30.268 --> 00:14:32.738
My name is Chris Garcia.
Good night.

00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:36.008
<i> - Chris Garcia, everybody,
 Chris.</i>
