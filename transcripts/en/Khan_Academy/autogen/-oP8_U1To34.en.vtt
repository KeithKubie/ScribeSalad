00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.119
click on the graph below to draw a right

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129
click on the graph below to draw a right
 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.820
click on the graph below to draw a right
triangle with right angle at x equals 8

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830
triangle with right angle at x equals 8
 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.400
triangle with right angle at x equals 8
y equals 6 and hypotenuse extending from

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410
y equals 6 and hypotenuse extending from
 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.430
y equals 6 and hypotenuse extending from
0 comma 14 to negative 10 comma negative

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440
0 comma 14 to negative 10 comma negative
 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.830
0 comma 14 to negative 10 comma negative
12 well it looks like they've given us

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840
12 well it looks like they've given us
 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.900
12 well it looks like they've given us
the three vertices of the triangle so we

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910
the three vertices of the triangle so we
 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.939
the three vertices of the triangle so we
could just plot them so let's just it

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949
could just plot them so let's just it
 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.320
could just plot them so let's just it
says click to add vertices so let's do

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330
says click to add vertices so let's do
 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.150
says click to add vertices so let's do
that we have one at eight comma 6 x

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160
that we have one at eight comma 6 x
 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.620
that we have one at eight comma 6 x
equals 8 y is equal to 6 then we have 1

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630
equals 8 y is equal to 6 then we have 1
 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.179
equals 8 y is equal to 6 then we have 1
at 0 comma 14 so x equals 0 Y is equal

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189
at 0 comma 14 so x equals 0 Y is equal
 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.759
at 0 comma 14 so x equals 0 Y is equal
to 14 and it drew the line there and

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769
to 14 and it drew the line there and
 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.530
to 14 and it drew the line there and
then we go from negative and then we go

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540
then we go from negative and then we go
 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.630
then we go from negative and then we go
from that point 2 negative 10 comma

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640
from that point 2 negative 10 comma
 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.290
from that point 2 negative 10 comma
negative 12 negative 10 I'm sorry X is

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300
negative 12 negative 10 I'm sorry X is
 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.170
negative 12 negative 10 I'm sorry X is
negative 10 X is negative 10 y is

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180
negative 10 X is negative 10 y is
 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.600
negative 10 X is negative 10 y is
negative 12 so we go to that point right

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610
negative 12 so we go to that point right
 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.279
negative 12 so we go to that point right
over there and then we can just connect

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289
over there and then we can just connect
 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.900
over there and then we can just connect
everything back by going to our original

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910
everything back by going to our original
 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.029
everything back by going to our original
point and there we haven't even drew the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039
point and there we haven't even drew the
 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.979
point and there we haven't even drew the
nice right angle right over there there

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989
nice right angle right over there there
 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.420
nice right angle right over there there
we have it we have our right triangle

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430
we have it we have our right triangle
 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.680
we have it we have our right triangle
we'd literally just have to plot the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690
we'd literally just have to plot the
 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.139
we'd literally just have to plot the
points in order actually any order would

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149
points in order actually any order would
 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.610
points in order actually any order would
have worked because there's only three

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620
have worked because there's only three
 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.109
have worked because there's only three
points here so yeah that was it
