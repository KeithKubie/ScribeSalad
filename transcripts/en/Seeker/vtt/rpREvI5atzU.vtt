00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.889
Our planet has a terminator.

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:11.180
No, not a time traveling humanoid robot, but
a line where its light and dark side meet.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.620
On Earth we see the Sun rise from the East
and set in the West.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:22.050
But if you were looking straight down from
space, you would see half the planet lit,

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.430
and the other half in total darkness.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.380
That’s the terminator.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.490
The terminator, also called solar terminator
or the “twilight zone” moves around our

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.980
planet once a day.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.309
The Earth is constantly rotating, and it’s
got a little tilt to it.

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.670
Our planet orbits the sun at a 23.5 degree
angle.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:54.430
That axial tilt causes one pole to be facing
the Sun, and the other pole facing away, which

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.921
gives our planet its four seasons.

00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:58.679
And the shape of the terminator curve changes
with the seasons.The terminator is a guide

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:01.260
for solar-powered low earth orbit satellites.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:15.610
They ride the line in total sunlight to take
pictures of Earth.So while the terminator

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.369
doesn’t really do anything, it is good for
science!

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.030
You can watch new episodes of Space Crafts
right here every Wednesday.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.600
In this edition, we break out everyone's favorite
elementary school science experiment to explain

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.190
how galactic ice volcanoes erupt on Enceladus.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.960
