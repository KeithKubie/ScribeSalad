00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.970
What I want to do in this video
is think about how expressions

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.640
are formed and the
words we use to describe

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.596
the different parts
of an expression.

00:00:08.596 --> 00:00:09.970
And the reason
why this is useful

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.220
is when you hear other people
refer to some expression

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.370
and say, oh, I don't agree
with the second term,

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.670
or the third term
has four factors,

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.736
or why is the coefficient
on that term 6,

00:00:18.736 --> 00:00:20.360
you'll know what
they're talking about,

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.040
and you can communicate
in the same way.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.270
So let's think about what
those words actually mean.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.310
So we have an expression here.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.018
And the first thing
I want to think about

00:00:27.018 --> 00:00:32.450
are the terms of an
expression or what a term is.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.900
And one way to think about it
is the terms are the things that

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.720
are getting added
and subtracted.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.110
So, for example, in this
expression right over here,

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.690
you have three things that are
getting added and subtracted.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.190
The first thing, you're
taking 2 times 3.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.760
You're adding that to 4.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.970
And then from that,
you're subtracting 7y.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.290
So in this example,
you have three terms.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.050
The first term is 2 times 3.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.280
The second term is
just the number 4.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.530
And the third term is 7 times y.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.339
Now, let's think about
the term "factor."

00:01:10.339 --> 00:01:12.130
And when people are
talking about a factor,

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.780
especially in terms
of an expression,

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.321
they're talking
about the things that

00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:17.830
are getting multiplied
in each term.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.350
So, for example,
if you said, what

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.020
are the factors
of the first term?

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.100
The first term refers to this
one right over here-- 2 times

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.730
3.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.200
And there's two factors.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.280
There's a 2 and
a 3, and they are

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.470
being multiplied by each other.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.580
So here you have two
factors in the first term.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.720
What about the second term?

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.160
This was the first term.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.190
The second term here has
only one factor, just the 4.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.030
It's not being
multiplied by anything.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.540
And the third term here,
once again, has two factors.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.710
It's the product of 7 times y.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.570
So we have two factors here.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.630
We have a 7 and a y.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.920
And this constant factor
here, this number 7

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.960
that is multiplying
the variable,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.420
also has a special name.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.125
It is called the coefficient
of this term-- coefficient.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.320
And the coefficient
is the nonvariable

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.391
that multiplies the
rest of the term.

00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:19.890
That's one way of
thinking about it.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.820
So here's 7y.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.170
Even if it was 7xy
or 7xyz or 7xyz

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.590
squared, that nonvariable that's
multiplying everything else,

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.730
we would consider to
be the coefficient.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.147
Now, let's do a
few more examples.

00:02:32.147 --> 00:02:34.104
And in each of these--
I encourage you actually

00:02:34.104 --> 00:02:36.780
right now to pause the video--
think about what the terms are.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.960
How many terms are there
in each expression, how

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.470
many factors in each term,
and what are the coefficients?

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.160
So let's look at this first one.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.850
It's clear that we have three
things being added together.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.000
This is the first term.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.260
This is the second term.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.490
And this is the third term.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.810
So this is the first term.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.810
This is the second term.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.220
This is the third term.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.020
And they each have two factors.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.160
This first one has
the factors 3 and x.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.310
The second one here has
the factors x and y.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.280
And this third one has
the factors y and z.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.830
Now, what are the
coefficients here?

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.746
Well, remember, coefficients
was a nonvariable

00:03:13.746 --> 00:03:15.920
multiplying a bunch
of other variables.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.300
And so here, the coefficient in
this first term right over here

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.380
is a 3.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.880
Now, you might be
saying, well, what

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.201
about the coefficients on
these terms right over here?

00:03:24.201 --> 00:03:25.700
Depending on how
you think about it,

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.660
one way to say it
is, well, xy is

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.790
the same thing as 1 times xy.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.845
So some people would
say that, hey, you

00:03:31.845 --> 00:03:34.130
have a coefficient
of 1 here on the xy.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.320
Or it's implicitly there.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.892
It wasn't written, but you're
multiplying everything by 1.

00:03:38.892 --> 00:03:40.600
And that might be
subject to a little bit

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.390
of interpretation
one way or another.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.600
Now, this one is
really interesting,

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.680
because if we look at
the bigger expression,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.800
if we look at the
whole thing, it's

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.150
clearly made up of three terms.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.860
The first term is xyz.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.050
The second term is x plus
1, that whole thing times y.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.019
And then the third term is 4x.

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.560
And if you look at that level,
if you look at the first term,

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.710
and you say, well, how many
factors does that have?

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.650
Well, you would say that it has
three factors-- x, y, and z.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.570
How many factors does
the second term have?

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.486
Well, you could say,
well, it has two factors.

00:04:15.486 --> 00:04:20.459
One factor is x plus y, and
then the other factor is y.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.050
The first factor is x plus 1.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.130
And the second one is y.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.610
It's multiplying
this expression.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.620
This smaller expression
itself is one of the factors.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.040
And the other one is y.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.970
And then this third one also
has two factors, a 4 and an x.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.710
And if someone said, hey, what's
the coefficient on this term?

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.577
You would say, hey, look,
the coefficient is the 4.

00:04:42.577 --> 00:04:44.160
Now, let's look at
this one over here.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.785
Actually, before I look at that
one, what was interesting about

00:04:46.785 --> 00:04:49.960
this is that here you had
a little smaller expression

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.740
itself acting as
one of the factors.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.540
So then you can go
and then zoom in

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.120
on this expression
right over here.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.750
And you can ask
the same question.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.740
On this smaller expression,
how many terms does it have?

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.580
Well, it has two
terms-- an x and a 1.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.910
Those are the two things
being added or subtracted.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.390
And each of them have
exactly one factor.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.440
So when we're giving
these, you can

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.660
keep nesting these expressions
to think about when you talk

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.570
about terms or factors
or factors of terms,

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.164
you have to really specify
what part of the nesting

00:05:20.164 --> 00:05:21.080
you're thinking about.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.690
If you're talking about the
terms of this whole expression,

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.540
there's one, two, three.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.730
But then you could look at this
subexpression, which itself

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.440
is a factor of a term,
and say, oh, well,

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.900
there's only two
terms in this one.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.460
Now, let's look at this one.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.554
How many terms?

00:05:37.554 --> 00:05:39.220
Well, once again,
there's clearly three.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.969
Actually, let me add
one more, because I'm

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:42.850
tired of expressions
with three terms.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.220
So I'm just going
to add a 1 here.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.130
So now, we clearly
have four terms.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.040
This is the first term, second
term, third term, fourth term.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.690
And how many factors
are in each of them?

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:53.900
Well, this is interesting.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.430
You might say, well, the
factors are the things

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.513
that are being multiplied.

00:05:56.513 --> 00:05:58.580
But here I'm dividing by y.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.730
Remember, dividing by
y is the same thing

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.695
as multiplying by
its reciprocal.

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:04.070
So it would usually
be considered

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.570
to have three
factors here, where

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.000
the factors are 3x and 1/y.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.880
If you multiplied 3
times x times 1/y,

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.184
you're going to get exactly
what you have right over here.

00:06:16.184 --> 00:06:17.850
So you would say this
has three factors.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.724
If someone asks, what's
the coefficient here?

00:06:19.724 --> 00:06:22.430
Well, you'd say, well,
that 3 is the coefficient.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.029
Here how many
factors do you have?

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:26.320
And this is a little bit
tricky, because you might say,

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.690
well, isn't 5x squared times
y, isn't that equal to 5 times

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.760
x times x times y?

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.480
And you'd be right.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.770
So it would be very tempting to
say that you have four factors.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.130
But the convention, the
tradition that most people use,

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.640
is that they
consider the exponent

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.560
with x as a base as just
one factor, this as just one

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.350
factor.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.670
So traditionally, people will
say this has three factors.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.980
It has a 5x squared
and a y. x squared

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.150
is just considered a factor.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.180
And once again, what's
the coefficient?

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.570
It's the 5.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.300
So with that in mind,
how many factors here?

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.340
Well, you have
three factors here.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.650
You have an x.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.450
You have a y squared.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.630
And you have a z to the fifth.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.200
And then, finally, this last
term, it's a constant term.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.450
How many factors does it have?

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:17.060
Well, it's just 1.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.393
It's just got a 1 sitting there.

00:07:18.393 --> 00:07:20.190
It's not being
multiplied by anything.
