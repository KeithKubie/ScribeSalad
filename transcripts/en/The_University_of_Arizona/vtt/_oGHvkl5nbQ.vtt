00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.830
Many of you I see when
I walk across the campus

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.180
every morning.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.540
As I said, until today
I've been a volunteer,

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.670
but I've enjoyed walking
in with some of you

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.280
and talking about what
you do for the university

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.950
and how great this place is.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.510
Right now I'm
going to invite you

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.840
all into Old Main for
refreshments, and let's go in

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.230
and enjoy a good
time of fellowship.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.590
Thank you all for being here.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.570
So let's go inside.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.940
Take me at my word.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.560
I am going to be out on campus.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.955
I'm going to be involved.

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:40.920
That's Amy's worst
nightmare, because she's

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.440
trying to keep me on schedule
and keep me in my lane.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.880
But as I've told
everyone, my favorite time

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.890
is start meetings about
7:00 o'clock at night,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.860
because the only
time limit on that

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.440
is 7 o'clock in the morning
getting back to the office.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.940
Hello.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.910
I'm in the college
ofr agriculture.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:58.910
Been there for 40 years.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:59.840
Wnat to welcome you.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.339
Wow.

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:02.070
Thank you very much
for doing that.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.720
You must have started
in junior high.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.900
'76.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.530
Wow.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.850
I really want to be able to
meet everybody who came out here

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.630
today.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.440
And as you guys know who've
seen me around campus,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.760
I will be out there.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.530
Please come up and speak to me.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.140
It's incredible the number
of people who've just come up

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.940
to me and told me their story.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.860
And there's so many
great stories here.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.819
So excited you're here.

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:25.318
Good.

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:27.320
Well, I didn't think
anybody was going to come.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.910
But this is great.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.970
Thank you each and
every one of you

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.280
for what you do
for the university.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.510
We're only as strong
as our weakest link.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.290
And everybody here
has an important job

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.550
that you do every day.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.945
I wanted you to know that
tribal nations are very, very

00:01:42.945 --> 00:01:44.890
excited that you're
our president,

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.640
so there will be many more
opportunities for engagement.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.030
So thank you for being here
and bear down to move up.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.480
