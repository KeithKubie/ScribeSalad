00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.750
Additive increase increases efficiency because it

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.440
gets us closer to that efficiency line

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.270
parallel to the X1 equals X2

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.620
line. It technically also decreases fairness because

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.440
the centers are both increasing their

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.180
rates so we're relatively further away from

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.450
this X1 equals X2 line. In

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.550
contrast, remember that multiplicative decrease reduces efficiency

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.880
by moving us further away from this green dotted line, but

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.010
it increases fairness by moving us closer to the blue dotted line.
