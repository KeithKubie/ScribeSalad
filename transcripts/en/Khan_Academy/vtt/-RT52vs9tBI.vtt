00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.015
5,524 plus 0.

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:04.160
Well, I'm adding 0.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.250
I'm adding nothing, so it's
still just going to be 5,524.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.624
By what number can we
multiply 8,895 to get 1?

00:00:14.624 --> 00:00:16.290
Well, we're going to
have to multiply it

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.790
times its reciprocal.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.960
So we're going to
multiply it times--

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.390
or we could say its
multiplicative inverse is

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.170
sometimes one way of
thinking about it.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.020
And that's just
going to be 1/8,895.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.800
You multiply 8,895
times 1/8,895,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.075
you are going to get 1.

00:00:40.075 --> 00:00:42.570
1,555 times 1.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.980
Well, anything times 1 is
going to be that anything,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.720
so this is essentially
saying one 1,555.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.950
So that's just
going to be 1,555.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.825
1,543 plus 0.

00:00:57.825 --> 00:00:59.200
Well, we're adding
nothing to it,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.970
so it's just going to be 1,543.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.470
5,804 plus 0.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.160
Once again, we're adding nothing
to it, so it's just 5,804.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.970
What number can we add
to 1,893 to get to 0?

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.370
So we're going to have to
essentially take 1,893 away.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.520
So the only number that we can
add that would take away 1,893

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.500
is negative 1,893.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.830
This added to 1,893
is equal to 0.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.210
Anything times 1 is going
to be that anything,

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.340
so it's going to be 7,360.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.090
By what number can we
multiply 4,850 to get 1?

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.560
Well, we've already done this.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:51.500
This is just going to be
1/4,850, and we are done.
