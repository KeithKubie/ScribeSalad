00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.660
Today's episode is brought to you by T-Mobile America's best unlimited Network

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.539
What's going on guys? Game of Thrones!

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.360
Season 7 is nigh and there's so many characters so many plot points

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.580
I forgot a lot of what happened last season

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.840
So that's why we do our public service: "The Idiot's Guide to Game of Thrones", and we've got an amazing

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.229
crew to break down the last season for us. In fact

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:35.189
They are the hosts of Screen Junkies show 'Watching Thrones'. First, I'd like to introduce, you know her from

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.370
SJ News and all over the place Roth Cornet. Hello

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.120
I'm excited to get our Thrones on. Oh, she was one of the previous hosts of Watching Thrones, and she's emerged back

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.550
Welcome back Michelle Boyd. Thank you very much for having me again. I have a raging Throaner right now

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.299
He's the head writer of Honest Trailers. You know him, you love him, Spencer Gilbert

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.239
I drink and I know things, Hal. So we're going to break this down

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:04.198
piece by piece to make sure that you guys are all caught up and ready for the premiere of season 7. Roth,

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.199
shall we venture to the North. So the season opens and after torturing us fans

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.289
letting us guess Jon Snow is dead, Jon Snow is dead,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.180
finally as predicted Melisandre brings him back to life at the behest of Ser Davos. "You were dead,

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.140
and now you're not. It's completely

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:32.700
*beep* mad." So maybe he's basically bulletproof for the rest of the series? He uses this opportunity to basically get out of his oath. "My watch has ended."

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.540
So yeah, we learned a little bit more about Melisandre. She went from Red Fox to Silver Fox! *laughs*

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.909
Or not quite a Silver Fox. She was yeah, just a hag. Like a hundred and ninety years old!

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.380
I do think that she will come back because I do think she has a larger role to play and she's still a big believer

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.449
in Jon Snow. "If you return to the North, I'll have you hanged as a murderer." There was a nice

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.508
Brother-Sister/Bastard-Sister reunion.

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.099
Since the first episode you're waiting for the Starks to get back together and who is it? It's Sansa and Jon who actually

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.210
didn't have that close of a relationship, but because of everything that they've been through

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.819
it's kind of 'trench mentality' and now they're very close. Except that she's not fully trusting Jon

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.390
She has an alliance with Littlefinger that she doesn't tell him about. Meanwhile Littlefinger is trying to convince her that

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.120
He and she together should take the Iron Throne. "...and you by my side."

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.640
So fan-favorite Lyanna Mormont comes out of nowhere to steal our hearts and make us want to elect her as president of the world

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:39.520
And she's ultimately able to get everyone rallying behind Jon. "He's my king from this day until his last day."

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.980
"The King in the North!"

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.140
And they're sort of like a sideways glance

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:49.829
and you're wondering is Littlefinger going to be able to convince her to go to the darkside fully. Now Ramsay has

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.220
Rickon. Of course Jon being Jon tried to save Rickon, which he cannot do.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.960
*Gasps*

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.180
Jon Snow in one of the most amazing sequences of the season - you're right in the middle of it

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.049
Claustrophobic. So it's this amazing battle sequence,

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.089
and it looks like all is lost and lo and behold

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:12.029
the Knights of the Vale come to save the day in his big battle against Ramsay. "You suggested one-on-one

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.130
combat, didn't you? I've reconsidered."

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.749
He's going after Ramsay at Winterfell. Taking his home back. Taking his life back, and he just bleeds him to a bloody fricking pulp.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.019
Oh yeah. So Sansa turns his own hounds on him. You realize she's had one of the best arcs on the show. *Barks*

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:36.959
Moving on to Michelle. Would you please take us beyond the wall. Poor freakin Meera has just been dragging Bran around for

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.880
seasons at this point, but we finally learned what Hodor's name means.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.500
"Hold the door!"

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.380
*Echos* "Hold the door!"

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.320
Frickin Bran! So it's his fault.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.480
Basically he was possessing Hodor to hold the door against the Undead Army in order to let him get away

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Hold the door! Hold the door!

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.480
Talk to us about the Three-eyed Raven. He basically tells Bran, "the time has come for you to become me."

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.628
He dies. He lets Bran kind of take over the Green Seer and

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.959
gives him this new quest to go back

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.720
I'm the Three-eyed Raven now.

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:18.638
Green Seer basically just is kind of communing with Nature sort of thing. He taps into it with trees

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.909
He is able to tap into the history of Westeros

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.019
He basically is able to time travel and use the trees as sort of a Delorean. Woah!

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:33.459
I mean essentially. Bran goes back to a very key moment and Bran just learned that Lyanna made Ned promise to protect Jon

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.430
Lyanna is actually the mother and

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:44.440
probably Rhaegar Targaryen is the father. And he can influence events in the past. "Father!"

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.229
One more thing is that Benjen Stark came back in a big way

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.939
Coldhands appeared and for book nerds we were looking forward to the appearance of this character

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.949
And he helped his nephew Bran and Meera to escape. And then of course he was stuck behind the wall

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:05.949
But the question becomes for how long? Does Benjin come beyond the wall with the rest of the White Walkers? "I'll do what I can."

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.180
"As long as I can."

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.139
Spencer, um, let's go to your favorite spot on the map King's Landing. Oh, it's such a lovely cesspool!

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.669
To really understand King's Landing this season you have to know that as always

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:25.749
It's all about who controls the throne. Which at the beginning of season six, held by little bowl-cutted, kitten cuddling Tommen Baratheon

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.020
*Laughs* Aww! Yup!

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.900
And there's three very powerful factions vying for control of him. One is the Tyrells. They have their daughter

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.240
Margaery, married to Tommen so she's the Queen. Now team two is as always Cersei. She's got her claws into her kid

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.120
She's lost two out of three children already. She's got a seven-foot-tall zombie bodyguard

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.640
*Crunch*

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.920
And then finally we have this newly empowered branch of the High Sparrow and

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.880
religion has started to play a big part in King's Landing. "It's what the Gods wanted."

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.600
Cersei has got a trial date coming up for incest

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.680
You've got Margaery and Loras

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.119
imprisoned and this causes the other two

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.179
former rivals the Tyrells and the Lannisters to join together to put aside their differences and to take out the High Sparrow

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:14.680
But Tommen comes out and stops the ruckus from really happening. "The Crown and the Faith, together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.640
to glory." Oh no, Cersei's defeated. Or is she?

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:27.849
Kaboom! She had wildfire planted under the Great Sept of Baelor, blew it all up. Everybody dead. So long!

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:34.750
Tommen, sweet little child that he is, was so distraught. He took a long jump off a high tower and never to be seen again

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.160
Cersei is down

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.510
three kids, up a glass of wine and up the Iron Throne which is what she may wanted all along.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.059
I now proclaim Cersei of the House Lannister

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:52.600
Who arrives back in King's Landing at that very moment? Jaime did show up at the end of this season

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.790
He kind of went on a detour before that to break the siege of Riverrun. So he's really going through

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.929
this kind of identity crisis of what his role is. Is he a knight?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.260
Who's he hold his loyalty to? He's still obsessed with Cersei, as he confesses, but then you also have big Brienne of Tarth,

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.440
holding him to a more chivalrous standard. "It's yours."

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.840
"It'll always be yours." Talk to us about Qyburn and

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:23.019
FrankenMountain. Qyburn, so he's an ex-Maester gone bad, pumping the Mountain

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.839
last seen dead in Trial by Combat

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:32.769
full of evil juice to make him into an unstoppable killing machine. Yes. You get to see a lot of that in season six

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:38.109
and it's awesome. Varys had his Little Birds, but the Little Birds are still present. Little Birds has been interesting

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.200
it's a term that Varys used throughout the series and it's a network of spies

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.140
made up of little children who will stab you if you cross them

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:53.080
So Margaery Tyrell is gone, but Lady Olenna is still around. Well, she ends the season lining up with Dorne

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.359
And what is my heart's desire?

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.810
Fire and blood

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:04.969
Michelle will you take us to Essos? At the beginning of the season you see Dani being kidnapped by a khalasar to get brought to

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:10.820
Vaes Dothrak. When Drogo was killed, Dani was supposed to go there and join the Dosh Khaleen

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:15.320
which is just basically the group of widows. So she gets brought over to Vaes Dothrak and

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:20.180
she says I'm not having any of this and burns them all. "Yeri vadrivoe."

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.820
Tyrion is there with her, they finally got together.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:31.610
She made him Hand of the Queen. "I'd swear you my sword, but I don't actually own a sword."

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:35.929
After kicking out Daario to the curb saying yeah, you're cute

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:38.840
you're great in bed, but I'm gonna need to find me a husband.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:44.840
"I can't bring another to Westeros." Theon and Yara came from Pyke. They

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.569
technically are royalty however

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:55.920
the Ironborn choose their next king and Theon and Yara's uncle Euron comes back after killing, Theon and Yara's father

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.480
"Aaargh!"

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:03.589
to take the throne by basically saying I'm going to let you all rape and murder and pillage as much as you want,

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.720
elect me King!

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.320
*Cheers*

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:12.440
He eventually wants to get over to Dany and make some kind of alliance with her. Theon and Yara get to Dany first and

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:20.389
make the alliance with her giving her all of the ships that they stole from the Ironborn. "Won't be enough to save them." Dany is finally

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:26.809
going to Westeros after six fricken seasons. Right?! She's going Westeros! She has an Unsullied army

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:33.720
She has ships from Yara, and Theon she's finally going with three full-blown dragons

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.000
*Roars*

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.120
Arya is also on her way home from Essos. She was the Girl With No Name

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.760
she was the blind little girl with no name who just keeps getting beaten up

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.040
Ugh!

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:51.109
Until she finally has a showdown with the Waif, she becomes no-one and Jaqen H'ghar says cool

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:55.310
you're one of us and she says no, peace, I'm going home. I'm Arya Stark mother*beep*er! Yeah!

00:09:56.130 --> 00:10:01.939
The List still does mean something to her because in the last episode she goes after Walder Frey

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:07.039
"The last thing you're ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die."

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.450
Let's move on to a little speed round Jorah is, uh, he needs to visit the

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.080
dermatologist. Jorah has the same thing that

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:20.360
Stannis's daughter had. He has greyscale. The last thing that happens to Jorah is he does get exiled by Dany again

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:27.640
Saying "I command on you to heal yourself. Find the cure." Spencer, back on you, talk to us about those lovebirds Sam and Gilly

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:33.080
They're still together. They got a baby. He stole his dad's sword. He's studying at college. And that's the Citadel right?

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:37.840
Excellent. Roth, catch us up on the Hound. The Hound, who's a character that we love, that we thought was dead

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:42.800
He comes back, but it's very quickly, he meets up with this guy, Brother Ray who is Ian McShane

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.800
which is amazing, and this rogue group of

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.560
Brothers Without Banners coming in and they kill everyone that the Hound has connected with

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.380
taking away his reason to be a better man. So now

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:55.070
he's out for blood. He goes and he finds the Brothers Without Banners to get his revenge

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:59.090
But they're already gonna kill the rogues. The Brotherhood Without Banners is now headed to The Wall

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:03.019
It's possible that they'll connect with Melisandre on the way. And Beric Dondarrion,

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:07.429
who's been a part of the thing since season one is back, boom! And he's going to play a big role and we'll talk about that

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.300
more on our show. Ooh!

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.169
"Cold winds are rising in the North. We could use you."

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:18.349
Wow, you guys have done the yeoman's work you've taken us on a tour of season six now

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:25.610
I want to talk about, real quick, this new segment you have you're introducing to Watching Thrones called Raging Throaners. First off,

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:28.940
what exactly is a Raging Throaner? It's just the thing that gets us the most

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:34.849
excited about that episode or in this case the entire season. Would each of you give us your Raging Throaner from

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:42.140
season six. It was the explosion of the Sept. That whole sequence, that opening sequence to the finale was so

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:48.680
beautifully done, so talked about, and that's it. Erm, my favorite moment, Arya slitting Walder Frey's throat

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.080
It's been a culmination of everything

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:56.389
since her brother and her mother died, since her father died, since the List started

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.509
Finally she gets to cross the big one off her list

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:04.520
I'll say Jon Snow and the Battle of the Bastards. That one moment where he runs out and wants to take on

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:09.669
the entire army, solo. Come at me Boltons, I'm right here! Beautiful. What a great moment.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:15.970
You know what those are all great Raging Throaners. I can't pick one better than the next. What's your Raging Throaner?

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:21.040
What's something that we left out or what's something that you're looking forward to in season seven of Game of Thrones?

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.930
Let us know in the comments section below, we want to know. I want to thank you guys for coming in and
