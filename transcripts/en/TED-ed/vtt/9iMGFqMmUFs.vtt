00:00:06.505 --> 00:00:08.807
Water is virtually everywhere,

00:00:08.807 --> 00:00:11.259
from soil moisture and ice caps,

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.086
to the cells inside our own bodies.

00:00:14.086 --> 00:00:16.181
Depending on factors like location,

00:00:16.181 --> 00:00:17.399
fat index,

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:18.114
age,

00:00:18.114 --> 00:00:19.202
and sex,

00:00:19.202 --> 00:00:23.808
the average human is between 55-60% water.

00:00:23.808 --> 00:00:27.024
At birth, human babies are even wetter.

00:00:27.024 --> 00:00:32.307
Being 75% water, 
they are swimmingly similar to fish.

00:00:32.307 --> 00:00:37.331
But their water composition drops to 65%
by their first birthday.

00:00:37.331 --> 00:00:40.196
So what role does water 
play in our bodies,

00:00:40.196 --> 00:00:44.288
and how much do we actually need to drink
to stay healthy?

00:00:44.288 --> 00:00:48.529
The H20 in our bodies works to cushion
and lubricate joints,

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:49.948
regulate temperature,

00:00:49.948 --> 00:00:53.932
and to nourish the brain and spinal cord.

00:00:53.932 --> 00:00:56.062
Water isn't only in our blood.

00:00:56.062 --> 00:01:00.510
An adult's brain and heart are almost
three quarters water.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.367
That's roughly equivalent to the amount
of moisture in a banana.

00:01:04.367 --> 00:01:08.487
Lungs are more similar to an apple at 83%.

00:01:08.487 --> 00:01:14.310
And even seemingly dry human bones
are 31% water.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.051
If we are essentially made of water,

00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:17.634
and surrounded by water,

00:01:17.634 --> 00:01:20.492
why do we still need to drink so much?

00:01:20.492 --> 00:01:24.293
Well, each day we lose two to three liters
through our sweat,

00:01:24.293 --> 00:01:25.227
urine,

00:01:25.227 --> 00:01:26.707
and bowel movements,

00:01:26.707 --> 00:01:28.371
and even just from breathing.

00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:30.859
While these functions 
are essential to our survival,

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:33.306
we need to compensate for the fluid loss.

00:01:33.306 --> 00:01:37.848
Maintaining a balanced water level
is essential to avoid dehydration

00:01:37.848 --> 00:01:39.710
or over-hydration,

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.279
both of which can have devastating
effects on overall health.

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:45.404
At first detection of low water levels,

00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:48.367
sensory receptors 
in the brain's hypothalamus

00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:51.399
signal the release 
of antidiuretic hormone.

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.489
When it reached the kidneys, 
it creates aquaporins,

00:01:54.489 --> 00:02:00.445
special channels that enable blood
to absorb and retain more water,

00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:03.050
leading to concentrated, dark urine.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.555
Increased dehydration can cause
notable drops in energy,

00:02:06.555 --> 00:02:07.586
mood,

00:02:07.586 --> 00:02:08.774
skin moisture,

00:02:08.774 --> 00:02:10.198
and blood pressure,

00:02:10.198 --> 00:02:13.252
as well as signs of cognitive impairment.

00:02:13.252 --> 00:02:17.210
A dehydrated brain works harder 
to accomplish the same amount

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.696
as a normal brain,

00:02:18.696 --> 00:02:22.618
and it even temporarily shrinks
because of its lack of water.

00:02:22.618 --> 00:02:25.614
Over-hydration, or hyponatremia,

00:02:25.614 --> 00:02:30.669
is usually caused by overconsumption
of water in a short amount of time.

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:33.242
Athletes are often the victims 
of over-hydration

00:02:33.242 --> 00:02:36.585
because of complications 
in regulating water levels

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:39.263
in extreme physical conditions.

00:02:39.263 --> 00:02:43.769
Whereas the dehydrated brain amps
up the production of antidiuretic hormone,

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.174
the over-hydrated brain slows,
or even stops, releasing it into the blood.

00:02:49.174 --> 00:02:51.980
Sodium electrolytes in the body
become diluted,

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.133
causing cells to swell.

00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:55.584
In severe cases,

00:02:55.584 --> 00:02:59.768
the kidneys can't keep up with 
the resulting volumes of dilute urine.

00:02:59.768 --> 00:03:01.923
Water intoxication then occurs,

00:03:01.923 --> 00:03:03.559
possibly causing headache,

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:04.688
vomiting,

00:03:04.688 --> 00:03:08.162
and, in rare instances, seizures
or death.

00:03:08.162 --> 00:03:10.295
But that's a pretty extreme situation.

00:03:10.295 --> 00:03:12.062
On a normal, day-to-day basis,

00:03:12.062 --> 00:03:15.632
maintaining a well-hydrated system
is easy to manage

00:03:15.632 --> 00:03:19.528
for those of us fortunate enough 
to have access to clean drinking water.

00:03:19.528 --> 00:03:23.808
For a long time, conventional wisdom said
that we should drink eight glasses a day.

00:03:23.808 --> 00:03:26.453
That estimate has since been fine-tuned.

00:03:26.453 --> 00:03:30.245
Now, the consensus is that the amount
of water we need to imbibe

00:03:30.245 --> 00:03:33.116
depends largely on our weight
and environment.

00:03:33.116 --> 00:03:39.616
The recommended daily intake varies from
between 2.5-3.7 liters of water for men,

00:03:39.616 --> 00:03:42.802
and about 2-2.7 liters for women,

00:03:42.802 --> 00:03:46.148
a range that is pushed up 
or down if we are healthy,

00:03:46.148 --> 00:03:46.987
active,

00:03:46.987 --> 00:03:47.950
old,

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.663
or overheating.

00:03:49.663 --> 00:03:51.522
While water is the healthiest hydrator,

00:03:51.522 --> 00:03:52.617
other beverages,

00:03:52.617 --> 00:03:55.230
even those with caffeine 
like coffee or tea,

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.323
replenish fluids as well.

00:03:57.323 --> 00:04:02.306
And water within food makes up 
about a fifth of our daily H20 intake.

00:04:02.306 --> 00:04:04.333
Fruits and vegetables like strawberries,

00:04:04.333 --> 00:04:05.302
cucumbers,

00:04:05.302 --> 00:04:08.874
and even broccoli are over 90% water,

00:04:08.874 --> 00:04:14.119
and can supplement liquid intake while
providing valuable nutrients and fiber.

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:17.276
Drinking well might also have various
long-term benefits.

00:04:17.276 --> 00:04:21.618
Studies have shown that optimal hydration
can lower the chance of stroke,

00:04:21.618 --> 00:04:23.107
help manage diabetes,

00:04:23.107 --> 00:04:27.871
and potentially reduce the risk
of certain types of cancer.

00:04:27.871 --> 00:04:32.051
No matter what, getting the right amount
of liquid makes a world of difference

00:04:32.051 --> 00:04:33.338
in how you'll feel,

00:04:33.338 --> 00:04:34.205
think,

00:04:34.205 --> 00:04:36.073
and function day to day.
