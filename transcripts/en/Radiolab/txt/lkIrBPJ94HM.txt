Speaker 1:          00:01          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab, the podcast. And this, I actually brought a list. Okay, let, what? Let's, why don't you share with me your list? Where is this thing? This is Andrew [inaudible]. He's a writer and editor at The New Yorker magazine. Oh, I might've gotten lost. Occasionally pops onto our show. Maybe you were mugged. Maybe a here it is. And he recently got obsessed with a m it's a list of measurements. Base units. They're called theirs, their SEI base units. The system international, you know, so let me do it this way. Um, have you ever wondered how long an inch is dumb? Exactly. How long it's stuff. I know I just look at a ruler. Well, but how do you know that your ruler and my ruler, do I have the same amount of inch base or that someone in China, they're inches are inches, your inches, my edge.

Speaker 1:          00:50          And really thought about it, but I w I'm just assumed that there's like a master inch somewhere be on too. I say it in French for reason and which will feel it in a moment. That is what was on this list that Andrew was looking at. It's a list of standard measures for everything we have around how big something is, how far something is, how hot something is. It's all on this list. Okay. So when you go down the list of the systemic Internacional d units, here's what you get. A meter. A meter is a fraction of a second of the distance traveled by light in a vacuum. Okay. A second is how much radiation corresponds to the transition between two hyperfine levels of the ground. State of the cesium one 33 atom. That's the definition of a second. How many times does that particular Adam Juggle? Yeah. Wow. Uh, an ampere which measures electric current. You know, amp is a constant current, which if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length would produce between these conductors. A force equal to two times 10 to the negative seventh newtons per meter of length. I have no idea what that it's g, that's the thing. If you look at the actual definitions, any of these things am meter second, whatever you go. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:01          there is one standard on the list that is unique for its simplicity. The definition of the standard unit of measurement that is a kilogram is no man, no numbers. It is a thing, a particular thing, a plum sized thing.

Speaker 1:          02:23          It is the only thing we use to measure things. It's the last one standing. The only physical standard laugh. Why is it the last and why there is it what, wait what? Let me just take you back to the beginning of the story. Like I must admit that I expected this story to be a lot more boring than I found. It's like an epic story. It's really, that is Latif Nasser Science's story in regular on our show and he says if you go all the way back to the very first farmers back in Mesopotamia, all of the earliest measurements were super intuitive and he says a lot of them came. The body as

Speaker 3:          03:00          in that bunny is coming close to the net. How close dad?

Speaker 4:          03:04          Two hands. But it's not just like, well cause we think of like hands and feet, but it was also, there are so many other kinds of measurements like you would say, oh, something is as far as you know, my voice can carry or that something is as far as I can see sitting on the top of a camel or something is as far as I can throw a stone.

Speaker 3:          03:28          So that would mean like say, okay, I'm going to build a farm here and I'm going to do it three throw rocks across.

Speaker 4:          03:35          Yeah. Yeah. The way I read about it was like travelers, like if you're a Saharan traveler, you know, and you're, you need to know where the next watering hole is. That's kind of a life and death, uh, measurement. They would say it's, you know, three throw rocks away or it's 10 throw rocks away.

Speaker 3:          03:51          But, but you know that there might be some built in uncertainty there because if you ask Achilles, yeah, it could be to throw rocks away, but he asked me, it would be like 78

Speaker 4:          04:01          you have nailed exactly the problem with the throw a rock a system.

Speaker 3:          04:05          And these problems kind of came up

Speaker 5:          04:06          do ahead in the 17 hundreds, it's the eve of the, of the French revolution in a little town called Paris. It's a pretty cosmopolitan place, which means that people are coming from different places and they all have their own measures, approximately 250,000 different units of measurement in regular use, 150,000. Every commodity has its own measures. So you have grain, wine, oil, salt, Hay for wood, fabric, ev, everything. And it's extraordinarily confusing.

Speaker 3:          04:35          Not to mention it's extraordinarily bad for trade. So if I came to you and I say, Miss Your, I have video of cloth, you would say, how much cloth do you got? And I'd say, I have two. Yeah. And you say, what's the yard? I said, [inaudible] these match America. I said, no, no, he's this match. No, no. It's this match and this match. And then you can see the frustrating. It was frustrating and making matters worse.

Speaker 4:          05:01          1780s, there was a famine. So there was a shortage of grain and people were hungry and people were angry, which I am going to uh, call. Uh, they were hangry, they were hangry, they were very hangry to the bakers at the time. They knew that if they raised the price of bread, like an angry mob would basically come and kill them.

Speaker 3:          05:22          But they also knew that with no absolute standard, there was no way to be sure that what you were getting is what you were getting.

Speaker 4:          05:28          And so what they started doing was they started just lightening their bread loaves by just a little. So as the famine got worse, people would be waiting in longer and longer lines to pay the same amount of money for smaller and smaller loaves. So they were getting angrier and angrier. And so one of the things that people are like crying out for is that they want standardized weights and measures. If I go to the bakery and I buy a loaf of bread, I want a whole loaf of bread, right? Don't short me on this. This is serious. Well, you, you know what happens next?

Speaker 6:          06:05          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          06:05          best deal is stormed. And uh, the king is under house arrest and then [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          06:09          under the guillotine and as soon as the revolutionary government takes over, they said, all right, okay, this is one of our first priorities. We are going to make a new standard, but not based on something arbitrary like a king. This is the enlightenment. Why don't we draw on some kind of totally different authority, the authority of nature, of nature of nature.

Speaker 3:          06:35          So long story short, they took the circumference of the earth. They took a quarter of that circumference, divided that by 10 million, and they got the meter, the meter, they then divided by 10 cube. Dick filled the cube with water, took the mass of the water, minted the cylinder of metal with that mass. And Voila,

Speaker 5:          06:50          they created the world's first kilogram. The idea of this was if we make this thing that is so beautiful and perfect and everybody can see it that way, then not only will France use it, but the whole world will use it. Then goods and ideas can be exchanged everywhere by all people and it will be a beautiful, glorious [inaudible]. Exactly. They wanted something that would be eternal and unchanging for everybody for all time.

Speaker 4:          07:24          So now I guess you want to see it? Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 3:          07:27          Okay, so it's in here. We ended up visiting the National Institute of Standards and technology in Maryland, and this is where we'll be going in, but we're going to go with this guy, Patrick Abbott physicist was our guide. They took us three stories down into the Babbitt rocks of the state of Maryland because they want things down here to be totally still. We've just gone through one double door and here comes another double

Speaker 6:          07:53          [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          07:53          Then we stepped into this vault of the room and narrowed was,

Speaker 3:          07:57          what we're looking at then is a glass jar with a little handle on top and then inside that is a another glass jar with a little handle on top and inside that is is the thing, the thing, it's kind of gorgeous, really. The shiniest little soon. Do you ever seen very small and it looks very clean, doesn't it too? Yeah. It's almost hard to tell where the like brushing doll glass jar stops because it's so reflective. That's might be crazy question, but can we hold a kilogram? That's our producer Lynn Levy. No, I'm just curious to know what it feels like. We've been talking about it so much. They are very careful with the kilogram and this isn't even really the real one. The original of the original, of the original, of the original

Speaker 4:          08:48          Gong cod as they call it, lives in a basement in France. You can't get anywhere near that one. I could. No, you couldn't. I get all Tom Cruise

Speaker 1:          08:55          on. Then trying. Here's how it works.

Speaker 3:          09:00          The international prototype is big Kahuna. That's the one you used to calibrate six identical platinum cylinders, what they call witnesses or Taiwan and French. Those witnesses are then used to calibrate another set of cylinders which are then used to calibrate the u s standards, which is what we saw and that one is used to calibrate all kinds of things. The weight of your lemons, the scale in your bathroom, green team, you lost 34 pounds. Every time somebody loses a pound on that TV show, biggest loser, 5.8 you can actually trace that like a bloodline if you will, or an unbroken chain back to the international prototype. Kilogram to a single object in a basement in France, the holy of holies. That is the kilogram.

Speaker 1:          09:44          Well, you're telling me that when something is weighed in the world, often it goes all the way back to this one hunk of metal, which was why the next part of the story is so, uh, disconcerting. What happened in 1989 is that according to Andrew, the folks who take care of the official kilograms, the big K, or they took it out of its jars, they put it in a steam bath, hit it with the steam, that rinses everything, wait for it to dry. Then they commence a ceremonial way, right? Well how do you waive the thing that is the standard of wait while you weigh it against the copies, like the u s copy for example. So they get one of those and they put it on one side of the scale and then they put the gun k on the other and the IP k the logo on because the one is light.

Speaker 3:          10:38          It's like it doesn't how many, how many, how much

Speaker 1:          10:41          she does it later. Is it then that sisters roughly the mass of a grain of sugar. Oh yeah. So I can't tickets measurable. Wait, how do they know that it was light and not that the other ones were heavier, right? Well they didn't. So they used the second sister copies, still light and the third sister copies still light in the fourth and fifth and sixth didn't comes. The man from Germany, light incomes. The man from Canada, light incomes, the man from Spain light, which led them to the troubling possibility that the international standard for weight was losing weight. Well, we think that we think the big guys, the problem as far as how it lost that weight, really no one knows. One possibility is it got cleaned too much and maybe some of it got scraped away. Although it's disputed whether cleaning it more would make it lose weight or gain weight.

Speaker 1:          11:29          The other theory is outgassing like maybe a little hydrogen is seeping out of the metal and then there was one thing I read that said foul play can not be ruled out. We'll see. I was thinking maybe the Taliban was clear as we may have a slightly trippy situation here. We've got a hunk of metal losing weight and yet because it is the standard, it still weighs exactly a kilogram, right? If the definition of a kilogram is the mass of the international prototype kilogram, whatever happens when you put that thing on the scale, that's a kilogram. You can't do that and then everything else in the world is wrong. No, you can't. That doesn't sit right. That's like something that like the North Korean government would do just be like no more cash like that. We can't just go around capriciously doing stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          12:12          Invisibilia is back for new season with all new stories. Oh, out of 22 arrival and yell, everyone get down. This is a robbery. We have stories about small personal battles. I didn't leave my house. I wanted somebody to see me really sorry about the past and stories about huge cultural issues. This is probably gonna get somebody killed. Just evil. You can hear Invisibilia in NPR one or wherever you get your podcasts. All right, so if the standard of weight is, as you're saying, losing weight, so how do you fix that? Well, I'm getting zero cell phone reception down here. That means we're really do. When we were down in that underground room in Maryland, we met a guy who had some thoughts about this. Oh, there he is. Okay. His name's John Pratt. I'm the leader of the fundamental electrical measurements group at the National Institute of Standards and technology.

Speaker 1:          13:08          John walked us through even more high security doors and then we walked into this, oh my God, amazing room. It's big. It is big up three stories tall and it's made of, it's like a silver room. It has a silver gray floor. It has silver shiny walls and you're hearing is on the silvery side very much so. You probably wouldn't be allowed any if you're a red head [inaudible] no, I don't even know how to describe it. It looks like a wheel turned on its side with the thing itself looked sort of just like a, like a massive round metal cauldron or like big metal pot. But then there are all these weird little gizmos and parts and then all these coiled up wires and just ate stunning machine. But it's all just for the benefit of the one. The one measure one kilogram because inside that giant [inaudible] and there is an extremely extremely sensitive balance and equal arm balance, which is basically like a seesaw or a teeter totter.

Speaker 1:          14:12          And usually you would set that up so that you would literally put kid on one side of the teeter totter kid on the other side of the teeter totter. Now you've been in a playground so you know how this goes, but what they've done here is on one side of the teeter totter, they'd got the kilogram, like the ground guy. That's kid number one on the other side. That of another kilogram or kid too. We'll have a highly variable magnet. Now here's the thing, the magnet won't be touching that side of the scale. It will be exerting a force at invisible force on that side. It'll produce a force and we could use that to hold the balance still and the force it takes to hold up the balance. That of course is the same as the weight of [inaudible] car sitting on the other side. And if you can convert that force into a number that everybody agrees to, Walleye, you have just redefined the kilogram, you have wrenched it from the world of things and it's become attached to the fundamental forces of the universe. Yep. [inaudible] grasp the gist of it.

Speaker 7:          15:11          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          15:12          do you want to see that happen right now? I can show you this with our lego version of the watt balance. Okay. If I can fire it up. Lego Lego one. We'll see the, the, the, the big one was being tested or something. So they took us over to look at the little button. Okay. So we have have a little scale and everything you can see. I just disturbed the balance and it's, you know, chilling around oil. It's free floating. Hey, so you're now going with your tweezers and you're plucking ITI. Bitty. Yup. Two gram mass puts this tiny little thimble thing on the mountain. Now it's going to, he says levitate. No, it's easy. It prompts me mass on Mass on, Huh? Yeah. I'm going to put the mass on. He pushes a button. Right and okay, but when do we see the levitation? That was it.

Speaker 1:          16:02          I didn't, I missed it. Do it again. Floating. It was floating. It is floating. Sitting on the balance. Okay, and it's not floating that is floating. Does it fall to earth? That's a different idea of levitation. No. The truth is that once I finally figured out what this guy was doing, it was actually sort of cool. He had taken a little metal way. He put it on one side of the scale. Then on the other side of the scale, it was just empty, but yet the thing didn't tip over because the MD side actually had a magnetic force equivalent to the metal holding it just perfectly still. Right. So if they're able to do that, does that mean that the ground k's rain is, is done now yet? No, because first of all we the, you have to get straight with a lot of mat.

Speaker 1:          16:45          Mc squared equals h new work backwards. You gotta divide by e and then by amateur the B field. Whoo. Let's go. I think you get your m peers and your watts and your Planck's constant. Lots of little bore model of Adams and stuff. Anyway, it is actually way more complicated. This whole thing than I frankly will live or understand. But here's where we are at. You got all these different teams around the world. You've got John's team in Maryland with his seesaw. You got another lab, actually a couple of them that have their seesaws. You've got a third lab. It's literally counting the atoms. They're all doing experiments, comparing numbers, trying to get the numbers to agree. So that by whatever route everybody agrees on exactly what a kilogram is right now, they're close there. They're in agreement out to about six decimal places and that's not good enough.

Speaker 1:          17:31          They want the numbers to be at the eight decimal places. But if they can do that and only then will the grand k be no more. Yeah. Because instead of defining the kilogram as whatever is equal to the ground k now you have a new, the new definition of the kilogram, the kilogram is the siu unit of mass. It's magnitude is set by fixing the numerical value of the Planck constant to be equal to exactly 6.626069 and we have x's because we haven't all agreed what the final, okay. Those, the missing decimals are the limb missing decimal places times 10 to minus 34 when it's expressed in the unit for actions. Jewel seconds, which is um, a meter squared kilogram per second. Cool. That'll be such a simpler definition. Oh yeah. No. You've, what will happen to the grand k when the new definition goes into effect? Well that, so this is the sad part was that [inaudible] it's like a church you each will receive to the church. We have the footballs, the ground K me eventually end up in a place like this. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          18:43          we're so many standards have gone to die. This is the music. These are, they met in Paris. So this is the beginning show 85 so was our tour guide. Yeah. What is this a lead [inaudible] you showed us the original liter [inaudible] some early thermometers. Yeah. And the VJ, but that's [inaudible] room. He showed us your original, I think it was the provision meters when Paris, this was the infallible, the absolute standards from 1801 I think it's in a wooden box with a velvet packing and it's got silk ribbons at either end and it's just a very beautiful looking silver rod. Oh till imagine like the, the thing, the grand thing being in this place. So you like seeing the pope and shorts with something makes me so uncomfortable.

Speaker 6:          19:50          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          19:50          special thanks to Eric Rominger and also to take when we don't want to forget. Richard Davis.

Speaker 6:          19:59          Ken Older Bob Waters. Michael. Michael Newman and fine.

Speaker 1:          20:04          Thank you to our math angels soprano. Very weird to sing my own name. Also, big props to reporter Andrew Moran, so lots of Nasr and our producer. Then leaving and uh Oh, oh, uh, also, uh, you should go to radiolab.org not only to support the show by clicking the support button, but also to check out a collaboration video that we did with Henry Rice from minute physics. You can see it@radiolab.org or also youtube.com/minute physics, yet another meditation on what things are unthinkable. Oh, all about. I'm Jad Abumrad I am Robert Krulwich. Thanks for listening.
