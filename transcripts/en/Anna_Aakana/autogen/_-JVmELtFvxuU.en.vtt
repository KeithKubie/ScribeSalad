00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:19.400
 [Dripping tap, buzzing sound] 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.200
 When I was pregnant, I was small, my economic situation was difficult, and I was dating this man who would call him Dick. 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.700
 {The sound of pat on her thigh} 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.460
 I met with you when I was working on a TV show 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.480
 I remember entering the studio when I felt awe 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.569
 I watched actors and actresses take their places before shooting began 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.880
 I had left the community college classes that absorbed my soul back and went to a real photography site 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.880
 Hi hello. I'm here for the background. I apologize if you're late 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.960
 D: Everything's fine I'm a dick 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.120
 A: Hi Anna "Anna" 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.120
 romantic music 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.780
 A: I was honored to meet you 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.480
 D: If I just wait here a few, your turn will come soon 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.620
 A: Well 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.500
 Exciting music 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.040
 D: I'm on my way 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.040
 Good Morning A: With safety 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.460
 D: Oh wait a little 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.240
 D: I've done a great job today. Thanks 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.820
 D: Do you want to work on this offer again? 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.720
 I love working in the background 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.109
 I bought my groceries from the 99 fils store 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.809
 I wanted all the jobs and all the free hot meals I could get 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.400
 You have a digital application to book me work directly, and every week call me to show me a job 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.200
 I loved it, and one day when I was getting ready to go out 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.200
 [Sparks voice] 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.449
 I did not know that this was on the table. If he flirts with me 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.080
 It did not take long before you sent intensive messages to you 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.080
 [Send Message] 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.700
 I imagined his body under his loose clothes. 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.740
 Then I discovered D: My brother died 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.840
 A: I'm sorry since I lost my sister as well 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.549
 Immediately a novel was invented by Rammansia 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.525
 A: Two survivors, we are destined to be together, 

00:02:13.525 --> 00:02:15.139
 D: We can help each other heal 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.900
 A: In my imagination, we had a deep connection 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.760
 No one else can understand 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.530
 A: We had a common grief 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.760
 the death 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.189
 You are crazy people, you bother too much 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:36.940
 [Sounds off the screen] 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.940
 Finally, surrendered 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.060
 During a dinner, I knew he loved meditation and loved the outdoors 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.600
 He believes in pluralism 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.340
 I asked him to explain 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.160
 D: Unilateralism is an outdated concept that no one can support 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:59.300
 I'm like most idiots I thought he just did not meet the right person yet 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.500
 I and Dick met us for a year and a half and every three months, he betrayed me 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.510
 Knock on the door 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.139
 Every three months, he confesses his betrayal and apologizes 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.290
 He was saying that his behavior was due to the suicide of his brother, and that this incident left him a damaged makkuro 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.250
 I thought to myself that I could see what he was going through 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.730
 I discovered the passcode for his phone, and I waited until he drowned in sleep, and read his messages 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.350
 He was angry because I had violated his privacy, and the cycle was over 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.760
 Despite these very clear red signals, we stayed together, 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.730
 During this period 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.740
 get pregnant 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.540
 I was not committed to taking birth control pills 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.160
 I used to do four jobs, attend comedy sessions, acting classes, and shoot weekly videos 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.100
 I used to go to sleep late at night and wake up early, often forgetting to take the pill 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.749
 I will not bear, I have lost my sister, but surely the Creator will give me a break 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.119
 One morning, Helmtay's feeling was strange 

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:14.119
 [Shower running] 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.290
 I knew immediately 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.290
 Music 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.224
 Smiley face? Smiley face. Smiley face stupid. 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.000
 D: What is this? 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.850
 D: This is not a good time for me to have a baby and you should be great 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.850
 You do not want to have a child, you have to be much bigger 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.360
 Look. He answers that you raise this child with another man 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.480
 A: He seriously told me that I should meet her baby with another man 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.440
 D: You have to abort this child 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.080
 A: At least answer that we have a conversation about it 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.360
 D: Any conversation? 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.260
 I will not abort this child, at least answer that we talk about ... 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.100
 [Sudden silence, then sad music] 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.809
 I spent years secretly secretly judging my friends who aborted 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.520
 How can they destroy such a life? 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.720
 I thought they were human beings 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.340
 But of course, when this happens to you, check yourself 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.320
 Am I ready to correct either? No 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.340
 Are you ready to become a father? No 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.380
 Do I have the economic ability to support a child 

00:05:53.385 --> 00:05:56.619
 No, I hardly have the ability to feed 3 cats 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.600
 Eventually she reached the same conclusion as Dick 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.400
 They told me that I was only seven days pregnant. 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.220
 The doctor was very impressed when I told him the story of the nipples. 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.780
 Doc: I'm very impressed with the story of nipples 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:18.840
 A: Thanks 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.700
 Doctor: Oops 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.940
 Abortion pills were given. 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.539
 Unless the doctor tells me about the pill, Houghthian. 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.700
 Well, Um, I'm pregnant. 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.400
 I'll admit that I like people to think I'm pregnant. 

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:59.600
 He made me want to walk around with my big belly and the way people would treat me 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.549
 Each tube will open to me 

00:07:02.549 --> 00:07:05.358
 Maybe people will offer me something to eat 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.220
 I imagined I was nine months pregnant with my child 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.560
 I wanted only one thing to make it easier for me to do this 

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.960
 Someone who truly loves me 

00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:25.698
 I knew then that I wanted to be a mother, but this was not the right time 

00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:28.199
 If you bring a child in the world, 

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:32.209
 I want to be able to give it both my love and attention. 

00:07:32.209 --> 00:07:36.220
 I want to be in a relationship where the child is loved 

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.960
 [Running water] 

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.760
 I bleed, cried and screamed for three hours 

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:46.129
 I wondered if I was doing the right thing, if this was killed. 

00:07:46.769 --> 00:07:48.769
 If you are a bad person 

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.520
 I promised myself that I would not do this again 

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.820
 When I carry the next time I will be ready 

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.840
 [Anna sigh, the sound of the bell] 

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.560
 [Voice Message] 

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:27.120
 D: Darling, did you think how you would pay me half the amount of abortion? 

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:34.150
 I hope to say my relationship with you and your dick has ended there, but we have not 

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.030
 I still thought you had a spiritual companion. 

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:44.259
 He was the only person who could understand what you ordered him, and vice versa. 

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:50.980
 I liked his smell, the color of his eyes, took me to Buddhist meditation sessions 

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.210
 It was the reason I was swallowed up in a week of silence 

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:03.609
 I spent seven hard days sitting with myself, walking with myself, and living with myself. 

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:10.030
 On the last day of silence, we all had to walk around and say one word summarizing our experience. 

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.200
 Love 

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.200
 Full 

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.700
 exploration 

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.720
 Super-cali-fragilistic-expialidocious. 

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.700
 Laughter 

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:27.399
 I discovered 

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.980
 this is me 

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.340
 I am someone who makes others laugh. 

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:38.020
 I felt peace, I love myself without shame, or neurosis, or arrogance. 

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:43.380
 When I feel the most calm, a loving moment of life in my life, 

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:47.000
 Dick was entering his penis in someone else 

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:53.099
 When he appeared in my door crying and begging for forgiveness, 

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.220
 Finally I thought, Damn this man. 

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.840
 In the desert, I finally found some self-esteem. 

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.060
 I have not been pregnant since. 

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.060
