JP Rangaswami

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.370
JP: Yes I think China will actually help pull
us out of the economic crisis we're in, but

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.370
for reasons that may be different from what
is perceived. Fundamentally, we need innovation

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:20.700
to get us out of this crisis. We can't use
the paradigm of the old or rules of the old

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.400
in order to be able to solve the problems
of the old. Innovation is key and I think

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.800
that the role that China plays because talent
knows no voters is going to be absolutely

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.480
critical. The place that innovation has to
take place is going to really involve the

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:45.120
sector I'm in, which is, you know, communications
and again I think, because of not just the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.969
talent for it but because of our ability to
understand and work with skill, China is going

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.190
to be absolutely critica. So the answer may
not be quite what you guys were expecting.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.159
I think China has a key role to play on it,
the role is associated with how talent innovates

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.100
and how communications plays a role or not.
