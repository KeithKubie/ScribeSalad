00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.400
[both] Whoa.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.200
[Grant] That was cool.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.700
Whats up guys!
Welcome back to the lab.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.140
I'm Grant Thompson, The King Of Random.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.100
And I'm Derick
from the YouTube channel, Veritasium.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.700
And today, we are playing
with fire and ice.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.020
I just got back from the gas station,
where I picked up this bag of ice.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.520
But this is no ordinary bag of ice. You see when we pour this ice into a bowl and light it off with a torch,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.500
you can see that the ice burns. Why is that?

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.240
So were gonna come clean guys. This bowl wasn't completely empty when we dumped in the ice. I first sprinkled a fine layer of

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.740
a chemical called calcium carbide, CaC2.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.640
Now this calcium carbide, I just went down to a chemical supply store and picked up for about 5 to 6 dollars

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.140
But this stuffs actually been used for centuries. Originally it was used in miners lamps.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.739
They would put it in add a little bit of water and it would pump out acetylene gas that they could light

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.139
And that's how they would light their way in the mines funny enough calcium carbide its main purpose today is to still produce

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.919
Acetylene gas and when you mix acetylene with oxygen it produces one of the hottest flames burning around 3,500 degrees Celsius

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.170
Which is ridiculous that is really hot its hardcore if we pour some of the actual calcium carbide out here

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.760
You can see what it looks like they almost look like little grayish black granules of Rock

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:13.439
Not super exciting until they make contact with water the instant this stuff touches water it starts releasing this misty white vapour which is

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.039
Extremely flammable and as we've just experienced as soon as it's lit

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.139
It's a very very hot flame and we could feel this from quite a distance yeah, yeah, we just lit ice on fire

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.890
That's really cool. Let's talk about that for a second. I actually have a little molecule kit

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.059
Let me should I bring it over here so the calcium carbide has two major components

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.049
Obviously your calcium and your C2 and their triple bonded these are

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.349
Carbons that are triple bonded you add in some water. What ends up happening is they break apart the calcium off

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.140
of there, and you form calcium

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:50.669
hydroxide which is CaOH2 like that and then the hydrogen's end up going on there and that creates your

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.459
Acetylene gas also known as ethyne

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.309
And this is a very flammable stuff that reacts with oxygen

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.739
And creates a very very hot flame that is an amazing reaction what I think is so cool about it, right?

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.619
Is that when you do it on ice you start it with just a little bit of water

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.769
So you just get this reaction starting get a little bit of acetylene

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.830
But then of course once the fire kicks in now more ice create more water that for the reaction producing more acetylene

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.320
And it's like a self feeding cycle exactly what I find is really interesting and I'm not sure what exactly is going on here

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.229
But look all the soot look at all this black residue right here

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.200
and we've got little chunks floating around in the air and

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.900
It what's really interesting is we just have this calcium carbide

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.439
and ice like nothing else went into it and now we're left with bubbles and uhh

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.940
What an interesting smell did you smell the gas coming off as well? Yeah, I did

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.300
Yeah, it's not quite the smell of rotten eggs

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.469
It smells a little bit different, but I would put it in the same family the same category. It's a little bit like um

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.960
Like gunpowder yes, what if it smells like that. Yeah, almost like a burned rotten egg smell yeah for sure but very very flammable

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.630
Who knows what that would do to your body something super I'm sure was basic, right?

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.729
So it would dissolve a lot of things it dissolves your flesh. Yes

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.770
Calcium Carbide is pretty cool

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.699
But one of the things that's made me wonder is where does it come from how is it made and as I did a little

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.190
Bit of research what I found is in an industrial process

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:19.480
They actually use an Arc furnace with carbon rods, and take coke and lime and burn it together at very high temperatures around 2,200 degrees

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.860
Celsius so you could probably do that with your backyard foundry, right?

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.510
Well, maybe not the backyard foundry

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.409
But I do have a mini Arc furnace ah which is basically the same thing on a smaller scale

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.219
So I wonder could we produce calcium carbide that might be an experiment for another day, so there you have a guys now

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.130
You know how to use a little bit of calcium carbide to make fire on ice.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.690
This is a very cool experiment very very messy very very dangerous but very very cool

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.640
Thanks so much for joining us for this experiment guys.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.360
Huge thanks to Derek with Veritasium for bringing out his models and is showing us the science behind why this works you can go check him?

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.820
Out I've got a link down in the description and we looking for you in the next video talk to you then!

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.239
Easier than animating 3D models. Yeah

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.410
So there you go guys now. You know how to use a little bit of calcium carbide mixed with ice

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.079
That's the vehicles coming back, Sorry. So there you have it guys -son of a b***h-

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.940
Hey guys, I want to jump back in for just a second to invite you to come follow me on Instagram.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.829

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.539
Just take five seconds right now to click the link in the description to come follow me on Instagram at the king of random

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.760
I'll see you there
