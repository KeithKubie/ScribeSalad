00:00:00.397 --> 00:00:02.195
-[Voiceover]Let's now
try to convert a number

00:00:02.195 --> 00:00:07.120
from the decimal system
to the hexadecimal system.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.290
Let's say we want to
convert the number 2,000.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.326
This is written in decimal form.

00:00:13.326 --> 00:00:15.291
Let's say we want to write
it in hexadecimal form.

00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:17.835
Like always, I encourage
you to pause this video

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:21.377
and try to work through it on your own.

00:00:21.377 --> 00:00:25.612
The key here is to break this down into

00:00:25.612 --> 00:00:28.303
multiples of powers of 16.

00:00:28.303 --> 00:00:30.518
Let's just write down
our powers of 16 here.

00:00:30.518 --> 00:00:32.781
16 to the zero power is one.

00:00:32.781 --> 00:00:34.962
16 to the first power is 16.

00:00:34.962 --> 00:00:39.168
16 squared is 256.

00:00:39.168 --> 00:00:43.264
16 to the third power is 4,096.

00:00:43.264 --> 00:00:45.305
We've gotten more than large enough.

00:00:45.305 --> 00:00:47.199
Let's start decomposing.

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.530
What's the largest power of 16 that is

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.119
less than or equal to 2,000?

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:56.430
It's going to be 256.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.246
How many times does 256 go into 2,000?

00:00:59.246 --> 00:01:02.379
I'll get a calculator out for that.

00:01:03.298 --> 00:01:08.298
2,000 divided by, I want
to figure out how many

00:01:09.565 --> 00:01:13.118
times 256 goes into it, divided by 256.

00:01:13.118 --> 00:01:16.330
It goes seven times, plus a little bit.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.911
What's going to be left over?

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:22.911
2,000 minus seven times 256 is equal to,

00:01:25.542 --> 00:01:27.498
you're going to have 208 left over.

00:01:27.498 --> 00:01:28.867
Let me write that.

00:01:28.867 --> 00:01:31.349
It's going to be seven times 256.

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:36.349
Seven, times 256, plus 208 left over.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.558
Now let's see if we can
decompose 208 into powers of 16.

00:01:44.558 --> 00:01:46.167
What's the largest power of 16 that is

00:01:46.167 --> 00:01:48.169
less than or equal to this?

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:49.750
Well it's just going to be 16.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.499
So how many 16s go into 208?

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:56.977
208, I'll just take that, divided by 16.

00:01:56.977 --> 00:01:59.131
13, exactly 13.

00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:00.496
We lucked out.

00:02:00.496 --> 00:02:03.062
So this is exactly 13 times 16.

00:02:03.062 --> 00:02:04.703
Let's just write that.

00:02:04.703 --> 00:02:09.703
This right over here
is exactly 13 times 16.

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:14.131
Now, we have broken this
down into powers of...

00:02:14.131 --> 00:02:17.515
We have broken this down into
multiples of powers of 16.

00:02:17.515 --> 00:02:19.799
Now we're ready to
write it in hexadecimal.

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.064
We just have to remind
ourselves about the place value.

00:02:23.064 --> 00:02:27.456
This right over here, this is
going to be the ones place.

00:02:27.456 --> 00:02:31.522
Then we're going to have the 16s place.

00:02:31.522 --> 00:02:36.522
Then we're going to have the 256s place.

00:02:39.612 --> 00:02:41.797
We know how many 256s we have.

00:02:41.797 --> 00:02:44.748
We have seven 256s.

00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:47.833
We have zero ones.

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:49.746
And how many 16s do we have?

00:02:49.746 --> 00:02:51.555
Well we have 13 16s.

00:02:51.555 --> 00:02:53.142
Well what's the digit for 13?

00:02:53.142 --> 00:02:57.321
We can just remind
ourselves that we obviously

00:02:57.321 --> 00:03:00.543
have zero through nine and then we have

00:03:00.543 --> 00:03:05.543
A is equal to 10, B is equal
to 11, C is equal to 12,

00:03:07.405 --> 00:03:11.479
D is equal to 13 and of
course E is equal to 14

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:14.033
and F is equal to 15.

00:03:14.033 --> 00:03:15.898
But we care about 13.

00:03:15.898 --> 00:03:18.593
We have 13 16s.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.528
So we put a D right over here.

00:03:22.528 --> 00:03:25.242
So the number "7D0" in hexadecimals...

00:03:25.242 --> 00:03:26.875
Let me write this down,
this is interesting.

00:03:26.875 --> 00:03:31.875
2,000 in decimal form
is equal to "7D0" when

00:03:36.396 --> 00:03:39.375
it is written in hexadecimal form.

00:03:39.375 --> 00:03:42.679
Hope you found that interesting.
