00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.760
Well, I sent the email for the
Cloud study jam last week on Friday.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.600
I was shocked that in less
than five minutes

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.640
we actually had about thirty
people signing up for it.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.960
Today, we're having a 
Google Cloud study jam. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.200
So we have students coming from all majors.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.400
We have Computer Science, 
Management Information Systems

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.880
Business Administration, Engineering.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.200
And the idea is 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.760
they have the interest to get to know
more about technology

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.240
but they don't know where to start. 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.880
So, as DSC, that's where
we come in.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.800
We're gonna do the first two labs.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.200
We're creating a virtual machine, and

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.720
using the G Cloud, and G Cloud Shell, so

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.240
it's pretty much exciting.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.360
So, your virtual machine was
like a house, right?

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.200
And the SSH is like a gate,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.520
like an entry point into the house
that you created.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.080
I'm the patron to the Developer Student Club

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.840
The issue is that Computer Science
classes provide some

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.000
level of theory introduction,
some level of practice.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.960
But then, we want to let the students
appreciate current technologies,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.560
state-of-the-art technologies by
introducing them through

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.320
Developer Student Club
workshops and seminars. 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.680
There are students from all majors.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.960
They really want to know more about
what they can actually do

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.160
to contribute to problem
solving in the society.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.720
I really love teaching people and
making them realize that

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.000
'Oh, I can actually do this.' 
That's one of the things that really

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.840
gives me the joy, 
when I see that in people.
