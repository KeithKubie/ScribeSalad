00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.870
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I want to thank everybody
for joining us today. We've got a very special

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.860
speaker here today, Dr. Robert Lustig. He
is gonna talk about sugar; kind of ironic

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.629
that I am the person introducing him since
I may be responsible for most of your sugar

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:17.580
consumption here on campus with my micro kitchens.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.449
But Dr. Lustig is gonna talk about sugar and
some of the dangers and things you need to

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.279
watch out with regarding that. He is a graduate
of MIT. He received his MD at Cornell, where

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.840
a lot of us are eggheads so I thought some
of us would appreciate that.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.300
He is currently the Professor of Pediatrics
at the University of California, San Francisco

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.410
and is now at the Benioff Children's Hospital.
He is also the director of the Weight Assessment

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.949
for Teen and Child Health, which is also known
as WATCH Program at UCSF.

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:57.460
He's published more than 85 research articles.
He's very well-known also for his recent YouTube

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.350
video. It's a 90-minute video on very, very
technical stuff regarding sugars and all those

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.500
things. And yet, he has received more than
1.5 million hits. Usually, those types of

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.250
numbers are reserved for cat videos of someone
getting hit below the belt.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.250
[laughter]

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.250
So, he is--

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.250
&gt;&gt;Robert Lustig: Lady Gaga

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.950
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah, Lady Gaga, too. So,
he has definitely got a loyal following and

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.360
I'm gonna turn it over to him and let talk
about this very, very important subject for

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.360
all of us.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.020
And we'll have some time at the end for Q
and A, so please jot down some notes and don't

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.070
be afraid to step up to the microphone when
he's all finished. Enjoy. Dr. Lustig.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.659
[applause]

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.060
&gt;&gt;Robert Lustig: Thank you very much Dino.
And thank you all for coming. And I apologize

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.939
for the monkey suit. It's Friday and everywhere
else in the world in the summer and on Friday

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.170
it's dress-down Friday, but not at UCSF.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.369
So I apologize. But that's the way it goes.
First of all, I'm supposed to show this slide

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:56.369
very specifically.

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.460
[laugher]

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:07.229
And everybody got their chance to see it.
OK, good. All right. So, I have no disclosures.

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:14.020
Let's start. Look to the left of you. Look
to the right of you. One of you is obese.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.020
[laughter]

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.900
&gt;&gt;Female audience member: Hey!

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.900
[laughter]

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.920
&gt;&gt;Robert Lustig: According to these data.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.920
[laughter]

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.790
Now, I'm looking around this room and I'm
telling you, this looks like a pretty healthy

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.630
crowd because after all, this is the Bay Area.
This is Google. I'm not all that worried about

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.630
you guys.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.540
But out there it's a different story. And
indeed, we see this all throughout San Francisco.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.270
We see this all throughout the country. This
is a huge problem that we've come up against.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.700
And the question is where did this come from?
Now, this is an eleven inch statue. Excuse

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.700
me.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:59.260
Just started to tickle. This is an eleven
inch statue called the Venus von Willendorf.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:06.750
It was unearthed in Vienna in 1908. It carbon-dates
back to 22 thousand BC. And what it shows

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:15.200
us is that the ancients knew about obesity
before they knew about McDonalds.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.090
Obesity is part of the human condition. Obesity
has been around for a long time, but clearly

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.250
something has gone on in the last 30 years
to have created this epidemic. And the question

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.340
is, what is it? And what do we do about it?

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.840
On the left is a Time magazine, a Newsweek
magazine article from eleven years ago and

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.010
it says here, "Six million kids are seriously
overweight." With all of the media attention,

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:52.310
with all of the efforts, with all of the programs,
with all of the White House working on this

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.460
problem, we are now up to 20 million.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:04.070
So, we have tripled that number in a decade.
The magazine article on the right you probably

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:10.570
have seen or heard about. It's a nine-page
article written about our work at UCSF in

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.940
terms of what's going on with sugar in particular.
And that's what we're gonna talk about mostly

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.690
today and I would refer you to it.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.950
You can find it very easily on the web, "Is
sugar toxic?"

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:29.840
Now, to try to explain obesity, first I have
to debunk what's going on in your head because

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.100
you believe you think you understand this.
And I'm telling you right now you don't.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.350
And I'm gonna try to un-debunk it for you
so that this will actually make sense for

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.900
you and will actually lead you, and hopefully
the rest of the country, in a different direction.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.500
The first law of thermodynamics is a law.
It's elegant. If I didn't believe in the first

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.720
law, you'd call me a whack job and you'd have
me out of here as fast as you could throw

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.720
me.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.760
I believe in the first law. But, as the Supreme
Court will tell you, all laws are open to

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.810
interpretation. There are two interpretations
to this law. Here's the first, the one you

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:15.400
learned, the one I learned many years ago.
If you eat it, you better burn it or you're

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:22.460
gonna store it. OK, now who here believes
that? Oh, come on, come on. You all do.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.460
[laughter]

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.390
Thank you. If you believe that then what you're
saying is obesity is a result of two behaviors--two

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.300
apparent behaviors. The calories in, gluttony.
The calories out, sloth.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:40.050
And indeed, when you go to the physician,
he tells you "Eat less. Exercise more." Basically

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.000
what he's telling you is you're a glutton
and a sloth.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
[laughter]

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.560
That's what it means. I don't do that. And
I'm gonna show you why. From that concept,

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.200
that these are two behaviors, the dogma that
surrounds this is that a calorie is a calorie.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.220
In other words, if you eat a calorie more
than you burn, you will gain weight.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.090
If you eat less calories than you burn, you
will lose weight. That's where, that's what

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.460
comes from that. And from that dogma comes
the following corollaries. That this is free

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.530
will. That you have a choice of what to put
in your mouth. You have a choice of whether

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:15.610
to exercise.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:21.410
That this is personal responsibility. You
get to decide, nd from that, gluttony and

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:26.041
sloth, and then for diet and exercise. Well,
guess what? It doesn't work. And I'm gonna

00:06:26.041 --> 00:06:31.230
show you that it doesn't work. So, are we
just in a caloric bacchanalia? Is that what

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.800
this is? Well, wait. This is wrong. Sorry.
That's much better.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.620
[laughter]

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.710
Indeed, we are all eating more. I'm not arguing
that. A hundred eighty-seven calories a day

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.680
more for men in the last 25 years. Three hundred
thirty-five calories a day more for women.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.080
Two hundred seventy-five calories a day for
teen boys.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.300
We're all eating more. There's no argument
about that. The question is, is that cause

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:57.651
or effect? That's not clear. So, here's the
evolution of fast food right here on the left.

00:06:57.651 --> 00:07:03.510
You have the original White Castle hamburger
at 210 calories. In the middle is Bob's Big

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.919
Boy at 618 calories.

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:10.230
And in the midst of the obesity epidemic,
Hardee's had the temerity to offer us the

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:15.580
Thickburger over there at 1420 calories. And
of course, we have Carl's Junior's six dollar

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.790
burger at 2000 calories. That's the entire
caloric allotment for the day.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.889
So you'd say, "Well, there you go. There's
your obesity epidemic right there." Not so

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:31.760
fast. How about this? Anybody had a Trenta?
I got one over here. OK?

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.810
[laughter]

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:43.110
One taker. OK, the Trenta has 916 cc's. Your
stomach can hold 900 cc's. It's bigger than

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:44.110
your stomach.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.150
[laughter]

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:50.310
OK? But people are buying them. So you say,
"There's your obesity epidemic right there."

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:54.530
And remember, that's not hot coffee. That's
not black coffee. That's flavored with,

00:07:54.530 --> 00:08:00.310
that's a Frappuccino drink. That's a cold
drink. And this I love. This came in the mail

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:07.810
to be about three months ago. Free chicken
sandwich with the purchase of a 32-ounce drink

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:12.169
at KFC. Has the food gotten so cheap that
we're actually giving it away now?

00:08:12.169 --> 00:08:18.389
I mean, so you'd say, "Don't these prove that
this really just about too much intake, too

00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:23.150
little exercise?" Let's look at the exercise
side. Do we have an activity famine? Is that

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:29.080
what this is? So, on the left we have MET
times, or a measure of physical activity.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.730
It's an accelerometer put on somebody's ankle.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:37.381
And on the right, I'm sorry. On the X-axis,
we have age from nine to nineteen and you

00:08:37.381 --> 00:08:40.930
can see for white girls and white and black
girls in the black circles. And but basically

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:46.070
by the time they hit age 15, the black girls
are laying prostrate on the floor, not moving

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:47.070
at all.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:52.680
So you'd say, "Well, there's your obesity
epidemic there. No exercise." So clearly,

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:57.560
we know that these things are true. The question
is, is that cause or effect? So, I'm here

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:03.190
to tell you, and you know this because this
is Google, that "education consists mainly

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:04.450
of what we have unlearned."

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:10.440
That's what research is. It's unlearning something
that you thought was right to find out something

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:17.810
that's new. OK? All of research is to debunk
dogma. What we believed ten years ago is already

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:21.480
wrong and what we believe today will be wrong
ten years from now.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:27.880
So, I need to unlearn you right now as to
what's going on in the obesity epidemic. And

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:33.520
I'm gonna try to do that. So, is this behavior?
Is this personal responsibility? I think not.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:40.520
There are six reasons to doubt this formulation.
First of all, no child chooses to be obese.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.610
The quality of life of an obese child is the
same as a child on cancer chemotherapy. They

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.761
are ostracized from their peers. No kid will
play with them. And it's actually gotten worse

00:09:48.761 --> 00:09:55.150
over the past 40 years as more kids have become
obese. The ostracization has actually gotten

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.150
worse.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:01.930
Now, maybe you know some adults who choose
to be obese, but no child does. They are miserable.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:08.500
My colleague Marcia Wertz did a semi-quantitative
analysis of kids coming through our clinic.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:15.890
And there is not one kid who, in even the
remotest sense, wants to be that way.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:21.240
Number two. Does diet work? Well, you say,
"Well sure. Look right there. Immediately

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:26.870
after you start the diet, everybody loses
weight." But look what happens after. Everything

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:32.080
goes back to normal. In fact, higher. And
if you look at the right graph, the maintenance

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.440
of weight loss basically no one can do it.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.850
And we all know that. How many yo-yo dieters
are there out there? Any yo-yo dieters in

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:45.360
the room? It's Google. I guess not.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.360
[laughter]

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.580
How about exercise? Does exercise work? If
you're burning more calories you should lose

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:55.640
weight, except for one thing. You don't. In
fact, there's not one research study that

00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:01.339
shows that exercise causes weight loss. If
anything, it causes weight gain because it

00:11:01.339 --> 00:11:02.899
builds muscle, which is good.

00:11:02.899 --> 00:11:08.310
That's a good thing. It builds bone. That's
good. When you stand on the scale, it registers

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:13.040
as weight gain, but you're healthier because
your waist line has gone down and that's what's

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:17.540
important. But if you tell somebody, "Oh,
you'll lose weight if you exercise."

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.930
And then they don't, what do you think is
gonna happen? They're gonna get depressed

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:26.661
and stop doing it. And that's what we've got
when we say it's diet and exercise. If you

00:11:26.661 --> 00:11:30.830
look here, when compared with no treatment,
exercise resulted in small weight loss across

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:31.830
studies.

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:38.710
One kilo. For rigorous exercise, one point
five kilos. That ain't gonna do it. Number

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:42.921
three. This isn't just about America. You
wanna call us a bunch of gluttons and sloths

00:11:42.921 --> 00:11:47.731
here in America? Fine. How about the UK, Australia?
OK, they're a bunch of gluttons and sloths,

00:11:47.731 --> 00:11:49.180
too, but except for one thing.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:53.240
It's going on everywhere. Whoever called the
Japanese sloths? You know what? They're doing

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:58.250
bariatric surgery at Tokyo Children's now.
It's going on in Japan. It's going on in Korea.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:02.750
It's going on in India, Thailand. I mean,
there are more obese people in the world now

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:06.300
than malnourished people by 30%.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:13.680
In one decade, we have gone from malnourished
to obese. And the United Nations has now declared

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:18.420
it a non-communicable disease. That is, diabetes,
cancer, and heart disease as a now bigger

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:25.060
threat to world health than infectious diseases.
So, this is a huge problem and the UN and

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:29.580
the World Health Organization knows it, so
you should know it, too.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:35.330
Number four. The poor are disproportionately
affected. They don't get to choose what they

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:40.350
eat. They don't even have a supermarket. They
have what they call "food deserts." They have

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:46.060
convenience stores; all processed food, all
high sugar, low fiber food, which we'll talk

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.459
about in a little bit.

00:12:47.459 --> 00:12:51.810
They don't get to choose what they eat. They
can't afford otherwise. Michael Pollan said

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:56.279
it very well. "If you have a dollar for food,
are you gonna choose 1200 calories in potato

00:12:56.279 --> 00:13:01.620
chips or 200 calories in carrots?" Is that
really a choice if you have a dollar to spend

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:02.620
on food?

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:08.240
So, if you don't have a choice how can you
call it personal responsibility? Number five.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:14.930
The prevalence of obesity is going up fastest
in the group that can't accept personal responsibility,

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:21.490
the two to five-year old, the toddler age
group. As was shown on the slide in the green.

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:28.120
And finally, the kicker, the Big Kahuna, he
slam dunk, the in yo face. We have an epidemic

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:35.730
of obese six-month olds. They don't diet and
exercise. So, any hypothesis you want to proffer

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:40.490
to me about what's causing the obesity epidemic,
you have to explain this.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:46.200
And you can't. And the reason is because a
calorie is not a calorie. Gluttony and sloth,

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:53.290
diet and exercise, personal responsibility,
free will, are all just garbage. OK? Have

00:13:53.290 --> 00:14:00.030
I got your attention? Good. Now let's go and
find out what the real problem is. So, you

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.209
wanna call this "behavior."

00:14:02.209 --> 00:14:05.810
So here's the definition of behavior. This
is the actual technical definition of behavior:

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:11.149
a stereotyped motor response to a physiological
stimulus. So, let's take that apart, stereotype,

00:14:11.149 --> 00:14:15.490
same every time. So, eating is a behavior.
Motor. Muscles have to move. A thought is

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:16.490
not a behavior.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:21.680
And finally, physiological. That's what I'm
interested in. The point is that all behaviors

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:27.440
have a biochemical basis. We may not be smart
enough to know what that biochemistry is yet,

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:32.350
but everything that goes on in your brain,
is a phosphorylation of a protein, or the

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.330
secretion of something, some neurotransmitter.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:44.820
Bottom line, how easy is it to control a biochemical
drive? What we call behavior is the cognitive

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:49.860
inhibition on a biochemical drive. And that
biochemical drive is going on 24/7. How long

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:54.709
do you think you can keep that up? That's
the recidivism of obesity right there. It

00:14:54.709 --> 00:14:55.709
can't be done.

00:14:55.709 --> 00:15:00.130
So, what I'm interested in is what are the
biochemical underpinnings of gluttony and

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:06.880
sloth and what can we do try to mitigate that
difference in order to solve the obesity epidemic?

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.290
It's very different from diet and exercise.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:15.300
Now, Kelly Brownell, who is the head of the
Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:20.960
Yale University, wrote this book called "Food
Fight" back in 2004. And in it, he coined

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.730
the term the "toxic environment." And you've
heard that term before. And what he was referring

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.149
to was modern eating and exercise conditions.

00:15:27.149 --> 00:15:32.420
So let's look at those. So, food available
24 hours a day. No argument there. Accessible

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.710
as never before right there, the micro kitchen.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:35.710
[laughter]

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:43.180
Sold in places--. Hey, I think it's a great
idea. Sold in places unrelated to eating.

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:48.980
Whoever heard of having dinner at a gas station?
Yeah? Really cheap, right? They're giving

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.500
it away at KFC.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:57.260
Promoted very heavily. They're giving it away
at KFC. And designed to taste really good

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.570
indeed, to keep people eating. We'll talk
about that at the end. On the activity side,

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:06.080
decreased walking and biking. OK? There are
some neighborhoods that don't even have sidewalks

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.490
anymore, right?

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:13.209
Little PE. Eighty percent of the San Francisco
unified fifth graders can't pass the Phys

00:16:13.209 --> 00:16:20.390
Ed exam. Screen time makes kids inactive.
OK? Actually, you guys are responsible for

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.100
some of that.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.490
[laughter]

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:26.870
And this you're not responsible for: parents
are reluctant to let their kids out of the

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:31.910
house for fear of crime. Which is a very sad
commentary on our society when you can't let

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:36.281
your kid play in their front yard because
they might get picked up and indeed, you've

00:16:36.281 --> 00:16:39.279
all heard the stories of how that's happened.

00:16:39.279 --> 00:16:44.230
So, the toxic environment as Brownell defines
it is a euphemism for these altered behaviors

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:51.430
that we have manifested over this last 25-year
period. True. I'm much more interested in

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:58.240
real toxins, poisons. Is there something insidious
and poisonous going on that's actually changing

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:02.420
our biochemistry and driving the obesity epidemic?

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:07.429
That's my question. And that's what I'm gonna
try to show you today. So, let's talk about

00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:13.339
what we're eating. OK, yeah. We're all eating
more. Agreed. What is it? So, 275 calories

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:21.789
a day extra in teen boys. What are they? Are
they fat? Nope. Five grams, forty-five calories.

00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:26.669
Nah. Nothing. And if you look at the secular
trends in specific food intake, as you see

00:17:26.669 --> 00:17:33.049
here, here are the fats. Whole milk, way down.
Meats and cheese up a little bit there. Dairy

00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:37.559
desserts up slightly. Bottom line, it's a
wash. And indeed, that's what the data shows.

00:17:37.559 --> 00:17:44.350
And, in fact, as we have reduced our percent,
not absolute amounts, but percent of fat consumption

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:50.120
from 40 percent to 30 percent over the last
30 years, and everybody remember why we did

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.519
that? Everybody know?

00:17:51.519 --> 00:17:52.519
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Heart problems.

00:17:52.519 --> 00:17:55.659
&gt;&gt;Robert Lustig: To prevent heart disease.
Right. To prevent cardiovascular disease.

00:17:55.659 --> 00:18:02.169
What's happened? It's gotten worse. Obesity
and metabolic syndrome have just taken off

00:18:02.169 --> 00:18:08.859
completely. OK? And now, that's 75%of all
of our health care expenditures.

00:18:08.859 --> 00:18:13.600
What do you think would happen to our health
care budget if we could fix that problem?

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:19.320
We wouldn't need health care reform if we
had obesity reform. So, this is really important.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:24.730
So it ain't the fat. What is it? Well, it's
the carbohydrates. Two hundred twenty-eight

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:26.720
grams to calories.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:32.529
OK? And what? I'm sorry. Here's the secular
trends. Look at the red circles. OK? That's

00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:40.429
all the carbohydrate. Everything way, way
up indeed. And what carbohydrate? Well, beverages.

00:18:40.429 --> 00:18:43.870
Forty-one percent increase in soft drinks.
Thirty-five percent increase in fruit drinks,

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:46.070
fruit aids, etc. OK?

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:51.879
For those of you who do obesity medicine,
a can of soda a day is 150 calories. Multiply

00:18:51.879 --> 00:18:56.980
that by 365 days a year. Divide that by the
magic number of 35 hundred calories in a pound.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:00.679
If you eat or drink 35 hundred calories more
than you burn, you will gain one pound of

00:19:00.679 --> 00:19:01.679
fat.

00:19:01.679 --> 00:19:04.679
That's the first law. No argument there. I
don't disagree with that. That's worth 15

00:19:04.679 --> 00:19:08.690
and a half pounds of fat per year. And our
kids aren't drinking one soda a day. They're

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:16.440
drinking how many? Four. So, I love this.
Here are the ten most obese states in the

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.440
country.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:22.220
And this probably is not a shock to anybody.
Here are the ten laziest states in the country.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.580
[laughter]

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:24.679
What's going on in Nevada?

00:19:24.679 --> 00:19:25.679
[laughter]

00:19:25.679 --> 00:19:30.630
You know, you can only get so much energy
loss out of doing this.

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.289
[laughter]

00:19:32.289 --> 00:19:38.779
I was just in Las Vegas last week to give
a talk and let me tell ya, it's true. It really

00:19:38.779 --> 00:19:47.950
is. Here's the adult diabetes rate. And finally,
here's soda per capita consumption. Notice

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:56.009
anything? That's interesting, but remember,
correlation is not causation. Cause or effect.

00:19:56.009 --> 00:20:01.700
We're not there yet. OK? Is it that obese
people drink soda? Or is it that soda causes

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:07.200
obesity and diabetes? That's the question.
We're not there yet. More to go. So, what

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:11.649
is this stuff? Well, you know about this.
It's high fructose corn syrup, right? Most

00:20:11.649 --> 00:20:14.359
demonized food additive known to man.

00:20:14.359 --> 00:20:19.570
Sixty-three pounds per person per year. We
never had this before 1975. It was invented

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:27.499
in Japan in 1966 and brought to the American
market in 1975. Originally, the soda industry

00:20:27.499 --> 00:20:32.010
didn't do very much with this for the first
five years. And then Hurricane Allen came

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:34.600
along and destroyed the Caribbean sugar crop.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:41.739
And they said, "You know? We better look into
this." And by 1985, the transition was complete.

00:20:41.739 --> 00:20:46.669
Everybody remember New Coke? That was high
fructose corn syrup. So, we revolted. We went

00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:52.200
back to Coke Classic, except for one thing.
What do you think you're drinking now?

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:58.840
So, what is this stuff? Well, on the left
is a molecule of glucose, six-membered ring.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:04.249
Now, glucose is not very sweet. You don't
see people going around chugging Karo syrup,

00:21:04.249 --> 00:21:09.559
do you? Might be good in a pecan pie, but
that's about it. OK? On the other hand, on

00:21:09.559 --> 00:21:11.429
the right, that's fructose.

00:21:11.429 --> 00:21:17.279
That's very sweet. That's what you're looking
for. That's what desserts are about. But if

00:21:17.279 --> 00:21:20.679
you look down at the bottom, that's sucrose.
That's table sugar, cane sugar, beet sugar,

00:21:20.679 --> 00:21:25.239
the stuff you put in your coffee in the morning,
the crystal stuff. And you'll notice, one

00:21:25.239 --> 00:21:28.139
six-membered ring, one five-membered ring.

00:21:28.139 --> 00:21:33.450
They're the same. It's a wash. And indeed,
all of the research studies that have compared

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:38.019
the two say they're the same. So everybody's
really excited about getting rid of high fructose

00:21:38.019 --> 00:21:44.700
corn syrup and substituting back sugar, like
throw-back Pepsi and things like that.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:50.140
This is just marketing. They're equal. They're
the same. They're equally bad and I'll show

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:56.239
you how. And remember, the rest of the world
doesn't have high fructose corn syrup. They

00:21:56.239 --> 00:22:03.009
have sugar. And here's world sugar consumption
in the upper left, going from 50 million tons

00:22:03.009 --> 00:22:06.940
per year in 1960, up to 150 million tons.
OK?

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:12.429
The population hasn't increased that fast.
So, you know we're eating more. And if you

00:22:12.429 --> 00:22:17.369
look at per capita consumption, look at Brazil.
Brazil, remember, is a sugar exporter. Brazil

00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:23.440
has the highest rate of increase of Type 2
diabetes. It doesn't have the highest rate

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:28.529
of Type 2 diabetes, but it has the highest
acceleration in their rate of any place in

00:22:28.529 --> 00:22:29.529
the world.

00:22:29.529 --> 00:22:34.619
And if you look at who has the most Type 2
diabetes, down on the bottom, you know where

00:22:34.619 --> 00:22:42.669
it is? Saudi Arabia and Malaysia. Now why
is that? Why do they have the highest rate

00:22:42.669 --> 00:22:52.169
of Type 2 diabetes? No alcohol. They're Muslim
countries. So what do you think they drink?

00:22:52.169 --> 00:22:53.789
Soft drinks like it's going out of style.

00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:54.789
[chuckles]

00:22:54.789 --> 00:23:03.510
"Cause it's hot there. OK? And they've got
diabetes like it's going out of style. So

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:10.409
here's our, in America, secular trend in fructose
consumption. Our ancestors a hundred years

00:23:10.409 --> 00:23:14.950
ago, pulling fruits and vegetables out of
the ground, got about 15 grams of fructose

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:16.710
per day.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:19.950
Prior to World War II with the nascent candy
and soft drink industries, we got up to about

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:25.140
20 grams per day. By 1977, just before the
advent of high fructose corn syrup, we were

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:31.519
up to 37 grams a day. That was 8% of our caloric
intake. By 1994, we were up to 55 grams a

00:23:31.519 --> 00:23:32.519
day.

00:23:32.519 --> 00:23:38.330
That's 10% of our caloric intake. And adolescents
currently mean 75 grams a day. That's 12%

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:44.450
of total caloric intake. And 25% of our adolescents
consume 100 grams of fructose a day. So, it's

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:47.690
four calories per gram. So that's 400 calories
in fructose.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:53.519
Multiply that by two for sugar, so that's
800 calories in sugar a day. That's 40% of

00:23:53.519 --> 00:23:59.710
their allotment in just sugar. So the question
is, what does that do to you? You think you

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:03.970
can handle that? As Jack Nicholson said, "You
can't handle the truth." OK.

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:08.950
Well, you can't handle that fructose load
is what you can't handle. So, where did this

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:15.399
come from? So, this is the perfect storm from
three political winds with a few extra things

00:24:15.399 --> 00:24:23.950
thrown on top. The first. Richard Nixon told
his Agriculture Secretary, Earl Rusty Butz,

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:29.889
love that name, that he wanted food off the
table as a political issue.

00:24:29.889 --> 00:24:36.282
That changing food prices caused political
unrest. Indeed, it does. And I'm gonna show

00:24:36.282 --> 00:24:42.340
you on this slide right here. This was in
Time Magazine just four months ago and it's

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:48.409
called "Hungry World." And what it is is color-coded
countries based on the percent of their gross

00:24:48.409 --> 00:24:50.520
national product that they spend on food.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:57.129
So you can see, we in yellow, and UK and Australia,
we're the three fattest countries because

00:24:57.129 --> 00:25:05.429
we spend the least of our percentage GNP on
food. Now, look at the purple countries. They're

00:25:05.429 --> 00:25:11.599
all in revolution. They spend more than 35%
of their GNP on food.

00:25:11.599 --> 00:25:17.629
When food prices go up, people get mad. Everybody
remember three years ago, we tried to take

00:25:17.629 --> 00:25:23.640
our corn crop and divert it to ethanol? You
know what that did? Raised the price of rice

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:28.529
in Thailand. And that caused the rice riots
and deposed the Prime Minister at the time

00:25:28.529 --> 00:25:29.529
in Thailand.

00:25:29.529 --> 00:25:33.249
Now, Thailand's got an unstable government
for a while, but that was the reason for that

00:25:33.249 --> 00:25:40.929
deposition. OK? So, we know that we're now
global society. So what we do affects food

00:25:40.929 --> 00:25:48.240
prices elsewhere. This is a big deal. Second
political storm. The advent of high fructose

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:53.559
corn syrup, as I said, invented in 1966 by
Takasaki at Saga Medical School in Japan and

00:25:53.559 --> 00:25:56.259
introduced to the American market in 1975.

00:25:56.259 --> 00:26:01.909
And here you can see what Nixon was talking
about. Look at the US producer price index

00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:09.539
on the left for sugar. Up down up down, prior
to 1975 then with the advent of corn sweeteners,

00:26:09.539 --> 00:26:14.999
nice stabilization at a 100% showing price
stability. That's what you want because what

00:26:14.999 --> 00:26:18.029
that says is you're not doing this up down.

00:26:18.029 --> 00:26:22.809
Look at what happened on the international
stage. The London price of sugar also stabilized,

00:26:22.809 --> 00:26:28.450
even though high fructose corn syrup was only
here. And of course, our cost of sugar is

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:33.350
way lower than England's. And look at the
US retail price of high fructose corn syrup

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:34.350
versus sugar.

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:39.580
It's half the price. So, it started appearing
in everything because now you could. There

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:44.999
were no two-liter bottles of soda before high
fructose corn syrup because it was too expensive.

00:26:44.999 --> 00:26:49.399
But now there is. Now you can buy it for what?
Ninety-nine cents, right? But what does it

00:26:49.399 --> 00:26:51.029
cost to make that bottle?

00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:56.559
About two cents. The price elasticity is enormous.
They're making money hand over fist and I'll

00:26:56.559 --> 00:27:03.090
show you that at the end. So, here's high
fructose corn syrup going up. And here is

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:08.869
sugar coming down. So, the Corn Refiners Association
says, "Well, you know it's just a substitution.

00:27:08.869 --> 00:27:15.279
We're substituting something that's cheaper
for societal benefit." But not really because

00:27:15.279 --> 00:27:21.320
if you look at the blue line at the top, 73
pounds per year up to 95 pounds per year.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:26.330
So there's a 25% increase in total added sweeteners
over this time. And there's something missing

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:27.330
from this slide.

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:34.070
Anybody know what it is? What's missing? Juice.
'Cause juice is sucrose, right? And we know

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:38.909
that juice causes obesity. This is a study
done by Myles Faith showing prospectively

00:27:38.909 --> 00:27:44.409
that juice servings per day increases BMI
z-score in inner city Harlem toddlers.

00:27:44.409 --> 00:27:50.710
And where do they get their juice? From something
called WIC. Anybody know what WIC is? W-I-C?

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:56.299
Women Infants Children. Government entitlement
program set up back in 1968 to prevent failure

00:27:56.299 --> 00:28:05.109
to thrive. Guess what? They did. And now we've
got 20 million overweight or obese kids.

00:28:05.109 --> 00:28:09.929
So now we've got juice plotted here with most
fructose items. Indeed, we are eating 141

00:28:09.929 --> 00:28:16.690
pounds of sugar a year. That's seven ounces
a day for every man, woman, and child in America.

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:24.440
And the question is, is that OK? Can you do
that? Can your liver handle it?

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:32.299
Finally, the last of the political whims.
Remember that admonition to reduce our dietary

00:28:32.299 --> 00:28:38.039
fat to prevent cardiovascular disease? So,
where did that come from? In the 1970s, early

00:28:38.039 --> 00:28:43.440
1970s, we learned about this thing called
LDL, low density lipoprotein. Is it good for

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.440
you or bad for you?

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:52.139
Ah, it's not as bad as you think, but yeah
I mean, it's not good. In the mid-1970s, we

00:28:52.139 --> 00:28:56.769
learned that dietary fat raised your LDL and
that's true. That's still true. So if dietary

00:28:56.769 --> 00:29:03.190
fat is A and LDL is B, we learned that A led
to B. In the late 1970s, we learned that LDL

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:09.399
levels in large populations correlated with
incidence of coronary heart disease.

00:29:09.399 --> 00:29:14.299
So, let's call coronary heart disease C. So
we learned that A led to B and B led to C,

00:29:14.299 --> 00:29:22.950
so the logic was, "Well, if A leads to B and
B leads to C, then no A, no C." Let's get

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:27.609
rid of the dietary fat and cardiovascular
disease will disappear. That was the idea.

00:29:27.609 --> 00:29:35.340
And McGovern, George McGovern, had a nutrition
panel back in 1977 which advocated this. And

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:41.710
I'll show you where that came from in just
a second. OK? Clearly did not work. Anybody

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:46.059
see any problem with the logic here? This
is Google. You must have some logicians here.

00:29:46.059 --> 00:29:47.460
Randy, what do you see?

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:48.889
&gt;&gt;Randy: Correlation is not causation.

00:29:48.889 --> 00:29:51.070
&gt;&gt;Robert Lustig: Right. Correlation is not
causation. That's one.

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:56.840
&gt;&gt;Randy: Something else could be going on
here, like, as you pointed out, sugar is going

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:57.840
up at the same time.

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:58.840
&gt;&gt;Robert Lustig: Right.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.210
&gt;&gt;Randy: Maybe this is just tracking a sugar
trend and has nothing to do with the dietary

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:03.210
fat.

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:07.009
&gt;&gt;Robert Lustig: Without question. OK? So,
A. But there's another reason. A can lead

00:30:07.009 --> 00:30:12.279
to B, but it can lead to D, E, F, G, H, and
I and never come back to C. And also, the

00:30:12.279 --> 00:30:17.730
contrapositive of a statement is not "no A,
no C," it's "no C, no A." So, it doesn't even

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:21.629
make sense in terms of the logic. OK?

00:30:21.629 --> 00:30:28.229
Now, here we have two books. The one on the
right, called "Pure, White and Deadly" about

00:30:28.229 --> 00:30:34.570
sugar, written by a British physiologist nutritionist
by the name of John Yudkin, written in 1972

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:41.239
and everything that this man prophesized in
1972 has come to pass. It's absolutely brilliant.

00:30:41.239 --> 00:30:51.309
And he was run out on a rail by the British
food industry. Very, very, very smart guy

00:30:51.309 --> 00:30:56.229
and had a really tough time in the last 20
years of his life, even though he was full

00:30:56.229 --> 00:31:02.409
professor at Oxford. On the left, we have
the book, "The Seven Countries Study," by

00:31:02.409 --> 00:31:04.169
a guy by the name of Ancel Keys.

00:31:04.169 --> 00:31:10.379
Anybody heard of him? OK. And Ancel Keys was
a Minnesota epidemiologist interested in cardiovascular

00:31:10.379 --> 00:31:18.429
disease. And he spent a sabbatical in 1952
in England and he saw what crap they ate over

00:31:18.429 --> 00:31:26.799
there and said, "Clearly, dietary fat is the
cause of cardiovascular disease."

00:31:26.799 --> 00:31:31.179
Here's the original case against fat. Here's
Ancel Keys' Seven Countries Study over here

00:31:31.179 --> 00:31:38.789
on the left. So, he has Japan, Italy, England
and Wales, Australia, Canada, and the US.

00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:42.999
That's only six countries as far as I can
tell. But anyway, maybe he thought England

00:31:42.999 --> 00:31:43.999
and Wales are two different countries.

00:31:43.999 --> 00:31:49.900
I don't know. But in fact, he actually studied
22. And the 22 are plotted over on the right.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:56.070
So the question is, why did he do that? I
don't know. No one really knows. But if you

00:31:56.070 --> 00:32:02.879
take a look, you can pick any series you want
from those data. OK? So, there's one series

00:32:02.879 --> 00:32:06.750
over there on the upper-left that'll tell
you, "Yeah, it makes sense. Coronary disease

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:09.029
against total fat consumption."

00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:13.820
How about the others? It says the opposite.
And the one below says, "Not at all." Bottom

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:19.880
line, we don’t' really know. In addition,
here are the outliers, by the way. These people

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:26.559
eat only fat. And they have no coronary disease.
In fact, the Aitkin’s Diet prevents coronary

00:32:26.559 --> 00:32:28.759
disease.

00:32:28.759 --> 00:32:34.809
And then finally, if you read Ancel Keys'
own work, the "Seven Countries Study," page

00:32:34.809 --> 00:32:39.091
262 where he describes the diet issue, this
is from his own work.

00:32:39.091 --> 00:32:42.169
[reads from book]
"The fact that the incidence rate of coronary

00:32:42.169 --> 00:32:47.539
disease was significantly correlated with
the average percentage of calories from sucrose,

00:32:47.539 --> 00:32:53.479
sugar in the diet, is explained by the intercorrelation
of sucrose with saturated fat."

00:32:53.479 --> 00:32:58.259
In other words, donuts, ice cream.

00:32:58.259 --> 00:33:02.480
"Partial correlation analysis shows that with
saturated fat constant, there was no significant

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:06.389
correlation between dietary sucrose and the
incidence of coronary heart disease."

00:33:06.389 --> 00:33:12.219
So Keys said, "See? Sucrose isn't the cause."
Except for one thing. When you do a multi-variant

00:33:12.219 --> 00:33:18.479
linear regression analysis like this, you
have to do it both ways. So, you hold dietary

00:33:18.479 --> 00:33:22.919
fat constant and show that sucrose doesn't
work, but then you have to do the opposite.

00:33:22.919 --> 00:33:28.490
You have to hold sucrose constant and show
that dietary fat still works. Did he do that?

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:37.710
He didn't do that. Why didn't he do that?
We don't know. He's dead. Nobody to ask. All

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:44.169
we know is that there's some real questions
about the last 30 years of nutrition policy

00:33:44.169 --> 00:33:48.119
in America based on this study.

00:33:48.119 --> 00:33:55.999
So of course, this led to the fat-free craze.
Sorry about the heading here. But bottom line.

00:33:55.999 --> 00:34:02.980
We live in a low-fat society. Remember Snackwells?
They're still with us, right? OK? The content

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:08.190
of low-fat home cooked food can be moderated.
You can determine what you put in the food

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:09.490
you cook yourself.

00:34:09.490 --> 00:34:17.471
But low-fat processed food tastes like cardboard.
OK? The flavor is in the fat. So, when you

00:34:17.471 --> 00:34:22.770
take the fat out, what do you have to do?
You have to substitute it. With what? With

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:26.590
carbohydrate. Well, which carbohydrate? High
fructose corn syrup or sucrose. So, there's

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:28.159
the recipe for Snackwells.

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:34.960
Two grams of fat out. Thirteen grams of carbohydrate
in, four of which are sugar. How about chocolate

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:43.320
milk? Kids won't drink milk today in school.
Why? Because we took the fat out, saturated

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:49.890
fat. Whole milk is 3% saturated fat. We took
it down to 1%. Or even skim tastes like crap.

00:34:49.890 --> 00:34:50.890
Kids know that.

00:34:50.890 --> 00:34:52.780
[laughter]

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:55.590
So what did they do? They said, "Well, we
gotta make the kids drink the milk 'cause

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:59.130
they need the Vitamin D, Calcium and Phosphorous."
So, what did they do? They added the chocolate

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:05.850
syrup. So now, chocolate milk has a half a
glass of orange juices' worth of sugar.

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:13.880
So the question is, which is worse, the sugar
or the fat? That's the question. And here

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:18.810
it is. One percent Berkeley Farms low-fat
milk right there. One hundred thirty calories.

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:23.030
Fifteen grams of sugar. And here's Berkeley
Farms one percent chocolate milk.

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:28.180
Hundred and ninety calories, 29 grams high
fructose corn syrup. So, is this what you

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:33.330
think we should be giving our children in
school? Yes or no. But that's what they're

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:42.120
getting. So, here's the reason. We have five
tastes on our tongue. We have sugar. We have

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.120
sweet.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:48.500
We have salty, sour, bitter, and something
called umami, astringent, soy sauce. Sugar

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:53.660
covers up the other four. It covers up salty,
like Chex Mix or honey roasted peanuts. It

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:58.510
covers up sour, like German wines, right?
They don't get enough sun so they're highly

00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:59.510
acidic.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:05.020
The citric acid is very high so they gotta
add some Sussreserve to cut it. So, all German

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:10.140
wines are kinda sweet. Or, lemonade, you gotta
add sugar. I mean, who would drink lemonade

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:14.650
without sugar? Umami, sweet and sour pork.
That's half soy sauce. You would never go

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:17.720
eat that at the Chinese restaurant, except
that the sugar cuts it and you can't even

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:18.720
tell it's there.

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:26.270
And finally, bitter. Caffeine is bitter. Dark
chocolate is bitter. Milk chocolate's not.

00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:28.710
Bottom line, you can make dog poop taste good
with enough sugar.

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:30.350
[laughter]

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:35.210
And indeed, that's what the food industry
has done. They have mitigated the negative

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:41.900
effects of the food that they are processing
and serving with sugar for their own benefit,

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:42.900
not for yours.

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:49.741
So as far as I'm concerned, we've had our
entire food supply fructosilated. OK? For

00:36:49.741 --> 00:36:54.340
palatability, especially with the decrease
in fat, because of this nutrition policy,

00:36:54.340 --> 00:37:01.670
which is highly questionable at best and downright
dangerous at worst, and also ostensibly as

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:03.250
a browning agent.

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:09.750
Go to Safeway and look at commercially available
bread. You'll not find a bread at Safeway

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:12.720
that doesn't have high fructose corn syrup
in it. And they will tell you "because it

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:21.250
browns better." Also, increases shelf-life.
How long does a loaf of bread that you buy

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:24.360
at your local bakery last before it goes stale?

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:31.940
A day or two? Maybe? Put it in the microwave.
It gets soft again. But bottom line, it goes

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:38.410
stale pretty fast. How come? There's no high
fructose corn syrup in it. The reason that

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:42.780
the commercially available bread lasts two
or three weeks is because the sugars displace

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:44.030
the water.

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:50.530
It's called water activity. And so, it doesn't
evaporate and so it doesn't go stale. So,

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:57.290
this is a shelf-life issue because then the
supermarket can sell it for longer. So, this

00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:03.720
is not for you. This is for them. And finally
also, the substitution of trans fats, which

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:07.800
we know are really dangerous, but we know
that and we're getting rid of them.

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:13.490
And they're going down to close to zero now.
And in New York, they're not even there. Right?

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:20.450
Mayor Bloomberg. The point is that fructose
is not glucose. No way, no how. The common

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:25.030
wisdom is that sugar is just empty calories.
And you can get your empty calories from anywhere

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:26.030
you want.

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:30.500
You can get your empty calories from carrots,
or you get your empty calories from cheesecake.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:36.530
The food industry will say constantly, nonstop,
every time they have a chance, "There is no

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:42.360
bad food. Every food should be eaten in moderation."

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:47.570
That's what they say as if somehow that's
some sort of a magic spell that's supposed

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:55.360
to basically divorce you from the reality.
In fact, we're not eating it in moderation.

00:38:55.360 --> 00:39:01.420
We're eating it in way excess. And that's
the point. And hepatic fructose metabolism

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:04.140
is completely different from that of glucose.

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:09.210
Glucose is the energy of life. Every cell
in your body uses glucose. Every cell in every

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:16.210
organism on the planet uses glucose for energy,
fructose, not so. In fact, there is no requirement

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:19.620
for fructose. There's no biochemical process
that requires fructose.

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:26.550
There's no place in your body that needs fructose
except for semen and your body makes it from

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:31.960
glucose through the Randle cycle and dietary
fructose does not contribute to it. So, if

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:38.110
there was no fructose on this planet, we wouldn't
have desserts, but we would do just fine thank

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:40.170
you. OK?

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:44.450
And I'm also gonna show you that chronic fructose
exposure alone promotes this thing we call

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:50.760
the metabolic syndrome. All the cardiovascular
co-morbidities: Type 2 diabetes, hypertension,

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:58.420
dyslipidemia, and obesity. And lastly, fructose
tricks the brain into increasing total food

00:39:58.420 --> 00:39:59.420
consumption.

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:06.000
And that's where this enormous glut of fructose
really comes from. It's from here because

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:12.100
of the phenomenon of reward and the process
of addiction. And I'll show you that. So in

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:16.700
order to explain this, I have to basically
show you fructose is different from glucose.

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:23.860
So, let's consume 120 calories in glucose,
two slices of white bread, a quarter cup of

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:31.451
rice. OK? Eighty percent of that, on the right,
96 calories will be metabolized by all the

00:40:31.451 --> 00:40:37.540
organs in the body 'cause every organ has
a glucose transporter to transport glucose.

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:43.270
Twenty percent will hit the liver. So, we're
gonna follow that 20%. Now, I'm standing over

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:47.580
here and I don't have a laser pointer, but
you can see in big font in the center the

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:54.650
word "glycogen." Almost all the glucose goes
to glycogen. Glycogen is liver starch.

00:40:54.650 --> 00:41:01.610
It is the storage form of glucose in the liver.
Does glycogen hurt your liver? No. We have

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:06.370
marathoning carb-loaders, right? They eat
pasta like crazy before a race because they're

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:10.860
trying to build up glycogen stores in their
liver so that they'll have more energy for

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:11.860
the race.

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:16.940
We have kids with glycogen storage disease
Type 1A. They've got livers down to their

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:22.370
knees, they're hypoglycemic, they're sick
as all get-out, but they don't get liver failure

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:27.340
because glycogen doesn't hurt your liver.
This is what your liver wants to do with excess

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:30.560
energy is make glycogen.

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:35.620
This is good. Now, let's do something that's
not so good. Let's talk about a different

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:41.780
carbohydrate. Let's talk about my favorite
carbohydrate, maybe yours too. Right? It's

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:49.640
a carbohydrate. There's the structure right
there. But we know that ethanol is not just

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:50.900
any old carbohydrate.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:56.100
Ethanol is a toxin. In fact, it's two toxins
in one. You wrap your Lamborghini around a

00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:03.040
tree, acute ethanol toxicity. And you fry
your liver, chronic ethanol toxicity. Two

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:09.560
toxins in one. We keep it out of the hands
of children. We have an agency in Washington

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:16.440
DC that regulates it as a commodity specifically
because we know this is dangerous and we have

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.200
to be kept from ourselves.

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:23.230
Called the ATF, right? Alcohol Tobacco and
Firearms, all of which are bad for us so we

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:29.100
need an agency to keep us from it. So anybody
who talks about the need for public health,

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:35.060
we already have it for these things. Over
here on the left we have acute ethanol exposure.

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:40.220
And you can read through it. You all went
to college. And over on the right, acute fructose

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:44.810
exposure. Nothing, because fructose is not
metabolized by the brain, whereas ethanol

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:55.260
is. Now, let's consume 120 calories in ethanol.
A shot of Makers Mark. OK? My drug of choice,

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:58.250
along with the caffeine.

00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:06.140
So what happens here? Remember with glucose
it was 20/80? With ethanol, it's 80/20. So,

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:10.710
20% of the calories, 24 calories, will be
taken off the table because of the stomach

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:15.440
and the intestine or the kidney, muscle, and
brain. Eighty percent of the calories, or

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:20.090
96 calories, are gonna hit the liver, four
times the substrate as with glucose.

00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:26.570
Same number of calories. Isocaloric, but not
isometabolic. Here's what happens to ethanol.

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:31.410
Now, I'm not gonna go through all these pathways
with you. If you wanna see how this works,

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:36.060
you can go to the YouTube video. I spend a
lot of time with them, 90 minutes worth.

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:41.990
So you can look at them there. Bottom line,
do you see glycogen anywhere? Nowhere. What

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:46.680
you see is that the ethanol comes down to
acetate and enters this thing down at the

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:52.330
bottom called the mitochondria. The mitochondria
is the energy burning factories of your cells

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:54.320
that create the energy.

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:58.540
You've got 96 calories of ethanol hitting
the mitochondria all at once. And that's where

00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:04.700
things go bad. When that happens, and you
don't have a pop-off to some storage form,

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:09.550
that's when you get into metabolic trouble.
So, the more calories that hit the liver and

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:13.390
faster it gets to your mitochondria, the sicker
you're gonna get.

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:19.760
That's what metabolic syndrome is. And alcohol
does it. Just ask anybody who drinks beer.

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:26.170
Now let's do fructose. Let's consume 120 calories
in sucrose, eight-ounce glass of orange juice.

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:32.510
So, two slices of white bread, quarter cup
of rice, eight ounce glass of orange juice.

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:38.200
All 120 calories. All isocaloric. If a calorie
is a calorie, it shouldn't matter, right?

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:47.070
But a calorie is not a calorie. Isocaloric,
not isometabolic. It is not what you eat,

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:53.670
it is what you do with what you eat. So let's
follow the 120 calories. The glucose will

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:56.220
do the same 20/80 split.

00:44:56.220 --> 00:45:03.120
So, 12 calories to the liver, 48 to the periphery--20/80.
But all 60 calories have to be metabolized

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:08.050
by the liver because only the liver has the
glucose transporter specific for fructose.

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:13.480
So now we're hitting 72 calories are hitting
the liver. And this is just for fructose.

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:16.950
So, the glucose will go to glycogen, but the
fructose, you see glycogen anywhere on there?

00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:22.230
You see a lot of arrows is what you see. And
in blue, you see hypertension, inflammation,

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:27.080
hyperinsulimia, hepatic insulin resistance,
dyslipidemia, muscle insulin resistance, and

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:28.080
obesity.

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:32.850
Now, I don't have time to go through how we
got there. Go to the YouTube video and you

00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:39.020
can see it, all the specifics. But the bottom
line is that's metabolic syndrome. And the

00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:45.610
reason is because it all comes down to the
mitochondria. And there's no glycogen pop-off.

00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:52.140
That's metabolic disease, and its' fast. So
here's chronic ethanol exposure. And here's

00:45:52.140 --> 00:46:00.420
chronic fructose exposure. Eight out of twelve
because they're the same. Because after all,

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:06.190
where do you get ethanol from? Fermentation
of fructose. It's called wine, right? We do

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:08.260
it right here.

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:13.490
The big difference is that for ethanol the
yeast does the first step in metabolism. For

00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:18.710
fructose, we do our own first step in metabolism,
but once you get down to the mitochondria

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:22.710
they're all the same. And they cause the same
diseases for the same reasons.

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:29.800
So, consuming all of this fructose is not
so good. And how did we get there? The food

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:35.030
industry brought us there. So, what's the
difference? Over here on the left we have

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:40.790
a can of Coke. Over on the right we have a
can of beer. Hundred fifty calories both.

00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:47.310
Clearly, the composition is different: 90
of ethanol, 60 of maltose, that's glucose.

00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:52.900
For the Coke, it's 75/75. But when you do
the math on the first pass effect the calories

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:56.880
hitting the liver are exactly the same. And
we already showed you that it's not just,

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:00.830
it's the calories hitting the liver and how
fast the mitochondria can metabolize.

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:05.370
So, in America we have something called beer
belly. Well, guess what? We also have soda

00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:12.640
belly 'cause they're the same. In Saudi Arabia,
they don't have beer belly. But boy, oh boy,

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:19.640
do they have soda belly. And so does the whole
world. Here are the four food stuffs that

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:27.780
do this: trans fats do this; branched-chain
amino acids: leucine, isoleucine, valine,

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:33.200
for those of you who took biochemistry. They
get metabolized to energy in the same way.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:37.940
And they are associated with metabolic syndrome
as well. Where do you get branched-chain amino

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:38.940
acids from?

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:49.390
Soy protein, that's our whole diet now, ethanol
and fructose. And so we have one fat. Amino

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:53.340
acids, that's protein, and we have ethanol,
which is sort of, I don't know what it is,

00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:59.080
and then fructose, which is carbohydrate.
Different things all from different parts

00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:00.280
of our diet.

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:05.730
But they all share two things in common. They're
not insulin regulated and there's no glycogen

00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:10.040
pop-off in the liver. They go straight to
the mitochondria and cause disease. That's

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:18.950
metabolic syndrome right there. Now, the other
thing that fructose does. It tells your brain

00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:21.100
you want more.

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:26.710
Junk food addiction may be a clue to obesity.
Indeed, binging on high-calorie foods may

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:29.930
be as addictive as cocaine or nicotine and
could cause compulsive eating and obesity,

00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:37.170
according to a study published on Sunday.
This was back in March. So, is sugar addictive?

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:43.380
The lay public seems to know. All these books,
right? If you look in the brain at the reward

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:47.751
center, called the nucleus accumbens, here's
a control brain over on the left and here's

00:48:47.751 --> 00:48:53.010
a cocaine brain. You notice the red has gone
down? Those are dopamine receptors.

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:58.700
Down regulation of dopamine receptors is addiction.
That's what causes addiction. Over on the

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:03.450
right, you see a control brain, you see an
obese brain, same thing, down regulation of

00:49:03.450 --> 00:49:07.630
dopamine receptors. When your dopamine receptors
are down regulated, 'cause dopamine is the

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:13.030
reward transmitter, when your receptors are
down regulated, you need more dopamine to

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:14.770
occupy those fewer receptors.

00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:20.810
Therefore, you have to eat more to get it.
So it's basically, that's called tolerance

00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:26.000
and that's an addiction term. And when you're
tolerant, you have to supply more substrate

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:31.610
to get the same effect. And then when you
take it away, that's withdrawal. So, tolerance

00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:39.020
means you're continuing it and withdrawal
is when you lose it.

00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:43.740
For an addictive substance to be addictive,
you have to fulfill four criteria. These are

00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:48.770
for animals now, for animals. Binging, withdrawal,
craving, and what we call cross-sensitization

00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:54.150
with other drugs of abuse. In other words,
if you expose an animal to say, morphine and

00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:58.570
you addict them, and then you take the morphine
away and you expose them to amphetamine, they'd

00:49:58.570 --> 00:49:59.950
never seen amphetamine before.

00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:03.530
They will have a heightened response to the
amphetamine because they were addicted to

00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:09.570
the morphine. That's called cross-sensitization
because the D2 receptors are already down

00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:15.070
regulated. Everybody got the picture? Sugar
does them all. And I don't have time to show

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:20.450
you all the data, but we're publishing a paper
out in the fall called "Is Fast Food Addictive?"

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:22.680
where we show all of this.

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:27.500
How about in humans? So here are the DSM-V
criteria for addiction right here. So you

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:31.530
have to show tolerance or withdrawal, and
then all of these psychological dependencies

00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:37.790
in orange. And if you just read through them
it sounds like every obese person I know.

00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:45.110
Indeed, I can show you withdrawal right now.
Everybody see this movie? OK? If second-graders

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:48.240
learn nothing else about nutrition except
watching this movie, that would be enough.

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:56.790
I'm gonna play one little clip from Day 18
of Morgan Spurlock's ordeal through McDonalds.

00:50:56.790 --> 00:51:02.220
Remember, this guy was a vegan, right? His
girlfriend was a vegan chef. He was nice and

00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:06.850
thin and then he started gaining weight 'cause
he started eating at McDonalds. This is Day

00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:08.180
18. Here's what he says.

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:09.180
[plays clip]

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:16.550
&gt;&gt;Morgan Spurlock: I was feeling bad in the
car. Feeling like shit. Really. I was feeling

00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:26.070
really, really, sick and unhappy. Started
eating, feel great. Feel really good now.

00:51:26.070 --> 00:51:29.140
I feel so good, it's crazy. Isn't that right,
baby?

00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:31.270
&gt;&gt;Girlfriend: Yeah, you're crazy all right.

00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:32.270
[end clip]

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:36.350
&gt;&gt;Robert Lustig: So, I don't know if you could
all hear him or not. He basically said, "I

00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:42.030
was sitting in the car. I was feeling really
crappy. I was feeling like shit. I was feeling

00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:48.140
tired and unhappy. Started eating. I feel
great. I feel so great, it's crazy. Ain't

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:52.390
that right, babe?" And she yells back, "Yeah,
you're crazy all right." That's what he said.

00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:53.390
[laughter]

00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:59.540
He just described withdrawal. Eighteen days
on a McDonalds diet and he went from being

00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:07.880
a vegan to being an addict. 'Cause he just
described drug withdrawal. So, who's winning

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:13.440
the war? This is a war. 'Cause whatever is
good for the food industry is bad for us and

00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.450
whatever's good for us is bad for them.

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:22.030
There's no middle ground. And they're winning
because the S&amp;P 500 in blue. And here's the

00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:27.370
stock price of McDonalds, Coke and Pepsi.
There's the economic downturn of 2008. And

00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:30.350
you can see that they're doing just fine thank
you. OK?

00:52:30.350 --> 00:52:38.530
And over here, we have Con Agra, General Mills,
Hormel, Kraft, Proctor and Gamble, and they're

00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:43.470
all doing better than the S&amp;P as well. If
you wanna make money, invest in a food company

00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:48.260
'cause they know what they're doing. And they
keep plying us with the sugar.

00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:57.340
They keep adding the sugar to the food specifically
because it works for them. The annual profit

00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:03.790
margin of the food industry prior to 1975
was 1% per year. One percent per year. The

00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:10.490
increase in the general population was 1%
per year. In other words, they sold more food

00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:12.650
because they sold the same amount of food
to more people.

00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:21.660
Got it? Since 1975, the profit margin's been
5% per year. Now, the population hasn't gone

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:27.090
up any faster than 1%. In fact, it's going
up slower now. So if they're going up by 5%

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:34.340
per year, how are they doing it? Selling more
food to the same number of people.

00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:38.110
The American Heart Association has recognized
this is a problem and they published this

00:53:38.110 --> 00:53:42.830
scientific statement in 2009, which I helped
contribute to, called "Dietary Sugar Intake

00:53:42.830 --> 00:53:47.570
and Cardiovascular Health." Because they were
the people who said low-fat, and they now

00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:48.570
got it.

00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:55.280
They now know that that was a mistake and
they're trying to undo the mistake. When you

00:53:55.280 --> 00:54:01.560
make a mistake, what do you do? You admit
the mistake and you try to right the ship.

00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:06.960
We haven't admitted the mistake and we haven't
righted the ship, and things continue to go

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:08.190
downhill.

00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:14.660
So, let me close by just re-stating the first
law of thermodynamics that I started with.

00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:19.730
Here's how you should state it from now on.
If you're gonna store it, that is, an obligate

00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:26.370
weight gain set up by biochemical forces out
of your control, and you expect to burn it,

00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:30.720
that is, normal energy expenditure for normal
quality of life, because energy expenditure

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.130
and quality of life are the same thing.

00:54:33.130 --> 00:54:37.400
Things that increase your energy expenditure
make you feel good, like ephedra, it's off

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:42.850
the market, caffeine, exercise. Things that
lower your energy expenditure make you feel

00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:49.860
lousy, like starvation, hyperthyroidism. So,
if you're gonna store it and you expect to

00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:52.290
burn it, then you're gonna have to eat it.

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:58.990
And now, the two apparent behaviors that we
note that are markers for the obesity epidemic,

00:54:58.990 --> 00:55:07.280
rather than causes. Remember, correlation
is not causation. I just showed you causation.

00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:11.770
And these are downstream. The gluttony and
the sloth are downstream of the biochemical

00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:17.440
process of insulin resistance and fat deposition
driven by sugar.

00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:24.970
Our biochemistry is a result of our environment.
So, here we have Michelle Obama trying to

00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:31.500
do something about childhood obesity. And
I applaud her for taking it on. And she has

00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:38.040
the "Let's Move" campaign, necessary, but
not sufficient.

00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:42.530
And the reason is because it's focused on
the individual, it's focused on the family,

00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:47.550
focus on the community, but leaves government
and the food industry out because they don't

00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:54.650
want the fight. So the question I'm gonna
leave you with is a big question. It's a global

00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:55.650
question.

00:55:55.650 --> 00:56:01.000
Can our toxic environment be changed without
governmental/societal intervention? Especially

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:06.940
when there are potentially addictive substances
involved? We have needed government intervention

00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:12.320
for every other substance of abuse: cocaine,
amphetamine, nicotine, cannabis, ethanol,

00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:13.800
morphine.

00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:21.320
Every single drug of abuse has required governmental
intervention because they're public health

00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:28.490
problems. I've just shown you that this is
a public health problem. For further reading,

00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:34.510
I'm gonna refer you to these papers. I'm not
gonna, iIf you want, you can send me an email

00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:37.400
and I'll happily send you a pdf of any of
them.

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:44.810
And just for a little enticement, in 2013,
look for this book, "Fat Chance: Gambling

00:56:44.810 --> 00:56:50.540
on our personal and public health." I'm writing
it now and hopefully by January of 2013, it'll

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:57.310
be at the publisher available not at Borders,
but maybe at Amazon. And with that, I wanna

00:56:57.310 --> 00:57:00.911
thank my collaborators at UCSF, the Weight
Assessment for Teen and Children Health Clinic,

00:57:00.911 --> 00:57:07.060
UC Berkeley Department of Nutritional Sciences,
and also Touro University, in particular,

00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:12.960
my colleague Dr. Jean-Marc Schwartz who is
a card carrying fructose biochemist, and also

00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:16.800
my colleagues at the Institute for Health
Policy Studies, Laura Schmidt and Clare Brindis,

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:20.240
who've helped with some of the policy work
that we're trying to engage in right now.

00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:25.010
With that, I will close and I'll open it up
to questions and I thank you all so very much

00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:27.680
for your attention.

00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:28.950
[applause]

00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:35.010
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I know a lot of you guys
have to get running to your next meeting.

00:57:35.010 --> 00:57:39.900
I just wanna remind you if you wanna learn
more about the Health at Google speaker series,

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:41.100
check out go O-Y-L.

00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:45.520
You'll learn a lot about that there. We'll
stay here as long as we can, letting some

00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:49.011
people step up to the microphone here and
ask some questions. But I know a lot of you

00:57:49.011 --> 00:57:53.424
need to run. Thank you for your investment
of an hour's worth of your time to learn more

00:57:53.424 --> 00:57:54.424
about this subject.

00:57:54.424 --> 00:57:55.424
&gt;&gt;Robert Lustig: Please.

00:57:55.424 --> 00:57:59.090
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Thank you. This
is instructive. I have a--

00:57:59.090 --> 00:58:00.090
&gt;&gt;Robert Lustig: Speak up though.

00:58:00.090 --> 00:58:01.210
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Oh, does this work
better?

00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:02.210
&gt;&gt;Robert Lustig: A little, yeah.

00:58:02.210 --> 00:58:05.060
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: I have a key question
about the calories in minus calories burned

00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:09.480
thing. It ignores the metabolism side,--

00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:10.480
&gt;&gt;Robert Lustig: Right.

00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:12.240
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: which you started
to get into. I mean, you talked about some

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:18.080
of this. It's like, how much that you took
in actually just passed through? Or otherwise,--

00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:19.080
&gt;&gt;Robert Lustig: Sure.

00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:20.080
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: get metabolized
in different ways?

00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:21.080
&gt;&gt;Robert Lustig: Absolutely.

00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:23.960
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: And I assume that
metabolism is, there's self-regulation mechanism.

00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:27.840
There's a feedback loop. So, it's not just
like putting more in is gonna mean you put

00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:28.840
more on.

00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:29.840
&gt;&gt;Robert Lustig: Right.

00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:31.350
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: 'Cause the feedback
loop kicks in differently.

00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:37.540
&gt;&gt;Robert Lustig: It depends on what they are.
For instance, protein costs more to burn than

00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:48.810
say, sugar. The metabolic debt from the burning
of protein is much higher. There's something

00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:50.460
called the thermic effect of food.

00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:56.970
That is, the heat, the body heat given off
when you burn any specific food. And what

00:58:56.970 --> 00:59:01.720
you do with protein is much higher than say,
with sugar as an example. In addition, who

00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:10.180
says you absorb them? The best way to not
absorb what you eat is fiber. Fiber acts as

00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:18.580
a barrier in the lumen of the intestine preventing
the transfer of calories from your gut into

00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:19.580
the bloodstream.

00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:24.460
Number one, that gives your liver a chance
to keep up because it's not just a dose issue,

00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:31.160
it's a flux issue and it also delivers some
of the nutrients to your large intestine,

00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:35.690
so they don't get absorbed at all. And so,
what happens in the large intestine is that

00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:38.910
those bacteria will use that for energy.

00:59:38.910 --> 00:59:44.890
And what will they do? They will make hydrogen
sulfide. So, in my world, it's either fat

00:59:44.890 --> 00:59:45.890
or fart.

00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:47.150
[laughter]

00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:55.830
So, how many calories you eat is not the issue.
How many calories you absorb, how fast you

00:59:55.830 --> 01:00:03.220
absorb them, whether or not you have a metabolic
debt in terms of burning them, and then of

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:06.770
course whether or not your insulin goes up
because once your insulin goes up, you don't

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:09.369
wanna exercise.

01:00:09.369 --> 01:00:13.570
So there are a lot of things going on that
interfere with that calories in, calories

01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:16.410
out equation. That's why we gotta get off
this.

01:00:16.410 --> 01:00:20.140
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Exactly. So we
have to learn more about those factors you're

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:23.520
just mentioning to have control over the metabolism
side.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:24.520
&gt;&gt;Robert Lustig: Absolutely.

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.130
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: OK. Thanks.

01:00:26.130 --> 01:00:30.190
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Hi. I think you
might have answered this, but I'm curious

01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:33.910
about what your take is on fruit and then
you also brought up soy in this lecture as

01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:34.910
well.

01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:35.910
&gt;&gt;Robert Lustig: Right.

01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:38.470
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: And I'd like to
know, do you advocate eating a lot of fruit

01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:39.470
and a lot of soy?

01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:43.780
&gt;&gt;Robert Lustig: Right. OK. I don't advocate
eating a lot of fruit. But you know what?

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:48.570
I don't care. And here's the reason I don't
care. First of all, fruit has fiber. It has

01:00:48.570 --> 01:00:54.780
way more fiber than it does sugar. If you
plotted sugar against fiber for all fruits,

01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:56.860
it's almost a linear straight line.

01:00:56.860 --> 01:01:02.490
The only outlier is grapes. They have more
sugar than fiber. But everything else, the

01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:08.150
fiber and sugar is the same. And it actually
makes, I mean, what has the highest sugar

01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:12.619
content of anything? Sugar cane, right? It's
a stick.

01:01:12.619 --> 01:01:13.619
[laughter]

01:01:13.619 --> 01:01:18.970
You can't even chew it, it's so fibrous, it's
so tough, it's so chewy. How much sugar you

01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:23.520
think you get out of a piece of sugar cane
from just chewing it or sucking on it? Almost

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:24.710
nothing.

01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:29.290
On the other hand, if you put it in the still
and you boil it up and you make the molasses

01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:33.210
and you chlorinate it and you make the white
crystalline sugar and you have a hundred pound

01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:38.440
bag of sugar lying around to make a donut,
then how much you gonna get? God made sugar

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:48.560
hard to get, man-made sugar easy to get. So,
I don't care if you eat God-made sugar. How's

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:57.250
that? In addition, fruit is self-limiting.
How many oranges can you eat in one sitting?

01:01:57.250 --> 01:02:02.619
One? Did you ever see a kid eat two oranges
in a sitting? Pretty rare. On the other hand,

01:02:02.619 --> 01:02:06.300
how many glasses of orange juice can they
drink in one sitting?

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:10.750
So which would you rather have? An orange,
which has 30 calories, 15 of which are fructose

01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:16.450
and plenty of fiber, or a glass of orange
juice, which has 120 calories of sugar, 60

01:02:16.450 --> 01:02:19.351
of which are fructose and no fiber? I put
it to you.

01:02:19.351 --> 01:02:22.550
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: OK. So if we had
like, four or five pieces of fruit a day--

01:02:22.550 --> 01:02:23.550
&gt;&gt;Robert Lustig: I don't care.

01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:24.550
[laughter]

01:02:24.550 --> 01:02:27.523
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: What about the
soy protein issue?

01:02:27.523 --> 01:02:33.340
&gt;&gt;Robert Lustig: Soy is a big question. Soy
clearly delivers protein, but it's not high-quality

01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:38.740
protein. There's high-quality protein, there's
low-quality protein. What distinguishes it?

01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:40.810
The essential amino acids.

01:02:40.810 --> 01:02:45.830
So, tryptophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine, the
aromatic amino acids are the ones in shorter

01:02:45.830 --> 01:02:50.810
supply. The place you get that is eggs. Egg
protein is the highest-quality protein there

01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:59.200
is. OK? Low-quality protein, soy. So, should
we be making everything with soy?

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:07.240
Well, only processed food has soy. What else
has soy? Only processed food. So this is a

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:12.780
processed food issue as far as I'm concerned.
If you ate food as it came out of the ground,

01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:18.660
as God intended it, I wouldn't care what you
ate. Processed food is the problem.

01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:24.240
And that's what we have shifted our entire
economy and our entire diet to because it's

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.470
cheap. Thank you.

01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:25.930
[applause]
