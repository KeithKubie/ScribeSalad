00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
and stuff and I thought that was a

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:37.650 align:start position:0%
again there's an interesting dichotomy
 

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:40.670 align:start position:0%
again there's an interesting dichotomy
because<00:12:38.340><c> what</c><00:12:38.880><c> he</c><00:12:39.060><c> just</c><00:12:39.390><c> came</c><00:12:39.570><c> out</c><00:12:39.630><c> of</c><00:12:40.020><c> was</c>

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
because what he just came out of was
 

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.740 align:start position:0%
because what he just came out of was
witnessing<00:12:41.370><c> a</c><00:12:41.610><c> bunch</c><00:12:41.940><c> of</c><00:12:42.060><c> people</c><00:12:42.420><c> who</c><00:12:42.600><c> had</c>

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:45.810 align:start position:0%
literally blind faith that they were
 

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.960 align:start position:0%
literally blind faith that they were
gonna<00:12:45.930><c> get</c><00:12:46.170><c> something</c><00:12:46.440><c> better</c><00:12:46.740><c> and</c><00:12:47.160><c> it's</c><00:12:47.730><c> all</c>

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:47.970 align:start position:0%
gonna get something better and it's all
 

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
gonna get something better and it's all
just<00:12:48.240><c> kind</c><00:12:48.420><c> of</c><00:12:48.540><c> a</c><00:12:48.630><c> scam</c><00:12:48.930><c> you</c><00:12:49.290><c> know</c><00:12:49.890><c> so</c><00:12:50.190><c> that</c><00:12:50.220><c> we</c>

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:50.610 align:start position:0%
just kind of a scam you know so that we
 

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:51.050 align:start position:0%
just kind of a scam you know so that we
know<00:12:50.820><c> of</c>

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
know of
 

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.720 align:start position:0%
know of
maybe<00:12:51.420><c> the</c><00:12:51.690><c> well</c><00:12:51.990><c> I</c><00:12:52.020><c> mean</c><00:12:52.320><c> crazy</c><00:12:52.530><c> you</c><00:12:52.680><c> know</c><00:12:52.830><c> um</c>

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:53.730 align:start position:0%
maybe the well I mean crazy you know um
 

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:56.150 align:start position:0%
maybe the well I mean crazy you know um
but<00:12:54.450><c> I</c><00:12:55.020><c> think</c><00:12:55.110><c> that's</c><00:12:55.440><c> the</c><00:12:55.620><c> point</c><00:12:55.770><c> from</c><00:12:56.010><c> his</c>

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
but I think that's the point from his
 

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.490 align:start position:0%
but I think that's the point from his
point<00:12:56.400><c> of</c><00:12:56.520><c> view</c><00:12:56.580><c> he's</c><00:12:56.970><c> just</c><00:12:57.210><c> like</c><00:12:57.330><c> my</c><00:12:57.600><c> god</c><00:12:58.110><c> can</c>

00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
point of view he's just like my god can
 

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.070 align:start position:0%
point of view he's just like my god can
it<00:12:58.590><c> get</c><00:12:58.800><c> any</c><00:12:59.070><c> worse</c><00:12:59.400><c> than</c><00:12:59.640><c> this</c><00:12:59.970><c> you</c><00:13:00.750><c> know</c><00:13:00.780><c> and</c>

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
it get any worse than this you know and
 

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
it get any worse than this you know and
it<00:13:01.200><c> I</c><00:13:01.350><c> think</c><00:13:01.380><c> it</c><00:13:01.650><c> challenged</c><00:13:02.160><c> his</c><00:13:02.400><c> faith</c><00:13:02.670><c> and</c>

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:02.970 align:start position:0%
it I think it challenged his faith and
 

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.490 align:start position:0%
it I think it challenged his faith and
then<00:13:03.090><c> he's</c><00:13:03.210><c> right</c><00:13:03.360><c> like</c><00:13:03.540><c> I</c><00:13:03.690><c> can't</c><00:13:04.200><c> do</c><00:13:04.350><c> this</c>

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
