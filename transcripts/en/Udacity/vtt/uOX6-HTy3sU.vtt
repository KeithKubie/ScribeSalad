00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.823
Imagery should convey information,

00:00:01.823 --> 00:00:04.877
personalize the experience of
using your app or provide delight.

00:00:04.877 --> 00:00:09.380
Your use of imagery will strongly
reflect and reinforce your branding.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.886
So if you're brand is bold and dynamic,
then use imagery in the same way.

00:00:13.886 --> 00:00:17.710
If your brand is playful and informal,
then maybe a more illustrative style.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.248
If you're chic and refined,
then tell that story visually.

00:00:21.248 --> 00:00:25.655
But what types of imagery can you
use and when are they appropriate?

00:00:25.655 --> 00:00:28.094
The major classes of
imagery you can use for

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:33.510
somewhere on a spectrum from photography
to illustration, to iconography.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.190
Let's take a look at each of these and
when they might be appropriate.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.906
Now photography is great when
it's specific to your content.

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:44.481
If you're showing information about
a particular person, place or thing,

00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:47.570
then photography can quickly and
beautifully communicate that.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.200
Conversely, if your content if more
abstract, we don't have imagery specific

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.850
to the content, then photography
might feel off the mark.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.246
Here in this example, we're showing
details of the London Eye and

00:01:01.246 --> 00:01:04.468
then having a specific
picture works very well.

00:01:04.468 --> 00:01:07.326
But if you're showing
information about another place,

00:01:07.326 --> 00:01:11.232
here Waterloo station, which is near the
London Eye, but not the same place and

00:01:11.232 --> 00:01:14.398
then the image doesn't connect in
the same way and it feels off.

00:01:14.398 --> 00:01:18.367
As another example, if I'm showing
content from other people like this

00:01:18.367 --> 00:01:22.206
messaging type app, then showing
a photo of a the contact immediately

00:01:22.206 --> 00:01:26.390
communicates far better than a label or
a generic graphic might.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.830
When presenting photography,

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.280
make sure you have sufficient
quality images to avoid pixelation.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.205
If you do have great quality imagery,

00:01:34.205 --> 00:01:37.130
then don't be shy about
using it immersively.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.410
It's perfectly acceptable to
use imagery as a backdrop

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.260
to set the mood of the screen.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.970
Always considered the different
ways that images might be cropped

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.270
depending on different layouts
of size of the device.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.021
Think about the aspect ratios,
scale types and

00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:54.641
focal points that is
important to maintain.

00:01:54.641 --> 00:01:58.480
We're going to go into much more detail
about this later on in lesson five.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.960
Illustration is great for
communicating abstract concepts or

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.130
metaphors without getting hung up on the
specificity that comes from photography.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.410
Take these three examples.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.750
The first two communicate
the concepts of syncing photos or

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.570
doing a brain training game without
the specific images of people.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.007
The last image helps on board users
without having to have imagery for

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:22.586
every specific device.

00:02:22.586 --> 00:02:24.379
When creating illustration, aim for

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.320
clarity instead of being
overly decorative.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.340
Have a focal point and a message
that you are trying to communicate.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.711
While the exact style of
the illustration is up to you and

00:02:33.711 --> 00:02:38.446
your brand, do try to stay consistent
within a series of illustrations to keep

00:02:38.446 --> 00:02:39.543
them connected.

00:02:39.543 --> 00:02:43.488
For example, using a consistent
perspective, color pallet or

00:02:43.488 --> 00:02:45.030
using textures.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.240
Iconography provides clear way finding.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.240
Its goals are almost the exact
opposite of illustration

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.080
to succinctly explain their meaning and
get out of the way.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.490
They should be easy to identify and
interpret in your UI.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.943
For this reason, it's best to use the
platform iconography for common tasks,

00:03:02.943 --> 00:03:07.012
such as search or share as your users
will already be familiar with them.

00:03:07.012 --> 00:03:10.611
The material design provides a wide
range of icons that you can use in your

00:03:10.611 --> 00:03:14.269
applications for creating new icons,
then check out the extensive style

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.750
guide, which is linked
in the instructor notes.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.990
And there's a great community
starting to pop-up and

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.015
create more icons in the same
style at materialdesignicons.com.

00:03:24.015 --> 00:03:27.900
So those were the main types of
imagery you can use in your app.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.590
Picking the right one really depends
upon the feel of your brand and

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.090
the content you're showing.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.360
No matter what type of imagery you use,
it'll help to create

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.540
an immersive experience and
can be a great way to introduce motion.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.600
For example, this music player eases
the transition between states and

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.880
has an incredibly immersive feel for
its use of imagery.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.530
The images themselves can
introduce motion using videos,

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.430
scrolling effects like parallax or
other other types of animation.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.230
We'll expand on using
motion in lesson four.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.890
Once you've picked the imagery that
works best for your brand, you can use

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.410
it to make your application experiences
more immersive, personal and delightful.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.340
Let's hand over to James now and

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.440
get into how you'd
implement this in your app.
