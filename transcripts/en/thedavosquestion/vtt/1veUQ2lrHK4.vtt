00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:14.420
&gt;&gt;The scale of FGM is simply enormous.
Three million girls a year are cut.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:22.390
140 million women are living with the consequences.
It's a centuries' old tradition.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.859
It predates both Christianity and Islam, and
it's believed to have

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:34.140
started in Egypt, we think.
It happens in 28 countries across Africa.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.660
It also happens in Indonesia, Malaysia, Yemen,
Kurdistan, various other

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.010
pockets around the world.
But more than that, it's now a global problem.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:55.430
It happens in all of those disparate communities.
So in Australia, in the UK, throughout Europe,

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:02.200
the USA -- almost
everyplace in the globe, FGM is a problem.
