00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.475
Oh, please don't say
anything.

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:09.676
Please just keep
it to yourself, whatever--

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.012
[sneezes]

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:14.848
Oh.
Thought you had an idea.

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:15.849
I do.

00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:17.985
Fuck.

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:21.989
- We need to make an app.
- Like, for a Smartphone?

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.457
An app that all the people

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.827
could download and then
we make millions.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.262
It's just, that shit's hard
to come up with, man.

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:30.163
It's like catching lightning
in a bottle.

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:31.932
I already got that.

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:33.100
You got what?

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.535
Lightning in a bottle.

00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:36.036
Really, what's the idea?

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:38.172
No, no idea.

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:40.974
I got actual lightning
in a bottle.

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:42.543
No, Levi.

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:45.445
That's just a phrase.

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:46.547
I got that, dog.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.781
[static electricity buzzing]

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:49.516
Lightning in a bottle.
Blip.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.885
That's crazy, son.
Where'd you get that?

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:55.956
Some old Chinese man
sold it to me years ago.

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.058
I mean, that's some
supernatural shit, man.

00:00:58.091 --> 00:00:59.159
Nah, man.

00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:00.861
All it does is this.

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:02.129
Oh, shit!

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:02.996
Oh, the lightning!

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.199
Oh!

00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:06.834
I got it.
[sniffs]

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:11.038
But seriously, man.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.473
Would it be like an app
that reminds you

00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:15.676
when your favorite television
shows are on?

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:21.515
No. It--we got to address this
crazy-ass bottle that you got.

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:23.350
What bottle?

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:25.652
Nigga, what bottle?

00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:30.090
The bottle with
the lightning in it.

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:32.759
Are you still on that?

00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:35.028
Yes. How does it work?

00:01:35.062 --> 00:01:36.763
Cedric, I don't know.

00:01:36.797 --> 00:01:38.932
It's the classic lightning
in the bottle gag.

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:40.734
Classic li--

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:41.935
You just open it up--

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.403
[shouting]

00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:44.938
[shrilly]
Oh! Oh!

00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:46.406
Lightning in the house!
Lightning in the room!

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:51.011
Okay, you know what?

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:52.546
- You shouldn't have this.
- What?

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.014
This shit--this shit
belongs to

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:55.082
the military or something.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.450
But that app, though.

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.252
No. We don't need the app.

00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:01.421
You've got the goose
that laid the golden egg.

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:02.789
How do you know about Honkers?

00:02:02.823 --> 00:02:05.025
[mysterious music]

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:06.860
What?
This mother--

00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:07.895
[honk]

00:02:07.928 --> 00:02:09.196
Honkers.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.898
Get in on this app idea.

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:12.399
[Honker honks]
- You like it?

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:15.269
[Honkers honks]
- He likes it.

00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:18.605
Yep. He got a goddamn
golden egg.

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:21.441
Honkers here is the cat's
pajamas.

00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:23.477
[ominous music]

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.545
No, please don't. Don't.

00:02:24.578 --> 00:02:25.779
I want to show you something.

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:27.314
Whatever it is,
I don't want to see it.

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:30.417
- It's relevant.
- I already know what it is.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.987
It ain't what you think.

00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:37.157
Well, what I think it is
is a pair of cat's pajamas.

00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:40.060
Yes. These are for Honkers
to wear.

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:42.496
Nigga, what?

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:43.931
The little neck in there.

00:02:43.964 --> 00:02:45.465
The neck--

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:48.802
how you gonna fit his head
through this--with the--

00:02:48.836 --> 00:02:50.971
the orange pump shit.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.172
[honks]

00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:57.244
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave my house.

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:58.579
Why?

00:02:58.612 --> 00:03:03.517
Because you disrespected
my roommate.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.320
Okay. Okay.

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:08.989
It's clear that this is
a crazy house. So I got to go.

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.691
You over here talking
about geese and golden eggs

00:03:10.724 --> 00:03:12.426
and feline sleepwear.

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.863
- [honk]
- Come on, man. Cedric.

00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:19.766
You need to get off
your high horse, man.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.002
Hey, I just thought of a name
for you.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:25.639
â™ª

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:27.307
High horse.

00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:28.342
[neighing]
