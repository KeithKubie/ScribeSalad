00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:04.650
In the last 50 years we have revolutionized
the world with electronics by exploiting a

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.720
fundamental property of electrons -- their
charge.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.410
Now researchers are working towards the next
leap forward in technology using another fundamental

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.080
property of electrons -- their spin.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.690
The field is called spintronics, -- a portmanteau
of spin transport electronics.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.420
The idea is to use an electron’s spin in
much the same way we use its charge.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.080
Electronics today encode information by using
electrical currents to represent 1s and 0s.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.360
If the current is on and electrons are flowing,
it represents a 1.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.070
If the current is off, it’s a 0.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.690
Electrons themselves can have spins in two
orientations, up or down.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.040
So instead of on or off representing ones
and zeroes, up or down spins can be used to

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.890
encode information.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.050
Spintronics would have several advantages
over traditional electronics.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.719
Instead of using semiconductors to control
the flow of electrons, spin can be read with

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.149
common materials like aluminum and copper.

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.329
This method could be faster and more reliable,
since spin can be changed quickly and doesn’t

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.329
go away with a loss of power.

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.030
And spintronics would need less power to begin
with, since it takes less energy to change

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.359
an electron’s spin than it does to maintain
a current.

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:10.799
Spintronics have been applied to traditional
electronics since the late ‘90s, when it

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.479
was discovered that controlling the spin of
electrons in a hard drive could allow for

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.920
more sensitive read heads and therefore open
up more storage space.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.189
This tech is being applied to computer RAM
for extreme applications like in aircraft

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.780
because of its reliability when exposed to
cosmic rays, but it may replace flash memory

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.029
in SD cards one day soon.

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:32.479
And scientists are exploring how heat and
electrical currents affect the way electrons

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.539
move and create spin currents for use in future
spintronic applications.

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.999
In another 50 years, who knows what advancements
spintronics will bring!

video on quantum teleportation to see how

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.460
we can make use of spinning photons too!

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.859
Did you know that “spinning” electrons
aren’t actually spinning, it just seems

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:54.359
that way from how they move?

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:56.029
Confusing, but cool!

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:58.179
