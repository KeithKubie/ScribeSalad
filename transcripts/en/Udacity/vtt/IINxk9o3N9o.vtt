00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.250
In your pitch perfect Xcode project
select the main doc storyboard file.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.939
This is your storyboard,

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:09.740
the place where you'll set up
your entire user interface.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.630
Here you will eventually see the entire
interface, all of the interface

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.440
elements, and the view controllers
associated with interfaces.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.790
You can see this app only
has one interface and

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.350
one view controller,
named ViewController.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.150
A couple of key things to notice,

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.140
the first is the light gray arrow
on the left side of this view.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.470
This signifies that this is
the initial view controller for

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.010
the storyboard and
in fact for the application.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.530
When the user starts this app,
this is the first view controller and

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.780
view that will load.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.610
On the bottom right side you can see the
library selector would different types

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.390
of user interface
elements we can drag in.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.300
If you don't see the library make
sure the third icon from the left is

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.230
selected, the one that looks
like two concentric circles.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.710
You can hide the debug area as
well as the navigator panel

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.480
to give us some more screen
real estate as Iâ€™ve done here.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.670
Before we can drag a button then this
view needs to be at 100% zoomed in.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.800
Double click on the header
here to do that.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.470
Let's start by dragging in a button
to this user interface element.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.200
On the bottom right scroll and
select a button or search for

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.570
it by typing UI button.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.840
Drag the button to the center of the
screen using the two blue bar guidelines

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.060
to center it horizontally and
vertically.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.410
Now we come to the first problem
most beginning iOS developers face.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.840
The background of this button is white.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.900
The UI view behind it is also white.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.529
If you click away,
how can you tell how big the button is?

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.260
One trick that I use is to temporarily
change the background of the button so

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.620
you can easily see how big it is and
where it is on the view.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.900
This is also a great chance for

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.510
you to play around a little bit
with the attributes inspector.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.750
With the button selected,
here on the left,

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.160
click on the attributes inspector and
scroll down until you see background.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.350
Select the drop down and pick a color.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.940
I've chosen bright green color for
the background of this button.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.300
The more visible the better.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.970
You're not going for
aesthetics just yet.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.690
Now we can see our
button is pretty small.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.149
And we can easily see what
would happen if you re-size it.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.430
Double click on the button and
change the text to record.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.810
Go ahead and grab the button and
drag it out, so

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.010
you can see the entire
word being displayed.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.290
While we're at it, here's another tip.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.786
If you had a hard time selecting the
button, you can use the document outline

00:02:34.786 --> 00:02:38.890
view in interface builder part of Xcode
to find the UI button and select it.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.630
That's this view here, on the left.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.330
You can hide and

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.380
show the document outline by clicking
on this button here on the bottom left.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.100
The next step is to set up
the layout for the button.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.910
And for that we've got to talk
briefly about auto layout.
