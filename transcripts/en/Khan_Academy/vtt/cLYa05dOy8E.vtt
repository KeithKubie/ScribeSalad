00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.380
Identify 15 over 8,
or 15/8, as a

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.260
proper or improper fraction.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.330
So proper fraction just means
that the numerator is equal or

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.960
less than, or less than or
equal to the denominator.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.040
So proper fraction, numerator,
the number on top, is less

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.710
than or equal to the
denominator.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.520
In an improper fraction, the
numerator is greater than the

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.490
denominator.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.810
And we see in our example right
here our numerator is

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.290
greater than our denominator,
so we are dealing with an

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.200
improper fraction.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.160
Now, a more interesting question
is what does 15/8

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.945
even represent?

00:00:46.945 --> 00:00:49.410
So let's think about
that a little bit.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.250
We saw in the last couple of
videos that the denominator

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.520
tells you essentially how many
slices of pie there are, I

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.780
guess is one way to
think about it.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.690
So let me draw something
with eight--

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.810
let me divide something.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.780
Maybe we could view this as a
square pizza or a square pie

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.030
of some kind.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.450
So let's say that's
the entire pie.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.750
I'm dividing it into two.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.800
That would divide it into four,
and then to divide it

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.180
into eight, I'd be
just like that.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.080
So this would be
one whole pie.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.890
Now, what does one of these
boxes represent?

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.890
What does that box right
there represent?

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.550
Well, we've seen this
is one of the eight

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.980
total pieces of pie.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.290
So this represents 1/8.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:47.060
Now, if I were to shade in blue
this box and that box

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.120
right there, and I were to say
what fraction of my pie is

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.630
shaded in blue?

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.900
Well, you'd say I have two boxes
shaded in blue: one,

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.860
two, out of a total
of eight boxes.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:12.640
This, these two right here,
are 2/8 of the entire pie.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.740
Or another way to think about
it, this is equal to two of

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.200
these pieces, right?

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.740
So you could say this is also
equal to 2 times 1/8, because

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.970
each of these boxes is 1/8.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:30.960
We saw that right there.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.590
It is one of the total eight
pieces, so two of the eight,

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.560
that's really just two of
these one-eighth boxes.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.400
Now, if everything I've just
said makes sense, let's think

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.100
a about what 15/8 mean.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.090
So if you imagine these
boxes like that,

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.020
let's try to do 15/8.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.970
So if you were to draw, that's
1/8 right there.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.610
I'm going to do it in the same
size as these boxes.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.090
Let me copy and paste this.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.570
So let me copy and then
let me paste.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.980
So then that would be 2/8.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.360
Let me do 3/8 and then 4.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.535
We're going to go all
the way up to 15.

00:03:11.535 --> 00:03:14.010
I hope it doesn't bore you.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:24.540
That is 5, 6, 7, 8, and now
we've made a whole pie, but

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.220
we're only at 8.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.390
We have to get to 15.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.220
So let's keep going.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.590
So then we're going to
start another pie.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.030
So it's 1, 2, 3.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.910
So far, how many do we have?

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:50.190
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.520
So what have I just drawn here
with all these pink squares?

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.990
Each of these is 1/8.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.510
Each of these boxes is 1/8 of
a pie, I guess is how you

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.190
could think about it.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.270
This is 1/8.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:10.950
And I've just drawn 15 times
1/8, so all of these combined

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:17.220
are 15 times 1/8, or we could
say that this is also equal

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.440
to, if we just use the logic
we did before, 15/8.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.700
Now, how many pies
do I have here?

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:31.130
Well, these first 8 of the 15,
this right here, that is 8 out

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.070
of 8, or 8 one-eighths, and
that's equal to one whole pie.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.710
So this right here
is equal to one.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.160
That right there is
equal to one.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.640
And what do we have over here?

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.440
We have one whole pie, 8 out
of 8 pieces of a potential

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.480
pie, or 8 out of 8 one-eighths
of a pie, I guess you could

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.030
call it, and then over here we
have 7/8 of a pie, right?

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.000
You could imagine a whole pie
would involve another grid

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.170
right there, would involve one
more over here, but this is 7

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.260
out of the 8.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.580
So this right here-- let me do
this in another color-- this

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:13.800
piece right here represents
7, 7 times 1/8, or 7/8.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.760
So if you were to say what 15/8
kind of represents, it

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.090
represents one whole pie, and
then 7/8 of another pie.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.990
You can even write that down
as a mixed number.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.020
And it's a mixed number because
it has a whole number

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.780
and a fraction.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:35.100
So this is equal to one whole
pie right there and 7/8 of

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.350
another pie.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.660
And that's all it represents
when you think

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.400
about what 15/8 means.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.170
Now, I had to draw it out like
this, but a quick way you can

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.590
do to solve this is to
divide 8 into 15.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.730
So if you were to take--
let me do this

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:54.690
with the new colors.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.780
So if you were to take that
8 right there, you

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:04.330
divide 8 into 15.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.060
You see that it's equal to--
well, 8 goes into 15 one time,

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.030
because 2 times 8 is 16,
so that's too big.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.290
So 1 times 8 is 8.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:18.650
You subtract 15 minus 8 is 7.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.240
So to get 1 and 7/8, this 1
right here-- so you get one

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.320
whole 8 in there.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.710
If you have 15/8, you get a
whole 8 in there and then you

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.650
have 7 left over, but these are
7/8, so that's where that

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.800
7/8 come from.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.660
You have to write the
remainder over 8.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.680
Hopefully, you found
out helpful.
