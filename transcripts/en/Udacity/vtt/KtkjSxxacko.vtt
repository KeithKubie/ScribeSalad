00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.180
A new lexical scope is created every time you type out a function definition.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.800
The function definition spans from the letter f

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.070
all the way down to this end curly brace.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.060
The two curly braces around the function's body enclosed the area of

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.835
the code where different access rules will apply.

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:22.520
Let's color in all the area between these braces to represent the region that

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.100
will have new rules, and that we would thus consider a different lexical scope.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.220
Once you've made a new lexical scope by defining a function,

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.550
it has a few more limits than the lexical scope around it.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.680
Although you can still access variables from the broader lexical scope

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.230
containing that interlexical scope, and

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.450
you can access variables that get defined inside that inner scope, the variables

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.270
that you find in the inner scope can not be referred to from outside that scope.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.160
Outside these curly braces referring to a variable that

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.770
was local to the inner scope will result in an error.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.570
So, what variables do you think would be available from

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.260
within the body of the new saga function?

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.560
That is to say what variables could you access in between these two

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.390
curly braces.
