Speaker 1:          00:00          Right. Well, I'm going to blow your mind with my technology in this conversation, which I just read an article yesterday that in uh, China face recognition is the thing that's gonna stop your fantasy of everybody just loving each other and going around in China there with face recognition, they're able to recognize and categorize Muslims in the country. There's like this one sector of Muslim in China and they're with all this face recognition that they're seeing, you know, from your phone, from everything. They're starting to catalog the enemy and they're, and they're going to be able to police or sharing information and hotels and everybody and they're all now through this network. No. What type of person just walked into this building and whether they're friendly or they're the enemy and that thing, that face recognition thing is PR could end up splitting us apart even more. Hmm. Oh,

Speaker 2:          00:58          Tommy Tommy with his technological facts here, China's big brother surveillance technology isn't nearly as all seeing as the government wants you to think. This is kind of like a, they might be able to upgrade it though, can't for sure. Yeah. That's one point. Oh, when your phone unlocked with your fingerprint and it blew your mother fucking mind, you're like, bro, it's roots. My Fan Guard. Even worse. My pinkie five fingerprints on this motherfucker. It'd be like I said, as I get to do the side of my thumb and it's still knows she has glasses. The Cop,

Speaker 1:          01:32          what do you mean with that is a cop. It's a cop with Google last, it's got some sort of face recognition thing. It's like that time Tom Cruise movie

Speaker 2:          01:41          minority report. Whoa. Was that real? Yeah. Nope, not Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise is definitely in there. I don't know, but it looks real. That's, you know, I, I try to Google glass on once I actually oh yeah. Through a whole UFC weigh ins wearing Google glass. How was filming it? I guess? Um, ah, it wasn't ready. It wasn't ready and I think that's why they haven't upgraded it. Oh yes, let's hold off because this is not working like it's been a while. It's not new to that Dorky shit and people got super uncomfortable when you around them. It's like holding a camera and everybody walked around with a fucking camera everywhere. I think they'll have something eventually, but I have a feeling it'll be something where there's a technology, like we were the outside. You can't see things from the inside. You can and then they'll show you images like directly in front of you on the Lens.

Speaker 2:          02:34          So like you wear glasses like your glasses, but it'll show you things right, right in front of you, like right. Yeah. I got one that I heard that I don't know if I understand and believe that this is real, but I've just googled it and I found something that makes it seem like it's so the next version of the VR headsets are supposed to have brain tracking in them and that sounds super scary, but it's already like being implemented and tested and get a knock on your door. Are you think about as beating off what is wrong with you, man?

Speaker 2:          03:05          We thought you were a regular person, but you're beaten off a hundred times a week. You imagine if they wanted to have a talk to you like Mr Papa, you watched 14 hours of pornography this week. That seems a lot. Yeah. I think your mother would think that. It seems like a lot. I mean, I don't want to talk to her. Well they say employers are going to do that. Insurance companies are going to do that and they're going to be able to tell them much or beaten or how much you're beating off, how much you're working out, how much you're sleeping, whether and what. Look at that, whether we choose to share only good stuff. That's like Google when they said don't be evil. Yeah, abandon that. Once you start making money, they fucking pain right over that side. Maybe a little evil. What is evil man?

Speaker 2:          03:46          I mean what is evil, evil Schmiegel we're going in that direction. Yeah, man. It's going in that direction. It's all go into some sort of a wearable thing that connects you, but a weird thing that like everywhere you're going and they're picking off your face and then you're going to be able to, they're going to know exactly what you are and who you are and you know, it's a strange, it's strange, but it isn't any more strange than our lives today in comparison to people that lived in 1920 like we were talking about earlier. Yeah. This is way weirder. Weightless, super weird. Way weirder. We're in a weird town already for sure. You just don't, it doesn't get into the hands of people that can really mess with you. Oh yeah. The people at the money put the money and all the control. Yeah. They are going to be cool with it, right? Yeah, that'd be great. That'd be all right. Yeah, that'd be fun. Everything's going to be fine. Do you have a Alexa in your house? All the, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My kids do. My from my one friend is always trying to tell me, just get that out of your house. It's listening to everything that you say and everything that he's doing bad in that room.

Speaker 2:          04:49          It's, I had a question about the neuro link might be coming on soon or whatever. I was thinking about like if, if it got to the point where like say we all got it and then everyone you knew had it and there's like a thousand people that have it. When we hit a oh like a threshold point, we were like, eh, not everybody should have this. We're good at this point right here. How would you ever deny people something like that? The cost. It might be really expensive to know. How would you, I know you can't deny people that won't like say if someone's coming up and they want to try it and everyone else has it, that would, that would create a giant problem. That'd be like if you said that with cell phones too many people have cell phones. We have to stop you no more buying cell phones.

Speaker 2:          05:26          I know. That's why I sort of think like that. There might become a big problem with that. Why? What is, but hold on a second. I don't understand why you think, I just sort of think that if, uh, in the theory that you're really going to let thousands of people have instant access to the world's knowledge at their fingertips, at a, at a thoughts like instant, that becomes too powerful in the wrong hands and the people that might have at first might see the future problems of that. I'm just, I was wondering, I was thinking way too far. Jamie goes high. Yeah. [inaudible] you got high watch superman. She answer. You say it was like, no, that probably won't be a problem or, well, no, I can't stop it though. I don't, that's what I'm wondering. I don't think that anyone can say that. Not going to be a problem. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, what is a problem though? It's going to be something, it's going to be a something, yeah.
