what happens if you don't let forest
fires<00:00:30.060><c> burn</c><00:00:30.449><c> is</c><00:00:30.920><c> that</c>

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
fires burn is that
 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.569 align:start position:0%
fires burn is that
well<00:00:32.640><c> forests</c><00:00:33.239><c> collect</c><00:00:33.630><c> a</c><00:00:33.750><c> lot</c><00:00:33.899><c> of</c><00:00:34.020><c> dry</c>

well forests collect a lot of dry
 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.160 align:start position:0%
well forests collect a lot of dry
branches<00:00:35.579><c> right</c><00:00:35.820><c> because</c><00:00:36.030><c> tree</c><00:00:36.510><c> branches</c><00:00:36.960><c> die</c>

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 align:start position:0%
branches right because tree branches die
 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.030 align:start position:0%
branches right because tree branches die
and<00:00:38.000><c> wood</c><00:00:39.000><c> falls</c><00:00:39.300><c> on</c><00:00:39.570><c> the</c><00:00:39.780><c> forest</c><00:00:40.530><c> floor</c><00:00:40.620><c> and</c>

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
and wood falls on the forest floor and
 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.030 align:start position:0%
and wood falls on the forest floor and
collects<00:00:41.460><c> and</c><00:00:41.820><c> so</c><00:00:42.270><c> the</c><00:00:42.540><c> amount</c><00:00:43.140><c> of</c><00:00:43.350><c> flammable</c>

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
collects and so the amount of flammable
 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.959 align:start position:0%
collects and so the amount of flammable
material<00:00:44.670><c> keeps</c><00:00:44.969><c> increasing</c><00:00:45.239><c> with</c><00:00:45.930><c> time</c><00:00:46.230><c> and</c>

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 align:start position:0%
material keeps increasing with time and
 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.510 align:start position:0%
material keeps increasing with time and
that's<00:00:47.969><c> not</c><00:00:48.149><c> so</c><00:00:48.360><c> bad</c><00:00:48.390><c> if</c><00:00:48.750><c> it's</c><00:00:48.899><c> wet</c><00:00:49.140><c> but</c><00:00:49.739><c> if</c><00:00:49.980><c> the</c>

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's not so bad if it's wet but if the
 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.040 align:start position:0%
that's not so bad if it's wet but if the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 align:start position:0%
amount of flammable material is
 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.049 align:start position:0%
amount of flammable material is
increasing<00:00:52.620><c> and</c><00:00:52.739><c> it</c><00:00:52.860><c> gets</c><00:00:53.070><c> really</c><00:00:53.280><c> dry</c><00:00:53.699><c> and</c>

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 align:start position:0%
increasing and it gets really dry and
 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.389 align:start position:0%
increasing and it gets really dry and
then<00:00:54.809><c> it</c><00:00:54.960><c> burns</c><00:00:55.260><c> then</c><00:00:55.739><c> you</c><00:00:55.980><c> have</c><00:00:56.129><c> a</c><00:00:56.160><c> real</c>

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
then it burns then you have a real
 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.569 align:start position:0%
then it burns then you have a real

and so a little bit of fire at the right
time<00:01:19.680><c> can</c><00:01:20.520><c> stop</c><00:01:20.820><c> everything</c><00:01:21.180><c> from</c><00:01:21.390><c> burning</c><00:01:21.869><c> to</c>

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 align:start position:0%
time can stop everything from burning to
 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
time can stop everything from burning to
