00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.730
- [Narrator] In this
video we're gonna talk

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.200
about balance sheets, and in
particular, balance sheets

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.400
for banks in a fractional
reserve lending system.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.840
Now, it's not just banks
that have balance sheets.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.700
All corporations have a balance sheet.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.620
You can even have your own
individual balance sheet.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.880
That is a snap shot of,
what do you have of value

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.690
and what do you owe to other people?

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.120
Now the things that you have of value,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.180
if we're talking about a bank,

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.680
the things that the bank has of value,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.320
those are called assets.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.050
And that could be cash that
the bank has in it's vaults.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.490
It might be property that the bank owns.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.540
And the things that the bank owes

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.713
to other people are liabilities.

00:00:42.826 --> 00:00:45.310
Liabilities.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.260
And, this might be money that
the bank owes to someone else,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.040
some future obligation.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.733
Now there's this other notion of equity.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.670
And when we're talking
about a corporation,

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.170
like a bank, equity is what's left over.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.180
If you take your assets and
you subtract your liabilities

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.480
equity is, you could
view it as the net worth.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.530
How much net value is
owned by the shareholders.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.550
And to make this tangible
you can look at an analogy

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.260
to your everyday life.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.450
If you're thinking about your
own personal balance sheet,

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.090
let's say the only asset
you owned was a car

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.477
that was worth $10,000.

00:01:22.477 --> 00:01:24.680
$10,000 car.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.340
So that is your asset.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.140
And let's say that you
only have one liability.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.610
You had to borrow $8,000 in order to buy

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.380
that $10,000 car.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.440
So this is something that
you owed to other folks,

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.110
so that is your liability.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.300
What would be your equity here?

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.960
What would be your net worth?

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.480
Well, if you own something worth $10,000,

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.230
if all of your assets are 10 thousand,

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.118
but you owe eight thousand,
what you have left over

00:01:49.118 --> 00:01:52.700
that's going to be $2,000.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.310
And so this would be your
equity, in every language,

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.280
as often times the net worth.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.710
And so assets minus
liabilities is equal to equity.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.880
Or, if you add liabilities
to both sides of that

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.740
you could say that assets are equal

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.740
to liabilities plus, plus equity.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.100
And so when you see many balance sheets

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.520
it's typical to see it in two columns.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.990
On the left hand side you have assets,

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.600
and on the right hand side you
have liabilities plus equity.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.990
And these two things should
add up to the same amount.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.720
So whatever assets are,
liabilities plus equity

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.710
should add up to that same amount.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.670
So now let's use this framework
to start ourselves a bank.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.180
And so, let's say we immediately
go and buy a building

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.200
and some equipment
worth a million dollars.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.160
Just to even have a place to run the bank.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.260
And so, we immediately
have assets of building,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.260
building plus equipment, plus
equipment, of $1,000,000.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.120
Now I just said, whatever
our total assets are,

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.560
that would be our
liabilities plus our equity.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.160
So in this situation what
are our liabilities so far?

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.110
Remember, the balance
sheet gives us a snap shot

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.750
at any moment in time.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.740
Well, so far I don't
owe anything to anyone.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.470
I'll just assume that I
had that million dollars,

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.310
I didn't have to borrow from
anyone to get that million.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.430
So I have zero dollars in liabilities.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.960
And so what would the equity be?

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.810
Pause the video and think about that.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.190
Well, liabilities plus equity
needs to be $1,000,000.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.530
If liabilities is zero, then
our equity is $1,000,000.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.450
So if I'm the owner of
the bank, this tell me

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.817
that the value of what
I own is $1,000,000.

00:03:40.783 --> 00:03:43.270
But as we know, banks don't
exist just to be a building.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.800
They take deposits from people

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.970
and then they make loans to people.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.930
So let's say someone's
walkin' down the street

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.060
and they see our bank and say,
Hey, that looks like a good

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.440
place to deposit their money.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.680
It looks like a safe place,

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.150
maybe they'll get some interest on it.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.550
And so they come and they give

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.620
a million dollar cash deposit.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.400
They have a suitcase with a
million dollars of cash in it.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.483
So how would that be reflected
on this balance sheet?

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.670
Well, it would actually get
categorized as reserves.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.730
Reserves you can view as
the federal reserve notes,

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.590
the cash, that it has on hand.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.430
It could be money that's in it's vault.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.390
It could be an account that
it has with the central bank,

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.110
although that gets a little
bit more sophisticated.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.480
But you can visualize it as it's cash.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.320
One way to simplify it.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.500
And so in this situation your reserves

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.440
are now going to be $1,000,000.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.290
Where did that come from?

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.350
It came from that suitcase of
cash that that person gave.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.670
Now, what happens on the right hand side

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:41.980
of this balance sheet?

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.500
They didn't just give us the money.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.340
At some future point in
time they might withdraw

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.410
some or all of that money.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.960
Our liabilities now,

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.910
so we now have a demand deposit.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.350
Let me write it this way.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.350
Demand deposit for $1,000,000.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.610
And this is a good time
to pause this video

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:03.940
and really understand this

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.840
because this is essential
for understanding banks,

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.180
is that yes, we got that cash,

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.820
but it's offset by a liability.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.320
Because at some point in the future

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.810
we have to give that million dollars back

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.830
to that person who made that deposit.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.630
And they can come on demand.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.257
Now you might be saying,
"All right this is all nice,

00:05:21.257 --> 00:05:23.760
"but how am I, as a bank,
going to make money?"

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.840
And the main way that banks make money

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.140
is by making loans.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.240
But how do they loan out
the money if all of this

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.380
is on demand deposit?

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.400
Well, in a fractional reserve system

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.820
you don't have to keep all
of your demand deposits

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.420
on hand as reserves.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.750
You can actually lend
out a good chunk of it.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.820
And it's dictated by what the
required reserve ratios are.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.360
So let's say in the country we're in,

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.200
or the jurisdiction we're in,
the required reserve ratio,

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.200
so required reserve ratio,
is 10% of demand deposits.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.510
That means that we can, whatever
our demand deposits are,

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.690
we have to keep 10% of that in reserves,

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.110
and then the excess
reserves we can loan out.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.941
And so I can now group my reserves.

00:06:12.941 --> 00:06:15.770
Instead of saying a million
dollars of just total reserves,

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.760
I could sub-categorize
it as required reserves,

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.760
required reserves, and excess reserves.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.800
Now, what do you think are
going to be the required

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.180
and excess reserves in this scenario?

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.440
Pause this video and figure it out.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.470
Well, required and access
are going to add up

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.780
to my total million dollars of reserves.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.230
The required reserves are
10% of my demand deposits.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.550
So I have to keep 10%
of this million dollars,

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.840
which is $100,000, and then the rest

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.450
is excess reserves of $900,000.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.010
And so this model is based on
the idea that statistically,

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.550
especially if these demand deposits

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.180
are coming from many different people,

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.950
it's unlikely that more
than 10% will be withdrawn

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.010
at any moment in time.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.430
And we talk about runs on banks

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.010
where this tends to break down.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.800
And so banks will then
lend out this other 90%

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.160
of the demand deposits, or up
to 90% of the demand deposits,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.250
and they lend them out
to people they think

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.280
are likely to pay the money with interest.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.290
And that interest is how
banks make the money.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.700
And so this bank could say,
Hey I have 900 thousand

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.880
of excess reserves, which
I can use to make loans

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.840
to other people.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.690
And so let's say a
bunch of people come by,

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.550
and they have some good ideas,
and we think that they're

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.860
going to pay us back.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.710
So what we do is, we can
take those excess reserves,

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:36.370
up to $900,000 of them,
and instead of having

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.290
this excess reserves we
can put 'em out as loans.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:44.250
So we can make loans of $900,000.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:45.960
Now one thing that might
be counterintuitive

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.570
to some of you, is say,
wait I'm used to a loan

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.040
being something like a liability.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.687
Here we just said we owed people money,

00:07:51.687 --> 00:07:53.620
and so that was an
obligation to other people.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.390
Why is it an asset here?

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.530
Well, it depends if you are the lender

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.980
or your the person borrowing the money.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.400
Here, as the bank, we're the lender.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.910
The loan is an asset
because someone is going

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.300
to pay us money back in the future.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.010
This has value.

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:10.960
If we owed money to someone else,

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.490
well then that would be a liability.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.420
And so, now notice here, the whole time

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.160
that we were doing this,
the assets were equal

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.150
to the liabilities plus equity.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.700
Assets right now are $2,000,000.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.200
One million, plus 100
thousand, plus 900 thousand.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.090
And our liabilities plus
equity are $2,000,000.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.973
One million in liabilities,
one million in equity.
