00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.890
- [Instructor] In previous videos,

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.510
we have talked about the
idea of price elasticity,

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.070
and it might have been
price elasticity of demand

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.200
or price elasticity of supply.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.700
But in both situations,
we were talking about

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.700
our percent change in quantity

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.733
over our percent change in price.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.100
If we're talking about
price elasticity of demand,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.620
it would be the percent
change in quantity demanded

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.380
over the percent change in price.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.310
And if we're talking about
price elasticity of supply,

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.610
it would be our percent
change in quantity supplied

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.150
over percent change in price.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.130
And as we talked about in many videos,

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.090
this is a way of measuring

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.810
how sensitive is quantity
demanded or supplied

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.220
to a change in price.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.220
What we're going to see
in this video is that

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.950
this is not the only type of elasticity

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.380
that economists will look at.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.560
There are many types of elasticity,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.967
where they want to see

00:00:58.967 --> 00:01:01.360
"How sensitive is one thing to another?"

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.480
For example, you could look at the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.680
percent change,

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.000
percent change

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.420
in labor supply,

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.220
so you could say quantity of labor,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.540
that would be our labor supply,

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.540
divided by our percent change in wages.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.360
I'll just write it out, wages.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.520
And you could view that

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.760
as a percent change in the price of labor.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.747
You might say, "Hey, this
is just a price elasticity

00:01:29.747 --> 00:01:33.730
"of supply being particular
to the labor market."

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:34.830
But you can even see things,

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.450
and we'll have a whole video about this,

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.470
probably my next video that I will make,

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.200
where you could have
the percent change in,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.720
let's say quantity demanded of one good

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.150
divided by, so let me call it good one

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.770
divided by the percent change in price

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.230
of not that good, then we
would have price elasticity,

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.830
but of good two.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.700
And so this is actually,

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.320
thinking about how good one
is a substitute for the other,

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.700
and we'll go into a lot more depth there.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.040
But the focus of this video,

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.360
as you can imagine because
it was already written down

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.470
in a clean font right over here

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.890
is Income Elasticity.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.620
And here, we're gonna think about

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.840
the income elasticity of demand.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.030
And you could imagine what that would be.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.100
This is going to be our percent change

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.840
in quantity demanded,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.913
demanded,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.840
divided by, instead of thinking about

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.520
the percent change in price

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.140
of that good or the service,

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.720
we're going to think
about the percent change,

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.280
change,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.280
in income of the people
who might be in the market

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.770
for that good.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.180
Normally you would expect
that when our percent change

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.890
in income goes up,

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.320
that the same thing would
happen to our percent change

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.850
in quantity demanded.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.220
For example, let's say we're talking about

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.800
the market for vacations,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.230
well, as my income, as most
people's incomes go up,

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.230
they might be able to afford
larger or better vacations.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.900
And that would be a normal good.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.323
This is a situation of a normal good.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.290
Normal good, just as
what you would expect.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.510
But you could actually
have the other way around.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.310
You could imagine a situation

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.890
where even though you have an increase

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.833
in your percent change in income,

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.080
that does not lead to an
increase in your percent change

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.180
in quantity demanded.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.390
In fact, it could lead to a
decrease in the percent change

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.990
in quantity demanded.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.540
Or another way of thinking about it,

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.650
your quantity demanded
could actually go down,

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.680
so you would have a negative,

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.420
a negative percent change right over here.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.420
Now could you image any
situations like that?

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.870
Well, imagine if we're
talking about the market

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.140
for car mechanic services.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.870
As people have more income,

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:05.810
they might be able to afford

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.770
better cars that are more reliable,

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.460
that break down less,

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.010
and then they would have to
go to the car mechanic less.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.060
And so that situation,

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.400
where our demand would actually go down

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.850
when our income goes up,

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.610
or our percent change will become negative

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.240
when we have a positive
percent change income,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.390
that would be, that is
known as an inferior good.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.123
Inferior good.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.470
There's two big things to take away.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.410
One, you don't just have to
think about price elasticity

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.370
of supply or demand,

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.690
there are other types of elasticities.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.690
But just to hit the point
home on income elasticity,

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.823
let's look at a few examples.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.660
We're told: suppose that

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.610
when people's income increases by 20%,

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.270
they buy 10% less fast food.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.500
In this situation, what type
of good would fast food be?

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.300
Pause this video and think about it.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.710
Well, their income is increasing

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.310
but their demand is decreasing.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.880
That's the situation we just talked about.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.598
This is an inferior good.

00:05:10.598 --> 00:05:12.970
Inferior good.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.510
And for kicks, what is
the income elasticity

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.810
of demand right over here, calculate that.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.760
Just remember, our income
elasticity of demand

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.910
is just going to be our percent change

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.180
in quantity demanded divided by

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.590
our percent change, instead of price,

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.970
we're going to say in income.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.160
I'll just write percent change of income,

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.760
which is going to be what?

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.000
Well, we know our
percent change in income.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.960
It went up by 20% in this example,

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.550
and what happened to
our quantity demanded?

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.350
Well, it went down by
10%, so negative 10%.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.200
And so here you have an
income elasticity of demand

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.603
of negative one half, or negative 0.5.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.800
Let's do another example.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.020
Suppose we knew that when

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.210
people's income increased
by 5% in a country,

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.430
the demand for healthcare
increased by 10%.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.320
What kind of good do people

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.940
consider healthcare: Normal or inferior?

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.520
First, calculate the
income elasticity of demand

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.243
for this example, and then
answer these questions.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.980
All right, so first

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.440
we are, our income elasticity of demand.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.440
Let's see, when our
income increases by 5%,

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.880
so we have a 5% increase in income,

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.140
our demand for healthcare
increases by 10%.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.970
Our demand for healthcare
increases by 10%,

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.390
so we get a positive income
elasticity of demand.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.610
And so in general, if
this thing is positive,

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.680
you're dealing with a normal good.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.400
As income goes up,

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.100
then you similarly see
quantity demanded going up.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.683
This is a normal good.
