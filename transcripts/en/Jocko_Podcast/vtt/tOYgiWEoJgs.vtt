1
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.440
Yeah, I hear that.

2
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.890
I'm over 40. I'm pushing 50.

3
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.640
<v 1>Bring it back off. Negative not happening.</v>

4
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.550
In fact, I'm stepping up. Um,

5
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.420
trading harder, eating cleaner. [inaudible] I'm training,

6
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.740
learning and reading and studying more now than I ever have in my whole life.

7
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.910
Do I get dinged up? Of course I did.

8
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.690
[inaudible] factor, no factor. Deal with them.

9
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.750
[inaudible] I hear, I hear the clock ticking.

10
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.923
Best buy here.

11
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.500
[inaudible] waits for no man.

12
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.510
You young guns out there.

13
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.480
<v 0>18 years old, 20 years old, 24 years old. Listen,</v>

14
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.960
<v 1>life goes by</v>

15
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.740
[inaudible] waste those years and don't waste them live.

16
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.070
I know you're going to live to be 30 much less than 40,

17
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.990
but you are and you will

18
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.290
in the earlier you get in the game, the better life you're going to have.

19
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.640
Wealthy you stronger, smarter, better

20
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.070
than 80.

21
00:01:55.071 --> 00:02:00.071
If you put old man like me and you haven't gotten on track yet,

22
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.550
get on track. Get on it. Now here's the deal.

23
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.630
No complacency, no complacency,

24
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.580
no backing off.

25
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.240
No slack whatsoever. Fight.

26
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.690
Fight that ticking clock with every feet. God.

27
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.900
So the end of a hard day.

28
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.510
Put your head down

29
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.530
satisfied.
