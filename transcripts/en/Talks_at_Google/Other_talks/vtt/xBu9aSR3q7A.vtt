00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.542
MALE SPEAKER:
Welcome, Google world.

00:00:04.542 --> 00:00:06.250
My name is [? Sunny Sani, ?]
and I'm here

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.740
to introduce Daniel Shapiro.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.100
Daniel Shapiro is one of
the world's leading experts

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.610
in negotiation and
conflict resolution

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.210
and is founder and director
of the world renowned Harvard

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.540
International
Negotiation Program.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.270
He has appeared on dozens of
radio and television shows

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.382
and has contributed to
the "New York Times,"

00:00:23.382 --> 00:00:27.630
"O, the Oprah Magazine," and
other popular publications.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.500
He is the recipient
of numerous awards,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.830
including the American
Psychological Association's

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.170
Early Career Award
and the Cloke-Millen

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.080
Peacemaker of the Year award.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.226
The World Economic Forum named
him a Young Global Leader.

00:00:40.226 --> 00:00:42.100
And he is here today to
talk about the tenets

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.040
of his new book, "Negotiating
the Nonnegotiable."

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.930
And without further
ado, Daniel Shapiro.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.701
DANIEL SHAPIRO: Thank you.

00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:52.750
Thank you, [? Sunny. ?]
So thank you.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.340
It is great to be here
with all of you today.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.485
So let me start with my
association with Google.

00:01:00.485 --> 00:01:02.610
So I have a few, but let
me tell you the one that's

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.500
most prominent in my mind.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.440
It was probably close
to 10 years back.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.080
I was in those
mountains of Switzerland

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.280
at Davos at the World Economic
Forum's annual meeting.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.840
And the hippest, the coolest
event of the whole time there,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.380
for their annual summit in
January, was the Google party.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.090
And guess who did not get an
invitation to the Google party?

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.740
Loser here.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.025
So some of my friends,
who were a little bit more

00:01:30.025 --> 00:01:32.570
in the circle, said,
we'll sneak you in.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.620
And so somehow I get
shuffled in a backdoor

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.140
into the Google party.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.040
I'm there talking
with Charlie Rose

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.455
and a couple of other people.

00:01:40.455 --> 00:01:42.330
And we start getting
into, so what do you do?

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.350
And I knew Charlie Rose.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.724
I turned to the
person beside me.

00:01:44.724 --> 00:01:45.650
So what do you do?

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.895
And this person says,
I work at Google.

00:01:47.895 --> 00:01:48.720
I said, oh, really?

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.761
What do you do at Google?

00:01:49.761 --> 00:01:52.270
And he says, I founded it.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.165
It was Larry Page.

00:01:53.165 --> 00:01:53.664
Yeah.

00:01:53.664 --> 00:01:55.472
So I went, oh.

00:01:55.472 --> 00:01:57.100
So I'm sneaking into your party.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.970
He goes, yeah, pretty much.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.280
And anyway, the rest of
our time there at Davos,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.670
literally, it was the
most awkward situation.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.300
Somehow, I found myself
sitting directly next to him

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.400
again and again.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.260
And again, I could feel
him going, who is this guy?

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.820
But I enjoyed
meeting your founder.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.490
I'm sure he does not
remember me at all,

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.770
although I very much member him.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.281
So let me start by asking
all of you a question.

00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:21.030
And you know what?

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.290
There are some of you over here.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.540
I'm going to be very annoying.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.260
Would you mind just
coming over this way,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.880
just so we are one happy
family here at Google.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.250
So just a show of
hands-- how many

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.789
of you in the past six
months have-- feel free.

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:39.372
Feel free just to
walk in front of me.

00:02:39.372 --> 00:02:41.140
Yeah.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.900
How many of you in
the past six months

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.120
have experienced an
emotionally-charged conflict?

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.980
Raise your hands.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.280
Yes?

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.220
Yes?

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.720
OK.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.300
Your hand-- OK.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.550
Good.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.070
OK.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.200
So you are human beings.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.050
Good.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.460
Let me ask you
one more question,

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.000
which will seem like
a total non sequitur,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.920
but I believe it is not.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.395
Anybody here know
what a poplar tree is?

00:03:03.395 --> 00:03:04.950
A poplar tree?

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:05.450
Yeah.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.962
So what's a poplar tree, sir?

00:03:07.962 --> 00:03:12.300
AUDIENCE: A tree that has
fairly roundish flowers on it.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.910
DANIEL SHAPIRO: OK, so a tree
with fairly roundish flowers

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:15.410
on it.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.260
I'll have to trust
you on that one.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.100
It's a deciduous tree.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.520
Few of us in this
room would have

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.900
much of any interest in what
is a poplar tree if it weren't

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.180
for the fact that there
was a single poplar

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.840
tree that sat right at that
border between North and South

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.202
Korea.

00:03:30.202 --> 00:03:32.410
And each year, this little
poplar tree would blossom,

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.790
and it would grow.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.490
And as it would grow, it would
block the South Koreans' view

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.150
of the Bridge of No Return, the
conduit between North and South

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.720
Korea.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.854
So each year, out would
march a small team

00:03:44.854 --> 00:03:46.270
of South Korean
soldiers, and they

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.150
would go to trim this tree.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.780
It was a security concern,
and this was fine.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.250
Year after year after year,
until August 6th, 1976,

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.470
when the usual team of South
Korean soldiers, they go out.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.100
They're trimming the tree
for about 10 minutes.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.800
Along comes a lieutenant
from the North Korean side

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.160
with a much larger team
of North Korean soldiers.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.900
The lieutenant from
the North walks up

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.100
the lieutenant from the South.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.910
You try and trim this
tree, we're going to shoot!

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.209
And sorry.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.029
We're going to shoot!

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:22.560
And they literally chase
away the South Korean team.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.410
But this is a security concern.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.350
And it does not stop
the South Koreans

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.339
from trying to trim this tree.

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:30.880
They come back about
two weeks later,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.170
now with a much larger team
of South Korean soldiers, US

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.770
soldiers, and UN
officials, and all

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.350
there for the single
purpose of what?

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.520
Trying to trim this
damn tree, you know?

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.920
And they start trimming once
again for about 10 minutes.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.520
Along comes that
lieutenant from the North,

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.450
this time with a
much, much larger team

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.570
of North Korean soldiers.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:00.060
You try and trim this tree,
we are going to shoot.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.640
This did not stop
the South Koreans

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.750
from trying to trim this tree.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.180
And for those of you who might
remember what happened next,

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.450
this turned into a
bloody, bloody mess.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.020
There were a number
of South Koreans

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.980
who were injured in the
circumstance, two US

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:21.620
Soldiers not just shot--
decapitated, caught on camera,

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.420
broadcast around the world.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.570
I was presenting this
case fairly recently

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.630
in my home
institution in Boston.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.210
And after I was
presenting the case

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.650
to some international military
leaders, some lawyers, business

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.430
people, and so on, I was
walking out of the room.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.770
And this one gentleman
comes chasing after me,

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.570
face as red as you can imagine.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:41.410
Shapiro!

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:41.910
That's me.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.770
Shapiro, I don't
think you understand!

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.720
I don't think you
understand, he says.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.250
I was there.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.690
I was at West Point,
the US military college,

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.110
at that point in time.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.470
He says, I knew those boys.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.450
I knew their families.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.790
He said, we were not
just feeling grief

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.420
at the loss of our soldiers.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.050
He says, we were feeling
utter, utter humiliation

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.690
at the way our boys died.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.220
And surprise, surprise,
this situation

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.020
then reaches the highest
of the high in the United

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.190
States, the White House, where
then-President Ford was faced

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.370
with a very difficult decision.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.655
What do you do?

00:06:22.655 --> 00:06:23.280
What do you do?

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.150
And he turns to
his lead advisor.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.420
And his lead advisor
basically says,

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.880
well, you know what I think
we should do, Mr. President?

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.340
I think we should bomb
the North Koreans.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.340
And the president
thinks about it

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.810
and decides that a more
appropriate strategy

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.920
would be to simply try
to cut down this tree.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.840
So now back to the scene.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.550
On August 21st, 1976,
some two weeks later,

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.930
comes 813 human power, manpower
as they sometimes call it,

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.450
F-4 fighters, F-5 fighters.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.200
They had a 64-man armed
platoon trained in taekwondo.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.840
They had three B-52 bombers
circling around overhead

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.082
with the single purpose of what?

00:07:07.082 --> 00:07:08.290
Trying to cut down this tree.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:09.930
And do they do it?

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:10.840
Yes.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.950
How long does it take?

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.880
About one hour.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.600
Was there further incident?

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.180
No.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.730
But as I was learning about
this story, what struck me most

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:26.080
is that this was literally
almost World War III.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.600
Literally almost World War III.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.183
And over what?

00:07:28.183 --> 00:07:30.160
Over a tree?

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.060
And obviously, it's over much,
much more than just a tree.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.380
But it begs two
fundamental questions

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.860
that connect all of us together,
two basic questions that we're

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.220
going to focus on today.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.090
One, why-- there we go.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:49.160
One, why do we get stuck in
emotionally-charged conflicts?

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.390
And two, how do we get out?

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.340
And, I mean, if you
look at the situation,

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.310
if this were the United
States and Canada

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:01.020
fighting over a tree,
five minutes, it's done.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.740
There's something
strange that happens

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.080
when we get into
emotionally-charged conflicts,

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.750
whether at work or
in the home life

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.130
or in the international realm.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.170
So with that, the more
specific purpose for today

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.540
is twofold-- well,
let me go back one.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.610
Twofold-- it's to present a
framework based upon research

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.630
that I've been conducting
over the past 20 years.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:27.150
Just two modest goals for today
connected to my new book-- one,

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:31.130
how do you guard against
the most fundamental mindset

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:32.770
that traps us in conflict?

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.210
What is that mindset?

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.280
How do you guard against it?

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.720
And second big
purpose of today--

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.650
there tend to be these
emotional forces that pull us

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:46.010
toward adversarial
relations, even when it

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:47.650
doesn't make sense.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.260
What are those forces?

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.900
And how might you try
to deal with them?

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.650
We're not going to go
into the full depth.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:54.450
The book is there.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.908
But for sure, I'm going to give
you some of the basic ideas

00:08:56.908 --> 00:08:58.770
so you have a good
sense of what they are.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:03.040
So before jumping into our talk
formally for the day, quickly,

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.312
where do these ideas come from?

00:09:06.312 --> 00:09:08.020
The ideas I'll be
talking about with you,

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.950
they come from two
different places.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:13.660
One, from laboratory research
that myself and colleagues have

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.430
done, fieldwork,
global field work

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.030
around conflict resolution.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:19.830
My own work has
been with, really,

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.220
a vast variety of
different groups,

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.630
everybody from civil
society organizations,

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.390
grassroots organizations,
families in crisis,

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:33.120
to working with heads of state
and CEOs of major businesses.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.950
And by the way,
I can promise you

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.760
but one thing-- by
the end of our time

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.135
together, although I've had
these various different kinds

00:09:39.135 --> 00:09:41.560
of experiences, my
greatest learning

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.300
has come from negotiating with
three of the hardest bargainers

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.164
that the world has ever seen.

00:09:47.164 --> 00:09:48.830
And you will have to
believe me on this.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.030
It is these guys right here.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.230
And these are my children.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.497
Noah's the oldest, Zachary
second, Liam is the third.

00:09:56.497 --> 00:09:58.080
And you will have
to trust me-- day in

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.730
and day out, they test
every one of these skills.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:04.600
I truly believe that most things
are negotiable except maybe

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.250
with my children.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.950
So anyway, my purpose for
showing you that slide, though,

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:12.610
is to say that, yes, what we
will be talking about today

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:16.810
is relevant in the corporate
context, in the business world.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:18.310
It's just as relevant
whether you're

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:21.990
trying to negotiate with
mom or dad, brother, sister,

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.700
whoever it might be at home,
as well-- romantic partner.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:28.290
So with that, let's
jump into the problem.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.460
The problem is
this-- how should you

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:34.180
resolve an
emotionally-charged conflict?

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:38.400
Now, these conflicts
impose a tremendous cost

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.380
on any organization.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.880
Most people don't even recognize
the extent of the costs

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.790
that conflict brings
to your organization.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:49.030
When you look at the financial
spreadsheets for most

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.840
organizations, you
see, often, one line

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.602
which deals with conflict--
legal fees, litigation.

00:10:56.602 --> 00:10:58.060
And yet at the same
time, there are

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:02.390
all of these hidden costs of
poorly dealing with conflict.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.497
You have all of the
poor decision-making--

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:05.455
what's your first name?

00:11:05.455 --> 00:11:05.860
AUDIENCE: Elad.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:06.500
DANIEL SHAPIRO:
I don't like you.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.293
What is it?

00:11:07.293 --> 00:11:08.040
AUDIENCE: Elad.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:08.600
DANIEL SHAPIRO: Elad?

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.100
OK.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:09.940
I don't like you.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:10.180
OK.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.290
So-- no, I'm just kidding.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.000
But if Elad and I
are working together,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.880
and I don't like Elad,
and he doesn't like me

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.200
for not liking him, all of a
sudden, our decision-making--

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.314
and by the way, you seem
like a nice enough guy.

00:11:20.314 --> 00:11:21.980
But all of a sudden,
our decision-making

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.830
starts to go way down.

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:24.830
I don't consult you.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:26.890
I'm not sharing
information with you.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:30.180
You're not loyal
to me, and so on.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.320
You have the big problem
that many organizations,

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.810
even masterful organizations
like Google, face.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.600
You start to lose
an employee or two.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.486
A star player goes to
one of the competition.

00:11:41.486 --> 00:11:43.650
And you go, ah
what just happened?

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:44.150
Conflict.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:47.840
Conflict If you don't deal
with it well, a huge cost.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.440
You have all of the elements of
a toxic corporate environment.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.090
And I know Google's
a nice place.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.199
I got a sense of it
today over lunch.

00:11:55.199 --> 00:11:57.240
There's a positive feeling,
a positive vibe here.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.030
At the same time, every
organization has conflict.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.440
If you don't deal with it well,
it is tremendously costly.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.850
So why don't we
deal with it well?

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:11.150
In its simplest form, my
sense is we approach conflict

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.120
typically like this picture.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:13.960
We think, OK.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.290
I am right here right now.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.950
Let me rationally try and deal
with this problem with Elad

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:19.190
that I have.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:20.850
Lets talk about our problem.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.160
Let's just problem-solve it.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.100
We are two wonderful
engineers here at Google

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.510
doing our fancy algorithms.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:29.960
Lets apply the algorithm,
and let's solve our problem.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:34.100
And Elad keep his arms crossed,
glares at me like that,

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:38.170
and we have a problem
because this isn't reality.

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.460
With conflict, that
picture is not reality.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.910
My sense of the reality of
the picture is more like this.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:48.320
In reality, there's this
whole set of emotional forces

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.780
that start to pull us
toward adversarialisms.

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.860
We're not listening,
not working things out,

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.870
even when rationally it makes
perfect sense for the two of us

00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:58.800
to work together.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.680
We're on the same project
team with the same goals.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.860
We both can be promoted.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.410
There's no competition.

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.760
And yet we end up in
this odd emotional space,

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.980
sabotaging each other when
it's in a sense sabotaging

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.250
ourselves.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:14.490
What's going on?

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.700
And what I'd like to do
today is to introduce you

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.720
to some of those forces.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.090
You already know them in a way.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:22.128
I'm just putting names
to things that you

00:13:22.128 --> 00:13:25.270
know, so that the next time you
experience them, you can go,

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:25.960
uh-oh.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.870
We're about to go into this.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.670
Now you have power
over that experience,

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:33.870
rather than that thing
having power over you.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.300
So let me start
with the deadliest

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.960
of all of these things.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.860
I call it the tribes effect.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.660
What do I mean by
the tribes effect?

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.590
I mean it's a divisive mindset.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.520
And it could happen
in any situation.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.200
Elad and I might
be best friends.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.880
But the moment we get
into a conflict situation,

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.070
that tribal mindset
starts to sink in.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.280
And all of a sudden-- think
about your own conflicts

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.900
in your own life.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.950
All of a sudden, it
becomes me versus you,

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:07.190
us versus that other
department here at Google.

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:09.550
That's the adversarial mindset.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:13.110
At the same time, I see my
perspective is absolutely

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.850
right and legitimate.

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:19.130
And Elad, I see, was
utterly wrong and crazy.

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:22.010
And the third characteristic
of this tribes effect

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:28.250
is that I will defend to no ends
my position, my perspective.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:31.430
And I'm going to close
my ears to yours.

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:34.320
That is the tribes effect.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.680
That same year that
I met Larry Page,

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.310
awkwardly, something
else happened.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:41.580
I ran a little exercise
there at Davos,

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.860
in those mountains
of Switzerland.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.970
And the exercise is called
the tribes exercise.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:49.260
I've developed it
over much time.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.955
Let me give you just
a bare-bones sense.

00:14:50.955 --> 00:14:52.830
So we had a room that
was not much difference

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:54.490
in size to this room.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:55.970
No windows, though.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:00.770
Into the room streamed 45 of the
usual participants of the World

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:02.660
Economic Forum summit.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.000
We had a deputy head
of state, leading CEOs

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.920
of many different organizations.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.350
We had security
experts, presidents

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:13.850
of universities, and on and on
and on and on-- major venture

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:15.057
capitalists.

00:15:15.057 --> 00:15:17.140
They come into the room,
and almost immediately, I

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.690
have them do a little project.

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:22.130
Divide them up randomly
into six different groups

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.090
and say, you now-- and
you know this, Ben.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:24.890
Yes.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:28.810
Ben is a former student and
also experienced this in his own

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:29.565
I believe, yes.

00:15:29.565 --> 00:15:31.440
So we'll have to get
your thoughts afterward.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:36.430
So anyway, we randomly
divided these leaders

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:39.610
into six separate tribes,
what I call tribes.

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.740
I said to them, you
have 50 minutes.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.510
And in the next 50 minutes,
at your own small group,

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.430
you need to create
your own tribes.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:50.142
And all of your-- what are
the values of your tribe?

00:15:50.142 --> 00:15:51.600
What are the beliefs
of your tribe?

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.820
Dress up like your tribe.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:54.700
Gave them balloons.

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.460
Gave them-- so literally,
I have a picture

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:58.810
of the deputy head of state
with a balloon on his head.

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:00.685
You know, it is the most
wonderful blackmail.

00:16:00.685 --> 00:16:02.020
I will never use it.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.540
Anyway, they all do this
for about 50 minutes.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.450
We come back into the room.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:10.030
And now you feel six distinct
tribes with different energies

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:11.450
to each group.

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:14.000
And all of a sudden, the
lights go completely black.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.120
And into the room burst this
intergalactic alien who--

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.340
big eyes, bulging
eyes, big head--

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.460
I am an intergalactic alien.

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.220
I have come to
destroy the Earth.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.710
I will give you one
opportunity to save the world

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:28.980
from complete destruction.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:32.620
You must choose one
of these six tribes

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:35.205
to be the tribe of everybody.

00:16:35.205 --> 00:16:37.550
You'll have three
rounds of negotiation.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:40.080
And if you cannot come to a
decision by the end of three

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:43.115
rounds of negotiation, the
world will be destroyed.

00:16:43.115 --> 00:16:44.490
Ha, ha, ha!

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:45.820
And out floats this alien.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.740
And as ridiculous as this all
sounds, the tension in the room

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:50.800
emerges.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.300
Round one, they cannot
come to agreement.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.450
Round two, the tension builds.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:58.640
Round three, time is ticking,
ticking, ticking, ticking.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.680
Six members in the middle of
the room, each negotiating

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.390
on behalf of their own tribe.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:06.602
By chance, it happened to
be five men, one woman.

00:17:06.602 --> 00:17:08.560
The moment they get to
the center of this room,

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.849
these men start yelling
over one another.

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:12.410
They start yelling
over this woman.

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:15.750
This woman gets so rightly
enraged at the behavior

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.210
of her colleagues,
she literally stands

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.290
on a bar stool--
which is what it was--

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.480
and she yells those lines
I will never forget.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.339
She yells, this is
just another example

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:27.609
of male competitive behavior!

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:29.340
You all come to my tribe!

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.975
One tribe joins hers.

00:17:33.975 --> 00:17:36.230
The others refuse.

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:40.750
And five, four,
three, two, one, boom.

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:44.000
Our world exploded at Davos.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.060
And not only did our world
explode, but our room exploded.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:52.500
I have done this exercise dozens
and dozens and dozens of times

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.100
with MIT Sloan students,
with Harvard students,

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.370
with Chinese diplomats,
with people from Australia,

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.060
from people all across
the Middle East,

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.150
literally around the world.

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:07.100
And but with the
smallest of exceptions,

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:12.190
the world has exploded again
and again and again and again.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:13.600
And it's a metaphor to me.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.387
In the course of
50 minutes-- and I

00:18:15.387 --> 00:18:17.720
have no doubt it would have
happened here today, as nice

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.330
as you all are,
yourself included.

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:21.790
The world would have exploded.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:24.100
And how do I account for that?

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:30.240
In 50 minutes, we can create
an identity so very powerful,

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.010
people are willing to
die for that identity

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:36.630
rather than move toward
saving the world.

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:40.410
You look at our world today,
you see that in reality.

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:43.610
But what happens that
causes people to go there?

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:44.980
The tribes effect.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:49.170
The moment it becomes an us-them
mentality, it's a mindset.

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:53.090
And a mindset is something that
sticks over time, sometimes

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:54.310
over generations.

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:57.420
The moment you get
there, the conflict

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.870
is destined for
explosion or close to it.

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:03.030
And it starts to
feel nonnegotiable.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:06.670
So the question, then,
is what moves you

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:09.580
toward the tribes effect?

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.809
And what I found
through the research

00:19:11.809 --> 00:19:13.850
have been-- let's skip
that for the moment-- have

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:18.270
been five emotional forces
that tend to pull us

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:20.910
toward that us-them thinking.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:24.590
And as I talk about these,
think about your own life.

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:26.880
Think about that
emotionally-charged conflict

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.200
in your own life.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.000
How might these relate to you?

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.395
So the first of these five
lures is what I call vertigo.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.120
Think about the
last time you really

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:43.340
got into a tough conflict,
how you got totally consumed

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.300
in that conflict situation.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.970
You know, you're here at work.

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:48.454
Somebody makes a decision.

00:19:48.454 --> 00:19:49.870
They were supposed
to consult you.

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:51.110
They did not consult you.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.750
And all of a sudden,
you can't stop thinking

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.570
about anything other than that.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:59.180
That's vertigo.

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.770
You go home at the
end of the day.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:02.764
You go to see your
friends or your family.

00:20:02.764 --> 00:20:04.430
And yes, they're all
excited to see you,

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:06.380
but you're still thinking
about that person

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:09.570
here at work who
screwed you over.

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:12.700
You are in that warped
state of consciousness

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.100
that I call vertigo.

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.770
Let me give you an example.

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:21.480
There's a former professor
of mine from many years back.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.230
He told a story-- this was in
my undergraduate, my first year

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:25.620
of undergraduate school.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.470
There was this eccentric
English professor.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.060
And he said one
day, he was shopping

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.670
with his wife for a bedspread.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:35.020
And he says his wife
thought they absolutely

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.670
needed the $500 bedspread.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.210
And he thought this was the
most foolish financial decision

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.030
they could ever make.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:43.950
He says, there we
are in the mall.

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.580
And we start to argue.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:46.560
She argues back.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.390
I argue more.

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:50.620
And so on, he said, until we got
into a really heated conflict

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.810
in that mall.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:58.590
And then he says, but just
for a moment, my eyes averted

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.090
those of my wife.

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:01.600
He said, I saw
there was a circle

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.980
of onlookers watching us fight.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.480
I had not seen it.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.910
And then he says, I
looked down at my watch.

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:11.750
20 minutes had passed.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:13.710
I thought it was five.

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:15.620
This is vertigo.

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:18.590
Time and space warp
when you are in vertigo.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:21.210
You get into that conflict
with your romantic partner,

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:24.140
and all of a sudden, three
years ago on a Tuesday,

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.270
you screwed me over.

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:28.210
That's vertigo.

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:31.820
The past becomes the present,
and the feared future

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:34.550
becomes the inevitable future.

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:38.130
Just as true between
couples as between Israelis

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.580
and Palestinians or others.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:43.370
The big advice-- the next
time you find yourself

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:44.910
in a heated
conflict, and you see

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:50.170
that tornado of vertigo coming
toward you, ask the question,

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:52.750
do I want to go there?

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.050
Do I want-- and
sometimes you might.

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:59.010
But sometimes, it might make
more sense to say, no, I don't.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:00.270
That's vertigo.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:01.870
All still together?

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:02.510
OK, good.

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:05.420
So let us go now to the
second of these lures.

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.580
And before we do, just
a little experiment.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.260
How many of you--
I'll tell you what.

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.250
I'm going to ask all
of you to partner

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:16.481
up with one other person in this
room, somebody you do not know.

00:22:16.481 --> 00:22:18.980
And if all of you could come
over here, please, and join us,

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:20.370
as well, find a partner.

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:21.640
Sit next to that partner.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.120
And if you do not pair up
with somebody, I promise you,

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.480
I will humiliate you.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.893
So find a partner.

00:22:27.893 --> 00:22:28.392
OK?

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.860
This exercise might feel
a little uncomfortable.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.280
The goal is to learn.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:40.540
So what I ask you to do is the
following-- listen carefully,

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:41.170
OK?

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:43.100
So we're going to do
a little exercise.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.890
Now you've paired
up with someone.

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:48.720
So you're going to be sharing
a few things with your partner.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.850
First two things
you will be sharing

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:54.110
from your own experience,
from your own world-- one

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:56.410
with the presidential
elections at play

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:58.440
right now with the campaigns.

00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.845
What's your political leaning?

00:22:59.845 --> 00:23:01.245
Are you a Democrat?

00:23:01.245 --> 00:23:03.220
Are you a Republican?

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.340
An independent?

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.800
And if you're not
from the United States

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.620
as a citizen, if you were,
where would you vote?

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:10.810
Which side?

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:11.650
That's question one.

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:13.320
You'll share that.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:16.800
Question number two--
what's your salary?

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.090
Do we have any human
resource people in here?

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:20.212
OK, good.

00:23:20.212 --> 00:23:21.170
I'm already in trouble.

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:22.040
OK.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.330
Let's pretend you're not here.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:26.460
And I want your honest salary.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.600
I don't want some pretend thing.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.510
So what's your salary
here at Google?

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:35.200
And I'm actually curious, too.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.460
Third-- so the first
two, you share.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.190
The next two, it's your best
guess, in a sense, your idea.

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:44.850
So how attractive do
you think this person

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:47.140
sitting beside you is?

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:48.200
OK?

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:52.050
And we are going to go on
a scale from one to 10.

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:55.120
And just so there are no
hurt feelings, a one is not,

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:55.880
you're ugly.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.430
But a one is, eh.

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:02.340
So, like, you're OK.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:05.370
And a 10 is like, you are, like,
the hottie of the Google world.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:05.870
OK?

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:07.170
It's like, hey, there.

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:08.160
So that's a 10.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.710
Final question-- what
do you think the age

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:12.980
is of this other person?

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:16.610
Precise age, specific numbers.

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:18.650
So what do you think the age is?

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:22.140
And the cool thing about
this exercise is afterward,

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:23.410
they can share their age.

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.965
And you can find out if
you were right or wrong.

00:24:26.965 --> 00:24:27.465
Good.

00:24:27.465 --> 00:24:28.423
So that's the exercise.

00:24:28.423 --> 00:24:30.645
Any questions before
we get started?

00:24:30.645 --> 00:24:31.228
Any questions?

00:24:31.228 --> 00:24:34.160
AUDIENCE: We don't tell them how
attractive we think they are?

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:34.650
DANIEL SHAPIRO: No, no, no, no.

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:35.560
You will tell them.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:40.052
So you will tell your
partner, from one to 10--

00:24:40.052 --> 00:24:41.760
you look like you're
getting excited now.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.380
I love you!

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:49.440
The first Google Talks
marriage that happened.

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.790
I don't know if you're married.

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:52.682
But any other
questions before-- yes?

00:24:52.682 --> 00:24:54.140
AUDIENCE: What if
we don't want to?

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.000
AUDIENCE: I don't think
this is a good idea.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.680
DANIEL SHAPIRO: Whoa, whoa.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.281
Why not?

00:24:58.281 --> 00:24:59.530
AUDIENCE: Is this a good idea?

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:00.750
I'll make it in the
form of a question.

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:02.541
DANIEL SHAPIRO: No,
well, say why you think

00:25:02.541 --> 00:25:03.802
this might not be a good idea.

00:25:03.802 --> 00:25:04.686
AUDIENCE: Because the--

00:25:04.686 --> 00:25:05.570
AUDIENCE: Because this is work.

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:06.530
DANIEL SHAPIRO:
Because this is work?

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:06.990
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.910
DANIEL SHAPIRO: And
you are at work.

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:08.410
This is Google.

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:09.368
This is where you work.

00:25:09.368 --> 00:25:09.960
I see.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.600
Ah, I get the idea of--
we don't really work here.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.405
No, yeah?

00:25:13.405 --> 00:25:16.895
AUDIENCE: I just-- we
don't know anything

00:25:16.895 --> 00:25:18.145
about this person next to you.

00:25:18.145 --> 00:25:20.228
DANIEL SHAPIRO: Well,
that's what makes this cool.

00:25:20.228 --> 00:25:21.990
AUDIENCE: --inapropriate
to express

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:25.237
in a brutally honest way with
someone you have no idea.

00:25:25.237 --> 00:25:27.320
DANIEL SHAPIRO: So, but I
mean, it's just honesty.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:31.550
I mean, there's nothing, is
there-- what's your fear?

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:32.422
AUDIENCE: Offending.

00:25:32.422 --> 00:25:32.860
Offending--

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:33.651
DANIEL SHAPIRO: OK.

00:25:33.651 --> 00:25:37.830
Your fear is off-- oh,
your salary's only that.

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:39.510
So there's a fear of
offending somebody

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:40.260
else in some sort of way.

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:40.940
What were you saying, though?

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:41.970
I think I misunderstood.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:42.439
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:42.439 --> 00:25:43.377
You did misunderstand.

00:25:43.377 --> 00:25:45.722
I said that it's because
we're all kind of co-workers.

00:25:45.722 --> 00:25:48.067
And I don't think
this kind of questions

00:25:48.067 --> 00:25:49.010
is appropriate at all.

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:50.393
DANIEL SHAPIRO: Why?

00:25:50.393 --> 00:25:52.269
AUDIENCE: Because this
is a work environment.

00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:53.059
DANIEL SHAPIRO: OK.

00:25:53.059 --> 00:25:54.350
So it's a work environment.

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:56.808
And so you're saying there are
certain kinds of questions--

00:25:56.808 --> 00:26:00.450
AUDIENCE: You don't need to make
the other person uncomfortable.

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:01.860
You're going to
be uncomfortable.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.080
DANIEL SHAPIRO: Which
question is going

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:03.840
to make them uncomfortable?

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.900
AUDIENCE: Actually,
the two, three, four.

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.275
DANIEL SHAPIRO:
Two, three, four.

00:26:07.275 --> 00:26:08.140
OK.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.890
AUDIENCE: I'm fine
with all the questions.

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:10.810
DANIEL SHAPIRO: You're
fine with all-- OK.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:11.520
Fair enough.

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.260
And others?

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:13.117
What do you think?

00:26:13.117 --> 00:26:13.950
What's your feeling?

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:14.390
Yeah?

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:17.014
AUDIENCE: I actually want to see
how you convince and negotiate

00:26:17.014 --> 00:26:19.400
we to start this conversation.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.410
DANIEL SHAPIRO: OK.

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:21.910
OK.

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.416
AUDIENCE: You see
the pushback, and how

00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:25.820
do you negotiate over it?

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:26.100
DANIEL SHAPIRO: Yes.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.630
And you see the
emotions already.

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:29.570
No, you did not
catch my question.

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:30.940
I don't like these questions.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:32.550
This is not
appropriate for work.

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:35.540
And Shapiro, I hate you.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:36.140
Fair enough.

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:37.080
AUDIENCE: I didn't
say any of that.

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:37.871
DANIEL SHAPIRO: No.

00:26:37.871 --> 00:26:40.016
It was the look.

00:26:40.016 --> 00:26:41.410
AUDIENCE: I haven't
even started.

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:42.368
DANIEL SHAPIRO: No, no.

00:26:42.368 --> 00:26:43.090
Oh, dear.

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:45.220
I will take a step back.

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.760
But notice what you are feeling.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:47.760
And how are you feeling?

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.830
Honestly how are you feeling?

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:49.790
AUDIENCE: Uncomfortable.

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:50.730
DANIEL SHAPIRO: Uncomfortable.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:51.313
Anything else?

00:26:51.313 --> 00:26:52.610
How about back there?

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:55.410
And Glenn is like, I chose the
wrong book-selling experience

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:56.354
here.

00:26:56.354 --> 00:26:57.300
Ah!

00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.160
You know, I am not going
to have you do this.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.327
I will not have you do this.

00:27:01.327 --> 00:27:02.243
AUDIENCE: I knew that.

00:27:02.243 --> 00:27:04.200
DANIEL SHAPIRO: Oh, yeah,
right you knew that.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:04.700
No.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.940
But the purpose for
sharing this with you

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:10.580
is to have you experience
what I call taboos.

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:12.114
So taboos are social--

00:27:12.114 --> 00:27:13.530
AUDIENCE: I have
another question.

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:13.880
DANIEL SHAPIRO: Yes?

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:14.800
AUDIENCE: Do people do it?

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.650
DANIEL SHAPIRO: Do people do it?

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:16.235
You know--

00:27:16.235 --> 00:27:18.560
AUDIENCE: Or is that your
thing, that we'll say no.

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.935
DANIEL SHAPIRO:
Well, no, no, no.

00:27:19.935 --> 00:27:23.060
I'll tell you, I just, as I've
been presenting this new book,

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.352
there's this chapter on taboos.

00:27:24.352 --> 00:27:26.435
And I was like, how do you
make this come to life?

00:27:26.435 --> 00:27:29.210
And literally two nights ago was
the first time I ever did it.

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:31.710
So I don't have a great
database for this.

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:34.650
And this was a group of
very established lawyers

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:35.750
and mediators.

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:39.390
And they all became
very uncomfortable.

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:40.870
And then when I
said, don't worry.

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:43.190
We're not going to do it,
they decided not to do it.

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:45.200
We're then afterwards
at a cocktail reception,

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.840
you know, just
immediately afterwards.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.586
And someone comes up to me and
says, with a French accent,

00:27:49.586 --> 00:27:51.336
somebody came up and
said, (FRENCH ACCENT)

00:27:51.336 --> 00:27:56.380
I just have to let you know, we
are all doing the exercise now.

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:58.302
And then he had trauma, though.

00:27:58.302 --> 00:28:00.510
This particular gentleman
had trauma because he said,

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:01.926
I did not know
what to do, though.

00:28:01.926 --> 00:28:03.150
I was sitting beside a woman.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:04.560
I sort of thought she
was more like a one,

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:05.770
but I didn't know
whether to call her a 10

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:06.800
or to call her an
eight because she might

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.350
think I'm lying with a 10.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:11.090
He was traumatized.

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:14.350
So I would dare not have you
do it, although afterwards,

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:17.180
if you want to do it, it's
not my responsibility.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:17.840
It's yours.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.000
OK.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:19.770
No.

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:21.392
But this is taboos.

00:28:21.392 --> 00:28:22.100
And you're right.

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:25.630
This feels inappropriate
to talk about these issues.

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:28.480
And the challenge
is what happens

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.420
when you are in a
conflict situation,

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:35.110
and the issues that are
the core issues at play

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:37.610
feel taboo to talk about?

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:39.230
How do you talk
about those issues?

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:41.960
And every organization has them.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.160
Don't criticize the boss.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.720
Or at home, don't talk
about Mom's drinking.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.470
Well, if it's driving
the dysfunction

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.690
and you don't talk about it, you
are moving toward that tribes

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:53.190
effect.

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:54.930
There's a division
happening, and it's

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:57.110
becoming more and more.

00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:00.000
And yet, if you do talk
about it, as you put it,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.530
it's uncomfortable.

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:02.810
It's scary.

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:04.800
It can feel dangerous.

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.550
And you ultimately
can get punished

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:08.790
for talking about the issues.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.100
This is taboos.

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.030
And so in a sense,
there are certain issues

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.820
that you should be talking
about in an organization

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.139
that you might not be.

00:29:16.139 --> 00:29:17.930
And then there are
others that you probably

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:21.500
shouldn't be talking about that
sometimes people do talk about.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:24.405
Suddenly, I start
criticizing, oh, your child.

00:29:24.405 --> 00:29:26.590
Oy, oy, oy, you have
a difficult child.

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:28.350
And you say, excuse me?

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:30.250
Might be taboo to
talk about that.

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:32.320
But that's taboos.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.810
The idea here is become aware
of these underlying forces

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:40.570
that create a wall between
you and the other side.

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:41.570
And what do you do then?

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:44.090
In the book, I talk more
explicitly about this.

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:48.521
But you have a whole range of
choices for what you can do.

00:29:48.521 --> 00:29:49.770
I'll give you a quick example.

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:51.230
The details are
there in the book.

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:55.630
But a number of years back,
in Charm el-Cheikh, Egypt,

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:59.090
I had organized a
program with Israelis

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:02.310
and Palestinian leadership,
others from the region.

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:04.410
And Tony Blair was
there and others,

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:07.200
when he was the
head of the Quartet.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.030
How do you deal
with taboos that are

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:13.360
just dead center at the heart
of the Israeli-Palestinian

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.470
conflict and yet
everybody's scared to death

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:18.570
to talk about them?

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:20.440
What do you do in
that situation, when

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:24.050
the essence of what you need to
talk about, by talking about it

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:26.380
will result in
substantial punishment,

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:30.030
not even by the other
side, but by your own side?

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:32.040
You're disloyal to my side.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.870
You are a traitor to my side by
even talking to the other side.

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:37.860
It's taboo.

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:40.480
But how in the world can
you ever resolve a conflict

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:44.570
if it's taboo to even
talk to the other side?

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:46.910
That's taboos.

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:49.050
Let's move on to the
third of these five

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:51.520
lures of the tribal mind.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.100
This is what Sigmund
Freud initially coined

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.720
as the repetition compulsion.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:00.300
And this is the
notion that we all

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:04.200
tend to repeat the same
dysfunctional patterns

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.960
of behavior again and again
and again and again in some

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.950
of our relationships.

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:12.900
And this is part of the reason
why someone can go and take

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:17.800
a great course on negotiation
or read a useful self-help book.

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.690
And they say, I am a
transformed person.

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:21.120
You come back to Google.

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.810
And for a week and a
half, you are transformed.

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:28.650
But then two weeks later, three
weeks later, all of a sudden,

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:31.470
you're back to your
same old patterns.

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:34.210
That is be repetition
compulsion.

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:36.800
And the trick with the
repetition-- the goal

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.350
is to try to break out of it.

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:40.000
If you do something
dysfunctional--

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.840
you're constantly
confrontational with somebody

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:46.500
when you shouldn't be, you
constantly avoid a conversation

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.910
when you probably shouldn't.

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:52.570
The challenge to breaking out
of this repetition compulsion

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:56.500
is that it feels utterly
unnatural to do it.

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.615
It feels not like
part of who you are.

00:31:59.615 --> 00:32:00.740
Let me give you an example.

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:04.930
I have a very close friend
who for more than 25 years

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:07.850
has been living in and
suffering through an emotionally

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:10.130
abusive relationship.

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:13.410
And finally, a month
ago-- literally a month

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:16.070
ago-- she broke out
of this relationship.

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:18.670
She goes to Washington,
DC and lives

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:21.364
with some friends of mine.

00:32:21.364 --> 00:32:22.030
And she's there.

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:24.020
And what happens
every single day?

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:25.410
Now, she's safe now.

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:27.030
She's moving forward.

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:29.230
She has a new relationship
that's emerging.

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:32.940
And yet what do you think
she does every single day?

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.020
She obsesses.

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.010
Should I go back?

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:35.970
Should I go back?

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:36.850
Should I go back?

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:39.615
And you know that
this is not healthy.

00:32:39.615 --> 00:32:40.990
It's not good for
her well-being.

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:43.150
And yet every single
day-- and I regret

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:47.770
to inform you that about
a week ago, she went back.

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:50.330
This is the
repetition compulsion.

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:52.810
Now, did she learn and
grow through that process?

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:54.380
Absolutely.

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.770
But it's extremely
difficult to break out

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:58.270
of that repetition compulsion.

00:32:58.270 --> 00:32:59.540
It's possible.

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:01.710
But it is another reason
why our conflicts often

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:05.042
feel so nonnegotiable.

00:33:05.042 --> 00:33:06.970
Let's move on to
the fourth of the--

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:09.190
and I'll skip this
next part here.

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:12.470
Let's move on to the
fourth of these five lures.

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:17.190
This is what I call an
assault on the sacred.

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:20.050
We all have things that are
personally, deeply meaningful

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:21.354
to us.

00:33:21.354 --> 00:33:23.270
And if you feel that I
have offended something

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:25.810
that is deeply
meaningful to you,

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:29.330
it can feel like an attack,
an assault on who you are

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:30.610
and what you stand for.

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:34.000
And the moment that I
attack that part of you,

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.750
whether elements of your gender,
your race, your ethnicity,

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:40.605
your family, the fact that you
are Google-- and I go, Google.

00:33:40.605 --> 00:33:42.900
Whatever.

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:44.740
And I will give you
a real-life example

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.900
that happened just yesterday.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:50.780
So I was at Microsoft
yesterday in Seattle.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:53.060
And it's about a third of
the way through the talk.

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:59.190
And I accidentally called the
people at Microsoft Google.

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:00.940
And I was like a third
of the way through.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:02.731
I said the Goo-- and
I went, no you didn't.

00:34:02.731 --> 00:34:04.244
And yes I did.

00:34:04.244 --> 00:34:05.910
And half the group
went, no, you didn't.

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:07.610
And I went, yes, I did.

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:09.409
This was an assault
on the sacred.

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:11.370
Now, some came up to
me afterward and said,

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:12.630
I didn't really care at all.

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:14.453
I just felt empathic for you.

00:34:14.453 --> 00:34:15.400
Faux pas.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.730
And I went, yeah.

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:20.600
But for some in the group, this
was an assault on the sacred.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.570
Your identity starts
to get connected,

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:25.215
whether it's here at Google
or there at Microsoft.

00:34:25.215 --> 00:34:27.340
And the moment I say, oh,
you're a great group here

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:29.131
at Microsoft, you say,
we're not Microsoft.

00:34:29.131 --> 00:34:31.260
We're Google.

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:32.810
That's an attack.

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:35.190
So in other words, the sacred
can be something religious,

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:36.840
but it doesn't have to be.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:41.560
It can be anything that we hold
deeply, personally meaningful.

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:46.889
You spend five months putting
together a major new product

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:49.670
or a part of an algorithm,
whatever it might be.

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:54.290
And you dedicated your heart
and your soul to this thing.

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:55.797
Day and night, you are here.

00:34:55.797 --> 00:34:57.880
You are sleeping on the
little couches over there.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.130
You're eating the wonderful
free food you have here.

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:01.280
But you are doing this.

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.780
You're investing your soul.

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:06.020
And then five months later,
your boss comes along

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:07.914
and says, oh, so
sorry to inform you,

00:35:07.914 --> 00:35:09.830
but we decided we're not
going to move forward

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:10.790
with that after all.

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:15.630
That can feel like an
assault on the sacred.

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:18.280
And all of a sudden, even
the most beautiful boss

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.847
in the world, the most
kind, generous boss,

00:35:20.847 --> 00:35:22.680
it can start to feel
like the tribes effect.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.720
It is me versus you.

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.420
We're not on the same page.

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:28.850
That's that.

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:32.130
And you know what?

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:34.240
Let's think about this
in a real-life example.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:36.850
So part of the work
I do is in working

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:39.050
with hostage
negotiators, working

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:40.670
with crisis negotiators.

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:43.470
And I thought we might
think about an example based

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:45.620
upon a real-life situation.

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:48.070
I did not negotiate in
the real-life situation.

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:50.890
I learned about this situation
through a training program

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:54.020
with the New York Police
Department hostage negotiation

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:54.530
team.

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:56.642
But I thought we'd think
about this together.

00:35:56.642 --> 00:35:58.600
So the basic situation--
first, how many of you

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.450
have been to New York City?

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:02.570
Almost all of you.

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:05.850
How many of you have been to the
subway system in New York City?

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:06.350
OK.

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:09.750
This situation happened
there a number of years back.

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:13.510
There was a gentleman,
about 26 years old.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:17.650
He was clearly suffering from
mental illness-- schizophrenia,

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:19.890
delusions of grandeur.

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:22.370
He had a tendency
toward violence.

00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:25.030
Most people who suffer
from mental illness,

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:28.210
even more extreme forms
of mental illness,

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:29.170
they're not violent.

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:31.370
We see it in the media,
but that's a fiction,

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:32.220
to some degree.

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.470
It doesn't account for the
real statistics of how much

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:37.480
violence occurs, which is very
minimal, with those who are

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.410
suffering from mental illness.

00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:41.190
Anyway, this gentleman's there.

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:43.560
He's sort of wandering
around the subway platform,

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:44.840
just wandering around.

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:47.450
And as he's wandering
around, he sees a woman,

00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:51.630
sees a woman about 20 years old
carrying a baby in her arms.

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:52.630
And he sees this woman.

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:53.630
He runs up to the woman.

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:55.590
He grabs the baby
out of her arms.

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:57.600
He pushes the woman
into the train track,

00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.650
runs off into the
janitor's closet,

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:01.440
locks the door behind him.

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.110
And about five minutes later,
the New York Police Department

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:06.530
hostage negotiation
team, they get there.

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:09.740
And they hear behind the door,
if this child is an angel,

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:10.600
I love this child!

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.660
It's a demon, you know
what I need to do!

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:14.569
If this child is an
angel, I love him!

00:37:14.569 --> 00:37:16.610
This child's a demon, you
know what I need to do!

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:17.485
And bang, bang, bang.

00:37:17.485 --> 00:37:18.620
We're banging on the door.

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:20.990
Open up, open up, open up.

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:23.180
And does our approach work?

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:24.000
What do you think?

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.350
Does our-- yes or no?

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:26.060
Yes or no?

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:26.602
AUDIENCE: No.

00:37:26.602 --> 00:37:27.601
DANIEL SHAPIRO: Come on!

00:37:27.601 --> 00:37:28.270
Yes or no?

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:28.500
AUDIENCE: No!

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.750
DANIEL SHAPIRO: Of course not!

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:31.120
It completely fails to work.

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.690
And why?

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:35.120
What are we failing to
do in this situation?

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:38.060
We are absolutely
failing to appreciate

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:41.000
what this gentleman sees as
sacred in this situation.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.280
We do not know what he
considers as sacred, in fact.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.330
And the situation escalates.

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:48.130
If this child is an
angel, I love him!

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:50.490
This child's a demon, you
know what we have to do!

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:51.990
If this child is
an angel, love him!

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:54.120
This child's a demon, you know--
and what are you gonna say now?

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:54.940
What are you gonna say?

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:55.490
What are you gonna say?

00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:56.680
I'm gonna kill this
child in three seconds

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:57.395
if you don't say something.

00:37:57.395 --> 00:37:57.680
AUDIENCE: Child's an angel.

00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.690
DANIEL SHAPIRO: What
are you gonna say?

00:37:58.690 --> 00:37:59.350
And say it again?

00:37:59.350 --> 00:37:59.970
AUDIENCE: The child's an angel.

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:01.340
DANIEL SHAPIRO: And say it
louder so everybody can hear.

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:02.673
AUDIENCE: This child's an angel!

00:38:02.673 --> 00:38:04.460
DANIEL SHAPIRO: This
child is an angel!

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:07.380
This child is an angel.

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:10.780
We said those precise words on
this other side of the door.

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:12.980
The child is an angel!

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:13.700
And did it work?

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:14.230
What do you think?

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.886
Yes or no?

00:38:14.886 --> 00:38:15.660
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:16.380
DANIEL SHAPIRO: Of course!

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:16.880
Of course!

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.660
Of course-- not, unfortunately.

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:22.310
It does not work because all
of a sudden, this gentleman

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:25.800
on the other side of the
door, he suddenly says, angel!

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:26.444
Angel, angel!

00:38:26.444 --> 00:38:27.110
How do you know?

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:27.850
How do you know?

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:28.600
How do you know this child?

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:29.560
How do you know this
child is an angel?

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.150
You said there were three people
on the other side of the door.

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:33.525
How many people are really on
the other side of the door?

00:38:33.525 --> 00:38:35.690
And all of a sudden,
we had now made

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:38.820
precisely the
opposite error that we

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:41.650
had made but three
minutes ago in this room

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:46.140
and undoubtedly hours in
the real-life situation.

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:50.620
And it all has to do with this
basic concept of appreciation.

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:53.890
Because in a sense, when we're
first banging on the door--

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:55.720
open up, open up,
open up-- how much

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:57.413
appreciation is going on then?

00:38:57.413 --> 00:38:58.380
AUDIENCE: None.

00:38:58.380 --> 00:38:59.400
DANIEL SHAPIRO: Nada.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:38:59.910
Nothing.

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:00.750
Zero.

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:04.340
We are approaching this
situation like interrogators.

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:07.610
You tell me what I need to know!

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:10.430
That approach doesn't work
very well in interrogation,

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:14.710
and it certainly doesn't work
well in hostage negotiation.

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:17.730
But then, three minutes
later in this room right

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:21.780
now, we are way on this
other side of appreciation,

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:27.610
in a sense over-appreciating,
assuming we know more about

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:31.350
what is going on in the
mind of this hostage-taker

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:33.520
than he knows.

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:37.370
And that is a
dangerous place to be.

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:38.870
And, I mean, just
to make this real,

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:41.120
let's say I come home
on a Friday night.

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:44.370
And there, my beautiful wife
is at the door waiting for me.

00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:46.020
And I say, hi, how you doing?

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:51.020
And she says, I have had the
most frustrating day of my life

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:54.990
with your three boys.

00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:59.110
Now, if my response to
my wife is, oh, honey.

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:04.940
I know exactly how frustrated
you are, I'm in trouble.

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:07.570
In a sense, I am
over-appreciating.

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:09.340
I am assuming I
know more about what

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:13.580
is going on in her mind,
her heart than she knows.

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.890
And you'll have to trust me,
that is a dangerous place

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:17.050
to be.

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:17.890
So here we were.

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:20.200
We were stuck in
this negotiation.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.370
Life in the real
situation was on the line.

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:24.280
What do you do?

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.970
And the best advice
I can give you

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:27.450
is the simplest
and most difficult

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:31.410
advice in the
world, two things--

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:36.240
listen, and ask good,
open-ended questions.

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.480
Talk to us.

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.800
What do you want?

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.950
How can we help you?

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:45.580
And once we started asking those
questions, we started to learn.

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:47.900
We started to learn this
gentleman was not crazy,

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:49.260
at least from his perspective.

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:52.090
He was trying to save the world.

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:57.050
Save the world from the
demons, bring in the good guys.

00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:59.460
And once we understood
that, it completely

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:02.370
changed our approach
to the negotiation

00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:04.860
because now we could
say, you know what?

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:05.670
I'm NYPD.

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:07.090
I don't see the angels you see.

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:09.160
I don't see the demons you see.

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:12.140
But I hear you saying you're
trying to save the world.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:12.890
And you know what?

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:14.598
In our own small way,
here at NYPD, we're

00:41:14.598 --> 00:41:16.047
trying to save the world, too.

00:41:16.047 --> 00:41:18.630
Why don't you open up that door
and see if we can try and save

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:21.580
this world together?

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:26.020
And literally
three minutes later

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:30.020
that little door squeaks
open, out walks that gentleman

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:31.700
with baby in arms.

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:34.430
But it is a challenge,
and a real challenge-- how

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:35.690
do you appreciate?

00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:39.100
And how do you appreciate
when your values, your beliefs

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:41.160
feel on the line?

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:44.280
The tendency, if I
attack you, the tendency

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.550
is you're going to defend.

00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:48.820
No, Shapiro, it's your
fault. It's not mine.

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:52.000
The most powerful tool you have
at your disposal here at work,

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.620
at home, any
situation, is the power

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:57.800
to appreciate the other
side's perspective.

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.750
The moment they feel
truly understood, heard,

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:04.300
and valued for
their perspective,

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.350
that's the moment that the
nonnegotiable starts to become

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:10.380
more negotiable, whether
it's these big international

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:14.220
conflicts, hostage situation,
or that annoying colleague here

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:18.090
at work who you just
cannot get along with.

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:19.680
Assault on the sacred.

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.180
The final and fifth of
these, really quickly,

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:26.830
so we have time for questions is
what I call identity politics.

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:28.810
What do I mean by
identity politics?

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:32.750
It is the shaping of identity
for some political purpose.

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:34.710
And you do it every single day.

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:37.880
You may not know you are
doing it, but you're doing it.

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:40.760
The moment you buddy up to
one of your senior authority

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:43.105
figures or leaders
and say, hey, that

00:42:43.105 --> 00:42:44.730
was really fun at
the party last night.

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:46.040
You build the relationship.

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.730
And then an hour
later, you say, and I

00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:49.300
need an extra week's vacation.

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.500
You know?

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.810
That's identity politics.

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:55.140
The danger in a
conflict is that we

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:58.170
tend to create an
identity that's

00:42:58.170 --> 00:42:59.720
what I and some
other researchers

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.390
call a negative identity.

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:05.930
I define myself as against you.

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:08.180
Just watch the
political debates with

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:11.010
the presidential candidates
that have been ongoing.

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:13.400
Each one of them says,
I am not this person.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.510
I am not that person.

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:15.410
I am not this person.

00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:17.516
I am not that person.

00:43:17.516 --> 00:43:20.260
Well, who are you, then?

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:23.440
What is your positive--
what defines who you are,

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.090
not who you are not?

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:26.300
Yes, you're not Microsoft.

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.175
Yes, you're not that.

00:43:27.175 --> 00:43:29.180
But who is Google?

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:32.850
And what are the basic
values, beliefs, rituals

00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:34.210
that define who you are?

00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:36.080
And you absolutely
have them here.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:38.450
As I walked into
Google, you can feel,

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:41.750
there's a vibe, a special
vibe that's in this place.

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:43.930
That's a positive identity.

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:47.042
And when you get into a conflict
with your best friend, don't

00:43:47.042 --> 00:43:49.000
just go, you know, I
don't want to be like you.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.510
That's not helpful.

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:51.410
Here's who I am.

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:53.560
Help me understand
who you are and how

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:57.710
can we, then, work together
to deal with our differences?

00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:00.620
So you put all this together,
you have a little model.

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:02.560
And the basic idea
is that this is

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:06.490
trying to capture the underlying
emotional dynamics that

00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:10.630
bring us into that negative
realm in a conflict situation.

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:14.050
They turn what seems so
rationally easy to resolve

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:16.140
into an emotional mess.

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:18.860
But you can deal with each
one of these five lures.

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:19.870
It's not easy.

00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:21.400
It's not a quick fix.

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:23.730
But its true power.

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:27.270
So with that, big
points are there.

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:30.120
Big points to overcome an
emotionally-charged conflict--

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:33.380
it's not enough to simply try
to look beneath each side's

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:35.822
positions to the underlying
interests or things like that.

00:44:35.822 --> 00:44:36.530
That's important.

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:38.280
That's essential.

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.570
But if you do not deal with
these underlying forces,

00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:42.470
they will suck you
down, and you're

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:44.600
going to end up in that
tribes effect, when

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.850
that's not to your benefit.

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:49.507
So with that, let me just
say a huge thank you.

00:44:49.507 --> 00:44:51.590
I'd love to open it up to
questions, to hear where

00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:54.440
your minds are at right now.

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:54.980
Questions?

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:55.479
Thoughts?

00:44:55.479 --> 00:44:57.500
Criticisms?

00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:01.200
AUDIENCE: The tribes effect can
play in one-on-one conflict,

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:01.720
right?

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:05.487
It's who you think you are
versus who you think they are.

00:45:05.487 --> 00:45:06.320
DANIEL SHAPIRO: Yes.

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:09.190
So the tribes effect-- exactly.

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:13.700
It can be either me versus
you or us versus them.

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.050
It's a divisive mindset.

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:18.720
And the big advice on how to get
out of it-- like what can you

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.140
do in your next conflict?

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:24.840
The simplest advice-- turn that
other person from an adversary

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:26.670
into a partner.

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:28.930
Simple things you can
do-- if you and I are

00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:31.380
in the midst of a
conflict situation, again,

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:34.480
the typical approach is
attack, counterattack.

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.860
Simple tool you
can do, ask advice.

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.200
Look, we've been struggling
through this conflict

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:42.251
for the past three
months here at work.

00:45:42.251 --> 00:45:43.500
I don't think it's helping us.

00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.282
I don't think you
think it's helping us.

00:45:45.282 --> 00:45:48.055
You have any thoughts
on what we could do?

00:45:48.055 --> 00:45:49.430
And you see what's
happening now.

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:52.400
All of a sudden, we've been
battling back and forth.

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:55.570
Now, it's me and you
sitting side by side.

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:57.170
You're not the problem.

00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:58.080
I'm not the problem.

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.450
The problem is here between us.

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:03.590
How are we going
to deal with it.

00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:06.090
That's the way out of the
tribes effect, in a way,

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:06.940
transforming it.

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:07.950
It's not me versus you.

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:12.220
It's the two of us facing
this shared problem.

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:14.780
AUDIENCE: Also about
the tribe effect,

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:18.530
I'm quite interested in
the first example you gave.

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:21.270
You do the experiment
with setting up six tribes

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:23.260
and never get resolved.

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:25.360
No one reached an agreement.

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:28.840
Did you do any
control experiment?

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:34.510
Like if you do not set
up a tribe beforehand,

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:36.130
did they reach
through an agreement?

00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:40.320
Or if after it you do
anything to help them

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.530
to converge to an agreement?

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:43.030
It

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:44.340
DANIEL SHAPIRO: Well,
let me start by saying I

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:45.800
don't see it as an experiment.

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:48.200
I see it as a very
emotionally-compelling,

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:52.820
sensitive classroom
exercise because you really

00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:53.790
can get emotions there.

00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:56.540
And it takes effort
to corral the emotions

00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:58.550
in a productive
direction, ultimately.

00:46:58.550 --> 00:47:01.870
The world has been
saved sometimes.

00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:03.217
The world exploded at MIT?

00:47:03.217 --> 00:47:04.342
AUDIENCE: I don't remember.

00:47:04.342 --> 00:47:07.224
DANIEL SHAPIRO: I think it did.

00:47:07.224 --> 00:47:08.140
Yeah, good.

00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:10.630
I don't remember.

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:13.440
But no, when the
world hasn't exploded,

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.320
it's been striking, as well.

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:17.040
So, for example, at
one point-- and I

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.470
talk about this in the
book-- a colleague and myself

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:23.780
were running an executive
education program at Harvard.

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:26.640
And we had about 60 or
so mid-career executives,

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:29.240
from their 40s to mid-60s or so.

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:34.050
And starting in round one,
this one executive immediately

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:35.960
took leadership control.

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:39.250
He just got up, brought out the
flip-chart paper, got a pen,

00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:40.094
and said, OK.

00:47:40.094 --> 00:47:41.010
What are your beliefs?

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:41.790
What are your values?

00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:42.706
What are your beliefs?

00:47:42.706 --> 00:47:44.740
And just taking total control.

00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:47.780
And by the middle of round
three, he turns to us,

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:51.110
and he says, we've
chosen a tribe.

00:47:51.110 --> 00:47:52.540
I said, really?

00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:54.492
And I remember
whispering to my--

00:47:54.492 --> 00:47:55.700
and all the other groups nod.

00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:57.033
And they said, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47:57.033 --> 00:47:58.180
We've all agreed.

00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:00.360
And I remember whispering
then to my colleague, who

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:02.400
I was co-facilitating
with, and saying, boy.

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:05.860
This is going to be a
very boring debrief.

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:07.770
Because I like when
the world explodes.

00:48:07.770 --> 00:48:12.870
It creates internal tension that
you can learn from and so on.

00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:15.380
I was totally wrong.

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:18.480
I get up in front of the group,
and I ask the very open-ended

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:21.980
question, how you feeling?

00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:26.400
And there was one gentleman
in the back, raises his hand.

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:28.210
And I say, yes, you sir.

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:30.440
He stands up, points
at the gentleman who'd

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:34.600
been taking charge of the
entire negotiation, and he says,

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:43.470
I would rather die than be
in a tribe with that man!

00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:45.540
And then somebody
else then goes, yeah!

00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:47.040
Who gave you the
right to be leader?

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:47.310
Yeah!

00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:49.350
And who gave you the right
to have the microphone?

00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:51.183
And why'd you bring the
flip-chart paper up?

00:48:51.183 --> 00:48:53.421
And voom, you had a
tribes effect in our room.

00:48:53.421 --> 00:48:53.920
You know?

00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:57.410
And just, the room split
into half like Moses

00:48:57.410 --> 00:49:00.880
with that sea, half for
him, half against him.

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:04.510
And it was rough, emotionally,
I mean, to the extent

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:07.930
that after this exercise, this
gentleman-- after everybody

00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:10.030
else left, this gentleman
was still in the room.

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:12.380
Now, this guy was probably,
I'd say, in his early 60s,

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:14.550
a very successful executive.

00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:18.540
He came up to my colleague
and myself literally in tears.

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:21.650
And he said all he was trying
to do was save the world.

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:27.680
And I remember my colleague
had this striking response.

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:32.810
My colleague held a very
high-level political position

00:49:32.810 --> 00:49:35.720
previously and made some
controversial political

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:37.040
decisions.

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:41.320
He turns to him, and he says the
very wise response-- it's true.

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:44.830
Sometimes a leader needs to
make very difficult decisions

00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:47.780
that you know are
right but that may meet

00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:50.370
with negative ramifications.

00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:51.660
So it's challenging.

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:55.090
There's not really a
win in that exercise.

00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:57.610
The only other times that the
world has really been saved

00:49:57.610 --> 00:49:59.290
has when people
haven't ultimately

00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:00.830
engaged in the exercise.

00:50:00.830 --> 00:50:03.460
They're not taking
on that new identity.

00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:05.980
In the Middle East,
for example, once,

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:08.270
as I was doing the
exercise, it just so

00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:11.030
turned out that three of
the four people negotiating

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:14.257
in the middle of the room
were all from the military.

00:50:14.257 --> 00:50:16.840
And no matter how much I would
say, keep your tribal identity,

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.890
tribal identity, tribal
identity, tribal identity,

00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:21.840
they said, no, no, no, no.

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:25.230
That guy ranks superior to me.

00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:28.330
So, I mean, there are
certain tribal identities

00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:32.230
that are emotionally more
weighty than any that you

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:33.800
can construct in a room.

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:35.834
But I look at our
world right now,

00:50:35.834 --> 00:50:37.500
and yes, there are
some beautiful things

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:38.490
about our world.

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:41.820
But our world also has
some messy things about it.

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:46.240
And concepts like
Google, in a sense--

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:49.020
amazing what you are
able to do in our world,

00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:51.330
allowing the information
to move back and forth.

00:50:51.330 --> 00:50:55.040
And yet at the same time,
there's also the danger

00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.700
that you see these
tribes forming

00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:59.580
in the real world,
some positive--

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:01.380
the various
different sub-cliques

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:03.310
and groups on the internet.

00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:05.400
And then you have the
ISISes and the others

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:08.177
who also forming tribes.

00:51:08.177 --> 00:51:09.510
But this is our world right now.

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:12.820
And that's why I think this
book is so timely, in a sense,

00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:15.140
because how do you deal
with these conflicts?

00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:16.720
They're not rational.

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.380
And yet our whole
world right now,

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:20.470
whether it's climate
change or something else,

00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:24.040
is depending upon all
of us, this generation,

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:29.954
to negotiate these, in a sense,
seemingly nonnegotiable issues.

00:51:29.954 --> 00:51:30.620
Other questions?

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:31.654
Yes?

00:51:31.654 --> 00:51:33.320
AUDIENCE: You talked
about how difficult

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.778
it is to address the taboos
that are within an organization

00:51:35.778 --> 00:51:37.130
or between groups.

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:40.840
Do you have strategies for
how to get to that issue

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:42.987
and how to discuss
taboos productively?

00:51:42.987 --> 00:51:43.820
DANIEL SHAPIRO: Yes.

00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:45.194
So in the book,
I talk about what

00:51:45.194 --> 00:51:49.190
I call the ACT framework, A-C-T.
And this is not rocket science.

00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:50.830
It's just a way of
trying to organize

00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:53.210
one's thinking around taboos.

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:56.410
The basic idea is first to just
think through, either alone

00:51:56.410 --> 00:51:59.850
or, as I did in Charm el-Cheikh,
with a small group of people

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:02.122
and a private-- thank you.

00:52:02.122 --> 00:52:04.330
I don't know why we all have
to pause, but thank you!

00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:05.986
OK.

00:52:05.986 --> 00:52:06.860
Awkward to leave now.

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:07.820
OK.

00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:11.020
It is now very taboo to
walk out of this room.

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:11.520
No.

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:15.205
But in the book, I talk about
the ACT framework, A-C-T.

00:52:15.205 --> 00:52:16.580
So the first thing
you want to do

00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:18.990
is to think through,
what are taboos

00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:22.230
that are impeding productivity
within our organization,

00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:24.130
within your family?

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:26.110
And it's sensitive.

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:29.745
One might say, oh,
in our organization,

00:52:29.745 --> 00:52:33.340
we deal effectively
and effortfully

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:36.410
with gender discrimination
or racial discrimination.

00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:37.550
It's often the case.

00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:39.220
And yet, at the
end of the day, you

00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:42.447
see people going at the coffee
houses afterward and saying,

00:52:42.447 --> 00:52:43.030
you know what?

00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:45.270
Things aren't as good
as they could be.

00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:47.420
But it feels taboo to
actually really talk

00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:49.550
about it in the organization.

00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:53.010
So you can get a group together
of trusted people, differing

00:52:53.010 --> 00:52:54.310
views and act.

00:52:54.310 --> 00:52:57.940
Do we want to accept that taboo?

00:52:57.940 --> 00:53:00.470
Two, do we want
to chisel it away?

00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:02.730
Subtly think, what
are some small ways we

00:53:02.730 --> 00:53:05.390
can try and change this taboo?

00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:07.690
Or three, do we want
to just tear it down?

00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:09.920
Do we want to be
Nelson Mandela going,

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:12.380
we will not live in a
segregated society more!

00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:15.970
We are going to tear down
this economic, this political,

00:53:15.970 --> 00:53:17.570
this apartheid wall.

00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:20.034
That's chiselling it down,
and that is precisely

00:53:20.034 --> 00:53:21.450
the set of questions
that we asked

00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:22.930
in Charm el-Cheikh, Egypt.

00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:23.830
What are the pros?

00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:25.530
What are the cons?

00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:29.850
Last point-- taboos aren't
necessarily all bad.

00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:32.090
There are some taboos that
actually are quite good.

00:53:32.090 --> 00:53:34.480
It might be good not
to share salaries.

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.606
That's a useful question
to think through.

00:53:36.606 --> 00:53:39.860
You look at the issue of
violence in our world.

00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:40.910
And I have young kids.

00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:43.090
And every day, I swear,
I get scared to death

00:53:43.090 --> 00:53:44.400
when I say goodbye to them.

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:46.325
Is there going to be
a school shooting?

00:53:46.325 --> 00:53:49.570
And the taboo line
in terms of violence

00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:52.950
has just gone much too far
in the wrong direction.

00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:55.310
What can we as a
global community

00:53:55.310 --> 00:53:59.470
do to shift that taboo back
in a different direction,

00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:01.780
to get students involved,
the alienated students?

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:03.420
Other students to
say, you know what?

00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:04.430
This is unacceptable.

00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:05.730
How can we all work together?

00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:07.690
Not tribes effect,
me versus you.

00:54:07.690 --> 00:54:09.900
But how can we all
work together to try

00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:12.380
and shift that taboo line?

00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:14.330
So taboos, they're complicated.

00:54:14.330 --> 00:54:16.960
But if you don't
deal with them, they

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.660
can cause that crazy dynamic.

00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:23.390
So with that, let me just
say it is a huge, huge honor

00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:25.995
to be here at Google.

00:54:25.995 --> 00:54:28.150
And it's a privilege to
talk with all of you.

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:29.640
Please, keep in touch.

00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:31.057
Tell me-- if you
do have the book,

00:54:31.057 --> 00:54:32.348
tell me what you like about it.

00:54:32.348 --> 00:54:33.510
Tell me what you don't.

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:34.750
That will be the next book.

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:37.234
So honestly, it's
an honor to be here.

00:54:37.234 --> 00:54:38.150
Thank you all so much.

00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.650
Thank you.

00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:41.686
