00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.710
if you say well I'm going to not going
to trust tap water anymore and that's

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720
to trust tap water anymore and that's
 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.390
to trust tap water anymore and that's
foolish because North America your tap

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400
foolish because North America your tap
 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.190
foolish because North America your tap
water is safer than bottled water it's

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200
water is safer than bottled water it's
 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.380
water is safer than bottled water it's
more regulated than bottled water but if

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390
more regulated than bottled water but if
 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.940
more regulated than bottled water but if
you say oh I don't trust it anymore so

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950
you say oh I don't trust it anymore so
 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.319
you say oh I don't trust it anymore so
i'm going to use bottled water then

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329
i'm going to use bottled water then
 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.180
i'm going to use bottled water then
you're then you're basically saying i

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190
you're then you're basically saying i
 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.860
you're then you're basically saying i
don't care what comes out of the tap so

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870
don't care what comes out of the tap so
 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.259
don't care what comes out of the tap so
i'm not going to pay taxes to have the

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269
i'm not going to pay taxes to have the
 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:56.910
i'm not going to pay taxes to have the
infrastructure repaired so that the

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920
infrastructure repaired so that the
 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.500
infrastructure repaired so that the
water coming out of the tap is safe

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510
water coming out of the tap is safe
 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.150
water coming out of the tap is safe
because i don't care because i'm not

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160
because i don't care because i'm not
 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.190
because i don't care because i'm not
drinking that stuff anymore so it's a

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200
drinking that stuff anymore so it's a
 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.380
drinking that stuff anymore so it's a
disconnect from the public tab and the

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390
disconnect from the public tab and the
 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.479
disconnect from the public tab and the
more we disconnect the more some people

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489
more we disconnect the more some people
 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.280
more we disconnect the more some people
will have bottled water they buy and

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290
will have bottled water they buy and
 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.890
will have bottled water they buy and
other people will have a system that may

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900
other people will have a system that may
 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.080
other people will have a system that may
be allowed to deteriorate because those

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090
be allowed to deteriorate because those
 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.970
be allowed to deteriorate because those
people buying bottled water for richer

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980
people buying bottled water for richer
 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.529
people buying bottled water for richer
and probably more powerful don't care

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539
and probably more powerful don't care
 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.390
and probably more powerful don't care
anymore so it's a really vicious cycle

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400
anymore so it's a really vicious cycle
 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.159
anymore so it's a really vicious cycle
we have to care what comes out of the

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169
we have to care what comes out of the
 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.690
we have to care what comes out of the
tap not just for us but for our

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700
tap not just for us but for our
 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.149
tap not just for us but for our
neighbors for people we even don't know

00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:24.159
neighbors for people we even don't know
 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:26.440
neighbors for people we even don't know
because public hell

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450
because public hell
 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.360
because public hell
is connected to public water which is

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370
is connected to public water which is
 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.130
is connected to public water which is
why we got public water in the first

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140
why we got public water in the first
 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.320
why we got public water in the first
place New York had private water at one

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330
place New York had private water at one
 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.060
place New York had private water at one
point and it was such a disaster this

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070
point and it was such a disaster this
 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.190
point and it was such a disaster this
was a century ago it was such a disaster

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200
was a century ago it was such a disaster
 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.140
was a century ago it was such a disaster
that they the government took it over

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150
that they the government took it over
 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.000
that they the government took it over
and said we will run it as a public

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010
and said we will run it as a public
 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.730
and said we will run it as a public
service and the reason was not so

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740
service and the reason was not so
 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.740
service and the reason was not so
altruistic that everybody has the right

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750
altruistic that everybody has the right
 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.990
altruistic that everybody has the right
although some people believed and still

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000
although some people believed and still
 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.300
although some people believed and still
believe that I believe that but it was

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310
believe that I believe that but it was
 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.480
believe that I believe that but it was
also that the only way to fight the

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490
also that the only way to fight the
 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.200
also that the only way to fight the
public diseases was diphtheria and these

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210
public diseases was diphtheria and these
 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.970
public diseases was diphtheria and these
kind of things was with clean water for

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980
kind of things was with clean water for
 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.650
kind of things was with clean water for
everybody and so if you had that

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660
everybody and so if you had that
 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.110
everybody and so if you had that
stability in that health that gave you

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120
stability in that health that gave you
 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.300
stability in that health that gave you
the economic basis to build your

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310
the economic basis to build your
 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.700
the economic basis to build your
resources and to build up a domestic

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710
resources and to build up a domestic
 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.280
resources and to build up a domestic
economy and so clean water was a very

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290
economy and so clean water was a very
 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.560
economy and so clean water was a very
important found a clean public water was

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570
important found a clean public water was
 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.740
important found a clean public water was
an important foundation of our wealth in

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750
an important foundation of our wealth in
 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.900
an important foundation of our wealth in
the north and we need to remember that

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910
the north and we need to remember that
 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.300
the north and we need to remember that
