spent a fair amount of time with

spent a fair amount of time with
 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.980
spent a fair amount of time with
fragments over the years here and

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990
fragments over the years here and
 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.200
fragments over the years here and
hopefully we can go over some

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210
hopefully we can go over some
 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.740
hopefully we can go over some
interesting information here so the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750
interesting information here so the
 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.269
interesting information here so the
first thing that people tend to ask is

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279
first thing that people tend to ask is
 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.670
first thing that people tend to ask is
why fragments there's a lot of

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680
why fragments there's a lot of
 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.109
why fragments there's a lot of

have used the api gotten kind of

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699
have used the api gotten kind of
 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.609
have used the api gotten kind of
familiar with it and in some ways kind

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619
familiar with it and in some ways kind
 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.500
familiar with it and in some ways kind
of gotten bitten by it there's a lot of

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510
of gotten bitten by it there's a lot of
 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.299
of gotten bitten by it there's a lot of
complexity there and in fact some

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309
complexity there and in fact some
 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.590

members of the community have put

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600
members of the community have put
 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.799
members of the community have put
together a few diagrams of just how

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809
together a few diagrams of just how
 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.470

complex the fragment lifecycle can be if

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480
complex the fragment lifecycle can be if
 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.209
complex the fragment lifecycle can be if
you combine it with the full activity

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219
you combine it with the full activity
 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.060
you combine it with the full activity
lifecycle as well so you can start up at

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070
lifecycle as well so you can start up at
 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.170
lifecycle as well so you can start up at
the top here and we keep going and

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180
the top here and we keep going and
 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.150
the top here and we keep going and
there's some more whoo ok well we got to

there and what activities really give

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399
there and what activities really give
 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.800
there and what activities really give
you to start with is just kind of a

these are just turned into callbacks on
 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.140
these are just turned into callbacks on
an object

instead so there were some other goals

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540
instead so there were some other goals

instead so there were some other goals
kind of in the design of activities as

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819
kind of in the design of activities as
 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.880
kind of in the design of activities as
well which one of those is that apps

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890
well which one of those is that apps
 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.199

always stay in the state where you left

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209
always stay in the state where you left
 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.050
always stay in the state where you left
them so in order to do that you have

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060
them so in order to do that you have
 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.460
them so in order to do that you have
this well-defined activity life cycle

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470
this well-defined activity life cycle
 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.890
this well-defined activity life cycle
and a compact state representation that

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900
and a compact state representation that
 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.020
and a compact state representation that
you can use so the process can die come

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030
you can use so the process can die come
 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.420
you can use so the process can die come
back later restore from that state all

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430
back later restore from that state all
 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.530
back later restore from that state all
of this is stuff that you're probably

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540
of this is stuff that you're probably
 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.220
of this is stuff that you're probably
familiar with also apps can call other

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230

apps to complete a task in the form of

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180
apps to complete a task in the form of
 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.330
apps to complete a task in the form of
activity is called with intent and each

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340
activity is called with intent and each
 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.610
activity is called with intent and each
one of those flows is represented as one

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620
one of those flows is represented as one
 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.500
one of those flows is represented as one
of these encapsulated units in the form

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510
of these encapsulated units in the form
 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.129
of these encapsulated units in the form
of these activities so overtime

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139
of these activities so overtime
 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:50.750
of these activities so overtime
activities just started getting big and

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760
activities just started getting big and
 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.990
activities just started getting big and
complex and and basically the way that

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000
complex and and basically the way that
 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.580
complex and and basically the way that
you deal with complexity is that you

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590
you deal with complexity is that you
 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.069
you deal with complexity is that you
factor out smaller pieces so that you

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079
factor out smaller pieces so that you
 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.330
factor out smaller pieces so that you
can compose them back in the pre Android

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340
can compose them back in the pre Android
 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.789
can compose them back in the pre Android

dialer app so each one of these pieces
 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.569
dialer app so each one of these pieces
in each one of these tabs actually

in each one of these tabs actually
 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.080
in each one of these tabs actually
contained a full activity so that kind

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090
contained a full activity so that kind

the activity lifecycle that just really

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790
the activity lifecycle that just really
 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.830
the activity lifecycle that just really
don't make sense of this kind of

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840
don't make sense of this kind of
 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.490
don't make sense of this kind of
composed model and then this happened

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500
composed model and then this happened
 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.259
composed model and then this happened
and we're not going to talk about that

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269
and we're not going to talk about that
 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.530
and we're not going to talk about that
so larger screens happen and larger

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540
so larger screens happen and larger
 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.229
so larger screens happen and larger
screens mean larger problems so we have

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239
screens mean larger problems so we have
 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.119
screens mean larger problems so we have
this idea of how do you want to present

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129
this idea of how do you want to present
 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:45.830
this idea of how do you want to present
these multiple small screens worth of UI

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840
these multiple small screens worth of UI
 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.180
these multiple small screens worth of UI
that you may have already built in an

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190
that you may have already built in an
 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.250
that you may have already built in an
existing application and then sort of

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260
existing application and then sort of
 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.949
existing application and then sort of
scale that out across other screens is

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959
scale that out across other screens is
 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.000
scale that out across other screens is
there sort of a smaller unit of

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010
there sort of a smaller unit of
 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.259
there sort of a smaller unit of
composition that you could use for that

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269
composition that you could use for that
 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.140
composition that you could use for that
and so that other unit of composition

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150
and so that other unit of composition
 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.539
and so that other unit of composition
spoilers is fragments so this was

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549
spoilers is fragments so this was
 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.369
spoilers is fragments so this was
introduced around honeycomb to try to

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379
introduced around honeycomb to try to
 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.729
introduced around honeycomb to try to
solve some of these problems the first

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739
solve some of these problems the first
 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.170
solve some of these problems the first
one of these goals though was really

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180
one of these goals though was really
 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.879
one of these goals though was really
just to break up these giant activity

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889
just to break up these giant activity
 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:09.199
just to break up these giant activity
classes and this is a problem that

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209
classes and this is a problem that
 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.909
classes and this is a problem that
happens whether you're dealing just with

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919
happens whether you're dealing just with
 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:12.680
happens whether you're dealing just with
small phone screens or if you're trying

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690
small phone screens or if you're trying
 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.270
small phone screens or if you're trying
to scale across many different screen

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280
to scale across many different screen
 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.240
to scale across many different screen
sizes and it's just kind of natural that

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250
sizes and it's just kind of natural that
 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.520
sizes and it's just kind of natural that
as app complexity grows so does the

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530
as app complexity grows so does the
 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.800
as app complexity grows so does the
complexity of these kind of big entry

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810
complexity of these kind of big entry
 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.129
complexity of these kind of big entry
points that can kind of

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139
points that can kind of
 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:24.749

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:24.759
to be these God objects if you're not
 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:28.589
to be these God objects if you're not
careful we also kind of wanted to fix

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599
careful we also kind of wanted to fix
 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:29.730
careful we also kind of wanted to fix
some of these problems with local

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740
some of these problems with local
 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.499
some of these problems with local
activity manager for when you do compose

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509
activity manager for when you do compose
 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.929
activity manager for when you do compose
them in these smaller constructs so you

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:33.939
them in these smaller constructs so you
 

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:35.879
them in these smaller constructs so you
have lots of these abstractions at the

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889
have lots of these abstractions at the
 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.029
have lots of these abstractions at the
activity level that just don't work well

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039
activity level that just don't work well
 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.140
activity level that just don't work well
when you start composing it this way

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150
when you start composing it this way
 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.869
when you start composing it this way
these are usually things that aren't

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:41.879
these are usually things that aren't
 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.339
these are usually things that aren't
quite as well covered is like the core

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349
quite as well covered is like the core
 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.320
quite as well covered is like the core
activity state diagram but they're all

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330

cases that still need to be handled in a
 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.260
cases that still need to be handled in a
general-purpose solution one of the

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270
general-purpose solution one of the
 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.459
general-purpose solution one of the
other things that we wanted to do with

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:53.469
other things that we wanted to do with
 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:55.950
other things that we wanted to do with
fragments was to encapsulate navigation

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960
fragments was to encapsulate navigation
 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.899
fragments was to encapsulate navigation
state so the state of your fragments can

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:00.909
state so the state of your fragments can
 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:02.850
state so the state of your fragments can
represent the full state of your

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860
represent the full state of your
 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.309
represent the full state of your
activity in a way that can be preserved

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:05.319
activity in a way that can be preserved
 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.529
activity in a way that can be preserved
through actor through state save and

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539
through actor through state save and
 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:11.010
through actor through state save and
restore through a process death so we

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020
restore through a process death so we
 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.510
restore through a process death so we
have things like an activity local back

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520
have things like an activity local back
 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.240
have things like an activity local back
stack which some people find useful and

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250
stack which some people find useful and
 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.029
stack which some people find useful and
some people don't but managed dialogues

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039
some people don't but managed dialogues
 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:19.110
some people don't but managed dialogues
was one of the other things that this

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120
was one of the other things that this
 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.909
was one of the other things that this
really tried to address dialog fragment

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919
really tried to address dialog fragment
 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.100
really tried to address dialog fragment
is something that a lot of people do use

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110
is something that a lot of people do use
 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.929
is something that a lot of people do use
at this point and it's because you

00:05:24.929 --> 00:05:24.939
at this point and it's because you
 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:26.519
at this point and it's because you
basically get the state restoration for

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:26.529
basically get the state restoration for
 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:28.110
basically get the state restoration for

changes back before fragments this was
 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.480
changes back before fragments this was
handled by just kind of this first-class

where you refer to a dialogue by its ID

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060
where you refer to a dialogue by its ID
 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.059
where you refer to a dialogue by its ID
there's this whole other creation

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:39.069
there's this whole other creation
 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:41.399
there's this whole other creation
process involved in terms of like yes I

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409
process involved in terms of like yes I

want to create the dialogue with this ID

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639
want to create the dialogue with this ID
 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.879
want to create the dialogue with this ID
we would persist that ID and try to

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889
we would persist that ID and try to
 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:46.200
we would persist that ID and try to
build everything back up from scratch

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210
build everything back up from scratch
 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.429
build everything back up from scratch
and that ended up just being very

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:47.439
and that ended up just being very
 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:50.629
and that ended up just being very
one-off and kind of awkward to work with

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639
one-off and kind of awkward to work with
 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:53.850
one-off and kind of awkward to work with
and the final goal that was probably the

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860
and the final goal that was probably the
 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.559
and the final goal that was probably the
most obvious in terms of how we pitched

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:55.569
most obvious in terms of how we pitched

haven't as well and then we also had

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770
haven't as well and then we also had
 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.890

this idea of child fragments so i mean

00:06:59.890 --> 00:06:59.900
this idea of child fragments so i mean
 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.600
this idea of child fragments so i mean
if you can nest one level deep in terms

if you can nest one level deep in terms

of putting fragments inside an activity

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:03.320
of putting fragments inside an activity
 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.900
of putting fragments inside an activity
well why can't you put fragments inside

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:04.910
well why can't you put fragments inside
 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.719
well why can't you put fragments inside
a fragment so that was an idea that had

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:07.729
a fragment so that was an idea that had
 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:10.210
a fragment so that was an idea that had
a lot of support in terms of a lot of

around the jellybean timeframe so how

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.010
around the jellybean timeframe so how
 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.920
around the jellybean timeframe so how
did it work out i mean some of you kind

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:23.930
did it work out i mean some of you kind
 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:24.969
did it work out i mean some of you kind
of already know the answer to this

00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:24.979
of already know the answer to this
 

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:26.560
of already know the answer to this
question but these are sort of what we

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:26.570
question but these are sort of what we
 

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.860
question but these are sort of what we
took as stewards of the api as some of

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:29.870
took as stewards of the api as some of
 

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.750
took as stewards of the api as some of
the lessons from fragments so the first

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:34.760
the lessons from fragments so the first
 

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.330
the lessons from fragments so the first
problem is that fragments are so general

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:37.340
problem is that fragments are so general
 

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.740
problem is that fragments are so general
that they become really difficult to

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:38.750
that they become really difficult to
 

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.290
that they become really difficult to
explain to people so is it just a pain

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:41.300
explain to people so is it just a pain
 

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.980
explain to people so is it just a pain
of a UI like in the gmail example is it

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:44.990
of a UI like in the gmail example is it
 

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.690
of a UI like in the gmail example is it
something like dialog fragments and

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:46.700
something like dialog fragments and
 

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.159
something like dialog fragments and
something that to deal with managed

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:48.169
something that to deal with managed
 

00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:50.350
something that to deal with managed
dialogues or is it something different

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:50.360
dialogues or is it something different
 

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.670
dialogues or is it something different
altogether like you can still have

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680
altogether like you can still have
 

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.140
altogether like you can still have
headless fragments that can act

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:53.150
headless fragments that can act
 

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.940
headless fragments that can act
completely independently of anything

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:54.950
completely independently of anything
 

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.830
completely independently of anything
else and we didn't give a whole lot of

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:56.840
else and we didn't give a whole lot of
 

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.600
else and we didn't give a whole lot of
guidance in terms of how to use these

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:58.610
guidance in terms of how to use these
 

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.659
guidance in terms of how to use these
things because we kind of felt like we

00:08:01.659 --> 00:08:01.669
things because we kind of felt like we
 

00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:03.520
things because we kind of felt like we
didn't want to be too prescriptive about

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:03.530
didn't want to be too prescriptive about
 

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.680
didn't want to be too prescriptive about
it and that ended up really hurting us

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:07.690
 

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.570
so of course the idea of even more

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:10.580
so of course the idea of even more
 

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.940
so of course the idea of even more
lifecycle to manage was really kind of

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:12.950
lifecycle to manage was really kind of
 

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.129
lifecycle to manage was really kind of
the killer here and the bugs really

00:08:15.129 --> 00:08:15.139
the killer here and the bugs really
 

00:08:15.139 --> 00:08:17.290
the killer here and the bugs really
didn't help this is really what killed a

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:17.300
didn't help this is really what killed a
 

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.840
didn't help this is really what killed a
lot of people whenever I've talked to

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:18.850
lot of people whenever I've talked to
 

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.190
lot of people whenever I've talked to
whenever I talk to developers about what

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:21.200
whenever I talk to developers about what
 

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.480
whenever I talk to developers about what
they would change about the fragment API

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:22.490
they would change about the fragment API
 

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.250
they would change about the fragment API
or what problems they have in using the

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:24.260
or what problems they have in using the
 

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.010
or what problems they have in using the
fragment API a lot of times what happens

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:27.020
fragment API a lot of times what happens
 

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.900
fragment API a lot of times what happens
is that you build up a fragment

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:28.910
is that you build up a fragment
 

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.730
is that you build up a fragment
transaction you commit it and then

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:30.740
transaction you commit it and then
 

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.170
transaction you commit it and then
something works completely differently

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:32.180
something works completely differently
 

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:34.149
something works completely differently
from how you expect it's not

00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159
from how you expect it's not
 

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:36.399
from how you expect it's not
particularly intuitive some of these

00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:36.409
particularly intuitive some of these
 

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:39.880
particularly intuitive some of these
things and it might kind of remove the

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:39.890
things and it might kind of remove the
 

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.649
things and it might kind of remove the
entire point of a bunch of code that you

00:08:41.649 --> 00:08:41.659
entire point of a bunch of code that you
 

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:45.480
entire point of a bunch of code that you
just spent a lot of time writing

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:45.490
 

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.550
so this was another thing that caused a

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:47.560
so this was another thing that caused a
 

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.660
so this was another thing that caused a
lot of misconceptions

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:48.670
lot of misconceptions
 

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.370
lot of misconceptions
I mean fragments they're just kind of

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:50.380
I mean fragments they're just kind of
 

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:51.660
I mean fragments they're just kind of
like views right I mean you can stick

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:51.670
like views right I mean you can stick
 

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.160
like views right I mean you can stick
this fragment tag in one of your layout

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:53.170
this fragment tag in one of your layout
 

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.170
this fragment tag in one of your layout
files inflate it and you get a fragment

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:55.180
files inflate it and you get a fragment
 

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:56.820
files inflate it and you get a fragment
for free

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:56.830

in hindsight the fragment tag was this

00:08:59.460 --> 00:08:59.470
in hindsight the fragment tag was this
 

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.320
in hindsight the fragment tag was this
great piece of syntactic sugar that

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:01.330
great piece of syntactic sugar that
 

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.090
great piece of syntactic sugar that
really confused people a lot more than

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:03.100
really confused people a lot more than
 

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.950
really confused people a lot more than
it helps in terms of just general

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:04.960
it helps in terms of just general
 

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.730
it helps in terms of just general
education so this immediately made

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:08.740
education so this immediately made
 

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.130
education so this immediately made
people think that fragment equals view

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:11.140
people think that fragment equals view
 

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.840
people think that fragment equals view
and that this is on the same level of

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:12.850
and that this is on the same level of
 

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:18.750
and that this is on the same level of
abstraction so if we kind of know where

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:18.760
abstraction so if we kind of know where
 

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.390
abstraction so if we kind of know where
things went off the rails then you know

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:21.400
things went off the rails then you know
 

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.650
things went off the rails then you know
how might we start trying to use

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:22.660
how might we start trying to use
 

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:27.440
how might we start trying to use
fragments a little bit more effectively

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:27.450
 

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.760
well the first thing to keep in mind

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:29.770
well the first thing to keep in mind
 

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.610
well the first thing to keep in mind
here is that fragments are roughly

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:32.620
here is that fragments are roughly
 

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.290
here is that fragments are roughly
equivalent to an activity in terms of

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:34.300
equivalent to an activity in terms of
 

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.790
equivalent to an activity in terms of
the level of abstraction that they act

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:35.800
the level of abstraction that they act
 

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.930
the level of abstraction that they act
on there composable entry points and

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:38.940
on there composable entry points and
 

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.190
on there composable entry points and
their lifecycle and inputs are really

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200
their lifecycle and inputs are really
 

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.620
their lifecycle and inputs are really
controlled by their surroundings they

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:43.630
controlled by their surroundings they
 

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.540
controlled by their surroundings they
optionally manage a UI presentation and

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:45.550
optionally manage a UI presentation and
 

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.310
optionally manage a UI presentation and
they're really kind of part of the

of the architectural patterns that you

really not meant to be seriously they're
not just fancy view groups fragments

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:03.430
not just fancy view groups fragments

not just fancy view groups fragments
implement you eyes just by using views

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440
implement you eyes just by using views
 

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.830
implement you eyes just by using views
they compose views they wire things up

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:07.840
they compose views they wire things up
 

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.360
they compose views they wire things up
to views in order to do something more

interesting and this really kind of

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:12.310
interesting and this really kind of
 

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.610
interesting and this really kind of
comes down to a core idea that isn't

comes down to a core idea that isn't
 

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.520
comes down to a core idea that isn't
communicated all that widely that we

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:17.530
communicated all that widely that we
 

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.680
communicated all that widely that we
kind of keep this idea of an abstraction

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:19.690
kind of keep this idea of an abstraction
 

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.630
kind of keep this idea of an abstraction

whereas the views and widgets are

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:27.730
whereas the views and widgets are
 

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:30.120
whereas the views and widgets are
further down the stack and what this

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:30.130
further down the stack and what this
 

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.560
further down the stack and what this
means in practice in terms of the

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:31.570
means in practice in terms of the
 

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.270
means in practice in terms of the
organization of code within the android

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:33.280
organization of code within the android
 

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.790
organization of code within the android
framework is that anything at a higher

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:35.800
framework is that anything at a higher
 

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.950
framework is that anything at a higher
level can import anything from a lower

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:37.960
level can import anything from a lower
 

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.540
level can import anything from a lower
level but not the other way around and

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:39.550
level but not the other way around and
 

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.760

if you go looking through AOSP you'll
 

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:43.110
if you go looking through AOSP you'll
probably find a couple of places where

different fragment that you're showing

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.010
different fragment that you're showing
 

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.850
different fragment that you're showing
if you were drilled into item a versus

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:06.860
if you were drilled into item a versus
 

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.190
if you were drilled into item a versus
drilled into item B in that list and

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:09.200
drilled into item B in that list and
 

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.020
drilled into item B in that list and
that's something that ideally you don't

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:11.030
that's something that ideally you don't
 

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.490
that's something that ideally you don't
want to have to track yourself in terms

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:12.500
want to have to track yourself in terms
 

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:16.090
want to have to track yourself in terms
of other state as it gets restored as

your process dies you come back into it
so on and so forth so that means that

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:22.760
so on and so forth so that means that
 

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.430
so on and so forth so that means that
setup of fragments is conditional and

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:24.440
setup of fragments is conditional and
 

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.510
setup of fragments is conditional and
this is another one of those kind of

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:25.520
this is another one of those kind of
 

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.920
this is another one of those kind of
weird things that everybody sees when

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:26.930
weird things that everybody sees when
 

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.270
weird things that everybody sees when
they first start working with fragments

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:28.280
they first start working with fragments
 

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.430
they first start working with fragments

check here when I'm setting up this
initial state and that's partially

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:33.470
initial state and that's partially

because the fragments are going to be

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:35.660
because the fragments are going to be

now this has historically gotten a

little bit weird in that if you're

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:45.260
little bit weird in that if you're
 

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.650
little bit weird in that if you're
dealing with child fragments when that

kind of dope dived into the fragment

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:00.740
kind of dope dived into the fragment

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:04.200
that giant diagram so how do we just
 

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.900
that giant diagram so how do we just
stop worrying and love the life cycle

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:05.910
stop worrying and love the life cycle
 

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:08.090
stop worrying and love the life cycle
here because every one of these stages

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:08.100
here because every one of these stages
 

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.040
here because every one of these stages
of the life cycle really does represent

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:10.050
of the life cycle really does represent
 

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.650
of the life cycle really does represent
a significant event that can happen to

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:12.660
a significant event that can happen to
 

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.690
a significant event that can happen to
your application and just because we

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:14.700
your application and just because we
 

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:15.920
your application and just because we

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:15.930
have a lot of them there doesn't
 

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:17.240
have a lot of them there doesn't
necessarily mean that you have to care

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:17.250
necessarily mean that you have to care
 

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.160
necessarily mean that you have to care
about all of them all the time a lot of

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:19.170
about all of them all the time a lot of
 

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:20.360
about all of them all the time a lot of
fragments that you'll write will only

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:20.370
fragments that you'll write will only
 

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.280
fragments that you'll write will only
implement a couple of these methods but

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:22.290
implement a couple of these methods but
 

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.110
implement a couple of these methods but
just having all the options there can be

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120
just having all the options there can be
 

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.490
just having all the options there can be
really overwhelming when you're just

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:25.500
really overwhelming when you're just
 

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:29.930
really overwhelming when you're just
looking at documentation so you know

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:29.940
looking at documentation so you know
 

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.180
looking at documentation so you know
that big flowchart like I couldn't tell

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:32.190
that big flowchart like I couldn't tell
 

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:33.890
that big flowchart like I couldn't tell
you everything on that big flowchart at

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:33.900
you everything on that big flowchart at
 

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.440
you everything on that big flowchart at
once off the top of my head either but

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:36.450
once off the top of my head either but
 

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:38.030
once off the top of my head either but
the nice part about this is that you

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040
the nice part about this is that you
 

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.530
the nice part about this is that you
really don't have to hold all of that in

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:39.540
really don't have to hold all of that in
 

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.600
really don't have to hold all of that in
your head at once because even though

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:41.610
your head at once because even though
 

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.420
your head at once because even though
those interactions look very complex

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:43.430
those interactions look very complex
 

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:46.730
those interactions look very complex
really the fragment life cycle is driven

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:46.740
really the fragment life cycle is driven
 

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.650
really the fragment life cycle is driven
by what's essentially a single integer

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:48.660
by what's essentially a single integer
 

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.200
by what's essentially a single integer
value so this is straight out of the

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:51.210
value so this is straight out of the
 

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:54.230
value so this is straight out of the
fragment source code where we have these

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240
fragment source code where we have these
 

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.330
fragment source code where we have these
six states that fragments move between

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:56.340
six states that fragments move between
 

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.490
six states that fragments move between
and the nice thing about these states is

00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:58.500
and the nice thing about these states is
 

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.500
and the nice thing about these states is
that this isn't like a completely

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:00.510
that this isn't like a completely
 

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:02.870
that this isn't like a completely
connected graph of states this is linear

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880
connected graph of states this is linear
 

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.630
connected graph of states this is linear
so when fragments move from one state to

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:05.640
so when fragments move from one state to
 

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.520
so when fragments move from one state to
another they move through all of the

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:07.530
another they move through all of the
 

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.290
another they move through all of the
other states in turn dispatching the

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:09.300
other states in turn dispatching the
 

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.300
other states in turn dispatching the
appropriate methods to the fragment to

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:11.310
appropriate methods to the fragment to
 

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:14.870
appropriate methods to the fragment to
deal with those life cycle events so

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880
deal with those life cycle events so
 

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.220
deal with those life cycle events so
this leads to something really kind of

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:16.230
this leads to something really kind of
 

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.559
this leads to something really kind of
convenient which is that all you need to

00:17:18.559 --> 00:17:18.569
convenient which is that all you need to
 

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:20.840
convenient which is that all you need to
think about is what invariants do I need

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:20.850
think about is what invariants do I need
 

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:23.300
think about is what invariants do I need
to enforce for my new state you can keep

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:23.310
to enforce for my new state you can keep
 

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:25.130
to enforce for my new state you can keep
your thinking very much constrained to

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:25.140
your thinking very much constrained to
 

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.750
your thinking very much constrained to
each one of these individual life cycle

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760
each one of these individual life cycle
 

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.210
each one of these individual life cycle
methods so that you don't have to worry

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:29.220
methods so that you don't have to worry
 

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.520
methods so that you don't have to worry
about the state of the entire

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:30.530
about the state of the entire
 

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.950
about the state of the entire
our application in aggregate when you're

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960
our application in aggregate when you're
 

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.910
our application in aggregate when you're
dealing with this more importantly you

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:36.920
dealing with this more importantly you
 

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.130
dealing with this more importantly you
can say what minimum state will this

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:39.140
can say what minimum state will this
 

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.290
can say what minimum state will this
component be in or what can I count on

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:41.300
component be in or what can I count on
 

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.570
component be in or what can I count on
since again the fragment states are

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:43.580
since again the fragment states are
 

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.490
since again the fragment states are
linear so if you know that you're up all

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:45.500
linear so if you know that you're up all
 

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.960
linear so if you know that you're up all
the way at the resumed state you know

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:46.970
the way at the resumed state you know
 

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:48.130
the way at the resumed state you know
that you've been through all of the

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:48.140
that you've been through all of the
 

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.870
that you've been through all of the
other methods and this is one of those

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:49.880
other methods and this is one of those
 

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.880
other methods and this is one of those
things that kind of seems obvious in

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:51.890
things that kind of seems obvious in
 

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.040
things that kind of seems obvious in
hindsight but again as you're looking

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:54.050
hindsight but again as you're looking
 

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:56.320
hindsight but again as you're looking
through the smorgasbord of methods that

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:56.330
through the smorgasbord of methods that
 

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.830
through the smorgasbord of methods that
you can override on fragment itself

00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840
you can override on fragment itself
 

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.450
you can override on fragment itself
sometimes this kind of gets lost in the

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:01.460
sometimes this kind of gets lost in the
 

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:07.330
sometimes this kind of gets lost in the
noise so let's go ahead and talk about a

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:07.340
noise so let's go ahead and talk about a
 

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.760
noise so let's go ahead and talk about a
few other things talk about one bug fix

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:09.770
few other things talk about one bug fix
 

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:12.610
few other things talk about one bug fix
that was pretty significant which is

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:12.620
that was pretty significant which is
 

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.230
that was pretty significant which is
that the child fragment manager state is

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240
that the child fragment manager state is
 

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.120
that the child fragment manager state is
guaranteed after the super dot on create

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:16.130
guaranteed after the super dot on create
 

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.310
guaranteed after the super dot on create
call now this is subtly different from

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320
call now this is subtly different from
 

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.980
call now this is subtly different from
what I said earlier about restoring

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:20.990
what I said earlier about restoring
 

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:23.140
what I said earlier about restoring
fragments from instance state because

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:23.150
fragments from instance state because
 

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:25.570
fragments from instance state because
there was this really kind of a fun bug

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:25.580
there was this really kind of a fun bug
 

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:27.370
there was this really kind of a fun bug
that happens so how many of you use

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:27.380
that happens so how many of you use
 

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.590
that happens so how many of you use
execute pending transactions for some

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:29.600
execute pending transactions for some
 

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.120
execute pending transactions for some
part of your work with fragments or have

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:31.130
part of your work with fragments or have
 

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.670
part of your work with fragments or have
tried in the past okay keep your hand up

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:33.680
tried in the past okay keep your hand up
 

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.230
tried in the past okay keep your hand up
if you ended up regretting doing that

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:35.240
if you ended up regretting doing that
 

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.780
if you ended up regretting doing that
during a debugging session later okay

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:37.790
during a debugging session later okay
 

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:39.820
during a debugging session later okay
yeah that's a pretty close match for

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:39.830
yeah that's a pretty close match for
 

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.940
yeah that's a pretty close match for
some of that so execute pending

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:42.950
some of that so execute pending
 

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:44.770
some of that so execute pending
transactions is this really handy method

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:44.780
transactions is this really handy method
 

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.840
transactions is this really handy method
on the fragment manager that tells it

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:46.850
on the fragment manager that tells it
 

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:48.550
on the fragment manager that tells it
okay all of those things that you've

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:48.560
okay all of those things that you've
 

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.140
okay all of those things that you've
queued up with fragment transaction

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:50.150
queued up with fragment transaction
 

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:53.800

commit do all of them right now all of
 

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.470
commit do all of them right now all of

them that you've got pending and that's
 

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.970
them that you've got pending and that's
got a couple of kind of interesting

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:57.980
got a couple of kind of interesting
 

00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.380
got a couple of kind of interesting
issues with it that we'll get into in a

00:18:59.380 --> 00:18:59.390
issues with it that we'll get into in a
 

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:02.890
issues with it that we'll get into in a
minute but one of the interesting things

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:02.900
minute but one of the interesting things
 

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.720
minute but one of the interesting things
about that is that you have expectations

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:04.730
about that is that you have expectations
 

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:08.500
about that is that you have expectations
after that call specifically if you've

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:08.510
after that call specifically if you've
 

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:09.970
after that call specifically if you've
committed one or more fragment

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:09.980
committed one or more fragment
 

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.670
committed one or more fragment
transactions before that then you expect

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:12.680
transactions before that then you expect
 

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.920
transactions before that then you expect
those fragments that you've committed in

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:14.930
those fragments that you've committed in
 

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:16.570
those fragments that you've committed in
that transaction to be brought up to a

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:16.580
that transaction to be brought up to a
 

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.010
that transaction to be brought up to a
particular state in the life cycle

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:18.020
particular state in the life cycle
 

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:21.460
particular state in the life cycle
usually matching the container well it

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:21.470
usually matching the container well it
 

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:22.780
usually matching the container well it
turns out that that wasn't actually how

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:22.790
turns out that that wasn't actually how
 

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.730
turns out that that wasn't actually how
things worked some of you probably found

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:24.740
things worked some of you probably found
 

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.310
things worked some of you probably found
this out and this again came down to

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:27.320
this out and this again came down to
 

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.110
this out and this again came down to
this idea of what happens with child

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120
this idea of what happens with child
 

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.420
this idea of what happens with child
fragments you probably noticing a bit of

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:31.430
fragments you probably noticing a bit of
 

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.780
fragments you probably noticing a bit of
a theme here so what would happen

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:34.790
a theme here so what would happen
 

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:38.200
a theme here so what would happen
instead is that the child fragment

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:38.210
instead is that the child fragment
 

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:41.020
instead is that the child fragment
manager itself wouldn't be brought up to

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:41.030
manager itself wouldn't be brought up to
 

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:43.230
manager itself wouldn't be brought up to
the new state until long after

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:43.240
the new state until long after
 

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:47.010
the new state until long after
the parents on create' return so all of

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:47.020
the parents on create' return so all of
 

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.080
the parents on create' return so all of
these invariants that should make it a

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:49.090
these invariants that should make it a
 

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:51.480
these invariants that should make it a
lot more easy to to reason about your

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:51.490
lot more easy to to reason about your
 

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.430
lot more easy to to reason about your
program especially when you're saying

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:53.440
program especially when you're saying
 

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.040
program especially when you're saying
that hey resolve everything right now

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:56.050
that hey resolve everything right now
 

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:57.930
that hey resolve everything right now
execute pending transactions well all

00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:57.940
execute pending transactions well all
 

00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.220
execute pending transactions well all
that just kind of went out the window

00:19:59.220 --> 00:19:59.230
that just kind of went out the window
 

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:00.780
that just kind of went out the window
so that made things a lot more difficult

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:00.790
so that made things a lot more difficult
 

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:04.860
so that made things a lot more difficult
that's now fixed so again you know that

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:04.870
that's now fixed so again you know that
 

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:05.880
that's now fixed so again you know that
you don't have to worry about that after

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:05.890
you don't have to worry about that after
 

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:09.120
you don't have to worry about that after
the call to super dot on create so

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:09.130
the call to super dot on create so
 

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.250
the call to super dot on create so
execute pending transactions had another

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:11.260
execute pending transactions had another
 

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.799
execute pending transactions had another
kind of problem as well which was that

00:20:13.799 --> 00:20:13.809
kind of problem as well which was that
 

00:20:13.809 --> 00:20:16.580
kind of problem as well which was that
it makes everything happen right now and

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:16.590
it makes everything happen right now and
 

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.049
it makes everything happen right now and
the issue with that is that different

00:20:19.049 --> 00:20:19.059
the issue with that is that different
 

00:20:19.059 --> 00:20:20.220
the issue with that is that different
parts of your program might be

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:20.230
parts of your program might be
 

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:22.169
parts of your program might be
committing fragment transactions at

00:20:22.169 --> 00:20:22.179
committing fragment transactions at
 

00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:24.870
committing fragment transactions at
different times so as soon as you say

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880
different times so as soon as you say
 

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.000
different times so as soon as you say
execute pending transaction in one piece

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:27.010
execute pending transaction in one piece
 

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:28.950
execute pending transaction in one piece
you may have just caused a side effect

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960
you may have just caused a side effect
 

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.350
you may have just caused a side effect
that it affects some other library that

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360
that it affects some other library that
 

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.240
that it affects some other library that
you imported that uses fragments and you

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:33.250
you imported that uses fragments and you
 

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.900
you imported that uses fragments and you
didn't even know about it so we went

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:36.910
didn't even know about it so we went
 

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:38.640
didn't even know about it so we went
ahead and we added a commit now a method

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:38.650
ahead and we added a commit now a method
 

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:40.860
ahead and we added a commit now a method
to fragment transaction which basically

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:40.870
to fragment transaction which basically
 

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.570
to fragment transaction which basically
does the same thing but really kind of

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:42.580
does the same thing but really kind of
 

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.490
does the same thing but really kind of
what you wanted instead which is no just

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:44.500
what you wanted instead which is no just
 

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.440
what you wanted instead which is no just
this transaction commit this one right

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:46.450
this transaction commit this one right
 

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:49.470
this transaction commit this one right
now this does have one particular

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:49.480
now this does have one particular
 

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.230
now this does have one particular
limitation which is that you can't deal

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240
limitation which is that you can't deal
 

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.730
limitation which is that you can't deal
with fragments on the back stack if you

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:53.740
with fragments on the back stack if you
 

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.280
with fragments on the back stack if you
use commit now just because if you have

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:56.290
use commit now just because if you have
 

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:58.590
use commit now just because if you have
other fragment transactions pending you

00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:58.600
other fragment transactions pending you
 

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.330
other fragment transactions pending you
don't kind of want to create inversions

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:00.340
don't kind of want to create inversions
 

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.130
don't kind of want to create inversions
in your back stack in terms of when

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:02.140
in your back stack in terms of when
 

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:07.200
in your back stack in terms of when
those really apply we also added a

match the fragment activity and activity
on attach fragment method this is kind

on attach fragment method this is kind
 

00:21:13.809 --> 00:21:15.060
on attach fragment method this is kind
of useful when you want to go ahead and

configure a fragment as it's being
 

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.440
configure a fragment as it's being
attached to its parent if you want to do

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:53.060
so a few other notes that are kind of

so a few other notes that are kind of
 

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:56.150
so a few other notes that are kind of
useful here this is one that some

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:56.160
useful here this is one that some
 

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.100
useful here this is one that some
developers ran into fairly recently as

we fix some other bugs around fragment

00:21:59.690 --> 00:21:59.700
we fix some other bugs around fragment
 

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:04.280
we fix some other bugs around fragment
transitions which is that to obtain the

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:04.290
transitions which is that to obtain the
 

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.830
transitions which is that to obtain the
state of a fragment transition we have

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840
state of a fragment transition we have
 

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.420
state of a fragment transition we have
to interrogate the fragment we have to

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:08.430
to interrogate the fragment we have to
 

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:09.860
to interrogate the fragment we have to
call a method on the fragment to get the

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:09.870
call a method on the fragment to get the
 

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:12.130
call a method on the fragment to get the
transition values and what it should do

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:12.140
transition values and what it should do
 

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:15.170
transition values and what it should do
but in order to make that make sense to

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:15.180
but in order to make that make sense to
 

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.280
but in order to make that make sense to
that fragment we have to bring the

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:16.290
that fragment we have to bring the
 

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:17.750
that fragment we have to bring the
fragment up to the created state before

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760
fragment up to the created state before
 

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.230
fragment up to the created state before
we ask it about the transition so what

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240
we ask it about the transition so what
 

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.080
we ask it about the transition so what
that means in effect is that we have to

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:24.090
that means in effect is that we have to
 

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:25.580
that means in effect is that we have to
bring some fragments up to the created

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:25.590
bring some fragments up to the created
 

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:27.290
bring some fragments up to the created
state before they become fully attached

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:27.300
state before they become fully attached
 

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.240
state before they become fully attached
or before they replace whatever fragment

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:29.250
or before they replace whatever fragment
 

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:32.180
or before they replace whatever fragment
that they were replacing before so this

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:32.190
that they were replacing before so this
 

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:33.560
that they were replacing before so this
is one of those things that's good to be

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:33.570
is one of those things that's good to be
 

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:35.420
is one of those things that's good to be
aware of don't assume that just because

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:35.430

your fragment goes through the attach

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840
your fragment goes through the attach

again this is something that you want to

again this is something that you want to

see people do a lot is that when a

see people do a lot is that when a

see people do a lot is that when a
fragment becomes attached and again just

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:07.620

because you have problems with state

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200

while this ends up being pretty

while this ends up being pretty
convenient it also means that those

chance and really the core issue here is
 

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.610

Diane was trying to get to in her post
over this weekend as well if you have a

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:33.860
over this weekend as well if you have a
 

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:36.460
over this weekend as well if you have a
very long-lived codebase then what was

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:36.470
very long-lived codebase then what was
 

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:38.380
very long-lived codebase then what was
popular and the obvious way that

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:38.390

to that is to try to create standard

00:24:52.899 --> 00:24:52.909
to that is to try to create standard
 

00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:56.080
to that is to try to create standard
smarter components so how many of you

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:56.090
smarter components so how many of you
 

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:58.299
smarter components so how many of you
have taken a look at integration steps

00:24:58.299 --> 00:24:58.309
have taken a look at integration steps
 

00:24:58.309 --> 00:25:00.130
have taken a look at integration steps
for some library for Android and you see

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:00.140
for some library for Android and you see
 

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:01.210
for some library for Android and you see
something that looks kind of like what's

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:01.220

stop I'm pretty sure that some of our

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:08.120
stop I'm pretty sure that some of our
 

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.610

own libraries from Google have these

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:09.620
own libraries from Google have these
 

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.799
own libraries from Google have these
types of instructions as well things

00:25:11.799 --> 00:25:11.809
types of instructions as well things
 

00:25:11.809 --> 00:25:13.240
types of instructions as well things
where you need to call some particular

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:13.250
where you need to call some particular
 

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:14.680
where you need to call some particular
method from some part of your lifecycle

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:14.690
method from some part of your lifecycle
 

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:16.990
method from some part of your lifecycle
and really that just makes these

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:17.000
and really that just makes these
 

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.519
and really that just makes these
integrations really kind of messy so

00:25:21.519 --> 00:25:21.529
integrations really kind of messy so
 

00:25:21.529 --> 00:25:23.590
integrations really kind of messy so
instead of that well we could just have

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600
instead of that well we could just have
 

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.320
instead of that well we could just have
well add this fragment instead and we'll

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:26.330
well add this fragment instead and we'll
 

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:27.880
well add this fragment instead and we'll
go ahead and take care of those extra

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:27.890
go ahead and take care of those extra
 

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:30.279
go ahead and take care of those extra
lifecycle steps and that suddenly makes

00:25:30.279 --> 00:25:30.289
lifecycle steps and that suddenly makes
 

00:25:30.289 --> 00:25:31.810
lifecycle steps and that suddenly makes
that a lot more reusable and a lot less

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:31.820
that a lot more reusable and a lot less
 

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.060
that a lot more reusable and a lot less
error-prone and the nice thing about

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:34.070
error-prone and the nice thing about
 

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:38.200
error-prone and the nice thing about
this is really that Oh or even better

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:38.210
this is really that Oh or even better
 

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:39.970
this is really that Oh or even better
you can just use one of these tags I

you can just use one of these tags I
mean even though we had issues around

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:42.470
mean even though we had issues around

kind of general education around

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:44.990
kind of general education around
 

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:47.320
kind of general education around

fragments on what they could do it's
 

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:49.450
fragments on what they could do it's
really powerful to be able to say here's

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:49.460

a piece of my UI I just want to drop

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:51.020
a piece of my UI I just want to drop

this completely self-contained component

00:25:52.899 --> 00:25:52.909
this completely self-contained component
 

00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:55.120
this completely self-contained component
here and then not think about it to be

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:55.130
here and then not think about it to be
 

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:57.010
here and then not think about it to be
able to just configure it possibly from

00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:57.020
able to just configure it possibly from
 

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:58.930
able to just configure it possibly from

00:25:58.930 --> 00:25:58.940
other XML attributes as specified there
 

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:02.560
other XML attributes as specified there
and then just let that component do its

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:02.570
and then just let that component do its
 

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:05.150
and then just let that component do its
thing

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:05.160
 

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.130
so the idea here is to really try and

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:08.140
so the idea here is to really try and
 

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.630
so the idea here is to really try and
provide these single points of

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:09.640
provide these single points of
 

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.340
provide these single points of
high-level integration that everyone can

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:11.350
high-level integration that everyone can
 

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.100
high-level integration that everyone can
use and that last part is really key

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:13.110
use and that last part is really key
 

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:15.660
use and that last part is really key
again not everyone is going to be using

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:15.670
again not everyone is going to be using
 

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:17.190
again not everyone is going to be using
the same architectural patterns that

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.200
the same architectural patterns that
 

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.780
the same architectural patterns that
your app does and your own app may not

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:18.790
your app does and your own app may not
 

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:20.160
your app does and your own app may not
use those patterns the same way over

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:20.170
use those patterns the same way over
 

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:22.380
use those patterns the same way over
time either but fragments are kind of

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:22.390
time either but fragments are kind of
 

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:24.090
time either but fragments are kind of
uniquely positioned here and that's

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:24.100
uniquely positioned here and that's
 

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.730
uniquely positioned here and that's
because fragments really closely mirror

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:26.740
because fragments really closely mirror
 

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:28.500
because fragments really closely mirror
that activity lifecycle there are a few

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:28.510
that activity lifecycle there are a few
 

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:30.690
that activity lifecycle there are a few
differences here and there but by and

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:30.700
differences here and there but by and
 

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.010
differences here and there but by and
large like as you're thinking about

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:32.020
large like as you're thinking about
 

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.020
large like as you're thinking about
invariance to enforce within a fragment

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:34.030
invariance to enforce within a fragment
 

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:35.549
invariance to enforce within a fragment
they really match what you do with

00:26:35.549 --> 00:26:35.559
they really match what you do with
 

00:26:35.559 --> 00:26:37.740
they really match what you do with
activities as part of that core entry

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:37.750

point idea for Android components so

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:40.780
point idea for Android components so
 

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.240
point idea for Android components so
that means that essentially they can sit

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:42.250
that means that essentially they can sit
 

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:44.730
that means that essentially they can sit
below that level of abstraction of your

below that level of abstraction of your
higher-level architecture that you

higher-level architecture that you
 

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:48.299
higher-level architecture that you
impose upon your application and that

00:26:48.299 --> 00:26:48.309

you really need to be careful about the

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:00.100
you really need to be careful about the
 

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.010
you really need to be careful about the
types of configuration dependencies that

this comes down to that issue of are you

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:08.380
this comes down to that issue of are you
 

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.500
this comes down to that issue of are you
going fishing in your parent activity or

who's using that fragment necessarily

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:20.410
who's using that fragment necessarily
 

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:22.040
who's using that fragment necessarily
going to know that that's a requirement

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:22.050
going to know that that's a requirement

team again this may not be a problem but

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:26.920
team again this may not be a problem but

team again this may not be a problem but
as things grow over time the we tend to

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:30.070
as things grow over time the we tend to
 

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:34.940
as things grow over time the we tend to
see a lot of these patterns show up and

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:34.950
see a lot of these patterns show up and
 

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:36.810
see a lot of these patterns show up and
that means that you really do need to

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:36.820
that means that you really do need to
 

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.040
that means that you really do need to
consider your audience as you're

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:38.050
consider your audience as you're
 

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:39.990
consider your audience as you're

libraries the answer to this is going to

00:27:42.419 --> 00:27:42.429
libraries the answer to this is going to
 

00:27:42.429 --> 00:27:44.010
libraries the answer to this is going to
be a lot different from if you're just

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:44.020
be a lot different from if you're just
 

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.419
be a lot different from if you're just
building another screen within your own
