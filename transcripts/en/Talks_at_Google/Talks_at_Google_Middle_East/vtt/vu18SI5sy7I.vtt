00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.090
SULTAN SOOUD AL
QASSEMI: Now, I just

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.520
want to tell you how
the Art Foundation

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.900
and Google work together.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.410
So we are the biggest partner
of Google in the Middle East

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.670
when it comes to art.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.120
We have over 900 works online.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.970
It is the biggest
library of Arab art

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.470
in the world online is what we
have hosted on the Google Art

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.430
Project.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.960
About 40 or 50 of the works are
in this ultra-high resolution

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.310
gigapixel camera.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.200
They took over my house,
the Google camera.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.012
Not only do we
have-- is there a--

00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:47.130
oh, there is this.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.360
So not only do we
have the artworks

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.130
that you can zoom
in forever and ever,

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.990
but we also have exhibitions.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.307
So if someone says, Sultan, what
did you show in Tehran in 2016?

00:00:59.307 --> 00:01:01.890
I don't know what were the works
that were in your exhibition,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.306
I tell them, go
on Google, and you

00:01:03.306 --> 00:01:06.454
will see the exhibition,
the works that were shown.

00:01:06.454 --> 00:01:08.620
And this is something that
hasn't been released yet,

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.870
but we're working with Google
on exclusively Google-curated

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:13.800
exhibitions.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.750
So this is something
that Google is launching

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.960
all over the world, and we
are their first partner here

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.830
in the Middle East.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.170
So these are exhibitions--

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.580
I don't know that
thing is doing.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.967
Maria, this is your computer.

00:01:24.967 --> 00:01:25.800
You need to stop it.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.666
MARIA: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:27.360
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI: Oh, OK.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.470
You need it back?

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.490
Fine.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.100
So this is exclusive
for Google online.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.550
We also partnered with Google
on the Street View project

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.380
for one of our exhibitions.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.220
And we've partnered
with Google Chrome.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.806
So believe it or not--

00:01:41.806 --> 00:01:43.560
maybe I shouldn't
be telling you this,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.930
but Google asked
for 20 images so

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.570
that they would upload them
into their Chrome international

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.240
library.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.370
So when people use
the Chrome extension,

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.750
a Japanese painting will appear,
a Brazilian artist will appear,

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.460
an American painting
will appear.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.200
But we sort of took things
overboard, and we uploaded 900.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.825
So it is very strange.

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:08.961
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:10.710
I'm not sure I should
be telling you this.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.490
But it is-- for the propensity
of the number of times

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.010
that our works show
up is shocking even

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.910
to me, the fact of how many
works show up on and on and on.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.870
So for example, that was
Nouri Al Rawi from Iraq.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.770
This is Noor Al
Suwaidi from the UAE.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.840
And we also-- Google had
the pop-up exhibition.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.360
They took over a house
two or three years ago.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.130
I'm not sure if you
guys were aware of it.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.096
And so we loaned them art.

00:02:38.096 --> 00:02:40.470
I just wanted to show you--
oh, and on Instagram also, we

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.020
have the only Middle
Eastern artworks

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.170
that appear on the Google
Instagram account, which

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.270
is very, very popular.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.760
Now, this is the presentation.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.400
From now, I hope to take
about 30 minutes of your time.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.269
We will talk about the political
undertones of iconic works

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.060
of the Middle East.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.690
Now, Middle Eastern
artists and Arab artists

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.190
have been documenting major
events for over a century.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.870
So ever since you had the
introduction of schools--

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.560
academies and schools into
the Middle East, the first one

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.400
having been founded
in 1908 in Egypt--

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.330
there was a young
prince from Egypt.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.284
He was the nephew of the king,
and he wanted to study art.

00:03:27.284 --> 00:03:28.200
And he couldn't leave.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.366
So they opened an academy
for him, which is amazing.

00:03:30.366 --> 00:03:31.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.290
His name is Youssef Kamal.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.550
And he said, you know, uncle,
King whoever your name was,

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.400
I want an academy.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.980
They opened an academy for him.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.650
And that was the first academy,
first opened in Alexandria

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.660
and then moved down to Cairo.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.710
And since then you've
had systemic education

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.174
when it came to art.

00:03:48.174 --> 00:03:49.590
But you also had
a lot of artists,

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.260
especially if you come
from Christian backgrounds

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.270
in the Middle East, who
studied in the church.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.320
They studied painting, whether
it was people like Nicola Saig,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.780
whether it was people--

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.960
artists like [INAUDIBLE],,
artists like Gibran Kahlil

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.360
Gibran, and others
who were maybe

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.670
not going to the church
for religious reasons.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.530
But because the
church was present,

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.820
they were able to learn from a
lot of the artists and artisans

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.149
and craftsmen who were there.

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:17.670
This is a very
important painting

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.550
that's part of the Shoman
Foundation collection in Amman,

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.130
and it shows you the
surrender of Jerusalem

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.760
to the British in 1980.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.210
Now, Nicola Saig was not there.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.730
He took the photograph.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.260
And he said, I need
to document it myself.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.110
And so he repainted the work.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.380
And this is one of
the first works where

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.780
you see artists
painting iconic events,

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.660
capturing iconic events
not just with camera

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.020
but with their brushstrokes.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.170
Now, who of you have heard of
the Degenerate Art Exhibition

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.570
of the 1930s in Germany?

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.542
Has anyone here heard of it?

00:04:56.542 --> 00:04:57.500
Who hasn't heard of it?

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.334
Let me see if you guys
are paying attention.

00:04:59.334 --> 00:05:01.833
OK, I'm guessing-- there's a
few of you who have heard of it

00:05:01.833 --> 00:05:04.010
and haven't heard of it,
which is very interesting.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.750
But I won't ask.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.410
So what happened was that the
horrible, horrible government

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.420
of the 1930s and '40s
Germany, the Nazi regime,

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.390
collected a lot of
art that they consider

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.400
to be un-German, unworthy
of being called German.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.380
And some of the artists
were Emil Nolde.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.570
They had Paul Klee,
some of the leading

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.730
lights of European culture.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.430
But these were modernists,
and they were not

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.340
painting iconic-- they were
not painting what you would see

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.100
traditionally as European art.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.680
And so what the
German government did

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.930
was that they were trying
to dehumanize them.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.910
Many of them were
Jews, but a lot of them

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.050
were not Jews as well.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.050
So as part of the effort
to dehumanize them,

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.940
they collected all
their artworks,

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.130
and they hung them in a--

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.340
not a museum, but
almost like a warehouse.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.790
And these works were
hung all over each other.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.030
They were badly lit.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.260
There was no attempt
to give these works

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.120
any kind of respect.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.610
And at the same time, they
opened another exhibition

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.580
across the street in
a beautiful building,

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.380
and the works were
very well lit.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.590
And the artworks
had space for them

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.060
so that you can go
and admire them.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.340
There were tour guides.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.640
And so they wanted to
show you the contrast

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.210
of what is un-German,
what is degenerate art,

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.680
and what is German art.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.380
This exhibition, people
were forced to attend it.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.470
Students from schools
had to go and attend this

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.180
so that they can see how
these works are unworthy

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.290
of being German.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.980
You can see--

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.938
I mean, some of them
really are-- look at that.

00:06:42.938 --> 00:06:46.490
Dada is a very important
movement that took place

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.730
in the 1920s, for example.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.450
So what happened was a lot of
intellectuals around the world

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.160
were horrified by this.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.460
Because again, this
is mass dehumanization

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.040
of people, which followed
the persecution of a lot

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.505
of the minorities in Europe.

00:07:03.505 --> 00:07:04.880
So this is a photo
I found today.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.650
I'm so proud of it.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.710
This is a photograph of Andre
Breton, the French philosopher;

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.480
the Russian dissident,
Leon Trotsky;

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.550
and the Mexican
artist, Diego Rivera.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.150
Now, they came together in
Mexico in 1938, a few months

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.560
after this exhibition.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.320
And they issued a
manifesto, the manifesto

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.300
for an independent
revolutionary art.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.300
And they said in this
manifesto that we are disgusted

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.000
by what happened in Germany.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.770
You're not supposed to treat
intellectuals and prosecute

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:37.760
them like this.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.030
And so as you noticed,
a Russian, a Mexican,

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.540
a European-- so there's
an international outcry

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.076
as a result.

00:07:46.076 --> 00:07:48.200
But what was interesting
and what people don't know

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.610
is that there was equally--

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.070
there was an equal outcry
here in the Middle East.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.850
A bunch of intellectuals from
the Middle East, from Egypt,

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:59.120
gathered in Cairo and
issued their own manifesto.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.570
So this is where
we come in, and we

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.340
have to highlight our
own history as well.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.100
We were also part of this
international movement

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.790
to condemn the
persecution of Jews

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.630
and of intellectuals and
artists under the Nazi regime.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.930
So as you see, this is
a photograph from 1941.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.373
But their first
meeting was 1938,

00:08:20.373 --> 00:08:26.027
so just a few months after
the Degenerate Art exhibition.

00:08:26.027 --> 00:08:27.360
You can see some of their names.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.970
They came from
different backgrounds.

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.964
Many of them were Muslim,
Christian, Jewish.

00:08:31.964 --> 00:08:33.380
Many of them were
ethnic Egyptian.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.089
And many of them were immigrants
to Egypt, who became Egyptian,

00:08:36.089 --> 00:08:37.130
but they were immigrants.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.520
They had Italian background,
Greek background,

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.809
and other backgrounds.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:43.970
So they came together
and they formed

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.550
a group called the
Art and Liberty Group.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:50.090
They issued a magazine called
"The Evolution Magazine."

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:53.190
It came out, I think,
every other month.

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:55.820
They met for a period of
almost eight, nine years.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.810
And they did five
major exhibitions.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:01.730
This is their manifesto.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:05.270
So just like the
Mexican and the Russian

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.090
and the other intellectuals
issued the manifesto,

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:12.590
there was a manifesto that
came out of Cairo in 1939--

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.434
'38, sorry-- December 1938.

00:09:15.434 --> 00:09:16.850
And look what
they're saying here.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.030
They're saying that--
basically what they're saying

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:25.490
is what is happening in Europe
is something that is revolting.

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:29.660
We see this as the
new Middle Ages

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.280
rising in the heart of Europe.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.770
So they're condemning
what's happening in Europe.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:37.520
So this is really sort
of a stand of solidarity

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.670
with the European intellectuals
and the Jews of Europe

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:45.300
and the artists of Europe
signed by all these luminaries.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.070
I just want to show you the
names of the men and women.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:52.440
And you can tell
from their names

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.610
what their backgrounds were.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.401
I just want to give
you a couple of seconds

00:09:55.401 --> 00:09:57.710
to look over the names.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:59.570
This is the kind of
art that they produced.

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:03.020
It was very similar to
the so-called Degenerate

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.280
Art of Europe.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.860
It is nothing-- when you
think of Egyptian art

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.950
of the early 20th century,
you would think of landscapes.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.320
You would think of pyramids.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.040
You think of people standing
in the market, Khan el-Khalili,

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.270
and these beautiful places
that we know in Egypt.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.110
However, this is what
they have been producing.

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:26.520
They've been producing
work that is modern,

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.160
that is cutting
edge, that really

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.480
is talking about the new
identity of the 1930s

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.630
and the 1940s in
Egypt and elsewhere.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.150
This is a great artist, for
example, who was the youngest

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.161
member of the group.

00:10:39.161 --> 00:10:41.660
She wasn't officially a member,
but she exhibited with them.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.102
Her name was Inji Efflatoun.

00:10:43.102 --> 00:10:44.810
We'll come back to
her a number of times.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.810
She is one of the most important
and influential artists

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.950
of the Middle East
of the 20th century.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.770
And this is-- can
you see the work?

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:55.310
It looks like trees that
are women that are nude.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.550
Her work is really incredible.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.730
And I give lectures
about Inji Efflatoun.

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.740
So we can come
back to her later.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.020
So again, remember how Nicola
Saig did not attend an event

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.880
but then decided
to go and paint it

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.990
because he thought
it was so important,

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.680
the surrender of Jerusalem
to the British in 1918?

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.450
Inji Efflatoun did
the same thing.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.720
And she went and she
painted this massacre,

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.660
the Dinshaway Massacre of Egypt
of the early 20th century.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.520
I don't suspect many
of you have heard--

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.340
any Egyptians here have heard
of the Dinshaway Massacre?

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:26.260
Have you heard of it?

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.700
Who has heard of the
Dinsha-- you've heard of it?

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.190
So not even all Egyptians know.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:35.810
But it was a milestone event
in the history of Egypt.

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:39.410
What happened, basically, was a
bunch of British soldiers, who

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:43.340
were basically the
occupying force of Egypt,

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:46.820
went hunting in this
town in the Nile Delta.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.070
And they shot pigeons.

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:51.045
However, in Egypt, the
pigeons are not just--

00:11:51.045 --> 00:11:53.420
they are kept, because they
are the source of livelihood.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.620
People raise the pigeons.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.270
They sell the pigeons.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:58.760
Their income comes from
the keeping of the pigeons.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.370
So they went for sport, and they
started shooting the pigeons.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:04.850
And so people went and
protested very briefly.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:08.341
And they pushed the
British soldiers away,

00:12:08.341 --> 00:12:10.340
but the Egyptian soldiers--
the British soldiers

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.770
were wearing these
very heavy overalls.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:15.020
And so one of them later
collapsed and died,

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:19.400
and they accused the Egyptian
peasants, the farmers

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.200
and the peasants of
having killed him.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.010
And they had an Egyptian
judge basically pass

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:29.300
a sentence of hanging
against two or three

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:34.160
of the Egyptian peasants.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.280
And so Inji Efflatoun captures
this very important event.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.140
What happened after
that was that it

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:42.660
was covered in the media and
was seen as an example and even

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.670
led to the multiple Egyptian
uprisings against the British.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:47.750
And now we are being--

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:48.840
we are being pushed.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.930
They are even taking away
our source of livelihood.

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:55.820
So this really led to
the uprisings of 1919.

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.860
It was a small event, but
it was the buildup of it.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.190
So here you see the
British soldiers sort

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:05.810
of standing watch, looking at
this guy who is being executed

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:12.710
or being hanged while his family
is crying, asking for mercy.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:14.810
Again, Inji Efflatoun
was not present.

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:16.700
She was born in the 1920s.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.220
However, she thought this was
such an important event that

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:24.400
took place 40-odd years ago
that I have to capture it.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:29.350
Not all artists had
a bad relationship

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.290
with the government.

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:34.120
This is an Egyptian artist, for
example, George Hanna Sabbagh,

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.460
who was one of the first
artists to go and to exhibit

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:43.610
in the Salon d'Automne in Paris
in the early 20th century.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.820
But George was very
close to the king,

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.110
and he was gifting the
king a lot of gifts.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.520
So a lot of artists benefited
from a good relationship.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.470
Just like they do here in the
UAE and the Gulf and elsewhere,

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:56.710
they benefit a lot from
having a good relationship

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.960
with the monarch and
the ruling family.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:04.210
Actually, this reads "Gift
to [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]."."

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:09.667
So it was a gift to
the Egyptian monarch.

00:14:09.667 --> 00:14:11.750
This is one of my favorite
paintings in the world.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:12.820
There's two copies of it.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.028
I'll tell you the reason why.

00:14:14.028 --> 00:14:16.870
One of them is owned, thank
God, by the Egyptian estate.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:20.200
And the other one is
owned by [INAUDIBLE]..

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.860
This artist was approached
by his boss, Yousuf--

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.850
or by his teacher, Yousuf Amin.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.920
So Abdel Hady El Gazzar
was the son of a cleric.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.820
And he was studying
art under Yousuf Amin.

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.890
And Yousuf Amin told
him, by the way,

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:38.470
there's going to
be an exhibition.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:41.500
And some of the works are
going to be gifted to the king.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.932
Would you like to
paint something

00:14:42.932 --> 00:14:44.140
that we can give to the king?

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.730
And it's very prestigious.

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:48.040
Your work will be in
the royal collection.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.540
A lot of people will see it.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:52.360
You will have a future
if you paint something.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.380
He said, sure, why not.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.340
I'll paint something.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.173
He painted this work
and was thrown in jail.

00:14:56.173 --> 00:14:57.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.340
Now, I want to give you guys
a few seconds to tell me,

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:04.170
why do you think he was
thrown in jail more than once?

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:07.384
AUDIENCE: Maybe because
of "The Naked Lady?"

00:15:07.384 --> 00:15:09.133
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
"The Naked Lady?"

00:15:09.133 --> 00:15:11.405
Who thinks it's because
of "The Naked Lady?"

00:15:11.405 --> 00:15:12.960
OK, now, because I
asked it that way.

00:15:16.185 --> 00:15:18.817
Who has another explanation?

00:15:18.817 --> 00:15:19.967
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:19.967 --> 00:15:21.175
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI: Huh?

00:15:21.175 --> 00:15:22.620
"The Plate," "The Empty Plate."

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:23.370
What do you think?

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:25.161
AUDIENCE: It's
demonstrative of the poverty

00:15:25.161 --> 00:15:26.487
of Egyptians at that time.

00:15:26.487 --> 00:15:28.320
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
I knew Google hires

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.820
the best minds and abilities.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.460
So yes, actually,
you're very right.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.980
This painting was
seen as an affront

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.060
to the Egyptian monarch.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.210
The message basically is in
your kingdom, your majesty,

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:41.640
everyone is poor and
suffering and hungry.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.805
And so he was picked up,
along with his poor teacher--

00:15:44.805 --> 00:15:47.250
Yousuf Amin had
nothing to do with it.

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:51.110
He was picked up, both were
picked up, thrown in jail.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.160
And finally, Mahmoud
Sa'id, who was

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.080
a very important
Egyptian artist, who

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.470
was the uncle of
the queen, went,

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:01.590
and he basically was able to
ask for clemency and mercy.

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:03.120
And they were able
to release them.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.880
But the guy was really
unhappy, the artist.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.120
I'll show you what he did later.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.580
So the artist, as you can tell--

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.420
Abdel Hady El Gazzar was--

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:15.076
when the Egyptian
revolution took place,

00:16:15.076 --> 00:16:16.950
do you think he was
sorry to see the king go?

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:17.430
AUDIENCE: No.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:18.950
SULTAN SOOUD AL
QASSEMI: Not so much.

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:20.366
He goes, well,
this guy jailed me.

00:16:20.366 --> 00:16:22.620
I'm not really sad that
he is no longer there.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:28.020
So in fact he was very close to
the government of Abdel Nasser.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:32.510
And in 1962, Egypt
introduced a new constitution

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:35.490
that Abdel Nasser
had commissioned.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:39.210
And this is a painting
that he created,

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:43.020
which is also, thankfully,
owned by the Egyptian state,

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.060
to celebrate the
new constitution.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.830
There's a lot of messages here.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:49.170
But can you see what's happening
over there in the back?

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:50.290
I like this a lot.

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:54.660
There's a Muslim imam and a
priest hugging each other.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:55.900
They're so happy.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.080
I don't know why they're
happy, but they're happy.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.140
And then here you see
the farmer and the worker

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.300
holding the wheat
and the flower.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.651
Is this wheat and flour?

00:17:04.651 --> 00:17:05.359
AUDIENCE: Cotton.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:06.692
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI: Cotton?

00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:10.230
Is it cotton in their hand,
almost kneeling in prayer.

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:13.020
You know, it is such an
iconic piece of Egypt,

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:16.150
and it's called
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] in Arabic,

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:17.472
"The Charter."

00:17:17.472 --> 00:17:19.180
And it was exhibited
in Korea last month,

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:21.660
which I'm very happy about.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:26.670
What led to, basically, this
new identity that took place

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:30.210
across the Middle East?

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:32.820
What happened was a lot of the--

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:36.990
across the Middle East, what
the region shared in common was

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:40.280
they were all under
foreign occupation,

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:44.890
either as protectorates or
as a proper colonial rule.

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:48.660
They were all under governments
that didn't give them

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:54.000
a lot of freedoms, whether they
were pre or post-colonial rule.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.710
And so one of the
only places that they

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:59.490
were able to gather the artists
were these fine art societies.

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:01.740
And not only were the
artists gathering,

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.600
but they also invited
intellectuals.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.140
So you have poets, you have
singers, you have journalists,

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.970
you have professors and lawyers.

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:11.910
They all gathered in
these fine arts societies,

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:14.220
and they were able
to exchange ideas.

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:18.090
And in this exchange of
ideas, a new identity emerged.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.700
When you look at the first
half of the 20th century

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.990
art and the second
half 20th century,

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:24.780
there's been a seismic shift.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:28.110
The work no longer
looks like European art.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:29.940
I must say, in
the 1920s and even

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.890
'30s, a lot of the
art from the region

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:33.480
was influenced by Europeans.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.280
But by the 1940s
and '50s and '60s,

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.700
you see the emergence
of an identity that

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.470
is very, very different,
that is very--

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:41.730
that is unique to that region.

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:44.910
This is the Baghdad Fine
Art Society of 1951.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:49.050
However, fine art societies
emerged in Khartoum, in Kuwait,

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.630
in Cairo, in
Alexandria, in Rabat,

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:55.890
all over the Middle East,
in Beirut, and other places.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.640
One of these intellectuals
was gathering--

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.390
I think he's somewhere
here, but I can't--

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:00.970
I don't know which
one he is here--

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:04.140
was Iraqi artist [AUDIO OUT].

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.950
So [INAUDIBLE] was
actually a person

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:09.072
who worked in the theater.

00:19:09.072 --> 00:19:10.530
He designed a lot
of the background

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:11.640
for a lot of the plays.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.000
But a lot of the plays
were political plays.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.360
So when he gathers in
the fine art society,

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:22.380
the playwright gives the script.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.180
The artist comes and
paints the background.

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:26.310
And so you have this
exchange of ideas.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:29.720
So [INAUDIBLE] here makes this--

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:34.690
created this work, which
is [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]----

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:38.250
it has a French name
for some reason--

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.760
in 1957.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.860
So what happened-- this is a
very interesting point that I

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.300
would like to share with you.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:49.970
In Iraq, in the 1950s,
as part of the British--

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:52.710
as part of the British
government policies

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:55.830
or the British
influence in Iraq,

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.990
a lot of the land
that was taken--

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:01.500
that was controlled by
peasants in the South--

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:02.900
was taken over by the British.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:03.770
They had airstrips.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.090
They had a military base.

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:08.390
So they moved all these peasants
into Cairo, into Baghdad.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:11.750
So you can imagine as a result
of several years of peasants

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:15.240
being pushed out of their
lands, they move where?

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.250
To the capital.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:18.274
When they move to the
capital, what kind of jobs

00:20:18.274 --> 00:20:19.190
are they going to get?

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.620
AUDIENCE: Laborer.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:20.371
AUDIENCE: Laborer.

00:20:20.371 --> 00:20:21.953
SULTAN SOOUD AL
QASSEMI: Laborer jobs.

00:20:21.953 --> 00:20:23.880
Basically, they are
really in dire situation.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.680
So in 1955, 1956, a couple
of seismic events took place.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.660
Now, I want to explain how
artists channel what happened

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.400
politically into an artwork.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:39.310
So in 1956, what
happened in Egypt?

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:40.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:41.818
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI: Huh?

00:20:41.818 --> 00:20:42.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.563
SULTAN SOOUD AL
QASSEMI: [INAUDIBLE],,

00:20:44.563 --> 00:20:45.670
the Tripartite Aggression.

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:47.290
So what happened
was Abdel Nasser

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.170
had nationalized the Suez Canal.

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:53.080
And who attacked--
who attacked Egypt?

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.000
Israel, France, and Britain.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.790
At the same time
in Baghdad, Baghdad

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:01.030
signs a treaty called
the Baghdad Pact

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:04.570
with the British government,
which is a joint defense pact.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.910
At the same time that the
British were attacking

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:10.030
an Arab country, the
Baghdad government

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.610
signs a joint defense agreement.

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.676
The Iraqis go out and
march against this.

00:21:14.676 --> 00:21:16.800
At the same time, they're
marching not only against

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.580
the Baghdad Pact--
that was the trigger--

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.163
but they are marching
against poverty.

00:21:20.163 --> 00:21:22.660
They're marching against
lack of job opportunities

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.750
and employment and
livelihood opportunities.

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:29.124
And so these people are
called the [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:21:29.124 --> 00:21:31.290
The [NON-ENGLISH] they came
from the [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.640
So they called them
the [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.820
So Kadhim Haidar, here,
painted the [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:38.770
He tells them, what happened?

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:39.490
What happened?

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:43.170
The [NON-ENGLISH] had gone
out and protest in 1957--

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:44.860
in '56 and '57.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.469
So they were a
series of protests.

00:21:46.469 --> 00:21:47.260
So he met him here.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.870
He goes, tell me what happened.

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:53.020
So the painting was called,
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:56.602
He has told us how it
happened, what happened.

00:21:56.602 --> 00:21:58.685
So when you look at the
painting, you're like, ah,

00:21:58.685 --> 00:22:01.140
Sultan is just talking shit.

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.550
It's a painting of a man
sitting down on the ground.

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:08.050
But really, these artists are
masters of hidden messages,

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:09.604
because they can
get into trouble.

00:22:09.604 --> 00:22:11.270
What they do is they
hide their messages

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:12.820
in the corners, in the middle.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:13.990
They find allegories.

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:16.260
They find metaphors for
what they want to say.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.990
So when you look at this,
you see that bit over there?

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.770
You see that?

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:22.910
That's full of hidden
messages over here.

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.390
So here, the artist
is painting a man

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:27.550
who looks like
he's boxed in, who

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:28.774
looks like he's a strong man.

00:22:28.774 --> 00:22:29.440
He must be what?

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.420
He must be in his 30s maybe.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.030
You think he's in his
30s or maybe late 20s.

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:35.290
He's a strong man.

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:39.820
But he has no shoes on, and the
sole of his feet are cracked.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:43.354
But he looks like he's
staring into the abyss.

00:22:43.354 --> 00:22:45.020
Does he look like he
has a bright future

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.300
and a bright prospect?

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.110
Not much, is it?

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.980
Am I right?

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:51.340
So when you look at it, now you
can see the hidden messages.

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.340
What happened?

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:56.990
He tell him the soldiers
shot at the civilians.

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.980
What happened?

00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:59.960
There were tanks and
planes that were--

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.390
there were tanks and planes
that were let loose on us,

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:03.410
and they dropped bombs.

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:05.180
And people were
crying, and people

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.970
were pleading for their
lives and running for cover.

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:08.870
What happened?

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:10.980
I saw rape.

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:11.900
Do you see?

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.770
Doesn't that give you goosebumps
about how the messages were

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.250
hidden by these artists?

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:19.340
Remember, the monarchy
was still there.

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:21.870
They were not able to
say what was happening.

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:26.000
So he had to hide
it in this painting.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.030
I'll just go back just to give
you a chance to see it again.

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:33.480
I also love the
leftist red color here,

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.250
the communist color.

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:36.990
Almost the only color
that you see here

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:41.160
is the color-- the red
color of communism.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:45.440
The same artist, Kadhim
Haidar, paints this work,

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.040
called "The Martyr's Epic."

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.770
So "The Martyr's Epic" basically
is a painting depicting

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:53.707
10 fatigued horses crying.

00:23:53.707 --> 00:23:54.540
Why are they crying?

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:56.520
Because Kadhim Haidar
is saying, oh, I'm

00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:01.770
painting a painting about the
martyrdom of Imam Husayn ibn

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:02.280
Ali.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.890
So if you're not
Muslim, Imam Husayn

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:06.960
basically was the
grandson of the prophet.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:11.040
And he was killed in
the Battle of Karbala.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.370
And it was a major
seismic event that

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:18.030
really led to the split of
Islam between Shia and Sunni.

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:19.530
I don't want to go
into the details,

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:23.460
but he's a very important
figure for both Sunni and Shia

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.530
Muslims.

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:31.550
And so what happened is when
Abd al-Karim Qasim in 1957--

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:34.350
in 1957-58 overthrew
the king, he

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:36.000
stayed in power for five years.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.070
And then, he was overthrown
by the Ba'athists.

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:42.360
So the Egyptian--
the Iraqi leader

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.250
only stayed in power
for five years.

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:45.930
And then, he was overthrown.

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:47.850
And so when he was
overthrown, they

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:50.460
went after his allies,
who were-- a lot of them

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.690
were the communists.

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:55.380
So remember, in the salon--
in the cultural salon,

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.390
a lot of people of
communist leanings

00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:59.190
and communist backgrounds
were attending.

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:00.660
But guess what happened?

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.652
They went after them,
and they executed them.

00:25:02.652 --> 00:25:03.360
They killed them.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.090
They jailed them.

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:06.750
They locked them up in theaters.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.370
They locked them
up in a stadium.

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:11.220
They locked them up in rooms.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.791
And they executed many of them.

00:25:12.791 --> 00:25:14.040
We'll come back to this theme.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.050
The theme of execution
of communists

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:18.300
was a big deal in
the '60s in Iraq.

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.410
So again, Kadhim Haidar now--

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:22.290
in the 1960s,
remember how he hid

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:25.560
the message of the rape scene
and all that in the painting?

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.682
Here, he wanted to show
something else that happened,

00:25:28.682 --> 00:25:29.265
which is what?

00:25:29.265 --> 00:25:32.310
Which is the murder
of the intellectuals

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:35.470
of Iraq in the early '60s.

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:41.160
So he uses an allegory of
the death of Imam Husayn

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:45.420
to represent the death of
the intellectuals of Iraq.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:48.730
Because he cannot paint an Iraqi
intellectual who was killed,

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:50.730
he says, I'm just
painting the deaths of--

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:52.900
the death of Imam Husayn--

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:54.300
Imam Husayn ibn Ali.

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:55.940
And that will be
the allegory, it

00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:00.180
will be the metaphor for
my friends who were killed.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:02.670
So here you see the horses
crying, because one of them

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:03.660
has been killed.

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.370
The sun has turned red.

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:08.160
You see the hair almost on
the back of their shoulders,

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.840
on their necks has
been-- has stood up.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.290
They are in agony,
and they're crying.

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:16.470
And so again, a lot of
artists use these metaphors

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:18.294
to represent political events.

00:26:18.294 --> 00:26:19.710
Ibrahim El-Salahi,
the same thing.

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:22.650
In 1985, painted
this piece in Sudan

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:25.660
called "The Inevitable,"
which was against the uprising

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:28.280
and the government of
Sudan had put down,

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:33.009
in a very nasty way, an
uprising that took place.

00:26:33.009 --> 00:26:33.800
This is going back.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.240
Mahmoud Sabri painted this
while he was in Russia.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.970
In 1962, there was a--

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:41.490
the communist leader
of Iraq was executed.

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:43.950
So as you can see, he
was in Russia very much

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:48.540
painting in the Russian Soviet
realist style of painting.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:49.680
I mean, look at this work.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.080
Look at these individuals
carrying the red flag

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.685
of communism in the background.

00:26:53.685 --> 00:26:54.870
Do you see them?

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:58.590
Look at the Salam Adil,
which was the nickname

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:00.480
of the Iraqi communist leader.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.200
He was 29 years old
when he was executed.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.280
But he's very proud.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.950
Because this is what the
story is that he had his head

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:08.880
held up high.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.480
Even though the
guy was in Russia,

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.940
he managed to
capture this scene.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.220
And look at the guy who
was executed before him.

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.080
What do you see?

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.180
Do you see that he has fallen?

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:19.740
He's still trying to stand up.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.810
So the guy who was
executed just before him

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:24.176
is pushing back up
because he refuses to die.

00:27:24.176 --> 00:27:25.800
And look at the child
in the background

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.080
here who almost
is being inspired

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.450
by the sacrifice of
these individuals.

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:33.310
I'm sorry about the colors.

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:37.914
So it's a very, very important--
again, a very important piece.

00:27:37.914 --> 00:27:39.330
The governments
in the Middle East

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:43.410
usually use artists to
create major monuments,

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.810
such as the Baghdad
Monument to Freedom,

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.320
that was created
by Jawad Saleem.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.170
As you can see here, this
was Abd al-Karim Qasim,

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:51.810
who, remember, who
overthrew the king.

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:54.780
He went to Jawad Saleem and told
him, create a monument for me

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:57.060
to celebrate the new Iraq.

00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:00.600
So as you can see here,
you have someone sort

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.300
of coming into the cage and
breaking the cage, which

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.730
is basically a metaphor
for the freedoms

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:08.700
that the Iraqis have won
by the overthrow of--

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.780
following the overthrow
of the monarchy.

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.950
This is still there
in Baghdad, thank God.

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:16.620
Now, a big theme in
the 1950s and '60s

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.530
was nationalism and Pan-Arabism,
which was championed

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:21.720
by Gamal Abdel Nasser.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.282
You have this theme--
the nationalism

00:28:23.282 --> 00:28:24.490
theme was all over the world.

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:27.690
This is the painting by
Ibrahim Ismail of Kuwait.

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:30.960
As you can see, he's showing
Abd [? al-Salam, ?] who was

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.000
the leader who
ushered in democracy--

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.550
who ushered in freedom and
independence of Kuwait.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:39.570
You have the olive
branch, the bird of--

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.480
the dove of peace.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.880
You have the
Constitution, et cetera,

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.750
all being shown here
in the flag of Kuwait.

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:50.640
But now is where it
gets really interesting.

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:54.620
This is the Kuwaiti painter
depicting Gamal Abdel Nasser.

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.141
Gamal Abdel Nasser
here is shown as what?

00:28:57.141 --> 00:28:59.390
First of all, what flag--
who knows what flag this is?

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:00.707
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:00.707 --> 00:29:02.290
SULTAN SOOUD AL
QASSEMI: What is that?

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:03.081
Someone explain it.

00:29:03.081 --> 00:29:04.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:05.140
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
What is the name

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:06.700
of the country in English?

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.270
AUDIENCE: United Arab Republic.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:09.490
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
United Arab Republic,

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:10.510
which was the union of?

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:11.710
AUDIENCE: Egypt and Syria.

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:13.418
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
Egypt and Syria.

00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:15.010
So this is a Kuwaiti
artist depicting

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:18.630
what Abdel Nasser meant to them,
someone from the Gulf saying,

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.830
Abdel Nasser now is the
leader of the region.

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:24.220
And the flag of the United Arab
Republic goes from the Maghreb,

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:26.160
from Morocco, all
the way to the Gulf.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.420
So Abdel Nasser is the leader
of the whole region, basically.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.540
Abdel Nasser was a larger
than life figure in--

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:38.320
almost literally
when it comes to art.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.050
In this case, you have
Abdel Nasser here--

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:44.500
Hamid Ewais, who was another
leftist leaning artist,

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.470
socialist, who was very
friendly with Abdel Nasser

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:51.160
and depicts him here
and the nationalization

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.165
of the Suez Canal in 1957.

00:29:54.165 --> 00:29:55.540
What do you see
in this painting?

00:29:55.540 --> 00:30:00.910
You see Abdel Nasser surrounded
by people who are happy,

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:02.717
from diverse backgrounds.

00:30:02.717 --> 00:30:04.300
And what do you see
in the background?

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.640
You see the first
vote sort of cross

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.880
under the era of Abdel Nasser.

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.930
So Abdel Nasser is
a recurrent theme.

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:16.900
I have 30, 40 paintings--
not have, but on the slides.

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:17.470
Here, I love.

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:18.636
This is one of my favorites.

00:30:18.636 --> 00:30:21.610
This is Mohamed Sabri, who
is an Egyptian artist, who

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:24.544
is still alive-- born 1917.

00:30:24.544 --> 00:30:25.710
Unbelievable, [NON-ENGLISH].

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:26.440
[KNOCK, KNOCK]

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:30.894
OK, so Mohamed
Sabri here depicts--

00:30:30.894 --> 00:30:32.560
I want you to analyze
this piece for me.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.910
What do you see?

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:35.260
What is Abdel Nasser doing here?

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:36.263
You guys analyze it.

00:30:36.263 --> 00:30:37.471
AUDIENCE: It's the UN speech.

00:30:37.471 --> 00:30:38.860
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
It's the UN speech.

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:39.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.370
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
OK, so who is he addressing?

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:42.078
Can you guys see?

00:30:42.078 --> 00:30:43.619
AUDIENCE: The emerging nation.

00:30:43.619 --> 00:30:45.660
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
Who is in the first row?

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.448
AUDIENCE: Russia and Chinese.

00:30:47.448 --> 00:30:50.140
AUDIENCE: Russia
and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.217
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
OK, so the first row,

00:30:52.217 --> 00:30:53.800
we see the leaders
of which countries?

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.120
America, Russia.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.540
So the world powers are there.

00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.890
And then who else is there?

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:00.882
AUDIENCE: India.

00:31:00.882 --> 00:31:02.456
AUDIENCE: Ghana.

00:31:02.456 --> 00:31:04.330
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
Why India and Ghana?

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:05.230
Why Ghana?

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:06.600
Why Indonesia?

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.179
Not India-- I think India is--

00:31:08.179 --> 00:31:08.845
AUDIENCE: India.

00:31:08.845 --> 00:31:09.715
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
Yeah, India-- it

00:31:09.715 --> 00:31:10.920
says India and Indonesia.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.607
But why Indonesia?

00:31:12.607 --> 00:31:13.950
AUDIENCE: Muslims.

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:15.366
SULTAN SOOUD AL
QASSEMI: No, there

00:31:15.366 --> 00:31:17.910
was the conference, the
Indonesian Non-Aligned Movement

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:22.020
Conference in 1956,
which he attended.

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:23.490
What else do you see there?

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:25.382
There's an empty seat.

00:31:25.382 --> 00:31:26.340
What's that empty seat?

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:27.170
AUDIENCE: His seat.

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:28.378
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI: His.

00:31:28.378 --> 00:31:29.550
What is the message?

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:31.470
When he's done with the speech,
where is he going to go?

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:32.200
AUDIENCE: The front.

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:32.430
SULTAN SOOUD AL
QASSEMI: He's going

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:33.955
to sit in the front, god dammit.

00:31:33.955 --> 00:31:35.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.950
This guy is going to
sit in the front row.

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:38.860
He's not sitting in the back.

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:41.270
The Egyptian leader
sits in the front row

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:43.520
with the world leaders.

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.970
Do you think this
was the reality?

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:45.690
AUDIENCE: No.

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:46.505
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
No, it wasn't the reality.

00:31:46.505 --> 00:31:48.100
AUDIENCE: They still have
this complex today, though.

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:49.580
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI: Yeah.

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:50.674
But it's not about--

00:31:50.674 --> 00:31:51.590
but this is something.

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:53.520
It just shows you
the power of art.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.920
Because these
paintings are meant

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.370
to be viewed by
the intellectuals

00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:57.970
and by the influencers.

00:31:57.970 --> 00:31:59.260
So you see Abdel Nasser.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.600
And is Abdel Nasser
as big as them?

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.539
Is he his size?

00:32:02.539 --> 00:32:03.080
AUDIENCE: No.

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:03.580
AUDIENCE: He's massive.

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:04.080
AUDIENCE: He's huge.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:04.950
SULTAN SOOUD AL
QASSEMI: He's massive.

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:06.360
And check out his teeth.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:06.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:09.090
I mean, wow, the
guy-- it's incredible.

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:10.861
The work-- I love
this painting so much.

00:32:10.861 --> 00:32:12.360
And who's sitting
in the second row,

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.068
without us getting
into too much trouble?

00:32:14.068 --> 00:32:16.732
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:16.732 --> 00:32:18.690
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
Who said that country?

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:19.565
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:19.565 --> 00:32:20.832
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:20.832 --> 00:32:22.540
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
I didn't say it.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:24.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:25.350
But who else is there?

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:27.360
Everyone else is
relegated to the back.

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.650
AUDIENCE: But then you
have Castro as well.

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:29.980
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
Castro is his friend.

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:30.300
Yeah.

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:30.560
AUDIENCE: That's true.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.185
SULTAN SOOUD AL
QASSEMI: That's Castro.

00:32:32.185 --> 00:32:33.870
That's right.

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:35.490
Also, unfortunately,
they're all men.

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:39.030
But I suppose this is the
truth here in this-- in the UN.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:42.630
So you can imagine how
Abdel Nasser's image

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:44.340
loomed over the region.

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:46.110
Not only do
Egyptians depict him,

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:49.620
but even Kuwaitis and
Syrians and Lebanese,

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:52.900
they all painted him as being
sort of this larger than life

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:53.400
figure.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.270
You want to see another one?

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:54.895
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:32:54.895 --> 00:32:56.078
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:56.078 --> 00:32:56.982
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:56.982 --> 00:32:58.398
SULTAN SOOUD AL
QASSEMI: So here--

00:32:58.398 --> 00:32:59.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:02.085 --> 00:33:03.168
AUDIENCE: The Last Supper.

00:33:03.168 --> 00:33:04.376
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI: Huh?

00:33:04.376 --> 00:33:06.392
AUDIENCE: The Last Supper.

00:33:06.392 --> 00:33:08.100
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
The Last Supper.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.960
Actually, Tyler,
that's a good point.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.990
Abdel Nasser died a few days
after signing this agreement,

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:14.460
unfortunately.

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:15.510
He was very young.

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:18.030
So this was the Cairo
Agreement in which he brought

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:19.530
all these leaders together.

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:21.484
What do you see
in this painting?

00:33:21.484 --> 00:33:22.400
You see which leaders?

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.855
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:24.855 --> 00:33:25.778
AUDIENCE: Palestine.

00:33:25.778 --> 00:33:26.819
AUDIENCE: Turkey, Kuwait.

00:33:26.819 --> 00:33:27.801
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:27.801 --> 00:33:31.160
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI: Yeah,
the leaders of Kuwait, Surdia,

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:31.850
Palestine.

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:32.756
Who is this?

00:33:32.756 --> 00:33:33.570
AUDIENCE: British.

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:34.230
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI: No.

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.590
AUDIENCE: Muammar Gaddafi.

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:37.190
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
Muammar Gaddafi, well done.

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:38.424
Yeah, Muammar Gaddafi.

00:33:38.424 --> 00:33:40.840
And I don't know who else is
there, to be honest with you.

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:41.470
AUDIENCE: Hussein is
next to him on the right?

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:41.730
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI: Who?

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:43.680
AUDIENCE: Hussein
is on the right?

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.055
SULTAN SOOUD AL
QASSEMI: I'm sorry?

00:33:44.055 --> 00:33:44.310
AUDIENCE: On the right?

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:45.560
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI: Yeah.

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.410
This is King Husseing of--

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:49.090
is any one of them alive?

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:53.070
It's amazing that Gaddafi
was alive until recently.

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:54.080
OK, I think I have more.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:54.700
Do you want to see more?

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:55.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:56.928
SULTAN SOOUD AL
QASSEMI: Let's see.

00:33:56.928 --> 00:33:58.960
Oh, this was
actually a painting.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.970
So this was interesting.

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:07.230
The Egyptian government,
[NON-ENGLISH]..

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.300
They were very, very
classy in the sense

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:13.530
that when they want to send the
message to the intelligentsia,

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:15.420
they bring in the
intelligentsia.

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:18.659
They chose over 20 artists,
and they shipped them down

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:19.739
to Aswan.

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:22.000
Abdel Nasser's project
was to build Aswan Dam.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.870
Do you know how
important Aswan Dam was?

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:30.060
Aswan Dam was so important
that it was Egypt's--

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:33.239
their backup plan,
their plan of survival.

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:36.300
Because Egypt, in those
days, was able to muscle--

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:41.511
you know hand wrestle all the
countries of the Nile Basin.

00:34:41.511 --> 00:34:42.510
Now, they can't do that.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:46.500
Now, Ethiopia is
interfering with them.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.120
But in those days,
they said, we're

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.790
building the MF
dam right now, OK?

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:53.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:54.820
OK, we're building the dam.

00:34:54.820 --> 00:35:00.270
And if the Americans don't give
us money, guess where we'll go?

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:01.350
We'll go to the Russians.

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:03.900
So this dam basically
was the reason

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:09.120
why Egypt shifted from
being in the Eastern--

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.640
sorry, from being in the
Western sphere of influence

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.440
to the Eastern
sphere of influence.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.090
It's a major, major change.

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:17.280
So what they did was that
they chose 20 artists.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.110
And they shipped
them to Aswan Dam

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:21.850
to paint what's
happening to Aswan Dam.

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:25.410
One of them was Ragheb
Ayad, who depicted--

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:26.250
I love this piece.

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:29.790
Because look at-- this is the
building of the Aswan Dam.

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:32.430
But if I didn't tell you it's
the Aswan Dam, what would

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:34.116
you think it was of?

00:35:34.116 --> 00:35:34.991
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:34.991 --> 00:35:37.490
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI: What
do you think they're building?

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:38.320
AUDIENCE: Pyramids.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.903
SULTAN SOOUD AL
QASSEMI: The pyramids.

00:35:39.903 --> 00:35:42.930
Or maybe they're
digging the Suez Canal.

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:43.560
Am I right?

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.170
It's amazing.

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:48.220
I mean, for me, this
is an artwork that

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:50.290
celebrates the
Aswan Dam but almost

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:52.180
is critical of the Aswan Dam.

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.790
On one hand, they're
presenting Abdel Nasser--

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:56.170
or he was presenting
Abdel Nasser

00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:59.320
as being the successor of the
[? hidewis ?] and the successor

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:02.020
of the pharaohs-- of the
pharaohs of thousands

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:02.800
of years ago.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.690
But what's missing
in this painting?

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:05.710
There's something very
interesting that's

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:06.940
missing in this painting.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:07.720
AUDIENCE: Muslim.

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:11.470
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI: No, if
you're building an effing dam,

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:12.054
you need what?

00:36:12.054 --> 00:36:12.719
AUDIENCE: Water.

00:36:12.719 --> 00:36:13.480
AUDIENCE: Terrain.

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.938
SULTAN SOOUD AL
QASSEMI: Not water,

00:36:14.938 --> 00:36:18.160
but you need
equipment, machines.

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:18.970
Am I right?

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:20.620
Where is the machinery?

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:22.120
So it's almost
critical in the sense

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:25.430
that they're very primitive.

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:26.350
They're building, yes.

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:27.890
They're very primitive.

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:30.400
So in one hand, they're
showing you no idle hands,

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.990
but in the other
hand, they're showing

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:34.840
that people are literally
digging with shovels

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.957
the same way they did
thousands of years ago.

00:36:37.957 --> 00:36:39.040
I love this piece so much.

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:41.170
This is a work that you
will not see anywhere

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:42.670
in the world except with me.

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:43.630
I went to Algeria.

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:45.190
I went to the Musee
des Beaux Arts.

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:46.210
I photographed it.

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:48.130
No one has an
image of this work.

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:50.300
It's such an incredible piece.

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:52.395
It's a piece by a Lebanese
artist called Arif El

00:36:52.395 --> 00:36:54.459
Rayyes, who is a Pan-Arabist.

00:36:54.459 --> 00:36:56.500
And he believed in the
Egyptian-- in the Algerian

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:59.762
revolution against the
uprising against the French.

00:36:59.762 --> 00:37:00.970
And look what he did to them.

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:05.260
He sent this work [AUDIO OUT]
in 1961 to the Algerians.

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:08.140
But look at-- can you see
the message in this work?

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:10.310
Unfortunately, it's
not very clear.

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:11.930
But I can read to you.

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:14.010
What does it say here?

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:14.590
ORS.

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:16.580
What is ORS?

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:17.530
Any Algerians here?

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:18.405
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:18.405 --> 00:37:21.250
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] The secret

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:23.610
army organization,
which is the--

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:26.410
sort of the gestapo
that was running

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:28.400
Algeria for the French--

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:31.165
sorry, on the behalf of
the French in Algeria.

00:37:31.165 --> 00:37:32.830
So ORS is here.

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:36.790
And then you have here Europe,
then the Nazis, then Zionism.

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:40.720
So he's showing you that
all these are crocodiles

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.760
that are cutting the
legs of the Algerians

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.100
to make a stew out of them.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.900
And then the United
Nations is going

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:48.250
to be eating from the Algerians.

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:54.070
So we can imagine how
bold and how creative

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:59.840
and how their feelings were sort
of regional rather than local.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.560
So this is a piece
by Arif El Rayyes.

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:03.070
Here we go.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:07.050
This is a piece by Hamid Ewais
called "The Guardian of Life."

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:08.890
So Hamid Ewais,
remember the guy who

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:13.210
did Abdel Nasser with the dam
and everyone smiling around him

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:15.000
and the ship is passing?

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.380
So Hamid Ewais was very
close to Abdel Nasser.

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:22.090
He was studying on a
scholarship in 1967-68 in Spain.

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:26.820
And he heard about
the defeat of Egypt.

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:28.270
Am I right to call
it the defeat,

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:32.410
the defeat of the Arab armies
at the hands of Israel?

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:34.840
And he wanted to
boost the morale.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:39.610
Because remember, a quarter
of the area of the country

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:40.870
was taken over.

00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:43.190
The Israelis had, at
one point in time,

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:46.390
almost approached the
borders of greater Cairo.

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.310
At one point in
time, the Israelis

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:51.070
had taken over
the Golan Heights.

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:52.660
They had taken
over the West Bank.

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:54.210
They had taken over Jerusalem.

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:55.780
They had taken over Gaza.

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.670
They had pushed
back the Jordanians.

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:59.200
They had pushed
back the Syrians.

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.840
They had taken
over all of Sinai.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:05.050
And so a lot of artists,
including Hamid Ewais,

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:07.960
felt that they needed to
boost the morale of Egyptians.

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.360
Worry not, fret not.

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.820
The Egyptian man
will look after you.

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:17.140
You are safe and secure
under the protection

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.462
of the Egyptian man.

00:39:18.462 --> 00:39:20.170
For some reason, a
lot of these paintings

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:22.450
had French names,
including this one.

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:24.830
But we changed the name here.

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:27.618
So can someone tell me what
you see in this painting?

00:39:27.618 --> 00:39:28.992
AUDIENCE: Light.

00:39:28.992 --> 00:39:30.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:31.350
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
What's happening?

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:32.433
Someone explain this work.

00:39:32.433 --> 00:39:33.980
AUDIENCE: There's a wedding.

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:34.380
SULTAN SOOUD AL
QASSEMI: There's a what?

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.922
AUDIENCE: There's
a wedding, I guess.

00:39:35.922 --> 00:39:37.546
SULTAN SOOUD AL
QASSEMI: OK, before you

00:39:37.546 --> 00:39:39.990
go to the details,
what's the overall image?

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.680
Before we go--

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:41.816
AUDIENCE: A protector.

00:39:41.816 --> 00:39:43.066
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI: What?

00:39:43.066 --> 00:39:45.010
AUDIENCE: Someone in
the army is protecting.

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:46.590
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
Someone is-- wait, is this?

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:46.890
AUDIENCE: Not the armies.

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:47.890
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
Do you think army?

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:49.200
AUDIENCE: No, it's someone.

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.991
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
This is maybe more

00:39:50.991 --> 00:39:53.560
of a peasant, maybe more of
a peasant, maybe more of--

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.641
I think the message
is the everyday man.

00:39:55.641 --> 00:39:56.140
I don't--

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:57.240
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.448
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI: Huh?

00:39:58.448 --> 00:39:59.810
Oh, sorry.

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:02.820
So what you see here, you
see sort of the everyday man.

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:05.740
The Egyptian was
carrying a weapon.

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:07.940
And the weapon is what?

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:09.055
It's a Russian.

00:40:09.055 --> 00:40:10.044
It's a Russian weapon.

00:40:10.044 --> 00:40:11.710
I think it's a
Kalashnikov or something.

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:13.270
I'm not sure.

00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:14.440
What's in the background?

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:18.670
You see here the guys looking
to-- what is this area?

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:19.690
What is that?

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:21.650
It's not the dam, no.

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:22.500
It's not the dam.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:23.670
It's Sinai.

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:25.780
This is Sinai that
was taken over.

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:28.020
But what is Sinai
represented as?

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:31.300
Is it very green, and there's
a lot of life and children

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:32.350
are playing?

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:33.685
What is Sinai to the Egyptians?

00:40:33.685 --> 00:40:35.020
AUDIENCE: It's barren
land that we don't want.

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:35.910
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
It's a barren land

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:37.076
that there's nothing really.

00:40:37.076 --> 00:40:38.650
Why are you guys so upset?

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:40.592
You know, like, what's
the big deal, guys?

00:40:40.592 --> 00:40:41.300
This was nothing.

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:43.133
It was just a little
bit of sand and desert.

00:40:43.133 --> 00:40:44.050
And it disappeared.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:46.660
And on the other hand that
he's protected behind him,

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.680
what's happening there?

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.950
What are the factories?

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:53.500
What's the smoke?

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.192
The smoke is industry, right?

00:40:55.192 --> 00:40:55.900
What's happening?

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:57.550
Look, there's people
in the background.

00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:59.980
There's a mosque.

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:01.960
There's homes.

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:02.800
Look at this.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.030
What's this here?

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:06.400
Factory workers
coming back from work.

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.782
OK, so contrast both sides.

00:41:08.782 --> 00:41:09.740
Look at the propaganda.

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:11.650
It's amazing.

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:12.670
Look at both sides.

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:16.084
And then, what's happening under
his hand, under his protection?

00:41:16.084 --> 00:41:16.750
What do you see?

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:17.230
AUDIENCE: The community.

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:17.710
AUDIENCE: Life.

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:18.190
AUDIENCE: Life.

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:18.490
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI: Huh?

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:18.970
AUDIENCE: Life.

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:19.300
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI: Life.

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:19.990
What do you see?

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:20.864
Give me more details.

00:41:20.864 --> 00:41:22.073
AUDIENCE: Women and children.

00:41:22.073 --> 00:41:24.280
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
Wedding, women and children.

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.765
We have an x-rated scene here.

00:41:25.765 --> 00:41:26.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:29.650
OK, I don't know
where his hands are.

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:30.850
You have children playing.

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:32.320
Huh?

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.030
You have children playing.

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:35.230
You have-- I'm not sure.

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:36.640
Is that a women breastfeeding?

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.080
Anyway, there's a lot of things
going on in this painting.

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.750
So basically, the
message, guys--

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:43.720
guys, the message
is life goes on.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:49.570
Life goes on in Egypt under the
protection of the Egyptian man.

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:52.970
But not everyone was very
happy with Abdel Nasser.

00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:55.780
Unlike Hamid Ewais, you
had Injia Efflatoun.

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:57.100
I told you about her before.

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.214
Remember her name.

00:41:58.214 --> 00:41:59.380
She was an incredible woman.

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:02.770
I know I'm taking more
time than I should.

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:06.230
But Injia Efflatoun
was so important.

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:09.610
And I feel like someone needs
to make a movie about her life.

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:13.630
She was the daughter of a
middle class, upper middle class

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:14.470
family.

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:15.880
They spoke French at home.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:16.840
They played the piano.

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.790
She had a tutor.

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:19.540
Her name was Inji.

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:22.150
Her sister was
Girespi or something.

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:24.495
You know, what is this family?

00:42:24.495 --> 00:42:27.310
Some names like that.

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:30.340
So Inji Efflatoun
basically became

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:33.010
a member of this elitist
movement of Egypt.

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:35.680
She became a member of
this anti-revolution--

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.860
sorry, anti-monarchy,
pro-revolutionary movement.

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:43.450
And when the Egyptian
monarchy was overthrown,

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:45.820
she was excited, because
she was a communist.

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:49.310
And she saw that a new socialist
government is taking over.

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:53.020
However, by the
1950s, late '50s,

00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:56.110
she realized that Abdel Nasser
was not communist enough.

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:57.780
He's like, what is this joke?

00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:03.400
OK, I want someone who is
more radical than this.

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:04.540
We demand more.

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:08.230
So she became a member of
this Egyptian feminist group.

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:09.640
They went on a protest.

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:13.390
And in 1958, I think she
was arrested and thrown

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:16.960
in jail for four years
under Abdel Nasser.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.114
She was not jailed
under the king.

00:43:19.114 --> 00:43:20.530
She was jailed
under Abdel Nasser.

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:21.640
Can you imagine?

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:24.020
So when she was in jail,
she was able to smuggle--

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:27.790
there's a beautiful-- there's
an autobiography by her

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:29.820
that-- she had written
her own biography.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:33.550
And she talks
about life in jail.

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:35.050
It's an incredible story.

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:37.330
But she was able to smuggle
in these small canvases

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:40.600
and paint the women
of the jail with her.

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.560
You know how we now
think we're very,

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:46.040
very smart when we use
the number seven to write

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.465
the [NON-ENGLISH],,
and I don't know what.

00:43:48.465 --> 00:43:51.280
And the [NON-ENGLISH],, and
all these-- oh, we're so cool.

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:52.630
We're so millennial.

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:53.570
We can write this.

00:43:53.570 --> 00:44:00.070
So Inji Efflatoun
did this in 1958.

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:02.700
If you guys think
you're so cool, so hip.

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:06.200
What she did, she wrote
letters to her sister.

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.150
I love this story.

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:13.000
She wrote letters to her sister
in Arabic using Latin script.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.300
And then they thought she was
a spy, because she was writing

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:17.780
a lot of weird gibberish.

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:18.880
Literally, you read it--

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:23.620
it's Arabic but written in Latin
letters, in English letters.

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:26.140
And her lawyer-- because
only her and her sister

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:27.250
could read the letters.

00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:30.970
And her lawyer argued
that his client is crazy.

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:33.430
And that's how she got
out of being in trouble.

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:36.160
But he said, how
can you even put her

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:37.160
in solitary confinement?

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:38.410
She's already crazy.

00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:39.400
And she is writing--

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:39.941
what is this?

00:44:39.941 --> 00:44:41.170
Nobody can read this.

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:42.950
So it's an amazing story.

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:46.290
So Inji Efflatoun went from
being a radical leftist

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:51.720
to being jailed and then
becoming sort of very yes-- no,

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.700
not anti-government as much.

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:54.600
I like this poster.

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.680
Again, it's a very
important poster of--

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:00.600
in 1982, it was the
first and only exhibition

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.160
of Arab art in Israel.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.380
So as part of the
Camp David Accords,

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:07.560
the Egyptians agreed to
send art to Tel Aviv.

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.510
And so this was the
poster of the show.

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:13.410
Very little documentation
exists of this show.

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:14.132
But it was--

00:45:14.132 --> 00:45:16.590
I want to show you as an example
of how the government also

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:19.650
use art for political ends.

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:23.680
Palestine is a major, major
theme in the Arab world.

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.680
And I will just skim
over it very quickly.

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:30.540
This is one of the most iconic
works by Ismail Shamout called,

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:31.760
"Where To?"

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:33.240
and was painted
five years after--

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.040
again, depicting
how a Palestinian,

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:36.720
basically, is going
from home to home.

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.610
And he's carrying his
children with him.

00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:40.800
And he looks like
he's lost everything.

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.890
Here, you have [INAUDIBLE]
in 1960s depicting

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:46.950
the [NON-ENGLISH] who
are the freedom fighters.

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:51.690
[INAUDIBLE] again,
Marwan Kassab-Bachi

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:55.050
depicting Palestinian children
who are painted as giants.

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:57.750
So even though they're 15 years
old here, they're teenagers,

00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:58.999
but they're painted as giants.

00:45:58.999 --> 00:46:00.321
They look down on you.

00:46:00.321 --> 00:46:01.570
This is based on a true story.

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:02.861
I don't want to go into it now.

00:46:02.861 --> 00:46:04.590
Abdul Qader Al Rais
is from the UAE,

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:08.094
again, depicting
Palestinian throwing stones

00:46:08.094 --> 00:46:10.260
at one of the occupation
soldiers in the background.

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:12.360
You can't see it, but there
is an occupation soldier

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:13.110
in the background.

00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:15.720
Sliman Mansour, of course, the
most iconic painting, maybe,

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:20.220
of the Arab world of the 20th
century, Jamal Al Mahamel,

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:22.350
"Camel of Burdens."

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:24.630
Another work, al-Azzawi
"Sabra and Shatila"

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:28.020
painting, which was
acquired by the Tate Modern,

00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:29.610
probably for over
a million dollars.

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:31.318
Nobody really knows
the number, but maybe

00:46:31.318 --> 00:46:34.560
for over a million,
million and a half dollars.

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:37.850
I filmed an episode
of this work.

00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:39.750
So you can watch it
if you want later.

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:43.040
Interestingly, the
Palestinians in 1978,

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:45.640
in the midst of the
Lebanese civil war, which

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:48.870
is really interesting for
me, invited 200 artists

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:51.450
from around the world to
send works in solidarity

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:52.499
with the Palestinians.

00:46:52.499 --> 00:46:54.040
And the work made
it through Lebanon,

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.372
and it was shown in Lebanon.

00:46:55.372 --> 00:46:57.330
And all these artists
from all over the world--

00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:59.280
Latin America, Europe,
the Middle East--

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.320
all sent paintings to Palestine.

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:04.230
It was called the International
Exhibition for Solidarity

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:05.580
or something with Palestine.

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:06.663
This is a picture from it.

00:47:06.663 --> 00:47:09.801
The exhibition only lasted
for about a month or so.

00:47:09.801 --> 00:47:11.550
This is a list of
artists that took place.

00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:12.480
You can see it.

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.610
But unfortunately,
a lot of the works

00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:16.530
were destroyed or
disappeared, because they

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:19.890
were kept in storage in the
PLO headquarters in Beirut.

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:21.720
And guess what the
first thing the Israelis

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:23.959
did in 1982 when
they stormed Beirut?

00:47:23.959 --> 00:47:25.500
They went after the
PLO headquarters,

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:29.940
and they demolished and
they stole a lot of things.

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:34.230
This is a fascinating piece
by a Palestinian artist,

00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:35.064
very political work.

00:47:35.064 --> 00:47:36.646
If you look at this
work, and you say,

00:47:36.646 --> 00:47:37.720
ah, it's just a cactus.

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:38.970
Sultan is bullshitting again.

00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:40.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.480
But actually, it's
a very, very--

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.860
it's all about
identity politics.

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:46.410
Asim Abu Shaqra
was a Palestinian

00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:50.730
born in the town of Umm al-Fahm
in northern occupied Palestine

00:47:50.730 --> 00:47:52.860
and northern Israel.

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:56.610
And he was one of the
very first Palestinians

00:47:56.610 --> 00:48:00.330
to enter into the Kalisher
Academy of Art, which is later

00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:02.320
incorporated into Tel Aviv art--

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.530
Tel Aviv University.

00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:08.970
And he started painting
the sabra, the cactus,

00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:10.820
as a symbol of
Palestinian resistance.

00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:12.570
And a lot of people
didn't understand what

00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:13.736
he was doing in those years.

00:48:13.736 --> 00:48:16.110
Unfortunately, he
died at the age of 28

00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:18.390
from asbestos
poisoning and cancer.

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:21.450
But he was-- just like van Gogh,
who was doing the sunflowers,

00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:23.700
he kept painting over
and over the cactus.

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:27.344
But what is the symbolism of
cactus for the Palestinians?

00:48:27.344 --> 00:48:28.230
AUDIENCE: Resilience.

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:29.390
SULTAN SOOUD AL
QASSEMI: Well done.

00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:30.660
I don't know who said that.

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:31.250
Thank you.

00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:32.130
Resilience.

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:36.030
So the fact that a
cactus plant or a cacti

00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:39.810
can resist the fact that
they're from the ground.

00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:42.210
The fact that they don't
change their thorns no matter

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:43.410
how long time passes.

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:44.100
They stay.

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:47.400
The fact that they can survive
in different conditions

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:48.460
under pressure.

00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:51.090
So he sort of compared
himself to the cactus

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:55.590
that has been removed from the
wilderness and from Umm al-Fahm

00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:58.890
and planted in Tel Aviv
and put into a pot.

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:03.015
So he sort of uses identity
politics in his art.

00:49:03.015 --> 00:49:04.890
There's so much to say
about Asim Abu Shaqra,

00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:09.170
but I will skip so that we can
all go home and have dinner.

00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:12.100
Again, Khaled Jarrar,
another Palestinian artist

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.340
who went through
the apartheid wall

00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:16.260
and started chipping
pieces from it

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:21.960
and reconstituting it
into toys, a bear, bread--

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:24.120
in this case, a
volleyball, doing

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:26.820
more than one thing, number one,
representing all the children

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:29.490
who have been stopped from
playing with each other because

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:31.860
of the giant wall that
came up in between them.

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:34.609
So all the football
fields, all the volleyball

00:49:34.609 --> 00:49:36.900
whatever you want to call
them, the playing fields that

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:38.200
have been disrupted.

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.780
But also, he's mocking the wall.

00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:41.530
He's saying, this wall
is nothing for us.

00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:45.340
He is making a mockery
of the war itself.

00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:47.030
This is a short video
I will show you.

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:52.435
So in 2011 or so, a Palestinian
artist based in Denmark,

00:49:52.435 --> 00:49:57.450
called Larissa Sansour, applied
for a competition in Geneva.

00:49:57.450 --> 00:50:00.330
The competition was
sponsored by Lacoste.

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:03.060
And it was organized by a
museum called the Musee de

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:06.850
l'Elysee in Geneve.

00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:10.560
And when she submitted
the idea, she's

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.060
like, this is what I want to do.

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:14.190
Lacoste was like, WTF?

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:15.150
No, thanks.

00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:16.780
They're like, we
don't like this idea.

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:17.742
It's too political.

00:50:17.742 --> 00:50:18.700
What do you want to do?

00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:22.545
Oh, I have this idea to
create a tower in Palestine

00:50:22.545 --> 00:50:24.270
where all the
Palestinians can live.

00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:27.990
And this will be a solution
to the Palestinian problem.

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:30.370
We will build a skyscraper.

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:33.520
And all the Palestinians
will live in Palestine

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:34.710
within the skyscraper.

00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:36.900
Of course, she has
artistic license.

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:40.140
She is not serious, but
this is her art project.

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:41.542
And Lacoste were horrified.

00:50:41.542 --> 00:50:43.500
They said they saw it
and were like, no, no no.

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:44.210
Change it.

00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:46.140
And she goes, I'm
not changing my art.

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:47.197
And they said, change it.

00:50:47.197 --> 00:50:48.030
I'm not changing it.

00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:48.990
You're not changing it?

00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:50.031
Then you're disqualified.

00:50:50.031 --> 00:50:51.550
You're out of the competition.

00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:53.050
And so a lot of
people came together

00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:55.060
and raised money for
her to create the video

00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:55.750
that I'm going to show you.

00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:58.333
It's a long video, so I'm only
showing you a short clip of it.

00:50:58.333 --> 00:51:00.780
But as you see, this is
Larissa herself waiting

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:04.350
in the lobby of the skyscraper.

00:51:04.350 --> 00:51:08.200
You see every city in every
town of Palestine is one floor.

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:10.360
So basically, the idea that
everyone from Jerusalem

00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:11.443
lives in the second floor.

00:51:11.443 --> 00:51:13.980
Everyone from Nazareth
lives in the sixth floor.

00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:18.294
So here she's seen watering
her, of course, an olive tree.

00:51:18.294 --> 00:51:19.710
And you see that
she's overlooking

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:23.907
the Al-Aqsa in the background.

00:51:23.907 --> 00:51:25.740
And I think now I'm
going to show you just--

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:27.172
maybe just a minute
of the video.

00:51:27.172 --> 00:51:29.130
This is the introduction
on how she's arrived--

00:51:32.546 --> 00:51:35.340
she's arriving now
at the skyscraper.

00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:36.512
She's moving in.

00:51:36.512 --> 00:51:39.404
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:51:43.484 --> 00:51:45.900
She's also a fashion designer,
so everything you see here,

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:46.858
she's designed herself.

00:51:46.858 --> 00:51:49.758
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:52:08.492 --> 00:52:10.910
Have they shown the
Palestine flags, or not yet?

00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:11.660
AUDIENCE: Not yet.

00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:12.826
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI: OK.

00:52:12.826 --> 00:52:14.906
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:43.965
These are all of the towns.

00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:53.370
The name of the video is "Nation
State," not "Nation States."

00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:02.540
Oh, this is the poster,
"Living the High Life."

00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:04.920
So smart.

00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:06.770
OK, so let's move on.

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:10.680
It's a 7 and 1/2 minute video.

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:12.730
Oh, that's her sister,
by the way, and her--

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:14.799
and her brother, I
think, in the video.

00:53:14.799 --> 00:53:16.590
Again, all the clothes
are designed by her,

00:53:16.590 --> 00:53:18.190
because she's into
science fiction.

00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:23.960
And I think if I press
a button I can move on.

00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:25.830
Maybe you have to exit.

00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:26.678
Wonderful.

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:32.680
Oh yeah, so pre-Arab Spring--

00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:35.080
so a lot of artists depicted
a lot of political events,

00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:39.210
including the destruction
of Iraq in the 1991 war.

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:43.110
Here, you see one of the
sculpture of Ishtar crying.

00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:48.690
The red flag, the angel,
has had its limbs cut off.

00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:51.930
This is poster by a Kuwaiti
that became a stencil

00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:55.350
during the occupation of Saddam
forces of Kuwait in 1991.

00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:56.710
I love these two works.

00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:58.410
This is an artist
called Walid Ebeid

00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:01.050
who depicted a lot of the
events in Egypt that really

00:54:01.050 --> 00:54:03.510
led to the uprising of 2011.

00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:05.260
In this case, he shows
you the bread line.

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:09.490
So one of the slogans of the
Egyptian uprising of 2011 was

00:54:09.490 --> 00:54:10.740
[NON-ENGLISH], which is bread.

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:11.760
So people wanted bread.

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.560
So here, he's showing
you the bread lines

00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:16.920
as far back as 2005, and
this is not the first time

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.200
that riots erupted in
Egypt because of bread.

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:21.870
So you see here, a lot of
these people standing in line.

00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:23.910
They have cash in
hand, but there isn't

00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:25.420
enough bread for everybody.

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:27.295
Even though they have
the money, there's just

00:54:27.295 --> 00:54:28.620
five or six loaves of bread.

00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:31.020
And there there's so many
more people waiting outside.

00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:32.880
Again, Walid Ebeid
here depicting

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:40.050
a lot of the injustices
that were taking place,

00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:43.220
a lot of the police
brutality against some

00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:47.400
of the Egyptians in the 2007--
again 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:50.820
led to a lot of anger
in the streets of Egypt.

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:54.090
I love this work by Mohssin
Haraki, a Moroccan artist

00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:57.450
who talks about the
fossilization of education

00:54:57.450 --> 00:54:58.350
in Morocco.

00:54:58.350 --> 00:55:00.540
So as you see here, he has--

00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:03.510
not only does he have
the history book,

00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:06.510
he has the religious
studies book

00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:09.400
also as part of the series.

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:11.610
But I love that he
has the Constitution.

00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:13.950
So he says that the Constitution
is not being updated.

00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:14.690
It's fossilized.

00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:15.940
It's become cemented.

00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:20.070
So again, artists are talking
about political issues

00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:21.580
through their art in the region.

00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:26.010
This is a work that we got into
some hot water in Singapore

00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:27.030
when we showed it.

00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:30.791
It's a piece by Sharif Waked,
the Palestinian artist.

00:55:30.791 --> 00:55:33.290
Basically, when you see this,
what's the first word you see?

00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:35.261
What's the first
word you think of?

00:55:35.261 --> 00:55:35.760
Quick.

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.050
AUDIENCE: ISIS.

00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:38.850
SULTAN SOOUD AL
QASSEMI: ISIS, wow.

00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:39.897
OK, another word?

00:55:39.897 --> 00:55:40.730
AUDIENCE: Terrorist.

00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:42.396
SULTAN SOOUD AL
QASSEMI: Terrorist, yes.

00:55:42.396 --> 00:55:44.710
OK, so I'm not sure ISIS
has done this before,

00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:46.980
but you're right.

00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:47.897
AUDIENCE: Top of mind.

00:55:47.897 --> 00:55:49.646
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
Top of your mind.

00:55:49.646 --> 00:55:52.170
So basically, I want to
explain this work for you,

00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:55.810
because it's very important.

00:55:55.810 --> 00:56:00.690
Sharif Waked talks about
how you judge people

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:02.135
from the first hand--

00:56:02.135 --> 00:56:03.010
from the first sight.

00:56:03.010 --> 00:56:05.190
Here, he talks about
this individual

00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:09.125
that you immediately assume
is someone who wants to die.

00:56:09.125 --> 00:56:10.750
However, when you
play the video, which

00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:13.230
I will not be playing
for you to save time,

00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:16.200
he is reading a book.

00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:17.860
What's the book
that he's reading?

00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:20.670
He's reading a book,
"1,001 Arabian Nights."

00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:23.100
And I'm sure you know the story
of "1,001 Arabian Nights."

00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:26.112
Someone tell me the story quick.

00:56:26.112 --> 00:56:27.919
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:27.919 --> 00:56:29.460
SULTAN SOOUD AL
QASSEMI: Scheherazade

00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:31.240
tells what to Shahryar?

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:32.460
What does she want from him?

00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:33.690
AUDIENCE: To keep her alive.

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:34.660
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
To keep her alive.

00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:35.579
Does she want to die?

00:56:35.579 --> 00:56:36.120
AUDIENCE: No.

00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:37.260
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
She doesn't want to die.

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:39.130
She wants to live another day.

00:56:39.130 --> 00:56:41.362
Likewise, this individual
doesn't want to die.

00:56:41.362 --> 00:56:42.570
He wants to live another day.

00:56:42.570 --> 00:56:44.790
So that's the idea of the work.

00:56:44.790 --> 00:56:47.340
A lot of artists, like
Ali Cherri of Lebanon,

00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:51.480
depicted contemporary events
with this 2011 uprising.

00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:54.210
Or Sulafa Hijazi, which I
love this work very much, very

00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:55.470
controversial.

00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:59.110
Does anybody here want to
imagine what it's about?

00:56:59.110 --> 00:57:03.330
So you all know the story of
Rapunzel, the German fable.

00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:06.190
So the idea here is
that some of the clerics

00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:08.730
are giving a helping hand
for some of the militants

00:57:08.730 --> 00:57:09.810
to rise up.

00:57:09.810 --> 00:57:13.410
So Sulafa Hijazi is a
Syrian based in Berlin,

00:57:13.410 --> 00:57:14.640
a very controversial piece.

00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:16.514
I have another controversial
piece coming up.

00:57:16.514 --> 00:57:18.750
So if you feel offended,
you should look away now.

00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:22.800
So this is a work, again,
by Sulafa Hijazi from 2011.

00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:26.190
She's talking, basically,
about these soldiers who

00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:29.310
feel that they have some
kind of raw emotion,

00:57:29.310 --> 00:57:32.250
that they get sexually
aroused in a way when

00:57:32.250 --> 00:57:34.980
it comes to seeing
protesters in the street.

00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:36.840
They see them
protesting, and they

00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:38.476
get that they want
to shoot their load.

00:57:38.476 --> 00:57:39.600
They want to go after them.

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:40.474
You know what I mean?

00:57:40.474 --> 00:57:44.880
They're almost like an
animalistic feeling.

00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:46.280
This work, I really like.

00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.930
Abdulnasser Gharem was
a lieutenant colonel,

00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:51.180
I think, in the Saudi Air Force.

00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:54.870
And in 2009, he created
this work called,

00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:57.287
"No More Tears," where he
took the stickers of-- you

00:57:57.287 --> 00:57:58.245
know Johnson &amp; Johnson?

00:57:58.245 --> 00:57:58.745
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:58.745 --> 00:57:59.459
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:57:59.459 --> 00:58:01.500
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
I'm sure your moms all--

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:03.640
you showered as kids
in Johnson &amp; Johnson.

00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:07.500
And so he removed the
Johnson &amp; Johnson stickers,

00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:10.440
and he placed them on a
map of the Arab world.

00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:16.980
So in 2009, you can imagine,
what were the trouble spots?

00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:18.840
Someone tell me, what
were the trouble spots

00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:19.590
of the Arab world?

00:58:19.590 --> 00:58:20.053
AUDIENCE: Iraq.

00:58:20.053 --> 00:58:20.516
AUDIENCE: Syria.

00:58:20.516 --> 00:58:20.980
AUDIENCE: Palestine.

00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:22.230
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI: Iraq.

00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:24.720
Iraq, Palestine, Somalia.

00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:25.730
No, in 2009.

00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:27.030
AUDIENCE: South Sudan.

00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:29.100
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
South Sudan, 2009.

00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:30.930
The interesting thing
also-- before we

00:58:30.930 --> 00:58:32.850
move to the next work,
the interesting thing

00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:38.850
about this work is, what
do the no more tears drops

00:58:38.850 --> 00:58:40.580
look like as well.

00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:41.247
AUDIENCE: Blood.

00:58:41.247 --> 00:58:42.538
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI: Blood?

00:58:42.538 --> 00:58:43.038
Good.

00:58:43.038 --> 00:58:43.537
And?

00:58:43.537 --> 00:58:44.610
AUDIENCE: Bombs, I guess.

00:58:44.610 --> 00:58:46.180
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
No, something else.

00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:47.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:47.900
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI: No.

00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:49.220
What do we export in the Gulf?

00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:50.030
AUDIENCE: Oil.

00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:50.450
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI: Oil.

00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:53.240
They look like oil, drops of
oil, when you look at them.

00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:57.260
Anyway, so what he did
was that he revisits--

00:58:57.260 --> 00:59:01.730
in 2014, he revisits
the theme of this work.

00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:03.920
And he creates an
updated version.

00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:05.795
Can you imagine what happened?

00:59:05.795 --> 00:59:06.950
Do you want to see?

00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:07.792
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:59:07.792 --> 00:59:09.750
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI:
This is what happened.

00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:11.020
It's all over the region.

00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:14.560
There's really the agony and
sadness all over the region--

00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:17.460
in Libya, in Syria,
in Tunis, in Yemen.

00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:19.064
AUDIENCE: In spite
of the three drops

00:59:19.064 --> 00:59:21.549
that weren't on the map
in the previous one,

00:59:21.549 --> 00:59:24.040
was he hinting that they
were going somewhere?

00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:26.456
SULTAN SOOUD AL QASSEMI: Maybe
he's predicting the future.

00:59:26.456 --> 00:59:27.425
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:27.425 --> 00:59:29.050
SULTAN SOOUD AL
QASSEMI: More to come--

00:59:29.050 --> 00:59:31.580
another bigger-- they're
bigger and bigger.

00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:34.382
Yeah, it's a disaster.

00:59:34.382 --> 00:59:35.340
So this is interesting.

00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:37.560
We have one work
left to show you.

00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:39.810
So a lot of people
in the Gulf, they're

00:59:39.810 --> 00:59:42.060
very careful when they're
critical of the governments.

00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:43.717
And so you don't
see a lot of artwork

00:59:43.717 --> 00:59:45.300
that are critical
of governments here.

00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:49.680
But this is an interesting
piece by a GCC artist

00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:52.200
called the GCC,
the micro-council.

00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:54.570
The collective is called
the GCC Collective.

00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:56.640
And this work from 2014 is it--

00:59:56.640 --> 01:00:00.450
2013, they create--
they recreate

01:00:00.450 --> 01:00:06.276
the GCC, the table where
they meet, all the leaders.

01:00:06.276 --> 01:00:07.650
And you look at
the work, and you

01:00:07.650 --> 01:00:10.580
think, oh, it's very beautiful.

01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:11.910
All the flags are there.

01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:15.150
The rubbish bins are made
of gold or whatever that is.

01:00:15.150 --> 01:00:16.170
They're all meeting.

01:00:16.170 --> 01:00:19.350
However, most Kuwaitis
have much more leeway

01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:22.677
and freedom when it comes
to political discussion.

01:00:22.677 --> 01:00:24.135
They wanted to put
them in context.

01:00:28.570 --> 01:00:30.300
So you can imagine.

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:33.950
So what the message basically
is that you will be scrutinized.

01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:36.600
So when you visit this work
and you walk next to it,

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:40.350
you look down and you
scrutinize the meeting--

01:00:40.350 --> 01:00:42.480
the meeting and the
leaders themselves.

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.380
So this is the whole
idea of the work.

01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:48.870
So this is how Kuwaitis sort
of interact with events here

01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:50.440
in the region.

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.280
Very last work that
I will show you,

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:57.400
unfortunately, is the work I
feel that reflects the region.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:00.050
I'm always sad to
end with this piece.

01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:02.240
It's a piece by
Mona Hatoum, who was

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.650
a Beirut-born, Palestinian
artist now based

01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:07.530
in the UK-- is very, very
important, had solo exhibitions

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:09.350
all over the world.

01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:11.580
Mona Hatoum's
"Infinity" basically

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:13.920
encompasses the region.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:18.960
What you see is soldiers
standing in eternal fights,

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.760
shooting each other forever.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:24.120
They are depicted as
toys, because they

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:26.070
are being controlled by others.

01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:27.780
They are replaceable.

01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:29.640
Have you ever seen
the green soldiers?

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:33.017
When you lose one of them,
you just buy another batch.

01:01:33.017 --> 01:01:35.100
So the idea is that they
really keep replenishing.

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:36.300
They're never-ending.

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:39.970
And they're also placed
on a coffee table.

01:01:39.970 --> 01:01:42.050
And the idea of placing
them on a coffee table

01:01:42.050 --> 01:01:45.900
is to show you how
wars are domesticated.

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:48.701
Wars have effects
on the household.

01:01:48.701 --> 01:01:50.200
And I feel like
this really reflects

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:55.290
the region where you have
eternal, perpetual wars, wars

01:01:55.290 --> 01:01:58.280
that affect the region,
where people are almost

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:03.240
standing constantly with a gun
to the back of someone else,

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.360
and you never know
what's coming for you,

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:12.030
and also the idea that there
is always an endless supply

01:02:12.030 --> 01:02:13.410
of available people to fight.

01:02:13.410 --> 01:02:15.130
