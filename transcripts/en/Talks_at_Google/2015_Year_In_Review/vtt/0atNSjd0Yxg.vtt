ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.111
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:08.150
My name is Artur Oliveira, and I
am on the Talks at Google team.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.650
I am very excited to welcome
to Google today the great actor

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.710
and comedian Rainn Wilson.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.830
He's here to talk
about his new memoir

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.710
"The Bassoon King-- My Life
in Art, Faith, and Idiocy."

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.210
Now, we all know Rainn as
the lovable Dwight Schrute

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.860
from NBC's "The Office."

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.910
But the thing is that
through "The Bassoon King,"

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.610
Rainn really lets us
know who he really is

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.080
and what his career
has been like.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.480
So with that, I would love
to welcome up Rainn Wilson.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.290
RAINN WILSON: Thanks, Artur.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.235
Hello.

00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:43.610
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Thank you very
much for coming to Google.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.276
RAINN WILSON: Hey,
thanks for having me.

00:00:45.276 --> 00:00:46.010
I love it here.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.470
This is great.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.290
Free food.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.220
Sign me up.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.850
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: We're very
happy that you're here.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.940
Like I said in the intro,
we all love "The Office,"

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.690
but I think what
I especially loved

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.620
about "The Bassoon
King" is really getting

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.770
to know your life story.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.240
And what was really
interesting to me,

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.810
what I wanted to start off
with, is it's easy for us

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.972
to see people who are famous
and think that they just did it.

00:01:19.972 --> 00:01:22.180
The snapped their fingers,
and they got on a TV show,

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.680
they got in a movie,
whatever it is.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.850
But you talk so much about the
ups and downs of your career.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.970
What made you want
to make yourself so

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.510
vulnerable with the audience?

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.880
RAINN WILSON: Well,
I did research,

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.590
and I had read a lot of
celebrity memoirs when I was

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.520
getting ready to write this,
because I wanted to see what

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.170
worked and what didn't.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.970
And one of the things that
I thought did not work

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.676
was memoirs where I read,
and I didn't know the person

00:01:47.676 --> 00:01:49.050
at the end of the
memoir any more

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.950
than I did at the beginning.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:58.790
What I responded to, personally,
were the heartfelt stories,

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.240
the vulnerabilities, the
struggles, the ups and downs,

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.640
the roller coaster ride
that the person went on.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.590
And those are the things
that I could relate

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.002
to and kind of learn from.

00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:10.710
And I also found them
to be the funniest,

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.080
because they struck a nerve.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.100
They struck a deeper chord.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.510
So I swung for the fences.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.920
I really was like, I want
this-- I'm going to write one.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.260
This is who I am and
this is what I'm about.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.450
And if I walk out here
on Charleston and get

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.746
hit by a bus, and
this is the document

00:02:33.746 --> 00:02:34.870
that-- it's got everything.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.620
It's all my failures
and struggles,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.560
and I get hit by the Google bus.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.002
No one will even look up
from their Wi-Fi computers,

00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:42.710
they'll be like--

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.750
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: That
would be very tragic.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.041
There's got to be someone
here who runs the buses.

00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:55.290
They're just kind of panicking
in the back of the room

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.000
somewhere.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.958
RAINN WILSON: But if I
was hit by a Google car,

00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.700
it would be going
seven miles an hour,

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.970
so I'd probably
knock the car over.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.620
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Thanks
for explaining that.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.470
Does that also tie in to why
you decided to write it now?

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.242
Why not 20 years from now?

00:03:14.242 --> 00:03:16.200
RAINN WILSON: Well, there
was a window of time,

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.010
and it just seemed like
the right opportunity.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.150
I finished "The Office,"
and right away I

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.514
shot a pilot for
the show "Backstrom"

00:03:24.514 --> 00:03:26.930
that ran on Fox for a little
while before it was canceled.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.780
One person whistled.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.840
One person groaned,
because no one watched it.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.930
And then I had this
nice chunk of time,

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.060
and I thought, well,
this is a time to do it.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.670
Actually, I was here at
Google maybe five years ago,

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.050
where we read from
our SoulPancake book,

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.519
"SoulPancake-- Chew on
Life's Big Questions."

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.310
When I wrote the
introduction of that book,

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.170
I saw that there was a
story there that I really

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.250
wanted to tell.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.800
Yeah, there's the funny stories
of worms coming out of my butt

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.485
in Nicaragua, and being a
starving actor and broke

00:04:05.485 --> 00:04:08.325
and struggling, and trying
to make my way in LA,

00:04:08.325 --> 00:04:10.770
and being a nerd
in high school--

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.430
I know there's a lot
of funny stories.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.450
But there's also a through line
of my spiritual and artistic

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.060
journey that I
thought made it a book

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.666
and not just a collection
of funny anecdotes.

00:04:23.666 --> 00:04:24.790
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Absolutely.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.840
It's a very cohesive story
from beginning to end,

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.690
and we can see your
growth as a person

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.740
and as an actor
throughout the book, which

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.480
is why I'm so excited for
everyone to be able to read it.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.720
So now taking a step
back, I think we're all

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.530
wondering about the name.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.620
Why "The Bassoon King"?

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:49.760
RAINN WILSON: Well, I played
the bassoon for five years

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.060
in junior high and high school.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.120
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Do
you still play it?

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.680
RAINN WILSON: No.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.520
I dug one out about
five or six days ago,

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.478
because I had to play it
on "The Colbert Show."

00:05:00.478 --> 00:05:03.570
I hadn't played a
bassoon in 30 years.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.040
But I have a little
section here I'm

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.110
going to read about the
bassoon, and about being

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.300
nerdy in high school.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.390
Maybe a few of you can relate.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.770
A couple, one or
two of you, might

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.850
be able to relate just a
teeny, teeny little bit.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.090
All right, ready, children?

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.060
"I ask you to savor
the following sentence.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.070
For several years off
and on, I was a member

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.160
of the following clubs at
school-- marching band,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.660
pep band, orchestra, debate
club, computer club, chess

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.630
club, model United
Nations, and pottery club.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.850
Note the above list does not
include my aforementioned role

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.060
playing gaming, Baha'i youth
activities, medieval weapons

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.730
sketching, kung fu movie
obsession, or vast Columbia

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.360
Record and Tape Club
cassette collection,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.660
featuring Journey, Styx,
Asia, and REO Speedwagon.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.570
And then, if that wasn't enough,
I decided to play the bassoon.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.490
Boom, universe explodes, then
implodes, then explodes again,

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.070
quickly folding
in on itself, only

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.880
to create infinite other
bassoon-shaped universes.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.420
Let's dig a little
deeper, shall we?

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.600
Having studied piano as
a kid and then clarinet

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.400
at Kellogg Middle School,
I went to my band teacher

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.650
and told him I wanted to quit
clarinet and play tenor sax.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.230
Saxophone was way
cooler, you see.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.670
Guys in the sax section
would crack jokes and wear

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.920
sunglasses in class sometimes.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.090
Clarinet wasn't
pathetically loserish--

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.840
I mean, it wasn't French
horn-- but it certainly

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.150
wasn't the most
masculine of instruments.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.130
Sure, there was a clarinet-like
instrument in the Cantina scene

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.440
in "Star Wars,"
but let's face it.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.160
Clarinets are for
girls in braces

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.175
and Woody Allen, who loves
girls in braces, ba-bum, bum.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.489
My band teacher, John
Law-- real name--

00:06:54.489 --> 00:06:55.780
really pulled a fast one on me.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.488
He said something to
the effect of, well,

00:06:57.488 --> 00:07:00.550
you could play the sax, but
we've got so many saxophones

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:01.620
right now.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.700
Wait a minute-- he paused
for dramatic effect

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.310
and lowered his voice
conspiratorially-- you know

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.190
what's really cool and unique?

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.830
And I was like, what?

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.730
What's really cool and unique?

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.670
And he was like, the bassoon.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.490
And I was like,
wow, what's that?

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.730
And with that
ridiculous manipulation,

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.070
a bassoonist was born.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.620
The bassoon is absurd.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.940
They should be banned for
being horrible, unnecessary,

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.200
and adenoidally grating.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.274
It takes, like, an
hour to assemble one.

00:07:31.274 --> 00:07:32.690
They're enormous,
and are made out

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:36.744
of Lincoln logs, aluminum
twigs, and paper towel tubes.

00:07:36.744 --> 00:07:38.410
There are these tiny
double wooden reeds

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.086
that you have to soak and
trim and tend to all the time.

00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:42.460
There's a strap
that you actually

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.330
have to sit on when you play
so the whole thing doesn't

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:49.340
fall onto the floor like
a bundle of garbage.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.540
And after all that
folderol, it ends up

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.821
sounding like an anemic
donkey with laryngitis.

00:07:54.821 --> 00:07:57.070
I ended up playing the bassoon
for the next five years

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.770
until I graduated high school.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.240
For better or worse,
I spent my adolescence

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.380
tethered to that bastard
woodwind, my siren, my spirit

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.944
animal, my nerd crucifix."

00:08:08.944 --> 00:08:09.860
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Bravo.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.520
RAINN WILSON: No, really.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.495
No, really.

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.440
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: I'm confident
you just transported everyone

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.564
here back to middle school.

00:08:18.564 --> 00:08:20.785
RAINN WILSON: A
little bit, right?

00:08:20.785 --> 00:08:22.160
ARTUR OLIVEIRA:
I think the title

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.820
of the book-- in and of itself
it's a microcosm of the book,

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.010
because you have "The
Bassoon King," a fun title.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.810
But you also have the
subtitle-- "My Life

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.640
in Art, Faith, and Idiocy."

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.110
And I really like
how in the beginning,

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.590
in the special
thanks section, you

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:40.471
thank your dad for teaching
you about art and faith.

00:08:40.471 --> 00:08:42.429
Could you talk a little
bit more about your dad

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:44.790
and the relationship you
had with him growing up?

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.661
Because you have so
many beautiful anecdotes

00:08:46.661 --> 00:08:48.410
you share about your
relationship with him

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:49.780
and the influence he had on you.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.571
RAINN WILSON: Yeah.

00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:54.580
So I talked about the
faith aspect of it,

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.870
which is a little bit risky
too, because people don't really

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.390
talk about faith.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.270
Or they don't do
it in a way that's

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:06.330
funny and a little bit
edgy, like I'm trying to.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:10.210
But I grew up a member
of the Baha'i faith,

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.530
and my dad was a Baha'i.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:17.870
And the way he wove
his spiritual belief

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.970
and his creativity together
were really inspiring.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.960
So my dad was an
aspiring painter.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.060
He paints abstract
oil paintings.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.540
And they were always in our
house, stacked to the ceiling

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.750
and hung on all the walls, and
then he'd swap them out every

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:32.611
once in a while.

00:09:32.611 --> 00:09:34.110
He wasn't very good
at selling them,

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:35.820
but he was really
good at painting them.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.410
And he also wrote tons of
science fiction and fantasy

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.720
novels while I was growing up.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:46.014
So he worked in a sewer
contracting office in Seattle,

00:09:46.014 --> 00:09:48.430
but he would pound away on a
little manual typewriter when

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.790
he wasn't answering
phones, or doing billing,

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.230
or sewer truck dispatching.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:57.580
He wrote, like, 10 or 12 fantasy
and science fiction novels,

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.120
so that was very inspiring.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.920
He always encouraged me
to be creative and extend

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.710
my imagination.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:08.570
And he was a very devoted
member of the Baha'i faith,

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:13.410
and was always trying to kind
of deepen his spirituality

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.280
at the same time.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.450
So those are some things
I'm really grateful for.

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:22.590
On the more negative
side, it was also

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.860
the fact that he was
kind of a failed artist,

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.500
that he wasn't able to achieve
his dream as an artist.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.630
He was supporting the family
and working day jobs and stuff,

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.520
so he didn't get to
really pursue it.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.440
That also helped me
to become an actor,

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.160
because I saw what
could happen to someone

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.230
who wanted to be an
artist but wasn't

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:47.840
able to or willing to commit
completely into that world.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.880
So when I made that
decision to become an actor,

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.420
it was a very serious decision.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.410
I knew that I was
going to be needing

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:55.830
to commit 10 years
of my life, at least,

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.320
to intensive training,
and studying with the very

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.880
best people, and
calling myself an actor,

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.980
and really pursuing that dream,
and committing whole hog.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.340
You can't just do
it on the side.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:10.920
So in a way he
also showed me what

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.860
not to do if you
wanted to be an artist.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:18.650
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: I love that
journey, and how he helped

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.310
you really make
the decision to go

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:24.390
to NYU, to really invest in that
part of who you wanted to be.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.340
I also wanted to ask, as
far as the next generation,

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:33.440
you talk a lot about how
nerdy you were growing up,

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.950
and you played
Dungeons and Dragons,

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:37.030
and you read fantasy
and science fiction.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:40.546
Is your son following
in your nerdy footsteps?

00:11:40.546 --> 00:11:41.920
RAINN WILSON:
Well, that's funny.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:47.480
He's 11 years old, Walter, and
it's such a different landscape

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.700
then to now.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.740
When I was a nerd in the
late '70s and early '80s,

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.480
it was a very different place.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.850
There were no nerd television
shows and nerd CEOs,

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:03.300
and there was no Silicon Valley,
and there was no Bill Gates,

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:09.470
there was no Beck, there
was no nerd rock stars.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:11.650
It didn't exist.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:17.160
You were really the
lowest on the totem pole.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.910
I remember even the
teachers would get in on it.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.790
There was no concept
of stopping bullying.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:23.960
Are you kidding me?

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.810
Bullying is good for you.

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:29.410
It toughens you up, it gives you
wisdom, and it lets you grow.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:30.860
It was a positive thing.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.990
And so teachers growing
up-- I remember,

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:37.310
some kid with zits in the
corner did something stupid

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:40.271
and picked his
nose, or something.

00:12:40.271 --> 00:12:42.520
The teacher's like, yeah,
you should kick the crap out

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:42.630
of him.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.110
He picked his nose in class.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:45.190
I hope you do.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:48.560
Anyway, turn your pages to--

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.640
It was a very different world.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.609
And nerds were reviled.

00:12:54.609 --> 00:12:57.150
It just was a matter of course--
you're going to get punched,

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:58.649
and you're going
to get made fun of.

00:12:58.649 --> 00:13:00.220
And that's just how it is.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.500
It's different now.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:07.029
My son is in school,
and he does it all.

00:13:07.029 --> 00:13:09.070
So he plays Dungeons and
Dragons with his friends

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:13.760
on the weekend, and then he's
on the flag football team.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.700
There doesn't seem to be
any kind of issue with that.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.600
He really geeks out about
science fiction movies

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.080
and stuff like that, and
music, and at the same time,

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.020
he's well liked.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:29.645
So I think it's a better
time by and large.

00:13:29.645 --> 00:13:31.980
ARTUR OLIVEIRA:
Better way to grow up.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.800
You talk a lot-- you
go on, respectfully,

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.330
a little bit of a rant
in the book about how

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.080
being geeky and nerdy
is now considered cool.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:45.681
You mentioned the nerdy CEOs,
and TV shows, Silicon Valley,

00:13:45.681 --> 00:13:46.305
and everything.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.880
What do you think has
caused that cultural shift?

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.790
Is it the importance
of technology

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:56.530
and these things in society?

00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:00.390
Is it just purely
money and marketing?

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.360
RAINN WILSON: I think there's
a lot of different factors.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:08.630
A couple is we went from a
manufacturing-based economy

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:14.830
to an information-based economy
over the course of 20 years,

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:18.240
less than one generation.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:23.040
And I also think that
capitalism is king,

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.080
and the capitalists swiftly
realized, hey, wait a minute.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.160
These nerds are
making some money.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.660
And they'll spend that money,
and they'll tell their friends

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:37.210
to spend that money on movies
and on gadgets and everything.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:43.220
So they used to kind of be
shunned, but let's co-opt them.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:48.310
So the whole nerd/geek thing
is kind of overly talked about.

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:52.650
But a lot of it just has
to do with how can we suck

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:56.815
the nerds dry of their cash?

00:14:56.815 --> 00:14:59.000
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Do
you still play D&amp;D?

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.760
RAINN WILSON: I don't
play D&amp;D anymore.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.780
I don't have the time.

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.110
I would love to.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:08.290
I would love to, there's
nothing against it.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:10.660
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: That's great.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.650
I think the great
thing about hearing

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:14.500
you talk about that
at Google is the fact

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.210
that for the most part,
almost all of us in this room

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:21.600
were on a similar boat to
a greater or lesser degree

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.050
while growing up.

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:25.510
And it's great to be able
to identify with someone who

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.230
had that same experience, and
as you said, kind of climbed

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.694
the ladder of nerd-dom
in high school

00:15:30.694 --> 00:15:32.235
until you made it
to theater, and you

00:15:32.235 --> 00:15:33.620
were at the top of that ladder.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.980
RAINN WILSON: I call the
theater geeks the lions

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.465
of the nerd Serengeti.

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:44.020
Theater's at the top
because there are actually

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:48.910
cute girls in the theater, who
if you make them laugh enough,

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.945
they will potentially
make out with you.

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.640
I transferred high schools
from Seattle to Chicago

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.600
and they had a good
theater department there,

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.750
and I did this-- I have a
chapter called "How Elvis

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:06.170
Costello Made Me an Actor."

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:10.990
Because they had an exercise
called private in public.

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:14.980
It's a very common theater
exercise where you just

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.190
act out as if you're
in your bedroom,

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:18.700
and people are just watching.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.280
So I put on Elvis
Costello's "Mystery Dance"

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.310
off of "My Aim Is True."

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:23.870
This was in 1982.

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:26.450
And I just started
thrashing around, pretending

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:28.610
I was in my bedroom just
goofing off to the song,

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:30.040
and lip syncing it and stuff.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.830
And it brought the house down.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.690
I had recently moved
into that school.

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.840
And then all the
girls, at the end,

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.220
they were like, oh,
you're so funny.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.760
Will you sit at our lunch table?

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.340
You should try out
for the next play!

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:50.810
And I was just like, huh,
girls have talked to me.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:55.070
So I left the others-- model
United Nations, chess team,

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:55.930
forget it.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:56.730
It was done.

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:58.220
I was in.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.520
And eventually, met my wife.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.339
We were drama geeks at
University of Washington

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:07.410
together and ended
up dating later on,

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:09.579
and now have been
together for 25 years.

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:12.630
So good things can happen.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.459
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: You've
talked about the art part,

00:17:19.459 --> 00:17:20.750
and I want to get to the faith.

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:24.589
But I can't not ask you about
the idiocy of the title.

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:27.730
Why did you choose to
include that in the title,

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:29.917
and what do you mean by that?

00:17:29.917 --> 00:17:31.500
RAINN WILSON: Well,
part of the idiocy

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.520
is just the stupid
things that I've done

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.450
and the things that
I've experienced.

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:42.200
I wanted to really make
myself vulnerable in the book.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.150
I think that's the only
way to do a book like this.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:49.550
So there's a lot of things I
end up looking pretty stupid.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:55.545
I've made a lot of mistakes
on this road, of all kinds.

00:17:58.972 --> 00:18:01.970
You know, it's not
really an idiocy thing,

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:05.090
but one of the
chapters is called

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.550
"How I Bombed on
Broadway." and I

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:10.500
think it's a very telling
story at the center.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:14.830
Because I was out of acting
school for a few years,

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:16.780
and I was working as an
actor, and I got cast

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:18.410
in my first Broadway show.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.780
It was at the Roundabout
Theatre Company on Broadway.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:26.180
And it was kind of an English
restoration, stylized comedy

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.870
of manners type of thing.

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.130
And I sucked.

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:32.130
I was terrible in it.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:36.790
I got really stuck early on
in the rehearsal process.

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:40.370
I always have had this
issue, this character defect,

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:42.810
of just wanting approval and
wanting people to like me.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:46.240
So I got cast and I had
these thoughts like, oh, I

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.270
could get a Tony nomination.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.570
I could get a great
"New York Times" review.

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:52.780
I could get a great agent.

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.940
I could get
discovered from this.

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.150
I had all these
visions of sugar plums.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:01.280
And I got really
stuck in the role.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.440
I couldn't get out of it.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.560
I was just bad.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.550
I was very robotic
and stiff, and it just

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:07.710
ended up not being good.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.380
And I went through hell.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.100
I'd call my wife at
3:00 in the morning

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.280
and sob to her about it.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.160
And I just couldn't
get out of it,

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.320
and it was eating me up inside.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:22.670
And then when I finished
that, I remember going out

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:25.520
on 44th Street near
Broadway in New York,

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.940
and I was like, you know what?

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:29.600
F it.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.290
I'm not ever going
to do that again.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:34.710
Whatever just happened,
I'm not going to do it.

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:35.660
It's just too hard.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:39.270
I can't be some
external idea of what

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:42.560
it is to be a New York actor,
wanting approval, wanting

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.310
to be liked, thinking
I needed to be

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:48.360
something outside of myself.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.110
All of that stuff, I
just really jettisoned.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:55.120
I was like, I'm a quirky
guy, I'm an oddball,

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.330
this is who I am.

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:58.660
I need to play roles
that are like that.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:02.460
I need to use who I am
in those kind of roles.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.300
And that's when
I started slowly,

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.790
slowly having more
and more success.

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:12.230
So when I look back on it,
it was a horrible experience.

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:14.400
Bombing on Broadway
and getting bad reviews

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.230
and sucking in front
of 1,000 people

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:20.120
every night for three months or
four months, it really sucks.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.240
Trust me.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.180
And yet had I not
gone through that,

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.050
I never would have
played Dwight.

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:29.130
I wouldn't have had the tools,
I wouldn't have had the skill

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:32.110
set and the belief
in myself to play

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:34.430
such an odd, quirky
character that draws

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:37.190
on a lot of my own odd quirks.

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.840
So I think that's
how life works.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.100
You can look at it as
a psychological lesson,

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.750
a sociological lesson, a
spiritual lesson, if you like.

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:48.300
But those fires and
those tests, often time

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.640
when you get the luxury of
looking back on your life

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.080
and having written a
memoir, which is something

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.639
I recommend for everyone,
whether you're on TV or not,

00:20:56.639 --> 00:20:57.180
to write one.

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.160
Because it's a really
interesting perspective

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:04.440
to look back on your life, and
you see how it was those tests

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.350
that make us who we are.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.600
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: And that was
not too far from the time

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.650
when you started going back
to your Baha'i childhood faith

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:16.260
and started incorporating
it back into your life.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.930
And you talk a lot in the book,
and also in "SoulPancake,"

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:22.740
about spirituality, and
how that's no longer

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.730
a cool word in society.

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:28.110
And you wanted to bring that
back and have people discuss

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:30.480
the big questions in life.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.400
Why did you feel like that?

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.680
Because that's
different from acting.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.510
What drew you to that, too,
in addition to the acting

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:40.970
that you were doing at the time?

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:41.830
RAINN WILSON: Well,
that's where I'll

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:43.150
disagree with you a little bit.

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:48.390
What I came to realize is it's
not different than acting.

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.970
In our culture,
spirituality right now

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:53.140
is this very separate thing.

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.390
It has to do with church.

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:56.890
It has to do with
fundamentalist religion,

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.950
or else it has to do with some
kind of very vague, new agey

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:05.250
kind of yoga pants and crystals
and how I'm feeling today

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:10.100
and my aura kind of bullshit.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.110
When spirituality really
is based in truth,

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:16.780
in the truth of the human
condition-- and it's

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:20.070
a set of skills and tools
that one uses in one's life

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:23.940
to understand how to navigate
life better, but also what

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.880
gives us meaning and
what gives us purpose

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.390
and what moves us forward.

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:30.790
So I view it more like that.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:36.080
But I used to view art-- when
I was starting SoulPancake,

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.840
Ed Helms came up and was like,
hey Rainn, doo-doo doo-doo.

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:46.830
What's this SoulPancake
thing you're starting?

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.290
I was like, well, it
kind of blends creativity

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:50.680
and spirituality.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:54.270
And he was like, aren't those
things mutually exclusive?

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.790
And I think that that's
a very common misnomer.

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:58.690
I think if you look
at human history,

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:01.770
the spiritual and the artistic
has always been blended,

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.740
whether it's shamans in
a cave telling a story,

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:09.790
whether it's Michelangelo
working on the Sistine Chapel.

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:14.080
It's John Coltrane
creating his work

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:18.049
that he saw as this
divine prayer, played

00:23:18.049 --> 00:23:18.965
through his saxophone.

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:24.770
It is a key teaching
in the Baha'i faith

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:27.840
that art and devotion
are synonymous,

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.250
especially art done in
the spirit of service.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.244
If you're doing art
in service to others--

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:33.910
because whatever
you're doing in service

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:37.040
is really an act of worship,
maybe the most powerful act

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.360
of worship that you can have.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:43.520
So yeah, it was a
long journey for me.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.560
Having lost faith, I
moved to New York City.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.500
I just wanted to be a Bohemian.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.770
I didn't want any morality.

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:53.600
I just wanted to do
what I wanted to do,

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.110
when I wanted to do it, and I
wanted to live that Bohemian

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:57.310
lifestyle.

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:59.490
And then as I became
an actor, I found

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:02.790
myself very dissatisfied
in my life, which

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:04.590
didn't make any sense
to me, because I

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:05.620
was working as an actor.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:06.745
I was a professional actor.

00:24:06.745 --> 00:24:10.750
Why do I feel alienated
and discontent inside?

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:11.930
What's going on with this?

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:16.130
And then I thought, well, maybe
by discarding God and faith,

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:20.020
I had thrown out the
baby with the bathwater.

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:24.070
So I started a very long--
it was like a eight year

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.090
journey of exploring
God and faith.

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.410
And I read the holy
books of the world,

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:32.560
and started having
discussions with people,

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.230
and kind of digging into
life's big questions

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:36.320
in a more vital way.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:40.450
And that eventually, over
years, brought me back

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:41.890
to the faith of my childhood.

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:44.320
I decided that that made
the most sense to me,

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:49.740
and it also brought me the most
focus and the most serenity.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.142
So that's part of
the story as well.

00:24:52.142 --> 00:24:53.100
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Thanks.

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:54.400
I really appreciate
you explaining that.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.774
And I think the
parts in the book

00:24:55.774 --> 00:24:58.330
where you talk about that
aspect of spirituality

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.210
were some of my favorites.

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:01.870
Thanks so much for
talking with me.

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.232
I would love, if you would,
if we could turn it over

00:25:04.232 --> 00:25:04.940
to the audience--

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:05.648
RAINN WILSON: No.

00:25:05.648 --> 00:25:07.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:09.842
ARTUR OLIVEIRA:
--ask some questions.

00:25:09.842 --> 00:25:11.550
We have a microphone
in the back for you,

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.990
so if you could please
make sure to use it.

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:16.270
And while you're
lining up and while we

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:18.640
get our first question,
I have one last question

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.570
for your, Rainn.

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:22.560
We all love "The Office."

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.440
How much of you is in Dwight,
and how much of Dwight

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.167
is in you?

00:25:26.167 --> 00:25:27.625
RAINN WILSON: That's
what she said.

00:25:27.625 --> 00:25:30.595
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:39.064 --> 00:25:41.230
RAINN WILSON: Well, I get
asked that question a lot.

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:43.890
I don't really know
how to answer it.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:51.745
I can certainly be
a dick at times.

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:58.200
I'm pretty different than
Dwight, I have to say.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.180
Real answer-- jokey
answers, blah blah

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:02.470
blah-- I'm not
like Dwight at all.

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:06.330
I'm not regimented and
disciplined and rigorous

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:09.960
with a set of
hierarchical rules.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.540
And I'm not a toady.

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:16.240
And sometimes I can be
a little self-serious,

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.360
but I'm not self-serious
in the way that he is.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:23.870
His whole clannishness around
his family in the Schrute

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:26.580
system is not at all how I am.

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:36.510
I'd like to think that I'm
more emotionally sensitive.

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:39.745
But you know, I'm
definitely quirky.

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:46.270
I think there's a little
Dwight in all of us.

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:47.224
That's what she said.

00:26:47.224 --> 00:26:49.477
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:49.477 --> 00:26:50.560
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: All right.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.330
Well, thank you.

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:53.080
If we could go to the back.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.440
AUDIENCE: Hey there.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.800
So actually tying into
that, my first question

00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.550
is what type of bear is best?

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:03.930
RAINN WILSON: That's an
interesting question.

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:10.370
I think I'm going to go with
the Himalayan sun bear, which

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:12.180
has never been brought
up on "The Office"

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:16.200
before, because they're
really the bear that's most

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.820
in need of protection from us.

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.876
That was my anti-Dwight answer.

00:27:21.876 --> 00:27:24.250
AUDIENCE: Well then, Dwight
would say, false, black bear.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:27.120
RAINN WILSON: False, black bear.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.210
AUDIENCE: But in all
seriousness, do you have

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:30.750
a favorite part of the book?

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:33.784
And if so, which is it and why?

00:27:33.784 --> 00:27:35.950
RAINN WILSON: Do I have a
favorite part of the book?

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:42.120
That's a great question.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.520
I think that I've been over
some of my favorite parts.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.800
I think my favorite
part of the book

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:53.860
is towards the end, when I
start talking about SoulPancake

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.500
and the founding of that
media company with my friends,

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.660
and also the work that my wife
and I do in Haiti and some

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:02.590
of the arts education that
we do for adolescent girls

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:05.520
in rural Haiti.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.810
Because it really
is a culmination

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:10.260
of so much of what I've
gone through and learned

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:15.560
through my life have resulted
in these things, have resulted

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:19.330
in SoulPancake, which is a
constant exploration of what

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:20.950
it is to be a human being.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:24.260
Life's big questions, inspiring
content, uplifting content,

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.790
bringing people together.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:29.800
It combines the spiritual
with the creative,

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.960
and the same with
the work in Haiti.

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:37.700
So that's been nice to see
that the things that I'm

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.150
most engaged in in
my life right now

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:43.920
are a culmination of and
reflection of my life's journey

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:44.897
to this point.

00:28:44.897 --> 00:28:45.730
AUDIENCE: Very cool.

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:45.900
RAINN WILSON: Thanks.

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:46.608
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:28:50.807 --> 00:28:51.890
RAINN WILSON: Anyone else?

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:52.530
I that it?

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:53.180
One question.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:58.130
AUDIENCE: You've had
such an incredible career

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:00.810
with this longevity
with "The Office"

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:02.060
and your books and everything.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.893
Is there something that
you haven't done yet

00:29:03.893 --> 00:29:05.030
that you really want to do?

00:29:09.774 --> 00:29:11.690
RAINN WILSON: Yeah,
there's a number of things

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:12.830
that I want to do.

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:16.720
I have a couple movies that
I'd really like to direct.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.990
I haven't directed a movie.

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:21.960
I'd also really love to
do a great of Broadway

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.210
run in a role, to
have that experience.

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:26.940
I've been on Broadway
a couple of times.

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:31.560
But to go back and
have a really good role

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:37.670
and experience a Broadway run
is a really exciting thing

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:38.530
to do as an actor.

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:40.820
You know, take the
subway in, and go

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:44.090
to the theater, and
the half-hour call,

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:46.280
and people coming in and
being in these houses that

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:50.340
are 120 years old that
Barrymore used to act in.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.920
It's a really fun thing.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.442
Those are a couple
things I'd like to do.

00:29:55.442 --> 00:29:57.400
AUDIENCE: I guess the
followup to that is, what

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.740
is that dream role on Broadway?

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.615
What did you grow up
with, like, oh my god, I

00:30:01.615 --> 00:30:02.380
would love to do that.

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.088
RAINN WILSON: "Larry
Page-- The Musical."

00:30:04.088 --> 00:30:06.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:14.540
Any other questions?

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:18.040
MALE SPEAKER: One over here.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.040
We'll pass it to you.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.540
Can we pass it to him?

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:21.040
No?

00:30:28.232 --> 00:30:30.440
AUDIENCE: How does it work
with the writers on a show

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.189
like "The Office"?

00:30:31.189 --> 00:30:33.340
How did you go about
creating Dwight?

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:36.085
Was it a written part that
then you put your stamp on,

00:30:36.085 --> 00:30:37.820
or did you guys exchange ideas?

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:41.362
How do you create that and
collaborate with the writers?

00:30:41.362 --> 00:30:43.570
RAINN WILSON: So the word
that you used, collaborate,

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:46.162
is really the best word.

00:30:46.162 --> 00:30:48.370
I mean, there wouldn't be
Dwight without the writers,

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:51.090
and without Greg
Daniels especially.

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:55.150
He really is the super
genius behind the whole show.

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:57.930
First of all, our "Office"
was based on the BBC "Office,"

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:01.119
so Gareth was an
amazing creation.

00:31:01.119 --> 00:31:02.660
And there's just so
much stuff that I

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.950
did as Dwight that
just was taken

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:07.940
from Gareth, stolen
from Mackenzie Crook

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.750
and him playing Gareth.

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:13.130
And then I had
conversations with Greg

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:17.150
about what he was
thinking about Dwight.

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:19.630
He wrote a really
great email early on.

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:20.960
I need to find that email.

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:24.990
I wrote him an email.

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:26.300
I said, I'm worried
that Dwight's just

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:28.091
kind of going to be
the annoying, geeky guy

00:31:28.091 --> 00:31:29.200
in the office.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.960
What can we do to kind
of change that up,

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.820
and give him more textures
and layers and nuance?

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:39.980
And he wrote this beautiful
essay about Dwight, and how

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.000
he sees the world,
and his hierarchies,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.980
and his love of order, and his
family, and stuff like that.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.910
I have to find that
essay somewhere.

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:52.990
But for instance, early
on in the first season,

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:55.690
there was no hint of Dwight
being on a farm or anything

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:56.190
like that.

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:58.130
And I did in
improvisation where I

00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:00.250
said, just completely
off the cuff, I was like,

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:02.360
"My name is Dwight Schrute.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.240
My father's name
is Dwight Schrute.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.970
His father's name?

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:10.790
Dwide Shrude-- Amish."

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:13.520
And all of a sudden, there
was this Amish connection,

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.390
and they were like,
oh that's cool.

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:19.120
And that led to, eventually, the
beat farm, and the Amishness,

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.410
and Mose, and the
bed and breakfast.

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:26.417
It came out of an improv, so
there was a give and take.

00:32:26.417 --> 00:32:28.750
And that was one of the great
things about "The Office."

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:31.370
I have a friend on a
big sitcom right now,

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:33.490
and they're not allowed
to improvise at all.

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:36.970
I mean, if it says, um,
uh, yeah, hello, you

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:40.450
can't even say, um, OK, hello.

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:42.050
You're doing a
comedy, and you have

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:44.370
to say every line as scripted.

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:47.840
And "The Office" was
very collaborative,

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.190
which I really appreciated.

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:53.324
Any other questions?

00:32:53.324 --> 00:32:54.823
AUDIENCE: Thanks
so much for coming.

00:32:54.823 --> 00:32:57.090
I saw you when you were
here last, five years ago.

00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:58.310
RAINN WILSON: Oh, nice.

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:00.810
AUDIENCE: So my question is
what was your experience writing

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:04.710
the book, taking so much time
to just reflect and look back

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:06.880
and sort of process your life?

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:11.980
How was the experience of
it, and has it changed at all

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:14.580
how you live now?

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:19.700
RAINN WILSON: That's
a good question.

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.400
Technology's the
number one enemy

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.300
to trying to get
anything creative done.

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.210
And maybe you guys find
that-- you work in technology,

00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:29.010
but I imagine your emails
and your Twitter feed

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:32.600
are your number one enemy to
try doing programming or design,

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.780
or whatever it is you're doing.

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:38.496
I would turn the Wi-Fi
off on my computer.

00:33:38.496 --> 00:33:40.370
What I really wanted to
do was get a computer

00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:44.290
without any Wi-Fi,
so it was just

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:46.700
like I was-- but it was great.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:50.640
It was very meditative.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.190
I realized that my only
creative hours were really

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:55.720
between like 9:00 and 12:30.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:58.030
After that my brain was mush.

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:01.020
And in that period of
time, I could write

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:07.920
between 400 and 1,000 words.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:12.580
If you do that every day, If
you write 1,000 words a day

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:19.267
for 300 days, then
you've got 300,000 words.

00:34:19.267 --> 00:34:19.850
Is that right?

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:21.330
That's too much words.

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:24.199
See, this is why I'm
not in programming.

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:25.240
But you can write a book.

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:26.114
You know what I mean?

00:34:26.114 --> 00:34:27.150
You can write a book.

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:32.449
So it was a great process of
looking back on your life.

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:36.840
And it was the first
time I really made myself

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.570
that disciplined to
sit down every day

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:42.909
and put down those number
of words on the page.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:46.770
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:50.380
So since faith and spirituality
is a big part of your book,

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:54.187
I was wondering what your
personal definition of God is.

00:34:54.187 --> 00:34:55.770
RAINN WILSON: That's
a great question,

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:57.895
because I think that that's
where people get really

00:34:57.895 --> 00:34:58.625
hung up.

00:34:58.625 --> 00:35:05.520
I also joke that it's really
am anathema for a comedian

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.530
to talk about God
or spirituality.

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:11.690
First of all, other
comedians are just like, ugh.

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:13.190
They don't know how
to deal with it.

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:16.260
And I love talking about topics
that really clear the room,

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:17.416
like God and death.

00:35:17.416 --> 00:35:19.290
You bring up, so what
do you think about God?

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:21.930
Uh, excuse me, I got to go.

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:25.070
It really creeps people out.

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:27.410
Recently, I said on one
of these book tour things,

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:30.530
the most punk rock thing
that someone could do

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:32.320
is talk about God
and spirituality.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:35.430
Because it is the thing that
just unsettles people more

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:36.345
than anything else.

00:35:36.345 --> 00:35:38.470
But one of the things we
tried to do at SoulPancake

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:41.262
was really redefine
the idea of God.

00:35:41.262 --> 00:35:43.220
Because that's where
people get really hung up.

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:45.450
It's the god of
their grandfathers,

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:50.040
or it's a judgmental old man
on a cloud with a beard who's

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.260
really judgmental and
scowling and disapproving,

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:57.590
and hates people of this faith
and loves people of the other.

00:35:57.590 --> 00:36:03.530
But for me it was when
I started researching

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:06.730
Native American
spirituality, and I

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:09.150
found this concept
of Wakan Tanka

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:11.480
from the Lakota
Sioux idea of God.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.180
And the name
literally translates

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:15.300
as "the great mystery."

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.210
And when I started
thinking about God

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:22.020
as the great mystery--
sure, a creator,

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:26.730
sure, all-loving, sure, running
through this material realm

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:29.590
and running through science
and infinite other dimensions.

00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:32.440
But when I think about
it is the great mystery,

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.550
and that god is
essentially unknowable,

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:36.150
that helps me a lot.

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:40.070
So I don't I don't know who
or what god is specifically,

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:43.380
but that was a really
helpful bridge for me.

00:36:46.859 --> 00:36:48.900
AUDIENCE: You've played
a number of unique roles.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.400
I mean, I loved you
on "The Office,"

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.022
but I really also liked you
on "Six Feet Under" as well.

00:36:53.022 --> 00:36:54.980
I was wondering if there
was something specific

00:36:54.980 --> 00:37:00.090
that you look for when you're
considering taking on a role.

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:02.600
RAINN WILSON: It's kind of
this way for all actors--

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.060
do you respond to it?

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.090
You read the role,
and does it just

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:07.540
touch you or move
you in some way?

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.290
Does it affect you?

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:14.270
Part of what the book is
about, "The Bassoon King,"

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:18.440
is why I always play
these weird outsiders,

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.680
and I'm really drawn to playing
these weird, outsider roles.

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:25.860
I wouldn't know how to play a
popular guy, or a well-balanced

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.170
individual.

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:29.610
I don't connect.

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:31.810
I don't know how to do it.

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:35.327
Actually, I'd like to try
some time to see if I could.

00:37:35.327 --> 00:37:36.910
That would be really
difficult for me.

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:40.520
So it is a kind of
an instinct thing.

00:37:45.019 --> 00:37:47.310
As you've been acting for
many years, you kind of know.

00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:49.121
Maybe it's the same
in the tech world,

00:37:49.121 --> 00:37:51.120
if you're offered a
challenge in the tech world,

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.617
and you're kind of like,
oh, I like that challenge.

00:37:53.617 --> 00:37:54.700
And I know how to do that.

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.430
I don't know specifically
how to do it,

00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:59.580
but I know that I could
do something really cool

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:00.940
in that direction.

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:04.940
And it's the same thing
that happens as an actor.

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:07.651
ARTUR OLIVEIRA:
That's a great answer.

00:38:07.651 --> 00:38:09.400
RAINN WILSON: They
were all great answers.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:15.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:19.519
RAINN WILSON: Anything else, or
should we would call it a day?

00:38:19.519 --> 00:38:21.810
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: I think we've
got one more in the back.

00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:22.942
AUDIENCE: Hi, Rainn.

00:38:22.942 --> 00:38:25.150
You recently just finished
writing a book, obviously,

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:27.680
so you have a little
free chunk of time.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:33.140
Do you have a favorite TV show
right now that is currently on?

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.501
RAINN WILSON: "Silicon Valley."

00:38:35.501 --> 00:38:37.470
For real, I love
"Silicon Valley."

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:38.600
It really makes me laugh.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:39.320
It's so funny.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.140
And I just was
chuckling about Hooli

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:43.260
as I was walking
through your campus.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:46.640
It's just making
me laugh so much.

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:50.430
I love "Game of Thrones."

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:52.284
There's a lot of great stuff.

00:38:52.284 --> 00:38:54.200
A lot of great stuff
going on on TV right now.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.390
Comedy, not so much.

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:56.480
Comedy's tough.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.850
I'm having a hard
time finding comedies

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:01.430
that actually make me laugh.

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:04.160
I like "Veep" a lot too.

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:08.247
There's a few out there,
but they're hard to find.

00:39:08.247 --> 00:39:10.830
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Rainn, thank you
so much for coming to Google,

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:13.670
for talking to us about
"The Bassoon King."

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:14.920
It was really lovely.

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:19.860
And we are looking forward to
getting to meet you and get

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:20.860
signatures of the book.

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:21.820
RAINN WILSON: Awesome.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:22.740
Thanks for having me.

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:23.281
Thanks, guys.

00:39:23.281 --> 00:39:26.090
[APPLAUSE]
