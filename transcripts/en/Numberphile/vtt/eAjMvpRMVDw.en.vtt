00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.120
B: Hello everyone, I'm Brady, who makes the Numberphile videos

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.880
B: and I've come to the other side of the camera.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.940
B: I'm here at the Royal Society, where we make objectivity videos.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.900
B: Usually with Keith the head-librarian here.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.600
B: Keith is gonna show Matt and I around. A few things we wonna have a look at.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.920
B: And today we wonna talk about prime numbers.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.820
M: I'm very excited.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.340
B: We don't mind a prime number.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.940
M: I can go a prime number every now and then.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.560
B: Yeah, we don't mind that. They're quite a theme on Numberphile

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.380
B: And that always seems quite modern.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.380
B: We're always talking about computers and all that sort of things.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.740
M: Yeah, modern innovations and prime numbers.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.360
B: Yeah, all these super computers crunching things and gimps projects and that.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.760
B: But you always say

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.540
B: that people've been fascinated with prime numbers for ever.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.240
M: That's true. And we always talk about

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.220
M: really modern prime numbers, that we're doing

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.980
M: or we talk about the ancient greeks.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.380
M: Right? And so it seems to be like no one did anything for thousands of years.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.700
M: and then suddenly people invented computers and we're off and racing.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.260
M: And so I believe Keith is gonna fill in a few of the gaps.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.240
K: We have plenty of material in between, yes.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.840
K: So let's have a look at some of that.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.600
B: So here, in the Royal Society Archives

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.680
B: This is from 1847

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.100
M: Are these ...papers people have like... sent to the Royal Society or are they...?

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.800
K: That's right. So they sent them in to the Royal Society

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.440
K: and on the whole they're not published, so that...

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.080
M: Oh, really?

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.320
K: They didn't make it into...

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.500
M: This is the junk mail, the spam of the Royal Society.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.340
K: That's right. Generally this is the unpublished stuff.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.120
M: So they kept them all?

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.860
K: They did. Which is rather great. 'Cause we can see exactly what people were writing about.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.680
K: Even stuff that was a bit odd.
M: Even the rubbish.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.220
B: Look at this, Matt, look at this!

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.600
M: Is this specifically maths-themed, this book? Or this is the order they arrive?

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.500
K: No, this is all topics. So it could be anything.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.640
M: All of this?! Oh no, you're going too fast!

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.560
B: I know, this is just how amazing stuff there is here. I know, this is exciting for you.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.140
B: But let's get to this paper here.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.760
B: This has been written in ...1847... the right honourable Sir Frederick Pollock, Chief Baron of the Exchequer.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.780
M: Oh! So he's in charge of the country's finances.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.560
B: And the title is 'On certain properties of prime numbers'

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.080
K: Usually these papers start with a bit of a history behind the topic.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.500
M: Ah, it says 'Previously on prime numbers...'

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.720
K: Yeah, so previously on prime numbers...

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.920
K: Here are some of the key papers, he's citing

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.260
K: and I can see in the following Legrange...

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.720
K: So he's quoting things that have been published.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.760
B: He's waffling.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.420
M: He's waffling.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.460
B: And then we get into the interesting...

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.340
M: So this is like an early Numberphile video.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.740
B: This is... I like to think... yeah...

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.700
B: It probably could do with editing down.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.040
B: So it is a lot like a Numberphile.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.260
M: It's a lot like a Numberphile video in every regard.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.760
B: Yeah.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.900
B: There we go, there we go. So ...

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.840
M: Oh ok, so he's found certain numbers...

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.860
M: ...to 720, if you add the cube numbers...

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.000
M: ...to it...

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.180
M: ...they're all multiples of 7...

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.940
M: ...and he's found another number... 2240...

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.160
M: If you add the cube numbers to that, it's always a multiple of 9, Ok!

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.560
B: Add OR subtract.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.760
M: Oh, that's true. They're always within a cube number of a multiple of 9.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.260
M: I mean this is... this is early recreational mathematics

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.540
M: So he's gone, you know... the country can deal with its own finances for a moment.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.600
M: I wanna find base numbers.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.000
M: Which are always within a cube's reach of a multiple... That is brilliant.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.300
K: The nation is safe in his hands.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.520
M: Yeah, I like this guy! I like the cut of his jib.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.200
B: We've got another paper here

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.600
B: W. Shanks, Reciprocals of Prime Numbers...

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:16.140
M: Ok so... remarks connected with the number of figures in the periods of reciprocals of the prime numbers.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.440
B: 1873...

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.820
M: 1873!

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.000
M: Ok, so he's got the inverse of these numbers...

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.700
M: ....and he's got 10 to a MASSIVE power at the top

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.660
M: ...and then he's equated that to something

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.060
M: ...and he's talking about...periods in the reciprocals....

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.920
M: ...this reminds me a lot of e-mails I get.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.720
B: Well, probably like a lot of those e-mails you get.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.080
B: It says here at the end 'This was 'read ...

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.080
M: ... but not published'. This is an early crank e-mail.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.440
B: I didn't get printed. It didn't make it to press.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.080
B: Keith, is it common for people to put their heart and soul into something, send it to the Royal Society and...?

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.820
K: Yeah, I mean...

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.200
B: ...it ends up in a Numberphile video?

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.760
K: We still have cranks files and they're absolutely wonderful.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.280
K: It's when we survey the Archives from years ago for things that should be kept and studied.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.440
K: Cranks files were on the top of the fellow's list, because they're so brilliant.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.600
M: They're such an insight, yeah...

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.080
K: They tend to reflect, what's going on in popular sience at a particular time.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.000
M: It's so good, 'cause I get emails from people who claim they've discovered a new pattern in the prime numbers

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.300
M: And it's great to know that has been going on for centuries.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.380
K: Yap, oh yes.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.020
B: Here we go. So another....

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.480
M: Wow... what era..oh, I see numbers already...

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.300
B: This is the one I-

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.700
M: What era are we in now?
B: This is what I wanted to show you.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:21.800
M: Oh my goodness!

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.860
B: So this is called... 'Rods to find prime numbers'

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.160
M: 'Rods to find prime numbers'. So this...

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.740
B: I know we've got no paper.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.960
B: We've got no explaination

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.760
M: It's just that one sheet?

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.440
M: Look, they run the primes across the top of these ones...

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.200
B: Right

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.560
M: All the primes below 100, it seems

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.480
M: ...and they've ignored the annoying low primes

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.720
M: ...which never behave...

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.400
M: I don't spot any other patterns in the numbers underneath them

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.840
B: Well, how about we take a picture of that and we put it on our website?

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.560
M: Let's put it up!

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.760
B: It just goes to show, prime numbers -- not just ancient times and not just modern computers.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.340
B: Basically it's always prime number time.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.560
B: Now...

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.520
B: ...if you wonna see more things like this; papers, objects, old fashioned things.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.940
B: Also more of Matt here in the Royal Society, we've done another video.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.120
B: Check out objectivity. We've got loads and loads of videos

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.340
B: going through all of these stacks of archives

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.880
B: looking at all of these amazing things here at the Royal Society.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.460
B: If you found this mildly intersting, you're gonna love objectivity!
