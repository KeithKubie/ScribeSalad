00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.224
Well ,I'm looking to put
my equation in y=mx+b form,

00:00:05.224 --> 00:00:11.272
m is my slope which is 4 and
b is this y-value of the y-intercept.

00:00:11.272 --> 00:00:16.821
So y=4x, well, I could say plus -6,

00:00:16.821 --> 00:00:20.634
but I'll just say minus 6.
