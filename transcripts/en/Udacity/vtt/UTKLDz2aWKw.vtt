00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.160
Now that we have some basic familiarity with d3's basic functionality,

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.970
we can begin creating more interesting visualizations, and start applying some

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.150
of the things we learned earlier in the lesson with regards to visual encodings.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.290
To start inserting some SVG elements into this page,

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.830
we might have to make some room.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.000
As it stands,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.120
it looks pretty cluttered with all of the other elements on the page.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.660
Since you probably want to watch the instructional video of me guiding you

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.160
through this, let us try not to remove the video frame element.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.580
There does, however, seem to be a sidebar with the discussion that

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.370
we might be able to temporarily make our canvas.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.200
Let's now clear this side column inspecting the element we can scroll up

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.380
until we hover over the correct element that highlights the entire box.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.340
In this case, it's a div, but

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.520
going even higher you can see there's another div with class call-access-three.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.180
Selecting this element we can inspect what is returned and

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.810
indeed again it is the correct element.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:05.080
If we want to wholesale remove this element we can call d3's.remove function,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.920
but since we actually want to insert some SVG and SVG elements into it,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.180
we only want to remove it's contents.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.460
The dot HTML method defined on its selection either returns the inner HTML of

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.500
a selection, in this care here you can see a string of HTML, or if we patch

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.220
in an argument it replaces that string of HTML with that value you pass in.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.010
In this case, since we want to empty out the selection,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.150
you simply pass in the empty string.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.130
And as you can see here, the discussion has disappeared and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.370
the DOM elements have been removed from the selection.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.010
Again, if you'd like to know more about the methods and

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.590
functions defined on selections or any d3 object,

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.050
I suggest looking at the API documents that are linked in the instructor notes.
