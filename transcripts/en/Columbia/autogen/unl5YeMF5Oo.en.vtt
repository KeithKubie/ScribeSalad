certain number of potential adopters
 

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.620
certain number of potential adopters
some fraction of whom adopt the new

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:42.630
some fraction of whom adopt the new
 

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.810
some fraction of whom adopt the new
thing and then each of those new

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:44.820
thing and then each of those new
 

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.500
thing and then each of those new
adopters contacts another group of

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:48.510
adopters contacts another group of
 

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:51.230
adopters contacts another group of
potential adopters so that you have a

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:51.240
potential adopters so that you have a
 

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:57.500
potential adopters so that you have a
chain reaction in which the the curve is

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:57.510
chain reaction in which the the curve is
 

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:58.600
chain reaction in which the the curve is
Arella

00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:58.610
Arella
 

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:01.010
Arella
is irrelevant with respect to the

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:01.020
is irrelevant with respect to the
 

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.980
is irrelevant with respect to the
content of the adoption it is a curve

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:03.990
content of the adoption it is a curve
 

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:08.870
content of the adoption it is a curve
that shows the spread of information the

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880
that shows the spread of information the
 

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.810
that shows the spread of information the
rate at which the information spreads

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:10.820
rate at which the information spreads
 

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.550
rate at which the information spreads
will determine the slope of the curve

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:13.560
will determine the slope of the curve
 

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.220
will determine the slope of the curve
other words it can look like this using

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:16.230
other words it can look like this using
 

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:23.300
other words it can look like this using
as a time scale or it can look like this

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:23.310
 

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:26.700
so I can look like that

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:26.710
so I can look like that
 

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:34.460
so I can look like that
that has to do with with the particular

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:34.470
that has to do with with the particular
 

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:37.380
that has to do with with the particular
phenomenon that you're that you're

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:37.390
phenomenon that you're that you're
 

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.630
phenomenon that you're that you're
looking at but basically what you're

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:39.640
looking at but basically what you're
 

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:44.780
looking at but basically what you're
looking at is a exponential growth of

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:44.790
looking at is a exponential growth of
 

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:48.600
looking at is a exponential growth of
expansion of information that has an

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:48.610
expansion of information that has an
 

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:52.530
expansion of information that has an
inflection point that then reverses it

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:52.540
inflection point that then reverses it
 

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:58.860
inflection point that then reverses it
so that it you know it slows at the same

00:13:58.860 --> 00:13:58.870
so that it you know it slows at the same
 

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:02.330
so that it you know it slows at the same
rate that it sped up to begin with

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:02.340
rate that it sped up to begin with
 

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.510
rate that it sped up to begin with
because the number of potential adopters

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:06.520
because the number of potential adopters
 

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:11.540
because the number of potential adopters
that each individual encounters becomes

that each individual encounters becomes
 

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.400
that each individual encounters becomes
smaller simply because so many people

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:14.410
smaller simply because so many people
 

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:18.180

technological innovations it's been used
 

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:49.380
technological innovations it's been used
to not only to to describe the rate of

to not only to to describe the rate of
 

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:54.150
to not only to to describe the rate of
and pattern of adoption but it has been

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.160
and pattern of adoption but it has been
 

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.220
and pattern of adoption but it has been
used also to predict an adoption curve

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:58.230
used also to predict an adoption curve
 

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.780
used also to predict an adoption curve
so that it also is used very much in

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:00.790
so that it also is used very much in
 

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:07.770
so that it also is used very much in
advertising to to model the the adoption

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:07.780
advertising to to model the the adoption

curve that you hope to have and when you

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:11.520
curve that you hope to have and when you
 

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.580
curve that you hope to have and when you
look at it from that point of view or

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:14.590
look at it from that point of view or
 

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:17.610
look at it from that point of view or
from any point of view actually you can

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:17.620
from any point of view actually you can
 

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.790
from any point of view actually you can
divide the curve into certain categories

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800
divide the curve into certain categories
 

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:26.130
divide the curve into certain categories
that are symmetrical categories let's

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:26.140
that are symmetrical categories let's
 

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:30.750
that are symmetrical categories let's
say this is this curve is the integral

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:30.760
 

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.950
the bell-shaped standard distribution

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:32.960
the bell-shaped standard distribution
 

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:38.829
the bell-shaped standard distribution
curve so here is your average here you

00:15:38.829 --> 00:15:38.839
curve so here is your average here you
 

00:15:38.839 --> 00:15:44.650
curve so here is your average here you
have one standard deviation from the

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:44.660
have one standard deviation from the
 

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:49.060
have one standard deviation from the
mean here you have two standard

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:49.070
mean here you have two standard
 

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:53.290
mean here you have two standard
deviations from the mean here you have

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:53.300
deviations from the mean here you have
 

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.960
deviations from the mean here you have
three and so forth and so on in other

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:55.970
three and so forth and so on in other
 

00:15:55.970 --> 00:16:01.240
three and so forth and so on in other
words the the the categories of people

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:01.250
words the the the categories of people
 

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:07.210
words the the the categories of people
who are transmitting information can be

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:07.220
who are transmitting information can be
 

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:11.260
who are transmitting information can be
defined in statistical terms and then

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:11.270
defined in statistical terms and then
 

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:14.170
defined in statistical terms and then
for people who study this carefully they

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:14.180
for people who study this carefully they
 

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.640
for people who study this carefully they
will proceed to ascribe social qualities

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:17.650
will proceed to ascribe social qualities
 

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:20.769
will proceed to ascribe social qualities
to the people who are in each category

00:16:20.769 --> 00:16:20.779
to the people who are in each category
 

00:16:20.779 --> 00:16:25.269
to the people who are in each category
so we'll say okay let's assume that you

00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279
so we'll say okay let's assume that you
 

00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:28.990
so we'll say okay let's assume that you
know that's your Model T Ford your you

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:29.000
know that's your Model T Ford your you
 

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.940
know that's your Model T Ford your you
know your mean adopter know when

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:30.950
know your mean adopter know when
 

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:37.199
know your mean adopter know when
everybody is in this time period from

00:16:37.199 --> 00:16:37.209
everybody is in this time period from
 

00:16:37.209 --> 00:16:40.360
everybody is in this time period from
one standard deviation above and once a

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:40.370
one standard deviation above and once a
 

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:42.850
one standard deviation above and once a
deviation below the mean this is where

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:42.860
deviation below the mean this is where
 

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.079
deviation below the mean this is where
you're getting your mass adoption of

00:16:44.079 --> 00:16:44.089
you're getting your mass adoption of
 

00:16:44.089 --> 00:16:47.170
you're getting your mass adoption of
automobiles but who is adopting

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:47.180
automobiles but who is adopting
 

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.930
automobiles but who is adopting
automobiles here who is the first person

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:49.940
automobiles here who is the first person
 

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.230
automobiles here who is the first person
to adopt it and then the people who

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:53.240
to adopt it and then the people who
 

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.540
to adopt it and then the people who
study this will say well this is a

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:55.550
study this will say well this is a
 

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:58.390
study this will say well this is a
different personality type or it's a

00:16:58.390 --> 00:16:58.400
different personality type or it's a
 

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.610
different personality type or it's a
different social category maybe it's a

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:00.620
different social category maybe it's a
 

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.430
different social category maybe it's a
difference in wealth maybe it's a

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:03.440
difference in wealth maybe it's a
 

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.829
difference in wealth maybe it's a
different instant education but

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839
different instant education but
 

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:07.929
different instant education but
certainly the people who are adopting

00:17:07.929 --> 00:17:07.939
certainly the people who are adopting
 

00:17:07.939 --> 00:17:10.929
certainly the people who are adopting
here are not the same people who are

00:17:10.929 --> 00:17:10.939
here are not the same people who are
 

00:17:10.939 --> 00:17:13.569
here are not the same people who are
adopting here nor the same people who

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:13.579
adopting here nor the same people who
 

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:15.970
adopting here nor the same people who
are the last ever to buy a car who are

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:15.980
are the last ever to buy a car who are
 

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:20.199
are the last ever to buy a car who are
adopting here so the people who study

00:17:20.199 --> 00:17:20.209
adopting here so the people who study
 

00:17:20.209 --> 00:17:22.510
adopting here so the people who study
innovation diffusion using this sort of

innovation diffusion using this sort of
 

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.939
innovation diffusion using this sort of
model break it down into social

00:17:24.939 --> 00:17:24.949
model break it down into social
 

00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:28.660
model break it down into social
categories but the constant in these

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:28.670
categories but the constant in these
 

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:33.390
categories but the constant in these
studies is that the thing is the thing

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:33.400
studies is that the thing is the thing
 

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:40.150
studies is that the thing is the thing

intellectual innovation instead of
 

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:07.300
intellectual innovation instead of
material innovation let us say when you

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:07.310
material innovation let us say when you
 

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:09.640
material innovation let us say when you
try to apply it to a religion or

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:09.650
try to apply it to a religion or
 

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:12.310
try to apply it to a religion or

you apply it rather simply to an area of

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:27.880
you apply it rather simply to an area of
 

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.780
you apply it rather simply to an area of
technological diffusion and that is that

00:34:55.450 --> 00:34:57.329
ideologies and then you had another
group where at the bottom of the social

00:34:57.329 --> 00:34:57.339
group where at the bottom of the social
 

00:34:57.339 --> 00:35:01.069
group where at the bottom of the social
scale who are joining the same movement

00:35:01.069 --> 00:35:01.079
scale who are joining the same movement
 

00:35:01.079 --> 00:35:05.660
scale who are joining the same movement
you find the same thing in Christianity

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:05.670
you find the same thing in Christianity
 

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:08.490
you find the same thing in Christianity
frequently people will say well

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:08.500
frequently people will say well
 

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:11.370
frequently people will say well
Christianity appealed to the slaves and

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:11.380
Christianity appealed to the slaves and
 

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:14.819
Christianity appealed to the slaves and
the Roman Empire well yeah it probably

00:35:14.819 --> 00:35:14.829
the Roman Empire well yeah it probably
 

00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:18.060
the Roman Empire well yeah it probably
did on the other hand when you read the

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:18.070
did on the other hand when you read the
 

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:20.010
did on the other hand when you read the
epistles of Paul he's not writing to

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:20.020
epistles of Paul he's not writing to
 

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:23.910
epistles of Paul he's not writing to
slaves he's not writing about slaves the

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920
slaves he's not writing about slaves the
 

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.700
slaves he's not writing about slaves the
people he's writing to clearly are

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:26.710
people he's writing to clearly are
 

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:29.250
people he's writing to clearly are
people of substantial position in

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:29.260
people of substantial position in
 

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:34.740
people of substantial position in
society rather than people who are who

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:34.750
society rather than people who are who
 

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:39.599
society rather than people who are who
are toiling under the yoke of Roman

00:35:39.599 --> 00:35:39.609
are toiling under the yoke of Roman
 

00:35:39.609 --> 00:35:45.150
are toiling under the yoke of Roman
slavery so I think my guess is that when

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:45.160
slavery so I think my guess is that when
 

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:48.079
slavery so I think my guess is that when
you have movements of ideological change

00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:48.089
you have movements of ideological change
 

00:35:48.089 --> 00:35:51.510
you have movements of ideological change
that when they start out you have a

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:51.520
that when they start out you have a
 

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:56.700
that when they start out you have a
certain incoherence not necessary to the

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:56.710
certain incoherence not necessary to the
 

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:58.980
certain incoherence not necessary to the
doctrine itself but in coherence that

00:35:58.980 --> 00:35:58.990
doctrine itself but in coherence that
 

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:00.870
doctrine itself but in coherence that
came from different expectations of

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880
came from different expectations of
 

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.940
came from different expectations of
different groups who are joining the

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:02.950
different groups who are joining the
 

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:05.040
different groups who are joining the
movement and that changes in the

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:05.050
movement and that changes in the
 

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:09.440
movement and that changes in the
ideology have to do in part with

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:09.450
ideology have to do in part with
 

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:14.040
ideology have to do in part with
rationalizing these differences with

trying to make the the ideology or the

trying to make the the ideology or the
 

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:26.460
trying to make the the ideology or the
religion acceptable to people of who are

points in that process

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:33.870
points in that process
 

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:35.780
points in that process
it's important that some people be

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:35.790
it's important that some people be
 

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:40.250
it's important that some people be
thrown out because they're not no

century ideologies is that they
 

00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:03.790
century ideologies is that they
frequently split they have reciprocal

moments of of Anathem o where they
 

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:12.800

throwing out the anarchists for example

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:14.610
throwing out the anarchists for example
 

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:18.320
throwing out the anarchists for example
or later on the the Stalinist throwing

whole question of whether one is a
 

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:33.080
whole question of whether one is a
Marxist communist or a socialist because

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:33.090
Marxist communist or a socialist because
 

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:35.090
Marxist communist or a socialist because
this is another problem that you have is

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:35.100
this is another problem that you have is
 

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:43.100
this is another problem that you have is
that when you have multiple adoption

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:43.110
that when you have multiple adoption
 

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:48.140
that when you have multiple adoption
processes underway at the same time they

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:48.150
processes underway at the same time they
 

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:51.530
processes underway at the same time they
frequently conflict and they aim at at

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:51.540
frequently conflict and they aim at at
 

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:57.110
frequently conflict and they aim at at
the same audiences so so socialism in

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:57.120
the same audiences so so socialism in
 

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.020
the same audiences so so socialism in
various forms comes into being in the

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:00.030
various forms comes into being in the
 

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:02.870
various forms comes into being in the
19th century and it is not necessarily

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880
19th century and it is not necessarily
 

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:06.370
19th century and it is not necessarily
compatible with Marxism although it may

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:06.380
compatible with Marxism although it may
 

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:10.100
compatible with Marxism although it may
adopt some of the views of Marxism and

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:10.110
adopt some of the views of Marxism and
 

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:12.500
adopt some of the views of Marxism and
ultimately you may get to a point you

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:12.510
ultimately you may get to a point you
 

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:17.840
ultimately you may get to a point you
did get to a point where Marxist

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:17.850
did get to a point where Marxist
 

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:20.480
did get to a point where Marxist
communist felt that their greatest enemy

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:20.490
communist felt that their greatest enemy
 

00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:24.160
communist felt that their greatest enemy
was the Socialists and vice-versa

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:24.170
was the Socialists and vice-versa
 

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:27.880
was the Socialists and vice-versa
because they were essentially competing

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:27.890
because they were essentially competing
 

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:32.780
because they were essentially competing
for the same adopter population in the

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:32.790
for the same adopter population in the
 

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:36.350
for the same adopter population in the
same way that the Christians would find

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:36.360
same way that the Christians would find
 

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:42.790
same way that the Christians would find
the Manicheans to be a you know a

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:46.170
unacceptable religion
 

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:47.990
unacceptable religion
because really they're competing for the

00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000
because really they're competing for the
 

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.290
because really they're competing for the
same for the same adopter population so

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:51.300
same for the same adopter population so
 

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:55.430
same for the same adopter population so
in the life of st. Augustine he starts

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440
in the life of st. Augustine he starts
 

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:59.420
in the life of st. Augustine he starts
out his first enthusiasm is as a

00:38:59.420 --> 00:38:59.430
out his first enthusiasm is as a
 

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:02.530
out his first enthusiasm is as a
neo-platonists and he follows philosophy

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:02.540
neo-platonists and he follows philosophy
 

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:05.030
neo-platonists and he follows philosophy
then he shifts and becomes a mannequin

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040
then he shifts and becomes a mannequin
 

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:08.750
then he shifts and becomes a mannequin
and as an ardent manikyam he really

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:08.760
and as an ardent manikyam he really
 

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:13.090
and as an ardent manikyam he really
thinks that mana ki ism is is the truth

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:13.100
thinks that mana ki ism is is the truth
 

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:17.060
thinks that mana ki ism is is the truth
then he becomes a Christian and at that

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:17.070
then he becomes a Christian and at that
 

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:19.070
then he becomes a Christian and at that
point the mana keys are the worst people

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:19.080
point the mana keys are the worst people
 

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.530
point the mana keys are the worst people
in the world they are magicians and

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:21.540
in the world they are magicians and

in the world they are magicians and
charlatans and frauds and any now

charlatans and frauds and any now
 

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:28.760
charlatans and frauds and any now
condemns the mana keys then he goes on

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:28.770
condemns the mana keys then he goes on
 

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:31.880
condemns the mana keys then he goes on
to discover that within Christianity

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:31.890
to discover that within Christianity
 

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:34.310
to discover that within Christianity
they're a bunch of heresies are really

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:34.320
they're a bunch of heresies are really
 

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:37.130
they're a bunch of heresies are really
awful and that he should now spend the

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:37.140
awful and that he should now spend the

Christians that were in that were in

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:48.600
Christians that were in that were in
 

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:53.600
Christians that were in that were in
Tunisia at that time so uh you look at

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:53.610
Tunisia at that time so uh you look at
 

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:56.450
Tunisia at that time so uh you look at
this in the history of sectarianism and

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:56.460
this in the history of sectarianism and
 

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:59.270
this in the history of sectarianism and
you say okay you have this this sect and

00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280
you say okay you have this this sect and
 

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.490
you say okay you have this this sect and
that sect and they disagree on this and

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:01.500
that sect and they disagree on this and
 

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:03.050
that sect and they disagree on this and
here is their position on that you look

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:03.060
here is their position on that you look
 

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:05.120
here is their position on that you look
at them in terms of intellectual history

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:05.130
at them in terms of intellectual history
 

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:07.790
at them in terms of intellectual history
and you see conflicts and overlaps

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:07.800
and you see conflicts and overlaps
 

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:11.090
and you see conflicts and overlaps
but if you look at in terms of adopter

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:11.100
but if you look at in terms of adopter
 

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:16.630
but if you look at in terms of adopter
history you see competition for souls

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640
history you see competition for souls
 

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.940
history you see competition for souls
where you might have two doctrines that

where you might have two doctrines that

where you might have two doctrines that
are extraordinarily similar but will

are extraordinarily similar but will
 

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:26.600
are extraordinarily similar but will
become hostile to one another because

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:26.610
become hostile to one another because
 

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:34.640
