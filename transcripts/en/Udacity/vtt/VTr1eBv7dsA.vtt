00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.062
Welcome to unit 11. At this point, I hope everyone's feeling pretty confident

00:00:04.062 --> 00:00:07.939
that you can write programs that can do interesting and powerful things. We've

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.820
come a long way, but we still don't know how to unleash our programs on the

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.106
world. At this point, to run your programs, you need to run them in the Python

00:00:14.106 --> 00:00:17.978
interpreter. What we're going to learn in this unit is how to write programs

00:00:17.978 --> 00:00:21.371
that we can unleash on the expectant world. To do that we need know a little

00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:25.409
bit about input and output. Being able to make programs that other people can

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:29.390
use is very empowering, but it also requires being careful. Once other people

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.987
start using our programs, well, they might do things wrong. Even worse they

00:00:32.987 --> 00:00:36.012
might be malicious. They might intentionally create inputs to our programs that

00:00:36.012 --> 00:00:39.378
try to make our programs do bad things. So, we have to be a lot more careful

00:00:39.378 --> 00:00:42.174
when we construct programs for other people to use.
