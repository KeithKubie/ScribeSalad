00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.860
Why does everybody keep on hiring me?

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.980
All of my work is shiiit!

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.260
Haha! Everything is awesome.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.360
Well done Chris Miller. Well done.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.240
Thank you.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.940
But he's not the only one we should congratulate,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.320
Our own Jennifer Lee has gotten a job
writing AND directing at Disney.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.780
Oh, It's nothing.
Just the most famous studio in the world.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.300
Well, I suppose now we can bring her in
on our real gamble.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.840
Wha- What gamble?

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.060
Oh, every time a new filmmaker comes along, we make an impossible dare to see if they can pull it off.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.740
Yes! And they, in turn, make dares back.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.320
Really?

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.460
And seeing how you're the newcomer with Disney,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.420
I bet you can't make an animated film
that points out all the faults of the past Disney films,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.760
Has two female heros, one of them a queen-

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.840
Oooooh!

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.820
-And have her sing a song so popular,
even boys will be singing it.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.280
Ooh, ooooooooh!

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.580
Okay! I like a challenge, especially in this demographic, ruled by 13-year-old boys.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.740
They're always the most profitable.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.180
But what about you, Mr. Peyton Reed?

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.460
What about me?

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.240
If I achieve that,
then you have to make a successful superhero movie

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.060
where the hero shrinks down to the size of an ant.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.540
Oooh, oooh, oooooooh!

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.960
You... know shrinking films
are box office poison right now?

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.320
What's the matter? Not taking my raise?

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.140
Ooooooh! *both laugh*

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.740
Oh, I'll call. Not that Miller and Lord over there
have the balls to do so...

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.240
*gasp* Hey! We're just as ballsy as either of you!

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.880
-Yeah!
-Prove it.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.780
I bet that we could do a product placement movie

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.800
so good that we could name the movie after the product,
and nobody would care.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.880
Yeah! And people will even be upset
that it wasn't nominated for best animated feature!

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.420
*laughs*

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.500
Say...

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.780
Mind if... I play?

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.380
(chorus of nope)

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.600
What, why not?

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.260
You suck at this game, Shyamalan!

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.900
Yeah. What's this idea that you can make trees scary?

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.640
Dahh, that's later down the road.
This idea is guaranteed to show you how talented I am.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.880
Wait, isn't this the one that Disney didn't understand,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.980
so you stormed out
even though they were gonna fund it anyway?

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.280
Who does that!?

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.980
Yes, I heard about this.
You said Disney didn't respect individualism.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.360
They're a bunch of hacks
who didn't realize my brilliance.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.020
Yeah? And what is this "brilliance"?

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.560
Alright. The main character is named 'Story'...

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.640
-Out.
-Not happening.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.140
She's an ancient creature called a Narf...

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.880
Oh honey, you can't do this.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.600
And she's being chased by Scrunts,
but saved by Tartutics.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.120
I heard a bum down the street shouting stuff like this!

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.300
Chester A. Bum (Distanced):
Oh c'mon, even I'm not that high!

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:02.280
I will show the world that I am so good
that I can make something so silly absolutely amazing.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.540
I mean, what else could happen to this movie?

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.440
Let's get this baby started!

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.440
While many people see "The Happening"
as Shymalan's funniest "so bad it's good" film,

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.460
I challenge them with the absolute mad ravings
of "Lady in the Water".

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.920
Sure, it's slower,
and doesn't have quite as many silly performances,

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.640
But the story is so insane,
so ego-stroking, so friggin' bizarre,

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.800
that if a well-known filmmaker's name
wasn't attached to it,

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.600
you'd swear it was written
on the walls of a mental institution!

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.780
There's so much to talk about,
so let's not waste any time.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.860
Let's end Shymalan Month
with my favorite bad movie of his, "Lady in the Water".

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.300
Oo~

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.900
It starts off with the backwash-
I mean backstory of this seemingly simple fable.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:01.620
{Once, Man and those in the water were linked. They inspired us. Man listened, and it became real.}

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.200
{But Man does not listen very well}

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.600
You just said they did.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.620
{Man's need to own everything led him deeper into land.}

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.640
{The world of Man became more violent.}

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.860
{War upon war played out, as there were no guides to listen to.}

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.700
Well, if they're so good at guiding people,
how did they let this happen to begin with?

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.400
{A handful of their precious young ones have been sent-}

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:35.140
{There are laws that are meant to keep the young ones safe, but they are sent at great risk to their lives-}

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.100
But- wait, if there are laws to keep them safe, then why would they be at great risk?

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.880
"Sometimes men take matters into their own hands-"

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.660
That's not what you said, movie represented now by Jack Nicholson performance,

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.960
you said they were safe but now they're at great risk,
so they shouldn't be in any danger, should they, movie?

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.980
"You snotty little bastard."

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.480
Why don't you just end with how every "humanity sucks" story ends saying how man has forgotten how to listen?

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.380
{Man have forgotten how to listen.}

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.980
Show us the way, movie.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:07.080
We know you have it even though in the first two minutes you already have tons and tons of problems,

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.880
but we have faith in you.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.480
We then cut to Paul Giamatti-

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.280
"It's some kind of creature!"

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.880
"Tell her it's not a creature,
there's no such thing as... creatures."

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.540
... A creature is just something you can't identify...

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.500
... Like the tone of this movie.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.660
A new tenant seems to be staying at The Cove,
an apartment complex Giamatti works at,

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.820
And he's a movie critic named Mr. Farber.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.160
"Mr. Heep!"

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.400
... "Buenos di-ass".

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.200
"Mr. Farber, this is Young-Soon Choi, she lives with her mother in 8-A. She's ah- a student at the university."

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.080
Hell, if Shyamalan would be nice enough,
maybe he'll cut to a shot that actually shows her face.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.180
Nope? Well, at least he held on a shot for a while.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.360
That automatically equals genius, you know.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.480
But not as genius as talking directly into the camera, another typical Shyamalan trope.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.160
"I tell 'em it's like... experimenting. I'm like a scientist."

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.180
It's fascinating how greedy one can get with their artsiness.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.900
In most movies, these kinds of shots are used sparingly, to establish mood.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.100
But with Shyamalan, he uses it like how the director of "Battlefield Earth" uses tilted shots:

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.380
Weird angles sometimes,
weird angles always!

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.360
{We're brilliant, we're brilliant!
Oh we do the brilliant dance}

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.540
But who cares!
It's time to figure out what stupid quirk this guy has!

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:29.060
Because as always, any quirk, no matter how stupid,
always equals a developed character.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.020
Let's see what we have in our kitchen.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.880
Let's see what we have here...

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.340
Umm.... You like hot dogs?

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:42.420
Expired water... Ah, here we are!
Working out half of your body for no reason.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.660
"Most people say hey, what's wrong with you, Reggie? Why you only working out on one side of your body?

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.500
Remember, it doesn't need to make sense,

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.640
you just have to say that director has a style,
and therefore it's good. It's the law.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.440
"Hey!"
"Hey... Sorry.."

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.400
That's a well-composed shot there...

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.220
That looks effortlessly done,
like there was no effort put into it whatsoever.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:09.600
It's almost as good as this one of Giamatti ending his day and the camera slowly tilting up to reveal...

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.920
... absolutely nothing!

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.440
Y'know.. something visually interesting there might've been nice.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.820
Was even the moon like,
"Aw hell no I'm not being in this shit."

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.320
[water splash]

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.180
Mermando?

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.000
No, but trust me,
it was something just as equally ridiculous.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.220
He goes out to the pool to inspect, when...

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.640
He was underwater...? Now he's not.
Now he's back underwater... Now he's not.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.280
Now he's out of the water.. He slips,
he goes back into the water, tries to get out,

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.460
says naahh, and he's suddenly in his room.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.160
Well, that was as easy to follow
as a moth in a snowstorm.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.780
There does, however,
seem to be a wet, naked woman in his room.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.420
'Oh, not this again. Well, at least this one's alive.'

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.460
"Where are you from?"
"Do you feel an awakening?"

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.220
*sigh* Is that like a "happening"?

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:05.120
Why don't you just replace all your dialogue with
"Do you feel an... inginging?"

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.820
"I don't even know your name."
"My name is Story."

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.240
Oh, yes, you heard that correctly-
it's that kind of movie.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.920
'I have two siblings- an older sister named Long Story,
and a younger sister named Short Story.'

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:21.300
'I have a very honest mother we named True Story,
an aging father named Old Story,'

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.320
'a dead grandfather named Ghost Story,'

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.100
'And for some reason all of them remind me
of my two pets, Cock and Bull Story.'

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.560
What I'm trying to say is that name is stupid.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:36.000
So he gives her a shirt, turning her into a cover story,
and sleeps the night away holding her in his arms.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.300
Because this... really wasn't creepy enough yet.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.840
"Tell me who in the world are you anyway?"

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:44.620
"A narf."

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.580
Didn't catch that? Yeah you did.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.260
The name of her species is 'Narf'.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:57.280
And not only that, they say this word all the time
like it's a totally common name.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:03.040
[compilation of different characters saying 'narf' in dialogue]

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.740
What, was 'Blaf' already taken, or 'Pwonk'?

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:11.200
Look out, we have to save the Nyeh-nyeh-nyehs!
They're on the run from the Carblonketyblonks!

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.280
Bitch, you for real?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.760
He tries to carry her outside
but sees a wolf waiting in the distance.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:25.420
'I serve the nothing...
which apparently this film has an abundance of...'

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:36.260
[Sudden screaming]
What-wha? W-what's going on? Wh-

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:42.840
[continued screaming]
Pool! Pool! Pool! Pool! *screams*

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:48.160
Ahh, oh my God, how can you not burst out into laughter watching that scene?

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.300
Wh-what can you even say about it?

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.560
It looks like he's carrying
an anorexic Julia Roberts to their honeymoon suite

00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:00.480
while she wants the pool to pull her finger
just before Steroid Chia Pet eats them alive!

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.900
What is this?! I- ju- What is this?!

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:10.320
So he decides to ask someone who would obviously know all about mythical creatures... Rufio!

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.960
"Could you look up the word narf for me?"

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.280
I'm sure you've come across them
from your adventures in Neverland.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.180
"It's an... Eastern bedtime story, Mr. Heep."

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.980
Uh, heh.. yeah.
I wouldn't insult Eastern storytelling like that.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.420
I think the correct answer is

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.360
'Oh! That sounds like a word
from the same idiot who came up with Cypher Raige!

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.480
Very common Eastern name.'

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.560
But her mother knows all about it, what are the odds,

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.960
and she says the *laughs*narf-
Sorry, that's gonna take some getting used to-

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.020
- Has to meet the chosen one so that she can inspire him.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:48.480
"She will return with the great Eatlon, a giant eagle..."

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.600
They... of course, cut out the scene where she ate five pot brownies before saying this, but you get the idea.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:58.060
So Giamatti looks for this chosen one
who Story says is a writer.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:02.200
Though... again, you could replace all the dialogue with
"What's your quirk?"

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.160
"She's very good with animals."
Mhm, and your quirk?

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.520
"Crossword puzzles."
And your quirk?

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.160
"Let's make up a witty phrase."
"Baby's on the half-tip."

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:16.560
[Raucous laughter]

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.740
Jesus, you can't even do stoners right. That's not how a stoner screams, that's--

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.620
One of the Rice Krispie elves watching another one die!

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:28.860
[explosion] aaaaAAAAAH SNAP!

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.840
Of course, Giamatti is so focused on finding a writer

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.460
that he completely overlooks the person he's known for years that is a writer.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.420
"How's the writing?" *ding*
*mark whalburg's 'duh'*

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.880
But Story has been eavesdropping in his diary
to learn about his past.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.260
"A night, a man entered your home
when you were not there.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:51.380
He stole many things and killed your wife and children.
That is when you stopped being happy."

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:58.060
Brilliant deduction there, Nancy Drew.
Any other obvious dots you'd like to connect?

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:02.780
'When I hit my head that's when my head hurts.
When my butt farts that's when the air smells bad.

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:06.940
When I run in high heels people will focus more on that
rather than how dumb the rest of the movie is!"

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.060
Why don't you get suited up in your proper uniform?

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:14.960
But Giamatti introduces the writer to her, and...
Take a wild guess who plays him.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.860
-"I know I sent in that form.."
-"Haah.."

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.460
That's right, the writer who really has lost his muse.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:24.540
Yeah, take a good look, Shyamalan,
that's the closest to story you'll ever get.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:29.060
".. And have seemingly irrelevant and tedious dialogue that seems to regurgitate."

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:34.540
"Nice meeting you."
"I'm so very happy we saw... each other."

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.740
So he's inspired to go write "Devil"
as Giamatti tries to get Story back home

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.580
but the grass hyena is still out there.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.680
"What's happening?! I thought it was gonna be safe!"

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.420
'We're okay now, thank God he can't climb stairs.'

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.740
So he tries to get more information
from the Korean peacock,

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.980
who seems totally fine interrupting her clubbing
to talk fairy tales.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:00.480
"She said only a rogue scrunt will break the law of that night because most scrunts are afraid!"

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.560
"Afraid of what?"
"Tartutic."

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:10.260
*laughing* Oh my God- Scrunts, narfs, tartutics-
these all sound like cartoon characters sneezing.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:15.520
Just look at Giamatti's face after hearing all this.
He's like 'Well, I'm in a bomb.'

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:21.020
This all reads like a drunk mother reading a half-assed bedtime story to her kid.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:28.620
'This is a story about... hmmm... Story...'

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.780
'The character's name is Story?'
'Uh- yes, yep.'

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:38.280
'-And she is an ancient *coughs*narf!'
'Narf?'

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:45.820
'Uh-huh, yes. And she's running- running away from the mean *snort*'

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.440
'Scrunt?'

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:53.880
'Mhm, mhm. And it all took place in modern times. Goodnight.' *thump*

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.300
'Well, it's better than the time she said the trees did it...'

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:06.980
[Outro]
