00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.009
So what about the more standard method?

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.939
The more standard method is
actually just like light striping.

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:07.929
So you recognize this figure, this is
the light stripes where we project

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:09.938
out the stripes,
look at them from a camera, and

00:00:09.938 --> 00:00:13.470
then we see that the stripes bend
depending upon the depth of the object.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.010
So, as we said before,
you're still just doing stereo, okay?

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.620
Except instead of two cameras, you're
actually doing projection of one and

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.640
coming out the other.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.440
But the thing that I want to remind you
about stereo is if you know the relative

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.720
geometry of the cameras, you know how
they're, they're aligned and their,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.620
their offsets et cetera, right, their
extrinsics and their intrinsics, right.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.525
Then for any given location in one
image, there is an epipolar line,

00:00:40.525 --> 00:00:42.989
remember, in the other
image along which to look.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.490
Now, this is also true for
the projection method, right?

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.930
So if I project a point out, right,
at some location in one image,

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.050
then depending upon the depth of
the scene in my other image, yes,

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.690
I'm over here, Meg, in the other image,
where that will, point will be,

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.280
will be along an epipolar line.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.860
And how far along the line it is
is a function of the depth, so

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.580
I only have to search in along
a line if I know the calibration.

00:01:11.146 --> 00:01:15.110
Well, In my Kinect system,
of course I know the calibration between

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.050
the projector and the camera,
but instead of projecting lines,

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.040
what we're going to do is we're
going to project out a speckle pattern.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.670
So instead of a regular projector,
we're using a Kinect.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.470
Instead of line stripes,
we're spraying out a pattern of,

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.580
they call them pseudo-random
speckles because it's important that

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.090
the pattern be a little different
everywhere so that I can do a, ready?

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.700
Normalized correlation, all right.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.700
Instead of using a camera, I use my
Kinect, because the Kinect actually,

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.270
if you take a look at it, has a little
projector in it and a camera.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.270
And the relationship
between those are known.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.680
And then what the camera sees
is a speckle pattern, but

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.140
where the dots are offset
as a function of the depth.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.960
So that's shown here.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.110
So here's a picture so it's looking
flat, this is from one perspective.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.840
It's actually sort of faked in how it's
doing it, but don't worry about it.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.750
If it was just a flat wall, but if I
change the depth, so I put a little book

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.840
on this stand, right, you see that's
the difference between the depth, right?

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.460
So on the left one I'm just projecting
it on a flat wall and looking at it, and

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.580
on the right, that's the offset
that comes from the book, right?

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.050
And, and by the way, what is this
little pattern, this little thing here?

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.340
That's a shadow, right, because
the thing is offset a little bit, and

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.560
I'm projecting here,
there's a little area right here that I

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.560
can see with the camera that
can't be seen by the projector.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.410
That's what the black pattern is.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.370
In this particular case, the projection
is coming from this side, and

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.560
the camera is coming from that side.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.060
All right.
