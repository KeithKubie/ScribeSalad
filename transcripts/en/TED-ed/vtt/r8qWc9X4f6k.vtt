00:00:07.183 --> 00:00:12.326
Let's say there's a disaster that sends
humanity back to the Stone Age.

00:00:12.326 --> 00:00:15.404
Can our knowledge and history survive?

00:00:15.404 --> 00:00:17.413
The printed page will decompose.

00:00:17.413 --> 00:00:19.754
Hard drive storage will deteriorate.

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:22.894
Even stones will eventually crumble.

00:00:22.894 --> 00:00:28.254
But we might have something inside us that
can outlast these physical limitations:

00:00:28.254 --> 00:00:30.884
deoxyribonucleic acid.

00:00:30.884 --> 00:00:34.734
DNA already stores 
our biological information.

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:39.854
From eye color to skin tone,
it programs our entire bodies.

00:00:39.854 --> 00:00:42.754
DNA is made of four organic bases:

00:00:42.754 --> 00:00:43.665
adenine,

00:00:43.665 --> 00:00:44.389
guanine,

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:45.195
cytosine,

00:00:45.195 --> 00:00:46.566
and thymine,

00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:49.366
or A, G, C, and T.

00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:54.085
The specific sequence of these bases
into groups of three, known as codons,

00:00:54.085 --> 00:00:59.545
gives our cells instructions to make
each of the proteins in our bodies.

00:00:59.545 --> 00:01:02.485
But this code can 
be used for other things, too,

00:01:02.485 --> 00:01:04.736
like secret messages.

00:01:04.736 --> 00:01:08.696
In 1999, scientists in New York
created an alphabet

00:01:08.696 --> 00:01:12.636
in which each of the 64 
possible DNA codons

00:01:12.636 --> 00:01:18.147
substituted for a specific letter,
number, or grammar symbol.

00:01:18.147 --> 00:01:23.286
They spliced a 22-character message
into a long strand of DNA

00:01:23.286 --> 00:01:27.006
and surrounded it with specific
genetic markers.

00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:31.627
They then hid the DNA over a period
in a type-written letter

00:01:31.627 --> 00:01:35.747
with only a small smudge
to give the location away.

00:01:35.747 --> 00:01:38.077
They mailed the letter back to themselves.

00:01:38.077 --> 00:01:41.678
Then they examined the letter
looking for the DNA strand.

00:01:41.678 --> 00:01:45.557
Once the DNA strand was located,
they found the genetic markers.

00:01:45.557 --> 00:01:50.399
Then, they sequenced the DNA
and successfully decoded the message.

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.087
It soon became obvious 
that DNA cryptography

00:01:53.087 --> 00:01:56.878
could code for much more
than simple text.

00:01:56.878 --> 00:02:01.619
By translating the 1's and 0's
of binary code into DNA codons,

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.618
digital data could be programmed
into synthetic DNA,

00:02:05.618 --> 00:02:09.461
then decoded back into its original form.

00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:15.158
In 2012, UK scientists encoded
739 kilobytes of computer files

00:02:15.158 --> 00:02:17.376
into DNA strands,

00:02:17.376 --> 00:02:21.007
including all 154 Shakespeare sonnets

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:25.019
and an excerpt from Martin 
Luther King's "I Have a Dream" speech.

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.679
And four years later, researchers at
Microsoft and the University of Washington

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.080
broke that record.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.590
They used binary coding to capture
a whopping 200 megabytes of data,

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.501
including the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights

00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:43.670
and a high-def OK Go music video,

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.370
all in strings of DNA.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.951
As far as storage capacity goes,

00:02:48.951 --> 00:02:53.360
DNA stands out because of the surprising
amount of information it can hold

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.641
in so little space.

00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:59.791
The current theoretical limit 
of DNA'S storage capacity is so high

00:02:59.791 --> 00:03:05.241
that you could fit 100 million HD movies
on a pencil eraser.

00:03:05.241 --> 00:03:09.322
It's even conceivable that one day
we could fit all of the information

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:10.801
currently on the Internet

00:03:10.801 --> 00:03:13.722
into the space of a shoe box.

00:03:13.722 --> 00:03:18.891
Also, computers and the magnetic tape and
discs that their information is stored on

00:03:18.891 --> 00:03:26.020
only last for a few decades, at most,
before degrading and becoming unreliable.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.453
Meanwhile, DNA 
has a half-life of 500 years,

00:03:30.453 --> 00:03:34.673
meaning that's how long it takes
for half of its bonds to break.

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:37.893
And if left in a cold 
and dark environment,

00:03:37.893 --> 00:03:43.321
DNA could potentially last
for hundreds of thousands of years.

00:03:43.321 --> 00:03:44.924
And if that isn't long enough,

00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:50.753
scientists experimented with having
synthetic DNA auto-reproduce.

00:03:50.753 --> 00:03:53.113
After creating their own strands of DNA

00:03:53.113 --> 00:03:56.854
that spelled out the lyrics to
the children's song "It's a Small World,"

00:03:56.854 --> 00:04:02.690
they placed them into the genome of
a microbe nicknamed Conan the Bacterium.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.794
Conan belongs to a species 
which can survive in a vacuum,

00:04:06.794 --> 00:04:09.394
or without water, for six years,

00:04:09.394 --> 00:04:14.174
or come out unscathed after being
exposed to a dose of radiation

00:04:14.174 --> 00:04:18.863
1,000 times that which would kill a human.

00:04:18.863 --> 00:04:20.114
According to the experiment,

00:04:20.114 --> 00:04:27.014
the bacterium was able to reproduce at
least 100 generations without data loss.

00:04:27.014 --> 00:04:31.314
Theoretically, if the organism
had redundant copies of the information

00:04:31.314 --> 00:04:34.325
that could be used to automatically
correct mistakes,

00:04:34.325 --> 00:04:38.886
the information could stay
preserved even longer.

00:04:38.886 --> 00:04:43.955
So one day, you might be able to create
a living, growing, knowledge archive

00:04:43.955 --> 00:04:46.305
in your own backyard,

00:04:46.305 --> 00:04:49.006
and its seeds might carry
your family's history,

00:04:49.006 --> 00:04:52.475
a detailed breakdown 
of the world's political upheavals,

00:04:52.475 --> 00:04:58.647
or the sum of humanity's knowledge
into forests and across continents.

00:04:58.647 --> 00:05:02.347
Perhaps even into the 
far reaches of space.

00:05:02.347 --> 00:05:06.768
Though we might one day disappear,
perhaps our legacy can still live on,

00:05:06.768 --> 00:05:09.427
if anyone would think to find it.
