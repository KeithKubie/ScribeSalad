00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:06.065
- First time I ever got
a laugh from an audience

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:08.400
was in seventh-grade English.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.904
It was the ten-minute
silent-reading point

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:13.306
in the middle of class

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:18.178
when the timing
just hit me perfectly to fart.

00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:22.682
And the class erupted
in laughter--

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:25.351
probably the best thing they
ever heard in their life.

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:28.687
And then the teacher, noticing
that if he were to go against me

00:01:28.687 --> 00:01:30.189
that he would lose the class,

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.658
decided to play along,
and he said,

00:01:32.658 --> 00:01:34.527
"I'll give that a 7 out of 10."

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:37.030
And then the class again erupted
into laughter.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.366
And that's when I realized
that farts are funny.

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:41.867
They're always
gonna be funny.

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:43.202
As far as I'm concerned,

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:45.105
a fart's one
of the funniest things.

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:48.208
It's the best fart joke--
just a straight fart.

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:52.445
And I'm not proud
of what I've done.

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:53.947
I'm a dad now.

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:56.215
Don't judge me.

00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:58.551
2008, I was
in Las Vegas, Nevada,

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:01.721
for seven days,
performing at Planet Hollywood,

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:03.389
and my friend
Ben Kronberg,

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:05.558
who's a very funny
stand-up comedian,

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:07.393
was performing with me.

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:10.229
And if you've ever been in Vegas
for longer than three days,

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.066
you know
that it's a suicide mission.

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.667
They're should be a limit.

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:16.068
Like, three days
we got to kick you out.

00:02:16.068 --> 00:02:17.736
It's not gonna be good for us.

00:02:17.736 --> 00:02:19.471
It's not gonna be good for you.

00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:21.073
But I stuck it out, seven days.

00:02:21.073 --> 00:02:24.743
And on the sixth day
of my seven-day run,

00:02:24.743 --> 00:02:26.245
we had two shows.

00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:27.913
And the first show
went great.

00:02:27.913 --> 00:02:29.415
In fact, a couple people
from Hollywood--

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:31.250
some industry was
out there gambling.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.586
They came to the show.
Afterwards, we smoked some pot.

00:02:34.586 --> 00:02:37.090
And they said, "Hey, listen,
we know you've got another show.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.092
"But after your next show,

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:40.760
"there's gonna be a party
at the club

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.261
at the top
of Planet Hollywood."

00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:45.097
I think it was called Privé
at the time.

00:02:45.097 --> 00:02:47.934
Said, "Go up there and just say,

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:50.102
'Table 60, Isaiah.'"

00:02:50.102 --> 00:02:52.605
They weren't Isaiah.
That was just the name of a guy.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.506
And they said,
"They'll let you right in.

00:02:54.506 --> 00:02:55.942
Table 60, Isaiah."

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:57.443
They were like, "The guy
practically owns the place."

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:59.111
I was like,
"All right, fine, yeah."

00:02:59.111 --> 00:03:02.515
So we do the next show,
and after the show,

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:04.283
another standing ovation...

00:03:04.283 --> 00:03:06.118
[laughter]

00:03:06.118 --> 00:03:10.623
I get sick of them, to be
honest, after a while, but...

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:11.958
After the show,

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.460
a girl walked up to me,
and she had a magazine

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.963
that was rolled up
as tight as it could be,

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:18.464
and she handed me
the magazine,

00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:20.366
and she said,
"This is from Craig."

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:23.069
And he's a comedian that had
been there the night before,

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.138
and apparently
he wanted to give me something.

00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:27.473
And as she walked away.
I unrolled the magazine,

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:32.478
and inside this magazine
was cocaine, Percocets--

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:34.146
prescription pain pills--

00:03:34.146 --> 00:03:37.483
a lot of mushrooms,
and marijuana.

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:41.987
So apparently Craig
had leftover drugs...

00:03:41.987 --> 00:03:44.657
and gave it to somebody and said
to surprise me with it.

00:03:44.657 --> 00:03:47.326
So I looked at all the drugs,
and out of all of these drugs,

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:49.829
I'd done one of them,
and I thought, "You know what?

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.163
Since I've never done
mushrooms"--

00:03:51.163 --> 00:03:52.665
a lot of people decide
to do mushrooms

00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:55.168
for the first time in the woods
with some good friends

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:59.338
or maybe
at a great Phish concert.

00:03:59.338 --> 00:04:01.006
I thought,
"Why don't I do it

00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:05.244
in the most nightmarish
landscape possible--Las Vegas?"

00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:07.446
So I just eat
some mushrooms.

00:04:07.446 --> 00:04:09.348
And then I'm like, "Well,
I've never had mushrooms before,

00:04:09.348 --> 00:04:14.286
I might as well throw
a couple Percocet on top of it."

00:04:14.286 --> 00:04:16.021
And so there I was,
feeling like--

00:04:16.021 --> 00:04:20.826
for the first time--
like I was living at 100%.

00:04:20.826 --> 00:04:23.329
And I looked at Ben, and I said,
"Isaiah, table 60."

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:26.365
And he said, "Fuck, yeah."

00:04:26.365 --> 00:04:29.201
And we went up to Privé,
and we got Isaiah, table 60,

00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:31.938
and we had some woman escorting
us up through whatever,

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:34.707
and the walls are vibrating
because of the mushrooms.

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:38.544
My feet were vibrating--
I think that was the Percocet.

00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:40.546
So it just kind of felt like
we were all in sync,

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:42.881
and there was Isaiah
at table 60,

00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:44.383
and you couldn't miss Isaiah.

00:04:44.383 --> 00:04:48.053
He had the body
of George Costanza...

00:04:48.053 --> 00:04:49.389
with fashion sense...

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.557
a certain type
of fashion sense.

00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:54.227
His hair was slicked back.
He was like an Italian guy.

00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:56.228
And he was wearing
a silk yellow shirt

00:04:56.228 --> 00:04:57.730
with almost-matching pants.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:58.731
He had his name--

00:04:58.731 --> 00:04:59.899
Like, his initials--

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:02.234
they were stitched
onto his pocket.

00:05:02.234 --> 00:05:03.836
And he had bottle service
at the table,

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:06.238
and he was shaking drinks up
and serving everybody.

00:05:06.238 --> 00:05:07.740
He was the king
of the party.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.909
He practically owns the place
is what I was heard.

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:11.911
It's what I was heard.

00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:15.248
[laughter]

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:17.249
And so I sit down,
and I get introduced

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:18.918
by these industry people,
like, "Here's Nick.

00:05:18.918 --> 00:05:20.920
He's the comedian
that's here for the weekend."

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.588
And Isaiah
immediately perked up.

00:05:22.588 --> 00:05:24.190
He was excited
to take care of me.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.424
We got the comedian here.

00:05:25.424 --> 00:05:26.825
"What do you want?
What do you want?

00:05:26.825 --> 00:05:27.893
You want a drink?"

00:05:27.893 --> 00:05:29.661
And I was like, "I don't"--

00:05:29.661 --> 00:05:31.764
In my mind, I'm like, "I don't
think I should add that.

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:33.432
Like, I don't think I should be
adding things at this point."

00:05:33.432 --> 00:05:35.935
So I was like, "No, I'm good.
Thanks, Isaiah."

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:37.270
Oh.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.439
The disappointment
just sunk into him.

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:43.675
The look on his face was like,
"That's not okay.

00:05:43.675 --> 00:05:45.444
I want to serve you something."

00:05:45.444 --> 00:05:47.113
And he goes,
"Well, then what do you want?"

00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:48.847
And I'm looking
around this club,

00:05:48.847 --> 00:05:51.784
and people are dancing, and
there's women dancing on tables.

00:05:51.784 --> 00:05:53.953
And it's not like one girl
is like, "Should I do it?"

00:05:53.953 --> 00:05:55.354
"Yeah, let's do it."

00:05:55.354 --> 00:05:56.956
No, they're paid to dance
on these tables.

00:05:56.956 --> 00:05:58.357
It's like these models

00:05:58.357 --> 00:06:00.459
that fly into Vegas
on Southwest Airlines--

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:02.929
you can see them every week
if you want--

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:05.397
that come in and do this.

00:06:05.397 --> 00:06:06.966
And they're dancing
on these tables.

00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:09.135
And I just looked at a girl
from across the room,

00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:11.470
and I go to Isaiah, "Her."

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:12.972
And he was like, "All right."

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:14.273
And he did some hand motion,

00:06:14.273 --> 00:06:16.309
and she was off that table
in seconds.

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:18.143
And she walked over, and she
said, "What do you want?"

00:06:18.143 --> 00:06:19.779
And he goes, "He wants you."

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:21.981
And this is a weird moment
where you're like,

00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:24.817
"Well, yeah, who wouldn't?

00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:26.619
"Oh, my wife wouldn't.

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:30.155
My definitely wouldn't want me
to have her."

00:06:30.155 --> 00:06:32.324
So I was like,
"Oh, I was actually joking."

00:06:32.324 --> 00:06:36.161
And I gave her to Ben, and she
danced on Ben for a song.

00:06:36.161 --> 00:06:38.163
And then Isaiah gave her
two $100 bills,

00:06:38.163 --> 00:06:39.665
and she went back to her table.

00:06:39.665 --> 00:06:43.403
And Isaiah was just
so disappointed in me.

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:45.337
I know that he wanted
to please me in some way,

00:06:45.337 --> 00:06:47.006
so I was waiting
for the opportunity

00:06:47.006 --> 00:06:48.741
where Isaiah finally had
something for me.

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:50.342
And then it happened.

00:06:50.342 --> 00:06:51.644
One of the guys from Los Angeles

00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:53.846
that had brought us
up to the table

00:06:53.846 --> 00:06:55.247
had rolled a joint,

00:06:55.247 --> 00:06:56.682
and that was gonna be
their gift for Isaiah

00:06:56.682 --> 00:06:58.651
for bringing us
up there that night.

00:06:58.651 --> 00:07:00.519
'Cause weed's actually kind of
hard to find in Las Vegas.

00:07:00.519 --> 00:07:02.287
I'll tell you
more about that later.

00:07:02.287 --> 00:07:06.325
So the guy took the joint,
and from across the table

00:07:06.325 --> 00:07:09.295
in a very loud room goes,
"After hours!"

00:07:09.295 --> 00:07:11.097
And he hands the joint
to Isaiah.

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:12.298
Isaiah looks at the joint

00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:15.367
and then looks at me
and says, "Huh?"

00:07:15.367 --> 00:07:17.770
And I was like,
"Yeah, I'll do that."

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.539
And so he lit this joint up
in a very secretive way,

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:22.708
handed it to me,
and now I was just like--

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:24.343
[inhales] And everyone's
like, "No, you got to"--

00:07:24.343 --> 00:07:26.011
And I'm like,
"Well, it's Isaiah,

00:07:26.011 --> 00:07:27.713
he practically owns the place,
but, yeah, we'll hide it."

00:07:27.713 --> 00:07:29.382
So it's getting--[inhales]
passed around the table,

00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:31.650
people are, like, hiding it,
going under the leg

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.720
and, like, keeping it down,
and it came around two times

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.123
and hit me as the last person,
my third turn with the joint,

00:07:38.123 --> 00:07:40.225
and I took the last hit,
and I went to go

00:07:40.225 --> 00:07:42.228
put it down by my feet,
and in that moment,

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:44.797
I feel a hand on my shoulder,
and I turn around,

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:46.565
and it's a guy
with an earpiece in

00:07:46.565 --> 00:07:48.734
and a polo shirt--
he's a security guard.

00:07:48.734 --> 00:07:50.403
And then I look
around the table,

00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:51.737
and people are scattering.

00:07:51.737 --> 00:07:54.640
Isaiah is jumping
over this fucking booth.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.375
Like, I don't even know
what he's doing, he's just--

00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:59.579
People are clearing out,
and not me and not Ben

00:07:59.579 --> 00:08:02.181
and not this agent
that was there from Los Angeles.

00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:03.716
We're all just stuck
at the table,

00:08:03.716 --> 00:08:06.251
and now we're surrounded
by ten security guards,

00:08:06.251 --> 00:08:08.220
all in polo shirts,
with the earpieces.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.521
And they don't just surround us

00:08:09.521 --> 00:08:11.256
like there's,
like, a couple areas

00:08:11.256 --> 00:08:12.758
where we might be able
to jump through.

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:14.927
It's like they've barricaded us
with their arms.

00:08:14.927 --> 00:08:16.261
And their move was this--

00:08:16.261 --> 00:08:17.530
It wasn't grabbing us.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.099
It was just, like,
a group walk.

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:22.267
And they just slowly
group walked us.

00:08:22.267 --> 00:08:26.104
And we're just in the middle
of a circle, and I'm like...

00:08:26.104 --> 00:08:28.941
You know, you think
it's like a dance circle.

00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:30.442
But it feels weird,

00:08:30.442 --> 00:08:33.945
and they pull us out,
and in this kind of big hallway,

00:08:33.945 --> 00:08:35.281
there's more security guards.

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:38.016
These ones have suit jackets on,
same earpieces.

00:08:38.016 --> 00:08:39.384
Things are starting to change.

00:08:39.384 --> 00:08:41.120
Temperature has changed a lot
in the room.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.958
I have all of my drugs
in this pocket--all of 'em.

00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:50.129
In my jacket pocket right here,
I have my own weed.

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:51.463
And the first thing
that they notice

00:08:51.463 --> 00:08:53.132
is that I look
a little more eccentric

00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:54.633
than the two other people.

00:08:54.633 --> 00:08:55.967
So they separate all of us,

00:08:55.967 --> 00:08:57.536
and then everything's
focused on me.

00:08:57.536 --> 00:08:59.305
And they're like,
"What drugs do you have?

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:00.472
Tell us right now."

00:09:00.472 --> 00:09:01.907
And in my mind, I was like,

00:09:01.907 --> 00:09:04.109
"Ah, let's just give them one
at a time

00:09:04.109 --> 00:09:06.411
and see if they keep pushing."

00:09:06.411 --> 00:09:08.813
So I pull the weed
out of my pocket,

00:09:08.813 --> 00:09:10.482
and I'm like, "I've got this."

00:09:10.482 --> 00:09:12.818
And so now he's looking
at this device.

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:14.820
It's like this wooden thing
with a twist top,

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.322
and there's this metal bat
that springs out

00:09:17.322 --> 00:09:19.658
because there's a spring in
there, and it, like, jumps out.

00:09:19.658 --> 00:09:21.326
And the guy's like,
"What is this?"

00:09:21.326 --> 00:09:22.995
And so I'm starting to explain.

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:24.664
I'm like, "Well, you take
that thing, and you put it in,

00:09:24.664 --> 00:09:26.499
and it gets some weed out,
and then you smoke it."

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:28.333
And he's, like, turning it
upside down,

00:09:28.333 --> 00:09:29.568
and, like, there was no weed.

00:09:29.568 --> 00:09:31.170
Just, like,
some specs fall out.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.404
I'm like, "Oh, God."

00:09:32.404 --> 00:09:34.006
And he goes,
"All right, all right."

00:09:34.006 --> 00:09:35.474
And in that moment,

00:09:35.474 --> 00:09:37.076
I realized, "Oh, my God,
I can't get arrested."

00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:39.311
I'm actually performing
on 'The Tonight Show'

00:09:39.311 --> 00:09:40.512
four days from there.

00:09:40.512 --> 00:09:42.514
Like, I had just shot a pilot,

00:09:42.514 --> 00:09:45.484
a television show for NBC
the week before.

00:09:45.484 --> 00:09:46.852
I cannot get arrested

00:09:46.852 --> 00:09:49.355
for all of these drugs
in Las Vegas right now.

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:51.157
This is the biggest moment
of my life,

00:09:51.157 --> 00:09:52.692
and I am a fuck-up,
and I hope--

00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:54.860
Oh, my God, everyone's gonna
hate me, my family.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.361
And, like,
it's all kind of hitting me.

00:09:56.361 --> 00:09:58.029
And when you're
kind of high on stuff

00:09:58.029 --> 00:10:00.032
and you start to take
that negative turn,

00:10:00.032 --> 00:10:02.368
it really goes bad.

00:10:02.368 --> 00:10:04.203
The one nice thing
was the Percocet

00:10:04.203 --> 00:10:06.706
that was just really warming
my body.

00:10:08.507 --> 00:10:10.543
So I'm standing there,
and right in that moment,

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:12.878
I'm like, "You can't arrest me.
I'm the comedian.

00:10:12.878 --> 00:10:15.480
I'm the comedian performing here
at Planet Hollywood."

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.884
And that was the moment that the
agent who was in there,

00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:21.386
even though he's not my agent,
steps up, and he goes,

00:10:21.386 --> 00:10:22.888
"You can't arrest him.

00:10:22.888 --> 00:10:25.023
If you do, then I will never
book another comedian

00:10:25.023 --> 00:10:26.392
in this casino again."

00:10:26.392 --> 00:10:28.227
And this seemed
to affect something

00:10:28.227 --> 00:10:29.995
a little bit for a moment.

00:10:29.995 --> 00:10:32.164
And they're like, "Well, the
cops are already on their way,

00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:34.700
so we're just gonna take you
guys down to the holding room."

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.535
So now they take us
to an elevator,

00:10:36.535 --> 00:10:38.037
and we're stuck
in this elevator,

00:10:38.037 --> 00:10:40.906
and we're going down,
and the vibes are bad.

00:10:40.906 --> 00:10:43.375
And I'm like, "It's just weed.
It's not a big deal."

00:10:43.375 --> 00:10:44.843
And he goes,
"This is Nevada, son.

00:10:44.843 --> 00:10:48.747
Having marijuana is just as bad
as having cocaine."

00:10:48.747 --> 00:10:51.817
And in my mind, I was like,
"What if you have both?"

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:55.988
[laughter]

00:10:55.988 --> 00:10:57.422
No.

00:10:57.422 --> 00:11:00.059
We get down to the basement
of the casino.

00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:02.427
They walk us to this room,
and they sit us down,

00:11:02.427 --> 00:11:04.229
and I'm sitting in this chair.

00:11:04.229 --> 00:11:06.365
And they take our IDs.

00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:08.600
They tell us the cops
are on their way.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.770
And one of 'em puts on
some rubber gloves.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:15.607
And he points to Ben, and he
says, "You're first, stand up."

00:11:15.607 --> 00:11:17.443
And I swear to God,
Ben jumped up

00:11:17.443 --> 00:11:19.678
like he'd won
the fucking lottery.

00:11:19.678 --> 00:11:23.615
Like, the most sarcastic,
like, "Whoo, yeah! It's me."

00:11:23.615 --> 00:11:26.284
And the guys are just like,
"Oh, this is"--

00:11:26.284 --> 00:11:29.454
And so Ben gets on the wall...

00:11:29.454 --> 00:11:32.290
and he starts, like--

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:33.959
I mean, I think we were
all wondering

00:11:33.959 --> 00:11:36.261
what the wall felt like,
you know, initially,

00:11:36.261 --> 00:11:38.197
and Ben was just kind of doing
an initial check-out,

00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:41.466
like, "Yeah, it feels--
it's definitely wall-like.

00:11:41.466 --> 00:11:42.801
And the guy goes,

00:11:42.801 --> 00:11:46.038
"Hey, comedian,
don't make this funny.

00:11:46.038 --> 00:11:47.639
This isn't a joke."

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:51.476
And Ben says, "How many movies
have I seen this scene in?

00:11:51.476 --> 00:11:53.545
How can I not make this funny?"

00:11:53.545 --> 00:11:56.715
And then in that moment,

00:11:56.715 --> 00:11:58.317
Ben...

00:11:58.317 --> 00:12:00.886
farted...

00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:02.054
out loud.

00:12:02.054 --> 00:12:03.322
It rumbled through the room,

00:12:03.322 --> 00:12:04.923
through the basement
of this casino,

00:12:04.923 --> 00:12:08.160
and everybody erupted
in laughter!

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.662
And in that moment,

00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:12.998
on that chair,
I took my jacket,

00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:15.500
and I took all the drugs
in my pant pocket,

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.168
while people were
laughing hysterically,

00:12:17.168 --> 00:12:19.839
and put all of the drugs
in my jacket pocket

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:23.075
and took my jacket off
and rested it on my chair

00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:24.677
and just sat there.

00:12:24.677 --> 00:12:26.111
They finished searching him.
They said, "You're next."

00:12:26.111 --> 00:12:28.514
I stood up, they searched me,
found nothing.

00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:30.015
Searched the agent.

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:32.084
Put my jacket back on
in the middle of all that

00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:33.519
while nobody was looking,

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:35.087
and they gave us back our IDs,
and they said,

00:12:35.087 --> 00:12:37.856
"All right, we're not gonna
have you guys arrested."

00:12:37.856 --> 00:12:39.692
And I knew it was because
they couldn't find the joint,

00:12:39.692 --> 00:12:41.694
because I later found
that it was still stuck

00:12:41.694 --> 00:12:43.695 line:92%
to the bottom of my shoe,

00:12:43.695 --> 00:12:46.031 line:91%
which was confusing
the fuck out of them,

00:12:46.031 --> 00:12:49.868
because I was smelling it, too,
and I was just like...

00:12:49.868 --> 00:12:51.936
"You guys missed
one area to search,

00:12:51.936 --> 00:12:54.373
I'll tell you that right now."

00:12:54.373 --> 00:12:55.708
[exhales deeply]

00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:58.877
They let us out
on a loading dock,

00:12:58.877 --> 00:13:00.545
and there's
some workers smoking,

00:13:00.545 --> 00:13:03.883
and I walked up and just...

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.387
Just was really feeling
the ground...

00:13:08.387 --> 00:13:11.223
that was moving.

00:13:11.223 --> 00:13:13.158
And...

00:13:13.158 --> 00:13:15.227
Ben...

00:13:15.227 --> 00:13:17.729
saved my life with a fart.

00:13:17.729 --> 00:13:19.231
Now, like I said earlier,
I always knew

00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:20.899
that farts would be funny--
every time--

00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:22.901
which proved itself
down in that room,

00:13:22.901 --> 00:13:25.838
but I never knew
one would save my life.

00:13:25.838 --> 00:13:27.572
Thank you guys very much.

00:13:27.572 --> 00:13:29.408
[cheers and applause]
