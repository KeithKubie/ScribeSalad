00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.950
- In the video on dehydration synthesis,

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.590
we saw how we could start with a glucose molecule,

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.820
and through dehydration synthesis

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.990
form a bond with another glucose molecule.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.020
And just by doing that, you'd form the disaccharide maltose

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.290
if these were both glucose molecules.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.350
But then you could keep going,

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.700
and you could form longer chains of glucose molecules.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.990
And to these things, where you would take a monosaccharide,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.210
glucose is the most common example of that,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.590
and you create chains of these,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.440
we call these polysaccharides.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.290
Polysaccharides, this is a polysaccharide.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.990
And there's all sorts of interesting examples

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.190
of polysaccharides all around you,

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.920
especially polysaccharides of glucose,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.220
or things that are derived from glucose.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.650
This right here this is a bowl of mashed potatoes,

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.550
which is mostly starch.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.400
Which is mainly just chains of glucose.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.470
So this right over here, that is starch.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.850
The shell of a lot of insects and things like lobsters,

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.650
and the wings of these insects right over here,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.540
that's made of something called chitin.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.500
And chitin is also a polysaccharide.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.480
It's made of chains, a modification of glucose

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.440
chains of that, that's chitin right over there.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.450
Very similar to starch, in our muscles we have glycogen,

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.920
which is our store of energy in our muscles.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.700
You have cellulose,

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.420
which is probably all around you right now.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.720
Cellulose are things like--

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.450
Because this is something that's all around you,

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.480
and you don't even realize it.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.090
Cellulose, this is what constitutes things

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.720
like paper and wood.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.350
It's involved in the cell walls of plants.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.990
This right over here is a picture of cotton,

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.685
cotton in its natural form.

00:01:55.685 --> 00:01:58.785
And cotton is actually one of the purest forms of cellulose,

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.675
it's roughly 90 percent cellulose.

00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:04.585
And if you take a zoom in on a cotton fiber,

00:02:04.585 --> 00:02:07.085
actually a fiber of cellulose,

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:11.285
you'll see chains of glucose molecules.

00:02:11.285 --> 00:02:16.385
So you see this right over here, that is a glucose molecule.

00:02:16.385 --> 00:02:20.245
Then you see another glucose molecule.

00:02:20.245 --> 00:02:21.825
And this chain has been formed

00:02:21.825 --> 00:02:23.985
through dehydration synthesis.

00:02:23.985 --> 00:02:25.985
And difference between starch and cellulose,

00:02:25.985 --> 00:02:26.885
for the main difference,

00:02:26.885 --> 00:02:28.585
in terms of how this bonding has.

00:02:28.585 --> 00:02:30.825
With starch, the glucose molecules just keep forming

00:02:30.825 --> 00:02:33.655
the way that you saw in the video on dehydration synthesis.

00:02:33.655 --> 00:02:36.255
While in cellulose, they get flipped over.

00:02:36.255 --> 00:02:40.985
So you can see here, this oxygen is pointing that way,

00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:42.385
this oxygen is pointing that way,

00:02:42.385 --> 00:02:43.755
that oxygen is pointing that way.

00:02:43.755 --> 00:02:45.755
And you could look up more about cellulose.

00:02:45.755 --> 00:02:47.885
But it's really interesting, what gives it its structure

00:02:47.885 --> 00:02:50.185
are these hydrogen bonds that form

00:02:50.185 --> 00:02:53.455
between the partially negative,

00:02:53.455 --> 00:02:56.355
the very electronegative oxygens on one strand.

00:02:56.355 --> 00:02:59.985
And the partially positive hydrogens on another strand,

00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:01.985
and that's actually what give its structure.

00:03:01.985 --> 00:03:05.525
So really, really interesting things, these polysaccharides.

00:03:05.525 --> 00:03:06.985
The question is,

00:03:06.985 --> 00:03:09.055
how do you actually break these things down?

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:10.855
If I were to eat these mashed potatoes,

00:03:10.855 --> 00:03:14.425
how do I eventually turn this thing into glucose,

00:03:14.425 --> 00:03:16.485
so I could use it for energy?

00:03:16.485 --> 00:03:23.075
And the way that happens is through hydrolysis.

00:03:23.925 --> 00:03:25.925
And you could break down this word.

00:03:25.925 --> 00:03:29.985
The "hydro", if you see hydro, the prefix hydro,

00:03:29.985 --> 00:03:33.165
that's a good clue that it has something to do with water.

00:03:33.525 --> 00:03:36.025
And then if you see "lysis", if you're lysing something,

00:03:36.025 --> 00:03:37.245
this means that you're gonna break it down.

00:03:37.245 --> 00:03:40.285
So this is breaking down something using water.

00:03:40.285 --> 00:03:42.955
And that's exactly what happens with hydrolysis.

00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:44.915
If you have this polysaccharide,

00:03:44.915 --> 00:03:48.785
and let's throw a water molecule in there,

00:03:50.545 --> 00:03:51.955
this water molecule is going to be able

00:03:51.955 --> 00:03:55.245
to break one of these bonds.

00:03:56.025 --> 00:03:59.075
So we might end up with something like--

00:04:00.155 --> 00:04:01.955
This chain could keep going in both directions,

00:04:01.955 --> 00:04:04.435
but we could end up with something that looks like this.

00:04:05.615 --> 00:04:10.335
That looks something like that.

00:04:10.855 --> 00:04:13.285
So half of this water molecule gets broken up,

00:04:13.285 --> 00:04:14.825
essentially to break this bond.

00:04:14.825 --> 00:04:17.485
It's the opposite of dehydration synthesis.

00:04:17.485 --> 00:04:18.855
So let's see if we can understand,

00:04:18.855 --> 00:04:22.325
get an overview of exactly how that happens.

00:04:22.325 --> 00:04:28.515
So this right over here, this is maltose right over here.

00:04:28.515 --> 00:04:30.485
It's disaccharide, it's just two glucose molecules

00:04:30.485 --> 00:04:31.525
attached to each other.

00:04:31.525 --> 00:04:34.005
If we kept doing this, if this kept going,

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:37.855
if this guy had bond to another glucose molecule,

00:04:37.855 --> 00:04:39.625
and this guy had a bond to another glucose molecule,

00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:41.655
then we'd be dealing with starch.

00:04:41.655 --> 00:04:43.385
Or we could be dealing with glycogen.

00:04:43.385 --> 00:04:44.455
If this was flipped over,

00:04:44.455 --> 00:04:46.185
and they kept flipping over and over,

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:48.755
then we could be talking about cellulose.

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:51.055
But let's just thing about how this is the mechanism.

00:04:51.055 --> 00:04:55.125
The mechanism by which this bond can actually be broken.

00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:59.835
It's really just the reverse of dehydration synthesis.

00:05:00.855 --> 00:05:02.655
This is going to just be an overview of it.

00:05:03.225 --> 00:05:07.845
This oxygen right over here, it's got two lone pairs.

00:05:07.845 --> 00:05:10.355
There's always a chance that if it bumps into something

00:05:10.355 --> 00:05:14.525
in just the right way, it could nab a hydrogen proton

00:05:14.525 --> 00:05:19.225
that is just sitting out there in the fluid.

00:05:19.225 --> 00:05:20.355
We're assuming that this is happening

00:05:20.355 --> 00:05:23.585
in an aqueous solution, it's happening in water.

00:05:23.585 --> 00:05:25.115
So it can just grab a hydrogen proton

00:05:25.115 --> 00:05:28.485
from a passing hydronium molecule.

00:05:28.485 --> 00:05:34.985
And so if it does that, it would form a covalent bond,

00:05:34.985 --> 00:05:36.685
and have a positive charge.

00:05:36.685 --> 00:05:39.485
And now relative to actually both carbons,

00:05:39.485 --> 00:05:41.425
but let's focus on this carbon right over here.

00:05:41.425 --> 00:05:43.625
This guy would be, what we call in organic chemistry,

00:05:43.625 --> 00:05:46.005
a good leaving group.

00:05:46.625 --> 00:05:49.855
So these electrons,

00:05:49.855 --> 00:05:51.985
the oxygen might want to just take these back,

00:05:51.985 --> 00:05:53.825
because it's got a positive charge,

00:05:53.825 --> 00:05:55.425
oxygen is really electronegative,

00:05:55.425 --> 00:05:58.525
so things just bump in exactly the right way.

00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:01.025
If things interact in exactly the right way,

00:06:01.025 --> 00:06:02.485
you might have another water molecule.

00:06:02.485 --> 00:06:05.085
And this is where that extra water molecule is valuable

00:06:05.085 --> 00:06:06.825
in our hydrolysis.

00:06:07.025 --> 00:06:09.025
So let's say this is just another water molecule

00:06:09.025 --> 00:06:11.285
just passing by in exactly the right way.

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:19.255
This could form a bond with that carbon

00:06:19.255 --> 00:06:20.605
right over there.

00:06:20.815 --> 00:06:22.655
And just as it forms a bond with that carbon,

00:06:22.655 --> 00:06:24.525
the carbon says, "Okay, I'm getting to share

00:06:24.525 --> 00:06:28.175
"some other electrons, let me let go of these electrons."

00:06:28.245 --> 00:06:30.245
So it lets go of these electrons.

00:06:30.845 --> 00:06:33.785
And what do you have left?

00:06:33.785 --> 00:06:36.025
Well, we can go over here,

00:06:36.025 --> 00:06:40.455
and so now this carbon has, let me color code it,

00:06:40.455 --> 00:06:42.455
so this bond that was just forming,

00:06:42.455 --> 00:06:46.005
that is this bond right over here.

00:06:46.625 --> 00:06:52.095
This oxygen is this oxygen right over there.

00:06:52.625 --> 00:06:54.425
It actually has another hydrogen attached to it,

00:06:54.425 --> 00:06:55.555
so let me do that.

00:06:55.555 --> 00:06:56.945
So right when it makes the bond,

00:06:56.945 --> 00:06:58.715
it will have a positive charge.

00:06:58.715 --> 00:07:04.155
And then, this bond right over goes back to this oxygen.

00:07:04.155 --> 00:07:05.955
This oxygen right over here,

00:07:05.955 --> 00:07:08.905
is that oxygen right over there.

00:07:09.415 --> 00:07:11.335
Now when it started off, this guy grabbed--

00:07:15.285 --> 00:07:17.525
The hydrogen proton that I grabbed, I showed in orange,

00:07:17.525 --> 00:07:18.705
that's this one.

00:07:19.185 --> 00:07:20.935
That's this one right over here.

00:07:24.085 --> 00:07:25.925
Now, this one grabbed a hydrogen proton,

00:07:25.925 --> 00:07:27.485
and now this one can actually give back

00:07:27.485 --> 00:07:28.855
a hydrogen proton through solution.

00:07:29.385 --> 00:07:31.955
If a water molecule passing by could just grab

00:07:31.955 --> 00:07:36.125
this hydrogen proton and then become a hydronium molecule.

00:07:36.125 --> 00:07:39.165
So it took a hydrogen proton, it's giving it back,

00:07:39.165 --> 00:07:40.585
and so what we are left with--

00:07:41.285 --> 00:07:45.555
It took up this water molecule right over here

00:07:45.555 --> 00:07:46.905
to break the bond.

00:07:47.355 --> 00:07:49.455
And so this is a positive charge.

00:07:49.455 --> 00:07:50.985
It could be a passing hydronium molecule,

00:07:51.945 --> 00:07:54.635
and it'll just hand it off to that.

00:07:55.255 --> 00:07:56.155
And there you have it,

00:07:56.155 --> 00:08:00.585
we have two standalone glucose molecules right over there.

00:08:00.585 --> 00:08:01.725
We have broken the bond.

00:08:01.725 --> 00:08:03.255
And these could be parts of chains,

00:08:03.255 --> 00:08:05.025
in which case, we've just broken the chain.

00:08:05.455 --> 00:08:07.085
Or, if we're just dealing with maltose,

00:08:07.085 --> 00:08:08.315
now we've broken it down

00:08:08.315 --> 00:08:13.215
into the individual glucose molecules.

00:08:13.215 --> 00:08:14.285
And the example here is with glucose,

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:16.655
but it could've been the case with maltose,

00:08:16.655 --> 00:08:17.925
and it could've been the case with sucrose

00:08:17.925 --> 00:08:20.655
where we break sucrose down using hydrolysis

00:08:20.655 --> 00:08:23.038
into a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule.

00:08:23.038 --> 00:08:27.087
So it's a very important reaction in biology.
