00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:00.993
- [Instructor] Talk a little bit about

00:00:00.993 --> 00:00:03.677
biogeochemical cycles.

00:00:03.677 --> 00:00:07.445
And the term biogeochemical
sounds very fancy.

00:00:07.445 --> 00:00:10.302
But really these are
just cycles that involve

00:00:10.302 --> 00:00:13.605
different molecules that
are essential for life

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:16.317
and how they circulate
through and an ecosystem

00:00:16.317 --> 00:00:20.270
and really how they
circulate through the entire,

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.235
through an entire biosphere.

00:00:22.235 --> 00:00:24.975
And the molecules that we care about,

00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:27.569
and molecules that could
consist of one element

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:28.932
or multiple elements.

00:00:28.932 --> 00:00:30.401
They are things like

00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:32.059
well, water molecules.

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:33.521
H2O.

00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:36.902
Oxygen and hydrogen
make up a lot of living,

00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:40.240
a lot of living creatures,
a lot of biomass.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.347
And water is just an essential element

00:00:42.347 --> 00:00:44.844
that is involved in life as we know it.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:47.802
We're also gonna be talking about carbon.

00:00:47.802 --> 00:00:49.791
And carbon takes on may forms

00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:52.494
when we think about biogeochemical cycles.

00:00:52.494 --> 00:00:54.551
There's carbon dioxide in the air.

00:00:54.551 --> 00:00:57.653
There's a lot of carbon
in organic molecules

00:00:57.653 --> 00:01:01.111
that form up most of the
mass of life as we know it.

00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:04.288
And there is actors that maybe
don't get as much attention.

00:01:04.288 --> 00:01:06.831
There are things like nitrogen

00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:10.917
and of course, you have characters like,

00:01:10.917 --> 00:01:12.809
characters like phosphorus.

00:01:12.809 --> 00:01:15.290
And you might say, "Okay, I
get that most organic molecules

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.314
"are made up of a bunch
of carbons and hydrogens

00:01:17.314 --> 00:01:18.948
"and every now and then, oxygens.

00:01:18.948 --> 00:01:20.211
"But what about nitrogens?

00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:21.867
"And what about phosphorus?"

00:01:21.867 --> 00:01:25.700
And remember, your DNA,
deoxyribonucleic acid.

00:01:26.646 --> 00:01:28.888
We're talking about nitrogenous bases.

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:30.835
Your adenines and guanines
and all these things

00:01:30.835 --> 00:01:31.997
that we talk about in DNA,

00:01:31.997 --> 00:01:33.380
they involve nitrogen.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.000
And there's other biomolecules.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.118
Amino acids, proteins, amino
acids which make up proteins

00:01:38.118 --> 00:01:39.688
that involve nitrogen.

00:01:39.688 --> 00:01:42.271
Phosphorus, ATP.

00:01:43.165 --> 00:01:45.527
The adenosine triphosphate.

00:01:45.527 --> 00:01:46.501
It's essential.

00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:48.803
It's in that core biomolecule.

00:01:48.803 --> 00:01:51.801
It's also in the backbone of DNA.

00:01:51.801 --> 00:01:55.340
So these are all essential
elements for life.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.640
And the key thing is,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.807
is that they all get recycled
through biogeochemical cycles.

00:02:01.977 --> 00:02:04.329
So they are all recycled.

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.778
We talked about how an
ecosystem energy flows.

00:02:06.778 --> 00:02:09.326
It might start with
light energy from the sun

00:02:09.326 --> 00:02:12.052
and then over time as it's
transferred form one form

00:02:12.052 --> 00:02:14.417
to another as it flows
from one form to another,

00:02:14.417 --> 00:02:16.092
it gets dissipated as heat.

00:02:16.092 --> 00:02:19.065
But the matter, the
elements, the molecules here.

00:02:19.065 --> 00:02:20.712
This is recycled.

00:02:20.712 --> 00:02:22.936
It was a originally formed.

00:02:22.936 --> 00:02:26.615
I mean there's a few meteorites
that hit every now and then.

00:02:26.615 --> 00:02:27.673
But the most part,

00:02:27.673 --> 00:02:31.127
most of the matter around
us was here at the dawn of,

00:02:31.127 --> 00:02:33.123
when the earth was first formed.

00:02:33.123 --> 00:02:36.988
It was first created in the
inside due to fusion reactions

00:02:36.988 --> 00:02:40.985
of stars billions and billions
and billions of years ago.

00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:44.070
So all of life, everything
that we've seen so far

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.451
in the history of earth,

00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:46.477
for the most part,

00:02:46.477 --> 00:02:49.835
it's the same elements
and the same molecules

00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:53.717
that have been recycled over
and over and over again.

00:02:53.717 --> 00:02:56.322
And so when we think about
biogeochemical cycles,

00:02:56.322 --> 00:03:00.661
we will think about things like,
if we're talking about H20,

00:03:00.661 --> 00:03:03.494
we're gonna think about the water cycle.

00:03:03.494 --> 00:03:05.834
Water cycle.

00:03:05.834 --> 00:03:07.530
And we have a whole video on that

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.106
but in (stutters) the short version of it

00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:13.057
is you could have water actually stored

00:03:13.057 --> 00:03:14.851
in a multiple different ways.

00:03:14.851 --> 00:03:17.616
Some of it couldn't evaporate

00:03:17.616 --> 00:03:19.339
as water vapor.

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:22.913
Eventually it condenses
in the form of clouds

00:03:22.913 --> 00:03:25.214
and then it can rain back down

00:03:25.214 --> 00:03:28.221
and along the way, you could have animals

00:03:28.221 --> 00:03:31.207
that get access especially
to the fresh water

00:03:31.207 --> 00:03:35.057
and make that part of the
actual living organisms.

00:03:35.057 --> 00:03:36.758
You actually, I also have living organisms

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:38.756
that view the water as
part of their ecosystem

00:03:38.756 --> 00:03:41.304
but we go into some
depth in another video.

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:43.854
You'll also hear people talk about,

00:03:43.854 --> 00:03:45.055
if we're talking about carbon,

00:03:45.055 --> 00:03:46.995
the carbon cycle.

00:03:46.995 --> 00:03:49.121
The carbon cycle.

00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:51.344
And just as a very high level of overview

00:03:51.344 --> 00:03:52.531
of the carbon cycle.

00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:54.618
So let's say that's the ground.

00:03:54.618 --> 00:03:57.866
Let's say that this is
a plant right over here.

00:03:57.866 --> 00:04:00.973
Take primary producer and autotroph.

00:04:00.973 --> 00:04:03.273
We talk about that in our ecosystem video.

00:04:03.273 --> 00:04:04.418
So let me draw a leaf here.

00:04:04.418 --> 00:04:07.144
This is a plant that is growing.

00:04:07.144 --> 00:04:10.490
What it's doing while
it takes light energy,

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.678
so it gets light energy from the sun.

00:04:13.678 --> 00:04:15.879
So that's the light
energy right over there

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.519
and it uses that light
energy to fix carbon.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.720
The carbon that is making up this plant.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.903
It's just not emerging out of nowhere,

00:04:22.903 --> 00:04:24.052
it's being recycled.

00:04:24.052 --> 00:04:26.316
It's being recycled from carbon molecules

00:04:26.316 --> 00:04:27.558
that are in the air.

00:04:27.558 --> 00:04:29.703
So the carbon molecules in the air,

00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:32.510
they're going to be, or
the carbon in the air,

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.633
it's gonna be in molecular form in terms

00:04:34.633 --> 00:04:36.671
it's going to be carbon dioxide.

00:04:36.671 --> 00:04:39.390
So that over there is CO2.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.492
And so the plant uses that light energy

00:04:41.492 --> 00:04:44.209
and that gaseous, that CO2 gas,

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:47.185
and it's able to fix the
carbon to construct it.

00:04:47.185 --> 00:04:49.604
So it's looks like that
plant is just growing.

00:04:49.604 --> 00:04:51.897
It's not clear where all
that mass is coming from.

00:04:51.897 --> 00:04:54.596
But it literally is coming from the air.

00:04:54.596 --> 00:04:55.693
And it might be able to get,

00:04:55.693 --> 00:04:57.031
it might get a few of the nutrients.

00:04:57.031 --> 00:04:58.874
Especially things like nitrogen phosphorus

00:04:58.874 --> 00:05:01.486
from the ground and that's
where we could go into the whole

00:05:01.486 --> 00:05:03.861
nitrogen and phosphorus cycles.

00:05:03.861 --> 00:05:07.290
But then once these plants
fix all of this carbon,

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.513
some of it gets stored in the biomass,

00:05:09.513 --> 00:05:12.433
sometimes the plant dies
and then it gets buried

00:05:12.433 --> 00:05:13.719
and if there was enough pressure,

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:15.464
it can turn into a hydrocarbons.

00:05:15.464 --> 00:05:18.923
So a hydrocarbons, when you
fuel your car, it's a really

00:05:18.923 --> 00:05:21.615
it's really energy stored by dead plants

00:05:21.615 --> 00:05:25.572
a long long time ago that got
buried and put into that form

00:05:25.572 --> 00:05:27.381
but it was essentially
plants through photosynthesis

00:05:27.381 --> 00:05:29.667
that first stored that energy.

00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:31.460
But then of course, and
we've talked about this,

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.448
you can have animals
that eat those plants.

00:05:34.448 --> 00:05:36.250
So let me draw an animal
that is eating it.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.438
So that looks like an animal.

00:05:37.438 --> 00:05:38.313
Well that one looks like something

00:05:38.313 --> 00:05:40.084
that likes to eat more than just plants.

00:05:40.084 --> 00:05:41.041
So this is, you draw it like

00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:43.600
it's like an alligator
chicken looking thing.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.934
Well, that's close enough.

00:05:45.934 --> 00:05:47.252
Well you get the idea.

00:05:47.252 --> 00:05:49.990
When it eats that plant, it's
using some of that carbon

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.782
that was fixed originally by
that plant for it's own biomass

00:05:53.782 --> 00:05:58.441
but it'll also as it metabolizes
the some of it (stutters)

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:00.736
it will use that the bond,

00:06:00.736 --> 00:06:03.666
the energy stored in those chemical bonds,

00:06:03.666 --> 00:06:07.252
to live and grow and move about.

00:06:07.252 --> 00:06:08.856
And as it does that,

00:06:08.856 --> 00:06:12.321
it will exhale the CO2.

00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:15.681
So that the CO2 goes back
into the environment.

00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:17.986
Now this is a huge oversimplification
of the carbon cycle

00:06:17.986 --> 00:06:19.761
but this is the general idea.

00:06:19.761 --> 00:06:21.120
And eventually this thing might die

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.680
or might get eaten by other consumers.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.484
And then you have the
decomposers down here

00:06:27.484 --> 00:06:30.873
who could further make use
of those chemical bonds

00:06:30.873 --> 00:06:33.256
that the primary producer first created

00:06:33.256 --> 00:06:35.256
using that light energy.

00:06:36.217 --> 00:06:39.133
Decom, decomposers right over here.

00:06:39.133 --> 00:06:41.874
And they might also, as they consume that,

00:06:41.874 --> 00:06:45.713
release more CO2 which will
eventually then get fixed again

00:06:45.713 --> 00:06:47.797
by a primary producer.

00:06:47.797 --> 00:06:51.113
And there's similar cycles
for nitrogen and phosphorus.

00:06:51.113 --> 00:06:53.336
These often involving bacteria

00:06:53.336 --> 00:06:56.096
to fix the nitrogen and
the phosphorus from the air

00:06:56.096 --> 00:06:58.538
to make it available as
nutrients in the soil

00:06:58.538 --> 00:07:01.287
for some of the primary producers in say,

00:07:01.287 --> 00:07:02.568
the carbon cycle.

00:07:02.568 --> 00:07:04.587
And nitrogen doesn't
get a lot of attention,

00:07:04.587 --> 00:07:07.664
but this is actually the
most gas in our atmosphere.

00:07:07.664 --> 00:07:09.188
So it's all around you right now

00:07:09.188 --> 00:07:10.519
even while we're breathing,

00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:12.927
we are breathing a lot of nitrogen.

00:07:12.927 --> 00:07:17.134
Although it doesn't play as
strong of a role as say oxygen

00:07:17.134 --> 00:07:21.515
and the oxygen in the air is
going to be molecular oxygen.

00:07:21.515 --> 00:07:23.446
So I could also write O2 right over here.

00:07:23.446 --> 00:07:25.602
Or as we breathe out,

00:07:25.602 --> 00:07:27.011
carbon dioxide.

00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:29.319
So I could write C

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:31.651
CO2.

00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:34.549
CO2 right over there.

00:07:34.549 --> 00:07:36.113
But hopefully this gives you a sense

00:07:36.113 --> 00:07:38.131
of how matter is recycled.

00:07:38.131 --> 00:07:40.262
Energy is flowing through ecosystems

00:07:40.262 --> 00:07:41.859
including the largest ecosystems on earth

00:07:41.859 --> 00:07:43.365
which is earth is biosphere.

00:07:43.365 --> 00:07:46.058
You have matter being constantly recycled.

00:07:46.058 --> 00:07:48.719
And the cycle of that matter,

00:07:48.719 --> 00:07:51.165
we call biogeochemical cycles.

00:07:51.165 --> 00:07:53.869
I think I just said the word cycle a lot.
