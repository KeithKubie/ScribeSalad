00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:02.570
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.480
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05.481 --> 00:00:08.990
April 3rd, 2017 what's going on? how are you ?

4
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.860
how's it go? A little white guy. DEF Jam Voice.

5
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.990
Little White Guy. Jam Voice. I'd taken you back through a little comedy history.

6
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.250
Remember that the height of black guys do these white guys do that and was

7
00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:24.620
always [inaudible] to have, I'd have to have that fucking voice.

8
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.100
You ever see a white gas stated a chair or sit in a chair?

9
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.870
Oh, I'm a black guy. When he sits in the chase, it's in the mother fucker.

10
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.340
GM white guys did odd years. I set out, I actually, I did my taxes.

11
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.790
Every fucking joke crushed.

12
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.930
Fucking crushed. That was the black comic version of white guys.

13
00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:50.640
Go and talking about flying on airplanes, comparing dogs to cats.

14
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.660
That's more like it. You know, dogs. You Fran a cat. Huh? Don't even fucking,

15
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:58.200
you know, that's actually still not a complimentary voice for a white guy.

16
00:00:58.201 --> 00:01:00.480
But I don't think that was a complimentary voice for a black guy.

17
00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:03.990
So I think I'm in the clear when it comes to political correctness.

18
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.750
Um, oh my God, what a fucking weekend I had, man. I had a great time.

19
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.520
You know, I had a great time.

20
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:14.940
I watched the fucking Bruins pick up four points this weekend. All right.

21
00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:19.941
And put themselves back into the driver's seat at least of their own destiny.

22
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.490
All right. By Beaton, the Florida fucking path.

23
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.630
And thank God the Chicago Blackhawks had the decency to rest.

24
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.680
Most of the good guys in their team. A, we will pick up another two points.

25
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:39.150
So thank you to the city of Chicago. I'm next deep dish is on me.

26
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:41.820
If I run into you, not the whole fucking city. Just one of you.

27
00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:46.320
Fatties what are you most stash? Yoed fatties from that SNL sketch.

28
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.090
I don't think I've ever seen a guy with a mustache in Chicago, you know? Um,

29
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.230
anyways, I never heard one say dap bears. Never heard that,

30
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.890
never heard it. Um, although I don't talk to a lot of them,

31
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.250
I just kinda go there and stand in front of their performing and then I leave.

32
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.690
That's basically what I do, which is one of my favorite things to fucking do.

33
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.440
By the way, there's nothing,

34
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.730
there's nothing better than when you do your show this second to do it.

35
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.400
You get in a car and you get the fuck outta there.

36
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.670
That's my favorite thing to do, you know,

37
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.040
either that or go to a dive bar and hang out like with three people.

38
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.290
That's the way I'm fucking wired. Um,

39
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.390
that's perfect. Be honest with you.

40
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.400
There's certain people they like to hang out, you know what I mean?

41
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.050
Go Wade into the crowd, you know, continue,

42
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.040
continue to say how awesome I am. I don't do that. I got it for that hour.

43
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.250
Perfect. Then you get in the car and it's nice and quiet. It's quiet.

44
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.810
It just fucking ride home, you know, and you go into your fucking hotel room,

45
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.390
Mike, sit down. You'll avoid the fucking snack buy. Right.

46
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.490
And uh, and then that's it.

47
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.390
You just sit there and the loneliness of your room.

48
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:01.543
<v 1>Okay.</v>

49
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.070
<v 0>That's most reason why I drink on the road, to be honest with you.</v>

50
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.750
That's all you're doing is you just trying to stay out. As long as you can see,

51
00:03:08.751 --> 00:03:11.390
you're so fucking tired that when you get back to your room,

52
00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:15.320
you just immediately fall asleep rather than dealing with the fucking loneliness

53
00:03:15.321 --> 00:03:20.000
of it. But, um, I dunno, I had such a great weekend man.

54
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.470
I played a little bit of drums, hung out with my beautiful daughter.

55
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.490
You know, she's a riot. She bossy as hell.

56
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.650
Oh my God.

57
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.160
She's already telling us what to do with just like the noises that she knows how

58
00:03:34.161 --> 00:03:36.950
to make. Um, yeah,

59
00:03:36.951 --> 00:03:40.430
she's going to be a little smarty just like my wife and she's fucking adorable

60
00:03:40.431 --> 00:03:44.240
as hell. Obviously. You know, I'm a little bias, but a, that's kind of,

61
00:03:44.241 --> 00:03:46.490
you know, you know when people are lying, you know,

62
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.540
if you kid oh hey wa what acuity?

63
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.173
<v 1>Yes.</v>

64
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.290
<v 0>I feel like we're getting like legit compliments. So anyways,</v>

65
00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.770
can anybody out there in the hockey world explained to me

66
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.510
like, uh, how this, like what seed you are,

67
00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:09.350
works in the playoff bracket. Like,

68
00:04:09.351 --> 00:04:10.890
I don't get it cause um,

69
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.840
it used to be like the Adams Division in the Patrick Division in one played for,

70
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.600
and then they sort of jumbled them all up.

71
00:04:17.601 --> 00:04:22.490
It seems like when they list them as far as like I don't get when you go to the

72
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.030
stand extinct because I would have thought is as a sixth or seventh c whatever

73
00:04:26.031 --> 00:04:30.650
the fuck we're going to be, we'd either play the capitals or the blue jackets,

74
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.660
you know, the top of that one.

75
00:04:32.661 --> 00:04:35.240
But they kind of doing like a march madness thing where it's like we're in like

76
00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:35.901
a different thing.

77
00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:40.550
So for some reason we'd get off easy or I should say and have to play the maple

78
00:04:40.551 --> 00:04:42.260
leafs rather than getting the old right there.

79
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.120
Fred from the capitols of the blue jacket,

80
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.890
not saying that we're going to beat Toronto,

81
00:04:45.891 --> 00:04:47.090
I have no idea what's going to happen.

82
00:04:47.091 --> 00:04:50.530
But according to the Stanley Cup playoffs here on,

83
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.800
on a nhl.com, um, as of today,

84
00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.513
the Mario Canadians with Clode,

85
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.550
Julia Julian would play fucking the New York Rangers.

86
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.480
So they're a number one seed and then they would get the wild card,

87
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.340
New York Rangers,

88
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.750
and then the Bruins would play the maple leafs little original six action they

89
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.640
have for you on those. Both of those, Huh.

90
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.490
Then the capitals would play Ottawa and Pittsburgh plays Columbus,

91
00:05:22.491 --> 00:05:23.930
like Pittsburgh gets punished.

92
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.650
Shouldn't they be playing an easier fucking team with the points they have?

93
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.510
I would think what? I'm the bottom faders, so that's great. I love that.

94
00:05:32.511 --> 00:05:35.420
Pittsburgh or the Columbus, we'll knock each other out.

95
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.080
We'll knock one or the other route I should say. And A, I don't know.

96
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.200
I don't know what's going to cause are the capital's finally going to push

97
00:05:42.201 --> 00:05:45.230
through the shift? Is it finally gonna Happen? You know, you know,

98
00:05:45.231 --> 00:05:48.840
it'd be the fucking Armageddon finals would be the Washington capitols versus

99
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.040
San Jose Sharks, you know, can,

100
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.180
one of them has to win, right? Like the cubs verse, the Indians,

101
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.110
somebodies a fucking win. And I bet it would go down the exact same way.

102
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:02.540
One would go up three to one. You know,

103
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.650
they just got to add that last bit of misery and then someone would come back

104
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:08.840
and win it. I Dunno. I Dunno what the fuck I'm talking about.

105
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:10.430
All I know is I really enjoyed, um,

106
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.070
obviously this weekend and if we can play the Tampa Bay lightning on Tuesday and

107
00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:20.090
fucking put them out of their goddamn misery, um,

108
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.170
I think we would avoid three years in a row of, uh, you know,

109
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.320
eaten a dick at the end of March at the beginning of April.

110
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.950
We've done it two years in a row. So, uh, that's it.

111
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:33.170
That's it for the fucking hockey talk. Oh, by the way,

112
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.960
I don't know what his name is, but that kid on Calgary, uh,

113
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.330
I keep to chuck his kid out there. That kid's a fucking riot, man.

114
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.230
He is an old school hockey player. I was watching a,

115
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.520
what did they have there with the fucking, uh,

116
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.130
Don Cherry hockey night in Canada. We actually get that down here.

117
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.700
And he was showing a highlight of that kid, you know,

118
00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.110
picking on that dude from the fucking kinks at Don Cherry's break at his fucking

119
00:07:00.111 --> 00:07:03.260
balls. And it's just like they trying to make the playoffs.

120
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.360
He's not going to get involved with some stupid fucking fight. Right. They,

121
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.080
they true dowdy and he, they need them on the ice, I would think anyways,

122
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.610
to daddy, the Dave Grohl of fucking, uh,

123
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.820
of hockey to me that the,

124
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.590
the exact same fucking person when Dave girls not making amazing music,

125
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.980
he's playing defense for the Los Angeles kings. I challenge you,

126
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.870
I challenge you to find Dave girl ever at a fucking game where, where,

127
00:07:29.871 --> 00:07:34.280
where drew dowdy is not as a healthy scratch. Um, all right,

128
00:07:34.281 --> 00:07:35.840
enough of that bullshit. Um,

129
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.200
I can't even tell to you about my fucking weekend some of this other bullshit.

130
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.210
Oh my God. Hello. If I hang out with just like a complete fucking psychopath,

131
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:50.750
ugh, just one of those social events you like. Oh No,

132
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.380
there he is. There he is. Um,

133
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.440
and then it's over and then it's the next day and like, oh great. You know,

134
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.850
God willing, I'll never have to see that person again.

135
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.550
Hey, how the fuck are the Celtics said number one seat.

136
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:10.610
I didn't watch in the last two weeks. I kinda got, you know, you know,

137
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.180
foot fucking hockey and basketball. You kinda got like pick a sport. You know,

138
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.960
I've been, you know, I've been trying to watch both of them, but um, the,

139
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.540
the Bruins were just in a more, uh, you know, I dunno.

140
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.130
Precarious position. So it was more of a exciting thing to watch.

141
00:08:28.131 --> 00:08:29.210
Are they gonna fuck this up?

142
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.190
Are they going to somehow pull themselves out of it? And uh,

143
00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.020
some other Celtics or a number one seed,

144
00:08:34.021 --> 00:08:36.950
although I don't think there are a better team than the Cavaliers, but a,

145
00:08:36.951 --> 00:08:41.240
I like what Lebron did the other night last night when he got into it on the

146
00:08:41.241 --> 00:08:44.210
court and that made that other dude on his own team flipping out,

147
00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:45.230
yelling at him and shit.

148
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.200
He immediately tried to diffuse it and then was just saying, yeah,

149
00:08:48.201 --> 00:08:50.660
I showed him up. I shouldn't have said that. Blah, blah, blah, blah.

150
00:08:50.661 --> 00:08:54.530
And I was like, that's a fucking right there.

151
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.320
Even though a of people don't like them. I fucking like Lebron. Um,

152
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.470
so anyways, dude, I've just been having like,

153
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:02.780
<v 1>okay,</v>

154
00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.150
<v 0>I know I got to get back into fucking meditating. I don't know,</v>

155
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:09.460
I've just keep running into these situations. Like I feel like I'm,

156
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.180
I'm attracting the, to me, like somebody,

157
00:09:11.181 --> 00:09:16.181
this New York number has been calling me for like the last fucking three days,

158
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.330
and then I'm like, I don't know who this number is so I don't answer.

159
00:09:19.331 --> 00:09:23.080
And then they finally leave a message to say, Yay, it's just show and show.

160
00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:27.670
You know, I'm looking for show and show, but it keeps saying, ah, you know,

161
00:09:27.671 --> 00:09:31.630
this is bill. Uh, all the time, the thing, but my phone is saying, you know,

162
00:09:31.631 --> 00:09:36.560
it's my daughter. So I'm like,

163
00:09:36.561 --> 00:09:38.870
all right, well this guy is going gonna figure this shit out. Right.

164
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.320
And he does it. So he filed right before he did the podcast,

165
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:46.580
he fucking calls against. So I finally picked up, I go, hello? The guy's like,

166
00:09:46.581 --> 00:09:49.460
yeah, we'll always just sit. I'm talking to, I'm like, well,

167
00:09:49.461 --> 00:09:52.550
it's not who you'd think it is. Yeah, you got the wrong number. And he goes,

168
00:09:52.551 --> 00:09:57.350
yeah, well fuck you too. He hangs up on me like, like it was my fault.

169
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.910
So I just laugh and I'm just like, what the fuck?

170
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.590
Why does this shit keep happening to me? So then he calls back and I'm like,

171
00:10:06.591 --> 00:10:10.130
well, I got to hear what this guy's going to say next, right.

172
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.640
I need a new hour of material. I got to put myself in the line of fire here.

173
00:10:13.641 --> 00:10:17.240
So I picked up, it goes, Yay man. I'm sorry man. I just,

174
00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:20.450
I lost my phone and I keep trying to call my daughter and you know,

175
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.450
my name's bill and it keeps saying, your name's bill and it's,

176
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:28.430
you gotta see the humor in that, right? I'm like, yeah man. It's, it's a, yeah,

177
00:10:28.431 --> 00:10:33.290
it's a funny situation. Good luck to you with your phone. I don't know.

178
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.470
I don't know what to tell you. Sounded like a nice enough person.

179
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.650
I love that he said, yeah, well fuck you too.

180
00:10:39.651 --> 00:10:42.800
When he still had the fucking nerve to call me back and then just say,

181
00:10:42.801 --> 00:10:44.930
act like it didn't even, he didn't say that.

182
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.070
Maybe it was just joking when he said it. I was just like, I don't fucking know.

183
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.520
So anyways, this past week, so I'm at a social event,

184
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.060
I'm trying to avoid this psycho audience.

185
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:58.940
I'm sitting right next to me and I'm talking to this guy and for fucking 10

186
00:10:58.941 --> 00:11:01.100
minutes, all of a sudden I can't find my cell phone

187
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.770
and I'm looking for it and I'm looking forward and I'm not bringing it up to

188
00:11:05.771 --> 00:11:08.200
anybody cause I'm thinking like maybe I left it in the car. I Dunno what,

189
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:13.590
and I realized that this psycho has placed his cell phone exactly right on top

190
00:11:14.321 --> 00:11:16.930
of mine, on the table,

191
00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.270
like completely lined up in mine,

192
00:11:20.271 --> 00:11:23.080
has a black case and was kind of dark so I couldn't see it.

193
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:28.340
And then I had to sit there playing this fucking mind game. Like,

194
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:32.660
did this guy do this on purpose? Am I over analyzing this thing?

195
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:37.070
Am I out of my fucking mind? And, uh, I dunno, did it,

196
00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:38.960
the whole thing just struck me as funny

197
00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:42.400
thinking of how my life used to be.

198
00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:46.390
Cause I used to have people like that in my fucking life. You know,

199
00:11:46.391 --> 00:11:50.830
those people that mind fuck you. And then like an hour later, hey, I'm sorry,

200
00:11:50.831 --> 00:11:55.330
I was like that, that fucking beater relationship, you got to get into him.

201
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.420
Ah, yeah.

202
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.390
Which is course how then the evening ends with that bullshit. Oh yeah, let me,

203
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.330
yeah, no. Hey, it's all right. Everything's cool.

204
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:08.920
And I just walked out of there and just felt like this fucking weight lift off

205
00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:11.500
me. Just be like, I'm never going to see that person again.

206
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.520
I have no fucking desire. That is it.

207
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.590
That is a fucking Rep.

208
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:25.670
If I've learned anything from hanging out with fucking, uh,

209
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:26.801
a cop,

210
00:12:26.801 --> 00:12:31.420
I have two good friends of mine that have both half Sicilian and um,

211
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.300
when applied correctly, the Sicilian,

212
00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:39.280
you're dead to me when applied correctly is the greatest fucking,

213
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.380
it just streamlines your life.

214
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.020
Why would you waste another second of your life playing that mental tennis?

215
00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:49.081
What's that like?

216
00:12:49.081 --> 00:12:54.081
You obviously don't connect with this person over and you just walk away and

217
00:12:54.361 --> 00:12:56.400
then that's it. And like today I just woke up,

218
00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:59.670
I was in the greatest fucking mood knowing I'm never going to see that person

219
00:12:59.671 --> 00:13:01.650
again. It's fucking tremendous.

220
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.800
And you know what I think then I created a void.

221
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.120
I created a vacuum in my life because I just let go all of that shit.

222
00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.830
And now I got this random guy calling me up on my cell phone looking for his

223
00:13:13.831 --> 00:13:18.270
daughter and then telling me to go fuck myself, you know, I'll take that.

224
00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.140
I mean, that's an easy one.

225
00:13:19.141 --> 00:13:23.130
That guy actually sounded like a better fucking person. So anyways, Oh,

226
00:13:23.131 --> 00:13:25.750
you know what? Easter's coming up fucking east.

227
00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:30.440
It comes Peter cottontail hop it dad,

228
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:35.310
buddy Trey [inaudible] Easter's on its way. Um,

229
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.540
I, uh, I get this week we're going to actually,

230
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:43.950
at some point we're going to go back to the mall of become a fucking mall

231
00:13:43.951 --> 00:13:47.760
person. I'm, I imagine eventually it's going to a,

232
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:50.010
it's going to drive me nuts, but, um,

233
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:53.040
we're going there and we're taking our daughter over it to get a picture with

234
00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:54.840
the Easter bunny. How fucking cute is that?

235
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.370
It's going to be absolutely adorable. I can't wait to do it,

236
00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.510
so we just have to calve out some time.

237
00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:03.253
<v 2>Um,</v>

238
00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:06.460
<v 0>yeah, I'm already nervous that she's going to get totally fucking freaked out.</v>

239
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:07.503
You know what I mean?

240
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:08.830
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

241
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:12.360
<v 0>The older you get, the more you look at that. You just realize why.</v>

242
00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:17.790
What is that bizarre ritual, you know? Why would you do that to you? Sorry,

243
00:14:17.791 --> 00:14:21.840
my stomach is grumbling. Yeah. I'm fucking on a massive diet here. Massive diet,

244
00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.170
massive diet, cutting out the booze. Except the last night

245
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.870
cutting out the booze, uh, been eaten basically perfectly.

246
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.380
And uh, I'm actually down to a buck 79.

247
00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:39.420
I fight weights between like one 68, one 72. And uh,

248
00:14:39.421 --> 00:14:41.610
I'm going to try and lose two to three pounds for them. You know,

249
00:14:41.611 --> 00:14:45.410
I figured some by mid May, mid May, I ought to be in fight,

250
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.900
in shape and I'm going to try to actually stay in that and continue cause what,

251
00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:49.081
you know,

252
00:14:49.081 --> 00:14:52.940
what I do is I get down to the way they wanted to get down to and then that's

253
00:14:52.941 --> 00:14:57.480
like the end of the movie roll credits and I go back to eat fucking pizza,

254
00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.530
beer and all of that shit. And then I slowly get back up again.

255
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:01.461
And next thing you know,

256
00:15:01.461 --> 00:15:06.110
I'm standing shirtless in a mirror just calling myself every horrible name.

257
00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.110
The that I can think of, you know,

258
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:14.240
tub of fuck something I've never even heard anybody say.

259
00:15:14.241 --> 00:15:16.700
I actually called myself that before I started this diet.

260
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.610
I actually have suits that I can't fit into anymore.

261
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.500
Like I've hit that point in my life and uh,

262
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:26.630
it's just like I can't, I can't, uh,

263
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:31.700
I can't be the guy that goes to the fucking dry cleaner to have his suits let

264
00:15:31.701 --> 00:15:36.560
out. You go to the tailor and you just basically saying, listen, the food one,

265
00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:41.300
I quit. I quit. I don't want to fucking do this anymore.

266
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:46.130
So, um, anyways, I did, uh,

267
00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.400
I'd just been doing, I just been doing cardio.

268
00:15:49.401 --> 00:15:52.250
My fucking shoulder's getting better. I can't really lift weights or anything,

269
00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:56.720
so I've just been kinda just stretching, doing cardio in, in, in, uh,

270
00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.280
in trying to eat right. I try to eat like from nine to five and then just stop.

271
00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.270
Uh, but the other night I was doing that, uh, April foolishness for, uh,

272
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.970
Kevin and being who I want to thank for having me on that.

273
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:12.980
We did it down at the, uh, the shrine auditorium, um, which is a famous,

274
00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:18.050
um, theater out here. What the fuck's going on?

275
00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.900
And they bring it came and think here. I actually went on Wikipedia.

276
00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.000
That's what happens. I was trying to look at some of this other shit.

277
00:16:23.001 --> 00:16:24.290
Some of this advertising I have to read.

278
00:16:24.291 --> 00:16:26.630
I literally get like anxiety as I look at it. Like, Oh God,

279
00:16:26.631 --> 00:16:27.950
look how long this fucking copy is.

280
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.520
Don't want to read all that as I'm trying to talk to you guys. My apologies.

281
00:16:31.521 --> 00:16:32.510
I was distracted there.

282
00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:36.440
So I played the shrine auditorium for Kevin and being show, uh,

283
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.380
April foolishness every year that raises money for, um,

284
00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.050
I think it's premature babies. I believe that's what it is.

285
00:16:42.051 --> 00:16:44.930
I never know what it is. I always ask right before I go on,

286
00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:50.260
what is this cause for so I can steer clear of going out there like that

287
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.880
show you just let it die or something, you know, just not walking into that.

288
00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:00.590
So we were at the shrine auditorium and I looked, went up on Wikipedia, went up,

289
00:17:00.591 --> 00:17:02.030
I went to it on, uh,

290
00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:07.160
on the Internet there and I found out, uh, that that is the place,

291
00:17:07.161 --> 00:17:09.920
the most legendary thing that I saw that happened at that place.

292
00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.340
Aside from like the grateful dead and all these guys doing shows was that was

293
00:17:13.341 --> 00:17:17.400
the place where Michael Jackson's shot the Pepsi commercial and Ed,

294
00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:21.470
his hair lit on fire, his Jerry Curl, you know,

295
00:17:21.471 --> 00:17:22.760
when he was slowly at the beginning.

296
00:17:22.761 --> 00:17:27.110
Was it the beginnings of transforming into a white guy? Um, you know,

297
00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:31.490
I dunno if it was the product he had, if it was a Jerry curl, if it was a conch,

298
00:17:31.491 --> 00:17:33.110
I don't know what he had going on. Okay.

299
00:17:33.111 --> 00:17:37.640
I don't know how that mixes with Pepsi and Flammable Shit,

300
00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:41.330
but all I know is his head lit on fire and um,

301
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.750
he got second degree burns. That was it.

302
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:48.980
And all these fucking people were like crying. They would terrify,

303
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.940
you know that these tremendous artists, his head caught on fire,

304
00:17:53.941 --> 00:17:57.960
his fucking head caught on fire doing a Pepsi commercial.

305
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.440
There was another groundbreaking thing that he did like,

306
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.720
because back in the day, if you were a,

307
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:07.770
any sort of a famous person and if you did a commercial,

308
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:12.750
you would just consider it a complete sellout. Um, at least in the white world.

309
00:18:12.751 --> 00:18:15.390
I don't know how it worked or he kind of was a hybrid though, right?

310
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:19.290
He treats sort of the first Caitlyn Jenner, but he didn't like in a race way,

311
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.153
you know,

312
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.010
like the way he walked out the door and due to Quebec, a woman,

313
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.840
he walked out the door, a black guy, it came back, a white guy. Um,

314
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:33.151
I mean,

315
00:18:33.151 --> 00:18:35.910
I can't imagine being friends with that guy every time he would leave and he'd

316
00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:40.110
just come back. He was like a shopaholic, but like for his face,

317
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.410
you know what I mean? You know, he's chicks always come about. Well,

318
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:46.830
it's coming back when I got a new bag, you know what I mean? Or some fucking,

319
00:18:46.831 --> 00:18:50.280
I dunno what shoes is. Some shit. He would do the same thing, but with his face,

320
00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:53.580
uh, yeah, Bell, he was one of the most famous people ever. We know what he did.

321
00:18:53.581 --> 00:18:57.970
Okay. Anyways, plowing ahead. Um, so I'm,

322
00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:02.310
I get to do that show down at the shrine auditorium and I cannot even begin to

323
00:19:02.311 --> 00:19:06.750
tell you what a fucking great time. I had unbelievable crowd.

324
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:11.370
Like I had to do a half hour at the end of all these other monsters going out

325
00:19:11.371 --> 00:19:14.550
there, fucking killing it the entire night.

326
00:19:14.551 --> 00:19:18.810
And Steve O did a hilarious fucking stunt, fucking hilarious.

327
00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:19.951
And uh,

328
00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:23.490
I got to go on like at the end of all this shit and do a half hour and it was

329
00:19:23.491 --> 00:19:26.610
fucking effortless. That's how great the crowd was.

330
00:19:26.611 --> 00:19:30.840
So I wanna thank everybody who came out for that wonderful cause that I believe

331
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:35.430
was for a premature kids.

332
00:19:35.431 --> 00:19:37.380
You guys liked the birds chirping in the background.

333
00:19:37.381 --> 00:19:38.940
Somebody mentioned to me that's fucking hilarious.

334
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:43.730
Listened to me going off on shit with birds chirping. I usually don't do, uh,

335
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:47.070
um, do my fucking podcasts in this room.

336
00:19:47.071 --> 00:19:50.040
I just do it cause it's the furthest one away from my daughter's sleeping.

337
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:53.340
You know, I don't want to hear me dropping all the f-bombs. So anyways,

338
00:19:53.341 --> 00:19:57.540
the end of the show comes right and everybody's shaking hands.

339
00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:00.810
Oh you are great now. You are great. No, I like how your mind works now.

340
00:20:00.811 --> 00:20:03.090
I like how your mind works better. You know,

341
00:20:03.091 --> 00:20:08.070
we're all doing the Hollywood thing, right? Everybody had a good set. And uh,

342
00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:12.930
once again, I ran into one of these crazy fucking parents,

343
00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:18.660
right? This is fucking hilarious. This is what this person did. They said, oh,

344
00:20:18.661 --> 00:20:21.390
congratulations on your daughter. I said, ah, you brought it up.

345
00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.360
You brought it up. Now I've got to show you a picture. Right?

346
00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:29.430
So her and her husband is standing there, right? The young young people,

347
00:20:29.431 --> 00:20:33.240
right. They look like they're single. They don't even look like they have kids.

348
00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:38.220
And I just show them the picture and she just goes, uh, yeah.

349
00:20:38.221 --> 00:20:42.060
It's so easy. He see, it's so easy. It's so easy.

350
00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.190
She started pointing my kid going, it's so easy. I'm like,

351
00:20:44.191 --> 00:20:48.850
what the fuck is she talking about? I've heard adorable. She's cute. Oh my God.

352
00:20:48.851 --> 00:20:53.440
Look at those cheeks. She's got a, yeah. So it's so easy. Yeah, I see.

353
00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.380
You see? It's so easy. I'm like, what do you mean it's so easy? She goes,

354
00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:01.120
she goes, we have three, we have three. It's so hard. You have no idea.

355
00:21:01.121 --> 00:21:02.230
It's so and just,

356
00:21:02.231 --> 00:21:07.231
she used my daughter's picture as a way to launch into how fucking difficult her

357
00:21:07.781 --> 00:21:12.160
life was. First of all, it's like, how fucking difficult is your life?

358
00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.140
[inaudible] you look like you've been P90x me.

359
00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:18.730
You guys don't have an ounce of fat on you. You don't have bags under your eyes.

360
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.800
It's Saturday night. You're out at a show me the one of you yawning.

361
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:25.300
And they were going, yeah,

362
00:21:25.301 --> 00:21:29.320
we had one and then and then we got pregnant again and then we had, we had,

363
00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.530
and I was going like, oh, and I'm sitting there trying to be empathetic.

364
00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.120
Oh yeah. You know, I hear a,

365
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.660
I hear too is like a game changer and then three, it's like you're out numbered.

366
00:21:38.661 --> 00:21:43.480
She goes, oh no. We went from one right to three like we had, we had,

367
00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:47.100
we had twins next to two kids. Oh,

368
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.940
I don't even know what that feels like. We don't even know what that feels like.

369
00:21:51.941 --> 00:21:53.830
It's just like, you know what? You don't know what?

370
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.890
You don't know what it's like to be in a fucking log cabin with no fucking heat.

371
00:21:56.891 --> 00:22:00.370
Like they had 200 years ago. It's fucking hard to the fuck outta here.

372
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.090
I swear to God like I and people like that. It's just,

373
00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:06.100
I just feel bad for their kids. It's like you have to be,

374
00:22:06.101 --> 00:22:10.210
you gotta be a fucking terrible parent. What kind of person has a kid? Right.

375
00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:15.400
And all I do when I see other people's kids is I just think of how much that

376
00:22:15.401 --> 00:22:16.930
person must love that kid.

377
00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.240
They have to feel the same way that I do about my kid.

378
00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.410
And then I'm happy for them.

379
00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:24.520
Who the fuck looks at somebody else's kid and just and compares like, Oh,

380
00:22:24.521 --> 00:22:27.520
it's so, it's so easy. Yeah. See Etsy

381
00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:31.450
and then I go, yeah, you know what?

382
00:22:31.451 --> 00:22:36.060
We're thinking of having another one and then, then the guy goes, yeah,

383
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:40.950
just have one gone out to war. First of all, like you can control it. Oh,

384
00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:43.780
they drive me up the fucking wall. I fucking, I'm going to say it.

385
00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:48.190
I fucking hate parents. Generally speaking, I cannot stand them. They like,

386
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:51.850
they're like fucking martyrs. They like these fuckers. He's like,

387
00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:55.900
you put yourself in this situation. Shut the fuck up.

388
00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.900
You have three people that are going to be sad when you die.

389
00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.950
They're actually going to give a shit and they're going to show up and say how

390
00:23:02.951 --> 00:23:07.300
great you are at where it isn't that enough. It's so hard.

391
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:11.800
You have no really with iPads in fucking 200 channels of cable,

392
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:16.350
you can put them in front of a fucking plasma TV. It's like looking into a, a,

393
00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:22.090
a tropical fish tank all day for them. You know they're soft.

394
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:27.190
You know what I mean? I don't know. I just, Oh God,

395
00:23:27.191 --> 00:23:29.980
there's so many times in my life like I wish I could just go back like that.

396
00:23:29.981 --> 00:23:32.860
I'm doing you believe it or not. I'm great in the moment on stage.

397
00:23:32.861 --> 00:23:36.760
I'm so bad at it when I'm off stage. You know what I mean? I'm just, you know,

398
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.520
cause I immediately just get to this anger level and then I ended up looking

399
00:23:39.521 --> 00:23:42.430
like a psycho. Like I wish I just said that to him.

400
00:23:42.431 --> 00:23:44.440
Like you guys sound like terrible parents.

401
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:47.090
Do you want to put your kids up for adoption?

402
00:23:47.091 --> 00:23:50.210
So maybe you can go back to doing blow or whatever the fuck it is that you miss.

403
00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:56.953
Do you go back in?

404
00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.930
Wish I could go back to last night and just tap that guy on his shoulder and

405
00:23:59.931 --> 00:24:02.520
just pointed his cell phone on top of mine and just be like, yeah,

406
00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:05.480
on a psychological level, would you like to explain this to me?

407
00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:09.950
How did this happen? Was this by accident? But I don't,

408
00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:11.150
I don't fucking say anything.

409
00:24:11.151 --> 00:24:14.660
And then I just fucking write people off and then they look at me like I'm out

410
00:24:14.661 --> 00:24:16.820
of my mind, which I am. I'm definitely out of my mind,

411
00:24:16.821 --> 00:24:21.200
but I'll tell you right now, I'm not the only one. I am not the only one.

412
00:24:21.201 --> 00:24:25.970
And I've learned that. I learned that this weekend. Oh,

413
00:24:25.971 --> 00:24:29.210
so you see it's so easy. It's so, it's like,

414
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.310
why would you say you don't have any fucking idea?

415
00:24:31.311 --> 00:24:33.710
Imagine if I had a special needs kid. Then you've pointed at Saint,

416
00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.890
it's so easy. What the fuck is wrong with you? Oh, that's right.

417
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.510
You're completely self involved. Ah, ah.

418
00:24:41.511 --> 00:24:43.250
It felt good to get this out. Oh Jesus.

419
00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:47.450
I'm glad I didn't say I'm glad I saved the for the podcast,

420
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.380
but wouldn't the podcast be better if I actually started saying these things to

421
00:24:51.381 --> 00:24:53.870
people? So then I would have the confrontations and I could just,

422
00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.650
maybe I could then do a two hour podcast. Hey, who knows?

423
00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:02.240
Who knows? So, you know, I, as I mentioned earlier,

424
00:25:02.241 --> 00:25:04.370
I are the last podcast I got, um,

425
00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.130
I finally got Sirius Satellite Radio on my car,

426
00:25:07.131 --> 00:25:11.240
so I'm fucking listening to the 80s channel, the 70s channel NHL.

427
00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:16.190
You know, I listen to opie show, Jim Norton's fucking show.

428
00:25:16.191 --> 00:25:19.160
And I finally listened to Howard Stern for the first time and fucking forever.

429
00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:20.683
And um,

430
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:23.600
he had Craig Ferguson on and Craig Ferguson was going on and on about the

431
00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.890
Chappelle fucking special. I gotta check it out. He was going on and on.

432
00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.250
It might be that greatest one I've ever seen. I'm like, well, fuck,

433
00:25:31.251 --> 00:25:34.970
I gotta check that out. I gotta fucking check that one out.

434
00:25:34.971 --> 00:25:37.910
But half of me does not want to watch it cause I know it's going to be,

435
00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.050
I don't want to feel like, oh my God, uh,

436
00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.710
certain people you watch to get inspired, I can't want you to shit.

437
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:47.150
Cause it'd be like, Oh God, I suck.

438
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:52.900
Really the gap is still that large, you know,

439
00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.200
I don't know. Every once you know,

440
00:25:54.201 --> 00:25:56.160
every once in a while you think you're fucking Hendrickson,

441
00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:59.780
then you realize you just playing a Ukulele. Right. Isn't that what happens?

442
00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:04.110
Isn't that what life is? Anyways? Let me, uh,

443
00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:07.520
let me read a little bit of the advertising here. Uh,

444
00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:12.510
it's unbelievable. It's the greatest special I've ever seen.

445
00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.290
I was just like Jesus Christ. Alright. Proflowers everybody. Um,

446
00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:22.010
have you ever forgotten your anniversary? Uh, yeah.

447
00:26:22.011 --> 00:26:26.390
To be honest with you right now I would, if you asked me, I would be,

448
00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:28.880
I'm 80% sure of my anniversary date,

449
00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:33.620
but fortunately I'm married a person who also, we don't, we can never,

450
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:38.420
uh, we don't really remember the day that we met.

451
00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:43.350
We don't have a day for that. And we, like this year we were like,

452
00:26:43.351 --> 00:26:48.250
what's, what's our wedding date again? See 11th Right? No,

453
00:26:48.251 --> 00:26:51.830
12th no. 11th 11. 11th. Yeah, it's 11.

454
00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:00.250
Um, but if, I don't know if you married some, I don't know, accountants.

455
00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:03.340
If you married an insecure accountant, they know what the date is. Right.

456
00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:07.810
Have you ever gotten your anniversary? If you're nodding yes, you're lying.

457
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.920
Well, how do you figure that,

458
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:14.490
you know those people that are just hard to shop for?

459
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:15.980
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

460
00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:18.560
<v 0>Wait, what the fuck state, if you, have you ever forgotten your anniversary?</v>

461
00:27:18.561 --> 00:27:23.200
If you're nodding yes, you're lying. Well, I wasn't nodding, but I have,

462
00:27:23.201 --> 00:27:27.160
I've actually booked myself on my anniversary weekend because I forgot.

463
00:27:27.161 --> 00:27:29.500
I just don't think that, I just think, oh,

464
00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:34.530
every other week I go on the road and if it lands on that week,

465
00:27:35.111 --> 00:27:36.760
then I wasn't out and it just, you know,

466
00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:38.533
<v 4>okay.</v>

467
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.150
<v 0>I don't know. Evidently pro flowers, I don't know Jesus.</v>

468
00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:43.200
Are they fucking psychos?

469
00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:45.960
Are they going to put this cell phone on top of my cell phone anyway?

470
00:27:45.961 --> 00:27:49.740
She know those people that are just hard to shop for like your wife or your

471
00:27:49.741 --> 00:27:54.540
anniversary or your sister for her birthday. It's just the worst. Trying to fit.

472
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.660

they'll like and be won't cost an arm and a leg.

474

475
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:07.890
They want something that they gonna like and they also want something that's

476
00:28:07.891 --> 00:28:12.030
going to cost an arm and a leg pro flowers stop acting like this is like a

477
00:28:12.031 --> 00:28:16.410
substitute for a gift. All right? You are the fucking appetizer.

478
00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:19.530
This is a great appetizer getting flowers,

479
00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:22.770
but if you think you'd get a fucking every year just to get your wife flowers.

480
00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:28.080
Hey Tom, thanks for hanging in there. Nursing the baby. Oh,

the Patriots mate might be talking to Adrian Peterson. Huh? If you're a fucking,

603
00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:46.200
I don't know if you watching the patriots for a long time.

604
00:35:46.201 --> 00:35:48.360
Doesn't that remind you when we signed Corey Dillon?

605
00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:53.610
That'd be nice to get that fucking guy wouldn't maybe see Tom Brady get number

606
00:35:53.611 --> 00:35:56.490
six, right? Somebody said,

607
00:35:56.491 --> 00:35:58.650
he said he wanted to play for another five or six years.

608
00:35:58.651 --> 00:36:01.470
That's fucking unbelievable. Um,

609
00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:05.520
just the fact that he's going to do that means he's going to play for at least

610
00:36:05.521 --> 00:36:10.440
another three. So he's Geek has a legitimate shot at getting another ring. Um,

611
00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:17.070
unreal. Unreal. Good Lord. I fucking enjoy that. All right. Because every time,

612
00:36:17.071 --> 00:36:19.080
every, every plays, I always think this could be the last year.

613
00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:23.220
It could be the last fucking year. You know, Belicheck is almost 70 years old.

614
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.520
Brady's going to be 40, you know, and you know, oh,

615
00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:29.910
we're gonna fucking what's going to happen on that franchise when those two

616
00:36:29.911 --> 00:36:31.890
people leave, who knows? Because what's his face?

617
00:36:31.891 --> 00:36:36.510
Robert Craft is three coaching hires. Bill Parcells, Pete Carroll,

618
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:40.800
Bill Belicheck. He's three for three. Um, alright,

619
00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:45.360
let's read some of these, uh, some of these emails for the week.

620
00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:50.280
Um, girl freaks out. Hey, they are Billy boy George.

621
00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:55.920
Um, it was funny, I never liked him and when I was in the, uh, in the 80s,

622
00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:59.280
you know, it was too homophobic to like that guy. But, uh,

623
00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.080
his fucking drum is to shit on the,

624
00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:04.800
do you really wanna Hook me?

625
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:08.820
Love the fucking drums on that song. Um, anyways,

626
00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:10.440
not sure if you saw this shit.

627
00:37:10.441 --> 00:37:15.441
Some girl freaked out at a yogurt shop in Santa Monica because the couple behind

628
00:37:15.541 --> 00:37:16.770
her kissed each other.

629
00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:21.720
She starts saying that she was being sexually harassed by them doing so it gets

630
00:37:21.721 --> 00:37:22.680
out of control.

631
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:27.000
The funny thing is that she starts off acting like a hacky liberal,

632
00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:31.980
but then ends acting like a hacky conservatives as she shifted through stages of

633
00:37:31.981 --> 00:37:36.810
emotion. Uh, the Phoenix video tour video look great. Can't wait for San Jose.

634
00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.990
Um, yeah. I actually, I watched some of that at first.

635
00:37:39.991 --> 00:37:43.450
I love this woman because I hate people who fuck, I don't hate,

636
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:46.950
I hate looking at people making out in public. It's fucking gross.

637
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:51.660
It's fucking gross. You tongued jammed down each other's throats.

638
00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:56.070
You know, it's like you, I don't want to look at,

639
00:37:56.071 --> 00:37:59.850
especially when I'm around food, I totally get what she's saying.

640
00:37:59.851 --> 00:38:02.640
But then she took it too far when she started saying that she was, uh,

641
00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.400
that she was being sexually harassed.

642
00:38:05.401 --> 00:38:09.000
What I did love though is I love how the extreme closeup,

643
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:13.170
when she's yelling into the camera, it reminded me of that movie misery,

644
00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:18.390
you know, with the ladies. Like you can't wait. Whatever the fuck should says.

645
00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.740
Was there anything more satisfying in a fucking movie?

646
00:38:22.741 --> 00:38:24.730
When he finally got in the bed and started slamming that bitch,

647
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:29.550
his head against the floor. Ah, just laying there that powerless.

648
00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:33.660
Do you know in the book she actually cuts his feet off rather than breaking his

649
00:38:33.661 --> 00:38:37.390
goddamn ankles. Um, I gotta be honest with you.

650
00:38:37.391 --> 00:38:39.850
I really think I could have sweet talked my way out of that bed.

651
00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.670
I really would have, I would act like I wanted to fuck her. You know,

652
00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:48.430
I would've done that. Right? Yeah.

653
00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:49.950
I would have told him that I was never going to leave her.

654
00:38:49.951 --> 00:38:54.060
I would have built her fucking up until I started to be able to walk around.

655
00:38:54.061 --> 00:38:58.040
Right. And then I would actually am once I could, even with south,

656
00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:01.950
this is how long of a slow play I would go with that woman. I would actually,

657
00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:03.270
I would, after I could walk,

658
00:39:03.271 --> 00:39:07.230
I would stay in a three month relationship with them till she got so fucking

659
00:39:07.231 --> 00:39:08.130
comfortable. Right.

660
00:39:08.131 --> 00:39:10.950
And then one day I'd be making my famous fucking scrambled eggs,

661
00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.410
take out a fucking skillet.

662
00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.130
That would be it, man. I would,

663
00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:24.000
I would stay in a relationship with that woman until the fucking snow melted,

664
00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:29.280
you know, and I could shake off whatever thing I had to have fucking,

665
00:39:29.281 --> 00:39:32.700
or I could shake that off. I'm German Irish, I could fucking,

666
00:39:32.701 --> 00:39:35.910
I could put that in a box and never think of it again. No Pun intended.

667
00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:38.670
That's what I would've done. He fucked up. You know what I mean?

668
00:39:38.671 --> 00:39:40.320
He actually wrote the real fucking book.

669
00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:44.220
I guess I that's cause I know that she was out of her mind,

670
00:39:44.221 --> 00:39:45.930
but I swear to God I would've fucking,

671
00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:51.510
I would have told her that I love what she did with her hair. All of that thing.

672
00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:54.390
The hardest thing would have been, was not laughing.

673
00:39:54.391 --> 00:39:57.900
The noises that she would have made during intersects, intersects, intercourse,

674
00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:03.270
intersects. Um, anyways. I don't know what that says about me,

675
00:40:03.271 --> 00:40:04.890
but you know, I, that's, that's how I would've got out of it.

676
00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:07.410
I would've just gotten totally like, oh yeah, yeah, the shit beautiful.

677
00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.380
Oh my God, this soup is fucking delicious.

678
00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:14.970
And I would've just talked to her and just find out what the exact fucking books

679
00:40:14.971 --> 00:40:17.190
she wanted me to write. And that's exactly what I would've written.

680
00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:23.400
Maybe I hit it with a typewriter, like some sort of symbolism, I don't know.

681
00:40:23.401 --> 00:40:24.780
But at the end of the day, you know,

682
00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:28.680
fucking some pig versus getting both of your fucking ankles broken. I mean,

683
00:40:28.681 --> 00:40:32.800
I don't think there's it, there's really no trade off. Right.

684
00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:35.470
<v 2>Um, [inaudible]</v>

685
00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.930
<v 0>you probably would need, she's such a fucking lunatic.</v>

686
00:40:37.931 --> 00:40:41.350
She's probably like asexual. You probably don't have to do that, you know,

687
00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:46.530
just laugh at her jokes. I think you would have been all right. Um, anyways,

688
00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:50.590
I just went on a tangent there. Sorry about that. Uh, here we go, girl.

689
00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:53.440
So when he was getting back to that, yeah, I don't like when, uh,

690
00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:57.100
I don't like watching people make out. It's fucking gross. Me,

691
00:40:57.101 --> 00:41:00.910
I hated him with the two things I hate most in movies is when people are fucking

692
00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:02.920
making out and, and,

693
00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:07.870
and people when they're eating in a scene and then fucking making those fucking

694
00:41:07.871 --> 00:41:08.704
noises.

695
00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:13.210
There's nothing worse than watching an actor eat in a scene because most times

696
00:41:13.211 --> 00:41:16.300
they're not eating. So they have to overact eating and everybody,

697
00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.400
I don't know what happens. They turn into fucking animals.

698
00:41:18.401 --> 00:41:19.840
They started eating with their mouth open.

699
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:21.910
They started pointing at people with the bread.

700
00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:24.950
<v 2>MMM. [inaudible]</v>

701
00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:29.560
<v 0>that, and I, I hate love scenes in movies. You know what I mean?</v>

702
00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:33.920
Like when they take it to the point where literally one actor is on the other

703
00:41:33.921 --> 00:41:36.830
actors titties, it's just like, I get it. They're going to have sex. Like,

704
00:41:36.831 --> 00:41:38.410
why are you going take it to this? Let whiskey.

705
00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:41.450
Are you making a porno now I want to watch a porn. Oh,

706
00:41:41.451 --> 00:41:45.440
I just want you to fucking porno. Why can't you just have a walk in the bedroom?

707
00:41:45.441 --> 00:41:50.210
And then they closed the door. I get it. They fucked. Like, who is that for

708
00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:55.300
Tay Away?

709
00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:59.540
They're always up against the wall and it's fucking raining out or some shit,

710
00:41:59.541 --> 00:42:00.374
you know what I mean?

711
00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:02.053
<v 4>Okay.</v>

712
00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:04.060
<v 0>Rather than they're getting used to each other,</v>

713
00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:09.400
figuring out which lip to go for. Do you go for the top lip or the bottom lip?

714
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:11.110
You know what I mean? What position do you like?

715
00:42:11.111 --> 00:42:14.200
Do you like to have your ass slapped and not all that shit's out of the way.

716
00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:17.440
They just automatically start acting like they've been banging each other the

717
00:42:17.441 --> 00:42:22.050
whole summer. Little bit cold,

718
00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:25.950
whatever fucking songs they play. What are some of the stupid,

719
00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.680
the 80s they always played that stupid saxophone.

720
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:33.250
The saxophone got ruined in the 80s it went from this, like,

721
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:38.200
it went literally from this instrument that when it was in the hands of a black

722
00:42:38.201 --> 00:42:38.621
person,

723
00:42:38.621 --> 00:42:43.621
it actually scared the CIA to the 80s where it just meant that Tom Cruise was

724
00:42:44.501 --> 00:42:45.490
going to fuck somebody.

725
00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.350
You know, half of those jazz guys in the fucking,

726
00:42:53.351 --> 00:42:58.351
from the forties 50s and 60s ad their fucking phones bugged by the Goddamn Jad

727
00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.940
go Hoover and the FBI. And then just, it just,

728
00:43:00.941 --> 00:43:03.970
somehow it just all went to shit in the 70s.

729
00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:08.410
It all went to shit and the fucking seventies, you know,

730
00:43:08.411 --> 00:43:11.560
they whacked everybody that they needed to whack in the 60s.

731
00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:16.330
They figured out how not to lose public support of a war after the debacle of

732
00:43:16.331 --> 00:43:19.720
Vietnam. Right? So now they've got everybody. Everybody's got wise.

733
00:43:19.721 --> 00:43:22.450
What drove I, you fought Trump. I'd worked trough. I fought everything I said,

734
00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:25.630
it's who doesn't support the tropes? They're on our team.

735
00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.380
But the brilliance is they've now morphed that into,

736
00:43:29.381 --> 00:43:33.600
you cannot criticize the war if you do or anything that, that the, the, the,

737
00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:34.510
the, the, the,

738
00:43:34.511 --> 00:43:39.040
the head Pentagon is doing because now you're criticizing some 18 year old who's

739
00:43:39.041 --> 00:43:41.560
over there fighting for your freedom. It's fucking brilliant.

740
00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:46.540
And we should have seen this common with what happened to the saxophone in the

741
00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:51.370
80s. All right. Girlfriends says, I'm stagnant. Oh,

742
00:43:51.371 --> 00:43:56.240
Jesus. Oh Dude, that's a major red flag. Uh,

743
00:43:56.310 --> 00:44:01.230
hey bill, you tiny Tim looking red nose. Pecker head. Okay.

744
00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:05.350
Who is tiny Tim again. Oh,

745
00:44:05.351 --> 00:44:10.210
tiny tips and ugly motherfucker with the Ukulele. Jesus Christ. Wow.

746
00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:13.510
It looks like if somebody beat the shit out of George Washington.

747
00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:17.740
Thank you for why that one really hurt. Ugh. Anyways, uh,

748
00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:21.760
maybe I'll pull a Michael Jackson get a cleft in my chin. Uh, love you.

749
00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:25.150
Love your podcast, but you wrote you love your podcast.

750
00:44:25.151 --> 00:44:28.960
Even though I never get any advice. Uh, will you give me some?

751
00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:32.070
I have l this is somebody who's not to use any punctuation.

752
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:36.520
This is all one sentence. Loved you po.

753
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:39.690
Maybe this person's foreign loved you podcast.

754
00:44:39.691 --> 00:44:43.350
Even though I never get any advice. Will you give me some advice?

755
00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:46.740
Will you give me some? I have this girlfriend I really like.

756
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:51.210
That's all one sentence. We worked together at the local restaurant.

757
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:54.360
I was fine until I got fired.

758
00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:59.460
Then I got into a fight with my girlfriend's sister's boyfriend.

759
00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:03.940
Got that? No, I don't. All right, let me,

760
00:45:03.941 --> 00:45:05.170
let me try to break this down here.

761
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:06.863
<v 1>Okay.</v>

762
00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:09.840
<v 0>All right. You have this girlfriend you really like.</v>

763
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:13.920
We work together at the local restaurant, I guess everything was cool.

764
00:45:13.921 --> 00:45:18.390
And then you got fired and then you got into a fight with her? With hers.

765
00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:19.410
Her sister.

766
00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:20.910
<v 1>Okay.</v>

767
00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:25.370
<v 0>Her sister's boyfriend. Okay. So your girlfriend at work,</v>

768
00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:28.700
you've got new fight with her sister's boyfriend and then you got fired from the

769
00:45:28.701 --> 00:45:31.460
TGI Friday's whatever the fuck you did. All right. I'm back on board.

770
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:34.280
Then I got a DWAI

771
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:39.340
driving while alcohol influenced, I dunno, I don't,

772
00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:41.790
I know what the fuck's going on here. Um,

773
00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:49.560
I F and I feel like a complete loser and sometimes it gets me depressed also.

774
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:51.490
I still give her rides to work,

775
00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:55.720
which she tells me means nothing and also says she loves me,

776
00:45:55.990 --> 00:46:00.670
but it's been getting meaner everyday. I don't get a job. All right,

777
00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:01.533
well, okay,

778
00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:04.840
well the defensive or you have to understand what the woman that if you're not

779
00:46:04.841 --> 00:46:08.110
bringing in money, you just literally have,

780
00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:12.250
you're like a 40 year old teenager at that point. You're just like a big kid.

781
00:46:12.251 --> 00:46:16.540
She has to deal with, um, you know, and women,

782
00:46:16.541 --> 00:46:19.360
they're all feminists until they have to start paying for everything.

783
00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:21.040
You know what I mean?

784
00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:22.300
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

785
00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:27.300
<v 0>Like what's fucked up with sexism and all that and the guys have better paying</v>

786
00:46:28.781 --> 00:46:30.280
jobs. Evidently. I have no idea.

787
00:46:30.281 --> 00:46:31.810
I've never asked people what the fuck they make,

788
00:46:31.811 --> 00:46:35.140
but let's just say what they're saying is true. Um,

789
00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:37.780
what's fucked up is,

790
00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:41.790
is it now created this thing where women can date and like you're,

791
00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:44.740
you're always for the most part, dating up.

792
00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:47.780
You know, if you're,

793
00:46:47.781 --> 00:46:52.220
if you have reasonable fucking looks okay and you had a reasonably good

794
00:46:52.221 --> 00:46:55.970
childhood and for whatever, you're not migrating towards fucking losers.

795
00:46:56.810 --> 00:46:57.643
All right?

796
00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:03.020
You can actually always be in a situation where getting married is a good thing

797
00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.320
cause the other person makes more money than you, so you don't have,

798
00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:07.820
the whole fucking thing falls apart. You're going to get the house,

799
00:47:07.821 --> 00:47:11.450
you're going to get the child support, you're going to get the alimony. Right.

800
00:47:11.451 --> 00:47:16.130
Only lately are we finally starting to see women that having to do that and it's

801
00:47:16.131 --> 00:47:20.270
fucking hell. Like they freak the fuck out. Like what

802
00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:26.030
a woman paid alimony was. It's like I all of a sudden got my period, like, wait,

803
00:47:26.031 --> 00:47:30.960
I gotta do this now. What the fuck? Right. Um, anyway,

804
00:47:30.961 --> 00:47:33.310
so anyways, so let me get back to the fucking thing here. I, I keep,

805
00:47:33.311 --> 00:47:37.330
I keep going on tangents here. I need to stay focused. Um, so, okay,

806
00:47:37.331 --> 00:47:40.420
so you got a DUI, right. And she still gives me shit. Okay,

807
00:47:40.421 --> 00:47:42.460
so now you're not making any money. So you know,

808
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:45.700
then you're all depressed and you don't have a car.

809
00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:49.870
So I'm guessing you're not really looking for a fucking job or maybe she's just

810
00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:52.360
meaning shit. I don't know. Anyways, he said,

811
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:55.150
I've never had trouble getting work when I needed it,

812
00:47:55.151 --> 00:47:59.080
but now I feel like a lazy piece of Shit. My girlfriend called me stagnant,

813
00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:02.620
stagnant, and told me she's worried. She said tonight,

814
00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:05.770
she would see me later then changed it to,

815
00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:10.480
or talk to you later and trailed off, muttering some inaudible bullshit.

816
00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:14.950
I need to pay my rent tomorrow. Uh,

817
00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.720
and I basically broke as fuck.

818
00:48:16.721 --> 00:48:20.320
I gave her a key to my place and she agreed to pay half the rent,

819
00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:24.550
but I feel like I'm twisting her arm to do it. Yeah, dude, what are you doing?

820
00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:29.650
I feel stagnant to and depressed and she makes it hard to think sometimes.

821
00:48:29.651 --> 00:48:32.410
So I secretly bought a train ticket to California,

822
00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:39.850
so I secretly bought a train ticket to California from New York that leaves in

823
00:48:39.851 --> 00:48:42.670
two weeks. I'm debating whether to stay here,

824
00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:45.790
keep looking for a job in a debt economy.

825
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:52.250
Try and work things out with my girl. I'm sorry guys. Like this is not me here.

826
00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:54.260
If this is how this is written in,

827
00:48:54.261 --> 00:48:58.820
face the music by paying thousands of fines and traffic tickets while I'm broke

828
00:48:58.821 --> 00:49:02.330
as fuck or go with the couple of hippie friends hikes through,

829
00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:04.820
through like he threw a ball,

830
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:10.000
the state of California while stopping to work on wolfing farms in between

831
00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:14.060
journeys. It's just like Jack Kerouac Shit. I don't know.

832
00:49:14.061 --> 00:49:18.230
I'm starting to think this isn't real to stay or to go. I don't know.

833
00:49:18.231 --> 00:49:21.620
But if she calls me stagnant again, I'll be out in over the horizon.

834
00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:25.640
I feel bad and I don't know what the fuck to do. So any advice is appreciated.

835
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:28.730
Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Yeah. First of all, all right,

836
00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:33.980
let's just eliminate the woman from all of this. Okay? Uh,

837
00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:35.760
you need to pay a traffic tickets, dude,

838
00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:37.430
if you think you're just going to walk away from that,

839
00:49:37.431 --> 00:49:38.900
you're going to end up doing jail time.

840
00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:41.480
A buddy of mine did that and K and they put them in county,

841
00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:44.810
which you don't want to be in because that's all different levels of fucking

842
00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:46.003
peoples. At least in La.

843
00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:51.950
That's like rapist lunatics like their own kid on fire right down to a,

844
00:49:51.951 --> 00:49:56.210
yeah, I had a bunch of traffic tickets and it got to such a f well made traffic

845
00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:59.000
tickets. You know a traffic ticket. He had a DUI and he,

846
00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:02.720
he didn't show up to court. Maybe you won't go to jail. I don't know.

847
00:50:02.721 --> 00:50:06.440
But it's going to be a fucking nightmare and this can be hanging over your head

848
00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:08.930
and then you're going to have to try to work under the table,

849
00:50:08.931 --> 00:50:11.300
which is going to cause you not to fucking pay taxes.

850
00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.730
It's going to be a nightmare. So, um,

851
00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:15.903
<v 2>okay.</v>

852
00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:18.430
<v 0>I Dunno, I would, uh,</v>

853
00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:23.700
I would reach out for help is what I would do and I,

854
00:50:23.701 --> 00:50:25.920
it doesn't sound like your girlfriend wants to do it anymore.

855
00:50:25.921 --> 00:50:28.130
You haven't told me how long been unemployed,

856
00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:33.080
but it sounds like she's at the brink of being fed up with you. But, uh,

857
00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:37.190
you did get into a fight. You did get fired, you did drink and drive.

858
00:50:37.191 --> 00:50:42.191
So you're making a bunch of bad moves and it's not her fault that she's trying

859
00:50:43.161 --> 00:50:46.340
to envision a future with you.

860
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:51.140
And all she's seeing is that she's going to work while you're boozing it up and

861
00:50:51.141 --> 00:50:53.810
she has to support you. And I'm going to go out on a limb here.

862
00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:56.750
I don't like speaking for the ladies, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say,

863
00:50:56.751 --> 00:50:59.030
I don't think a lot of women are looking for that in the future.

864
00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:01.220
So I would man up.

865
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:05.090
You need the man to fuck up and realize that you are stagnant.

866
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:07.520
You need to get your shit together. All right.

867
00:51:07.521 --> 00:51:09.740
I don't know what you have to do to find a fucking job.

868
00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:12.440
That's a difficult thing. But um, I dunno.

869
00:51:12.441 --> 00:51:15.980
Can you ask your parents for some help? Maybe you fucking leave your apartment,

870
00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:18.620
move back in with your parents while you get through this.

871
00:51:18.621 --> 00:51:21.170
You bought them the fuck out. You sober up.

872
00:51:21.171 --> 00:51:24.740
You start working out with the old weights. You left in your parent's garage,

873
00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:27.500
you find a fucking job. All right?

874
00:51:27.501 --> 00:51:30.680
Get on a payment plan with you fucking tickets and all of that shit.

875
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:34.940
Get all of that off the table. Maybe even break up with your girlfriend.

876
00:51:34.941 --> 00:51:38.300
Get your shit together, create a whole new fucking you.

877
00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:42.050
And maybe you get a new girlfriend that's beyond the level of this one here that

878
00:51:42.051 --> 00:51:44.450
was working at the fucking restaurant or whatever the hell you are at.

879
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:47.720
All right? But just know this. You sound like you're still young.

880
00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:51.640
You got your whole life ahead of you and you know you're at.

881
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:55.640
What you're doing is you're giving into your situation rather than fucking

882
00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:59.180
picking yourself up off the mat. All right, so get up off the floor.

883
00:51:59.181 --> 00:52:01.640
Stop feeling sorry for yourself. All right?

884
00:52:02.130 --> 00:52:05.560
You have all the power in the world to turn that thing around. All right. And a,

885
00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:09.890
that's it. Get a job. Pay Off your tickets and uh, you know,

886
00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:13.100
see what happens with that woman. You know, maybe she's not the one.

887
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:16.550
Maybe she is. Who knows who gives a fuck, but work on your life.

888
00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:20.760
Work on yourself. There you go. All right. Girlfriends ultimatum and up.

889
00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:24.600
Jesus Christ. Here we go again. Hey, Billy Bond.

890
00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:29.810
My girlfriend, oh, parentheses of over one year recently gave me an ultimatum.

891
00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:34.820
Weed or her? I chose weed. All right.

892
00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:38.300
Here's a person who knows what he likes. Did you say that?

893
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:42.260
Did you say that in the moment? Did you wait a few days?

894
00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:44.450
Did you mull it over for at least a few minutes?

895
00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:50.970
Sick of your pot smoking. Okay. I know that, you know,

896
00:52:50.971 --> 00:52:55.170
I said earlier that I was okay with it, but the truth is I'm not,

897
00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:59.020
you're high all the time. I think it's affecting you and it's just, I,

898
00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:02.160
I'm to the point, I can't do this anymore.

899
00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:05.550
So you need to make a choice.

900
00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:07.813
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

901
00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:12.360
<v 0>you choose me or you choose marijuana.</v>

902
00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:18.300
Once I get to me, I'm gonna choose the weed sweetheart. See you.

903
00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:24.020
She's going to slowly walk their head down out the fucking door.

904
00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:29.040
It couldn't have gone down like that anyways. However, as I perceived it,

905
00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:32.820
it was a choice of reason versus absurdity, not her verse.

906
00:53:32.821 --> 00:53:37.470
We'd allow me to defend myself. Absolutely, Sir. You have the floor.

907
00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:41.940
Um, or man, you know, this might be a lesbian relationship.

908
00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:45.330
My girl and I started smoking together about two months ago.

909
00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:49.770
She was never big on it, but I was a self-admitted pothead in the past.

910
00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:54.630
We started smoking a couple of months ago and her request, uh,

911
00:53:54.631 --> 00:53:58.410
we would smoke one or two hits per night before bed. Well,

912
00:53:58.411 --> 00:54:02.190
last night she decided that she didn't like smoking weed anymore because she

913
00:54:02.191 --> 00:54:05.850
doesn't like the feeling of being high. Apparently in that same moment,

914
00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:10.940
she became morally opposed to the idea of marijuana and she proceeded to call me

915
00:54:11.251 --> 00:54:15.840
an addict that has a serious problem in a grand dramatic gesture.

916
00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:21.050
She flushed my remaining weed down the toilet and made me choose her or weed.

917
00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:27.940
Wow. That escalated as they say an anchorman. Uh,

918
00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:31.350
she kept pointing at me and [inaudible] yelling, look at yourself.

919
00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:34.380
You're so high right now. Keep in mind,

920
00:54:34.381 --> 00:54:37.350
I took one hit out of a one hitter.

921
00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:42.960
I called bullshit on all of our arguments because as long as I've known her,

922
00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:48.140
she has never had a problem with weed and would often encourage me to use it

923
00:54:49.201 --> 00:54:51.990
because it does reduce my anxiety and temper.

924
00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:57.560
She often brags about her ex boyfriend selling weed and her ex husband's smoking

925
00:54:57.691 --> 00:55:02.160
every day and it not being an issue. All right.

926
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:06.930
I was kind of hearing her argument to those last fucking two sentences. Wow.

927
00:55:06.931 --> 00:55:11.910
This person, this is a fucking retread year with, Huh? Jesus. A,

928
00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:16.830
you got her onto the recycle bin there. I as soy assumed this wasn't about weed,

929
00:55:16.831 --> 00:55:21.300
but something else. I assume it's the result of me telling her months ago, oh,

930
00:55:21.301 --> 00:55:22.050
here we go.

931
00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:27.050
That I wouldn't be with her if she continued to drink because she had a serious,

932
00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:30.720
seriously unhealthy relationship with alcohol. So,

933
00:55:30.721 --> 00:55:35.721
I imagine she's trying to use this as her chance to play holier than thou card

934
00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:40.530
for the record. I don't want to smoke weed all day slash every day.

935
00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:41.970
It's the principle of the thing.

936
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:45.690
But now my relationship is riding on this thing and I don't want,

937
00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:51.080
I don't want to do what is riding on this thing and I don't want to do,

938
00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:54.000
I think it's riding on this thing that you don't want to do is stick what you're

939
00:55:54.001 --> 00:55:56.700
trying to say. What are your thoughts? Help a brother out.

940
00:55:57.150 --> 00:56:00.630
Do I want to deal with this crazy level of hypocrisy forever. Thanks.

941
00:56:00.631 --> 00:56:04.380
And Go fuck yourself. Um, I don't think so. No,

942
00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:08.880
I don't think so. Uh, and they detached away that you're able to talk about her.

943
00:56:08.881 --> 00:56:11.370
And you never once said that, you know, I really love her though.

944
00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:14.100
You never said that. So, um,

945
00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:19.590
it sounds like she had a rough childhood that led into alcohol abuse and to her,

946
00:56:20.090 --> 00:56:23.980
uh, picking some really fucking, so we're a winners here.

947
00:56:23.981 --> 00:56:26.410
Drug dealers and fucking, uh, I don't know Mike.

948
00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:30.880
I don't know what her ex husband did, but he smoked every day. Um,

949
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:33.550
yeah, I, I think, uh,

950
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.650
<v 1>okay.</v>

951
00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:39.160
<v 0>The way you tell it, it doesn't sound like a rational person. So, um,</v>

952
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:40.600
on the other side,

953
00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:44.380
I will tell you there are a lot of people that get high every day and don't

954
00:56:44.381 --> 00:56:48.670
think that they have a problem. Whereas if you get drunk every day,

955
00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:53.620
people call you a drunk and say, you know, you have a problem. Um,

956
00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:57.490
I have a couple friends of mine that did that for a good 20 fucking years and

957
00:56:57.491 --> 00:56:58.420
they paid the price.

958
00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:04.100
I'm smoking weed every single fucking day. It's like everything.

959
00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:06.640
He wouldn't want to eat ice cream every day. You'd be a fat fuck.

960
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:11.970
You drink booze every day. You're going to have a bad liver, gallbladder, gin,

961
00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:15.550
blossoming. Fucking alcohol is brutal. And I actually, you know,

962
00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:18.130
now that I've finally been educated a little bit on weed,

963
00:57:18.131 --> 00:57:21.040
I really do believe it's way, way worse.

964
00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:26.590
It definitely ages you way, way, way more, um, than we does.

965
00:57:26.590 --> 00:57:28.120
But I don't think like, you know,

966
00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:33.100
wake and bake people and people who need weed to fall asleep.

967
00:57:33.101 --> 00:57:37.360
I know it helps with anxiety and shit like that. And obviously, you know,

968
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:39.990
pain of chemotherapy, it's got a lot of great things. But I,

969
00:57:39.991 --> 00:57:42.670
I wouldn't really comes down to is if it's not,

970
00:57:42.671 --> 00:57:44.500
if you feel it's not affecting your life,

971
00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:47.380
then I would just continue to do what you're doing.

972
00:57:47.381 --> 00:57:51.130
But it's something that as an adult, you know, when you move out,

973
00:57:51.131 --> 00:57:54.730
your parents aren't there to fucking question your behavior. You really have to,

974
00:57:55.960 --> 00:58:00.070
I feel be extra tough on yourself. Like I drank way too much last year,

975
00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:01.150
way too fucking much.

976
00:58:01.151 --> 00:58:04.530
So I'm glad that I kind of have it back under control and even,

977
00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:06.250
I probably drank way too much. Um,

978
00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:10.240
so I'm trying to look at that type of shit and you know, it's funny when I,

979
00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:13.470
when I don't drink, you know,

980
00:58:13.471 --> 00:58:18.471
I'm more apt to take a hit a weed because I'm just used to having a little bit

981
00:58:18.661 --> 00:58:20.490
of a buzz every couple of days.

982
00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:23.850
So then I that always whenever I quit drinking,

983
00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:26.520
then there'll be like a two week period that if somebody has weed, hey,

984
00:58:26.521 --> 00:58:28.800
you want to hit, I'll actually take a hit and I'd never smoke weed.

985
00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:34.320
But then after that, then I, then I just, you know, I just don't like weed.

986
00:58:34.350 --> 00:58:37.020
I'm just not into it. And um,

987
00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:41.210
then after like two weeks, then I just kinda just don't do anything.

988
00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:46.850
And then that's when I start getting into shape again. So whatever, I think,

989
00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:49.670
you know, you sound pretty level headed and you never said you love there.

990
00:58:49.671 --> 00:58:51.710
So I would get out of that. That sounds like a fucking,

991
00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:57.440
you'd really have to like demand a baggage. She sounds like she has, you know.

992
00:58:58.540 --> 00:58:59.373
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

993
00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:01.680
<v 0>Me marrying a fucking alcoholic. I mean that just, that,</v>

994
00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:06.780
that really takes a fucking saint t is if you're sober, sort of,

995
00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:10.050
I don't know. I don't know why you'd want to put yourself through that.

996
00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:13.260
All right. That's their issue to fucking deal with.

997
00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:16.590
And you gotta be selfish when you want to find the right person.

998
00:59:16.591 --> 00:59:20.850
So there you go. Alright. Older lady wants to bang.

999
00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:24.770
No, JJ, here's to you,

1000
00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:28.310
Mrs. Robertson. Alright. Hey Bill.

1001
00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:33.340
I am a 22 year old senior at college just outside of Baltimore and I'm a big fan

1002
00:59:33.351 --> 00:59:35.060
of your stand up a podcast. Well thank you.

1003
00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:38.090
I caught your show when he came to Baltimore and you absolutely killed it.

1004
00:59:38.091 --> 00:59:40.700
Thank you again. Anyways, I wanted to,

1005
00:59:40.701 --> 00:59:45.701
I wanted your advice as it relates to an older fucking lady.

1006
00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:50.660
Um, so just to give you a little background,

1007
00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:53.690
last summer I decided to get in shape.

1008
00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:58.730
I developed a nice workout routine and subsequently lost 40 pounds and really

1009
00:59:58.731 --> 01:00:02.960
built up some muscle. As a result, women have been showing me a lot more,

1010
01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:06.980
showing a lot more interest in me. They had go turned it around. Good for you.

1011
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:10.970
I'm happy for you and I have definitely had more confidence with talking to

1012
01:00:10.971 --> 01:00:12.890
women. All right, we'll keep going. Keep going,

1013
01:00:12.891 --> 01:00:14.420
keep going and keep shooting for the moon.

1014
01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:18.470
Talk to those chicks you think around to the audio leak, see what happens.

1015
01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:19.371
Anyways.

1016
01:00:19.371 --> 01:00:23.330
Now I have been using some dating apps and have met and hooked up with more

1017
01:00:23.331 --> 01:00:27.770
women than I have ever have before. Not Bragging. It's just the facts.

1018
01:00:27.771 --> 01:00:32.420
All right, well I be using a condom. They're fucking Studley. Um,

1019
01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:34.880
so recently, and this may sound weird,

1020
01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:39.770
I ran across this incredibly attractive 50 year old woman on one of the dating

1021
01:00:39.771 --> 01:00:44.360
apps and liked your profile. Just kind of as a joke. No,

1022
01:00:44.361 --> 01:00:46.460
you didn't. You were attracted to it. It gives a shit.

1023
01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:49.280
She is a classic example of a cougar.

1024
01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:53.990
She's like Mrs. Robinson from the graduate or that horny bitch from sex in the

1025
01:00:53.991 --> 01:00:57.770
city who just fucks everybody. Oh my God. Yeah.

1026
01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:02.420
The most one dimensional character ever. Kim Cottrell's character.

1027
01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:06.230
It's just fucking with every fucking line. It's like, I get it.

1028
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:11.210
You fuck a lot of guys. Has anybody ever just,

1029
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:15.350
there has to be a youtube video where everybody just put all those lines from

1030
01:01:15.351 --> 01:01:18.440
the entire fucking series. It's like,

1031
01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:20.130
<v 4>okay,</v>

1032
01:01:20.130 --> 01:01:20.810
<v 0>my, my knee.</v>

1033
01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:24.900
I used to watch the thing and all the way back when it was on when we were still

1034
01:01:24.901 --> 01:01:27.270
living in New York, we were living together in this apartment.

1035
01:01:27.271 --> 01:01:28.800
I would just be on the other side of the apartment.

1036
01:01:28.801 --> 01:01:33.360
She'd be watching it at any time. Kim Cottrell's character would say something.

1037
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:38.130
I would always be in the background. I would just go cause she's a whore.

1038
01:01:43.810 --> 01:01:47.460
Um, anyways, he says, much to my surprise, I matched with her.

1039
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:51.240
I don't know what that means. She hit you back basically.

1040
01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:53.940
She's surprisingly sexually aggressive.

1041
01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:57.390
It isn't women fucking by their mid thirties. They know what the fuck they want.

1042
01:01:57.391 --> 01:02:00.210
They don't give a shit anymore and clearly wants to fuck me.

1043
01:02:00.211 --> 01:02:04.560
She sends me messages all the time and talks about how she likes younger men.

1044
01:02:04.830 --> 01:02:07.950
Of course she does. She does want to bang some fucking old bastard like me.

1045
01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:12.150
She followed me on snapchat recently and started sending me nude pictures and

1046
01:02:12.151 --> 01:02:15.690
shit. He Blake now,

1047
01:02:15.691 --> 01:02:20.580
at least in my experience, young guys always joke about the of fucking a cougar.

1048
01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:22.800
All my friends are saying I should just fuck her,

1049
01:02:22.801 --> 01:02:25.830
but I can't shake the feeling that there's something fucked up about it.

1050
01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:30.060
Is it weird that she's over twice my age? What are your thoughts on this bill?

1051
01:02:30.061 --> 01:02:34.080
Should I fucker or is it a bad idea? Let me know. Thanks to go fuck yourself.

1052
01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:37.260
Oh Sir. This is going to be a great lesson for you. Um,

1053
01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:42.360
how old did you say you were? 22. Okay.

1054
01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:45.660
I will tell you this and it took me into my early forties to learn this.

1055
01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:52.040
There is no way to ever over emphasize the importance of listening to your gut.

1056
01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.110
Listening to your gut will will.

1057
01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:02.070
I'm telling you when your gut just tells you, man, this doesn't feel right.

1058
01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:04.020
You fucking walk away.

1059
01:03:05.130 --> 01:03:10.110
Walk away every fucking time, okay? Unless it's like,

1060
01:03:10.111 --> 01:03:12.570
it's something that, you know, it's some sort of stage fright thing,

1061
01:03:12.571 --> 01:03:14.820
some sort of anxiety thing that you have to get over.

1062
01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:17.400
You're not afraid of fucking women. Okay?

1063
01:03:17.490 --> 01:03:21.060
Now all of a sudden this woman's coming and this is fucking failing that you

1064
01:03:21.061 --> 01:03:24.870
fail and this ain't right to just fucking walk, walk,

1065
01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:27.360
walk away. Okay.

1066
01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:32.520
What kind of a fucking 50 year old is sending naked pictures to somebody have to

1067
01:03:32.521 --> 01:03:37.020
fucking age. All right. Now I know this day of hyper feminism,

1068
01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:42.030
they'll say that that's actually brave. It's this. It's that. It's empowering.

1069
01:03:42.031 --> 01:03:44.490
It's fucking pathetic because all you have to do is slide it over.

1070
01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:48.420
If a guy was sending Dick pics to a 22 year old chick,

1071
01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:52.740
see what I'm saying? You know what I mean? This is like

1072
01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:59.010
whatever. Anyways, yeah dude, fucking walk away. That's, you know,

1073
01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:03.180
that's a fucking train wreck and your gut is telling you that and you need to

1074
01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.000
just listen to your gut. All right?

1075
01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:09.330
When you go into a job interview and you fucking sit in across from the person

1076
01:04:09.450 --> 01:04:12.270
they're talking to you, I'm telling you beyond just interview,

1077
01:04:12.271 --> 01:04:14.610
you're going to get a sense. I swear to God,

1078
01:04:14.611 --> 01:04:19.410
I took a meeting one time with somebody, and the second I met this person,

1079
01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.420
I just didn't like them. And there was something about them.

1080
01:04:21.421 --> 01:04:24.900
They felt sleazy and I got this joke, thief vibe from them,

1081
01:04:25.110 --> 01:04:27.600
and I immediately stopped telling stories and all that shit.

1082
01:04:27.810 --> 01:04:29.970
And I ended up going and I just was like, wow.

1083
01:04:29.971 --> 01:04:31.590
I thought I really wanted to meet that person.

1084
01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:33.420
Then I met them and they weren't what I thought they were going to be.

1085
01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:36.000
And then I talked to like two or three people about them. They like, yeah,

1086
01:04:36.001 --> 01:04:40.170
that guy's got a, he's got a fucking rep for steel and shit. I'm telling you,

1087
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:45.270
you gotta listen to your gut. It will give up. That's how you, how you end up,

1088
01:04:45.271 --> 01:04:48.330
not in the trunk of a serial killer's car. Is your guts going to tell, hey,

1089
01:04:48.331 --> 01:04:51.780
you know, I don't give a fuck if this person has a flat keep driving.

1090
01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:56.190
You're going to feel it. You're going to feel that weird thing. So good feel.

1091
01:04:56.220 --> 01:05:00.450
Don't do it. All right, here we go. All right, let's read the last thing here.

1092
01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:03.900
Overrated. Underrated. Uh, Hey,

1093
01:05:03.901 --> 01:05:08.400
you Bruin love and Fuck Boston Bruin love and fuck actually get it right.

1094
01:05:08.401 --> 01:05:12.990
The original Bruins. I like the UCLA Bruins who came later. Um,

1095
01:05:13.050 --> 01:05:13.883
overrated.

1096
01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:19.180
Sidney Crosby is the most overrated comment I can think of. Oh,

1097
01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:21.910
give me a fucking break, dude. All right.

1098
01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:24.880
So he scored a lot of goals against your team, is what I'm guessing. Anyways.

1099
01:05:24.881 --> 01:05:25.181
He said,

1100
01:05:25.181 --> 01:05:29.710
I wished this Cox cocksucker would be held accountable for just one of the

1101
01:05:29.711 --> 01:05:31.270
ridiculous fucking antics.

1102
01:05:31.271 --> 01:05:36.271
He Poles this bag of shit most recently jams is sticking to Ryan O'Reilly's nuts

1103
01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:40.090
from behind. You can see in the replay,

1104
01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:45.250
he waits for the ref to be screened and assassinates O'Reilly's future kids.

1105
01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:50.350
He won't even get a fine fuck him. And every comment that routes forum,

1106
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:54.400
um, I understand that, I understand that. But you know,

1107
01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:58.090
Lucci choose to play for us and he was the king of spear and people in the taint

1108
01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:02.710
and the nuts. Um, I dunno,

1109
01:06:02.711 --> 01:06:03.550
I would just, you know,

1110
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.600
he also makes the league a lot of money and superstars have different rules.

1111
01:06:07.601 --> 01:06:09.670
That's just how it is. But I will tell you this,

1112
01:06:09.671 --> 01:06:14.671
that guy's backhander is fucking f has more power in speed to it than a lot of

1113
01:06:14.801 --> 01:06:19.570
guys. Wrist is in the league, the best backhand I've ever seen. And um,

1114
01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:25.100
you know, I have to give it up to greatness, but you know, he, yeah, he,

1115
01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.160
he used to whine a lot when he was younger.

1116
01:06:27.161 --> 01:06:31.550
I think half of it was his pouty lips, so it made it look even worse. But uh,

1117
01:06:31.570 --> 01:06:34.670
I don't know that guy's a stud man, but I understand not liking them. Um,

1118
01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:36.730
anyways, underrated bowling.

1119
01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:41.200
I recently found out I have a spine problem. I spine problems.

1120
01:06:41.201 --> 01:06:43.870
So I had to quit softball and flag football.

1121
01:06:44.290 --> 01:06:48.340
The good thing I was at high school. Uh, the,

1122
01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:50.370
I was good at I guess the sport.

1123
01:06:50.371 --> 01:06:54.090
I was good at a lot of people fucking up this week. The sport, the sports.

1124
01:06:54.091 --> 01:06:57.120
I was good at high school in high school,

1125
01:06:59.010 --> 01:07:00.810
but not that good starter kit.

1126
01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:04.110
You left out a couple of words and that thing buddy. Anyways,

1127
01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:08.040
my brother turned me on to bowling leagues and it's way better than I ever gave

1128
01:07:08.041 --> 01:07:12.300
it credit for. It's competitive. You win a little money and if you suck ass,

1129
01:07:12.301 --> 01:07:17.301
you can walk 10 feet to the bar and get lit slash win-win.

1130
01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:22.100
Thanks. Go Fuck Yourself. Absolutely. Bowling's the shit.

1131
01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:27.220
Um, but I will tell you, uh, I would definitely go to a chiropractor and, uh,

1132
01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:30.560
I would get a great misuse and maybe they can work out a lot of your back stuff

1133
01:07:30.561 --> 01:07:32.840
because, uh, you know,

1134
01:07:32.841 --> 01:07:35.950
if you're going to go from active shit to something inactive like that and add

1135
01:07:35.951 --> 01:07:39.230
alcohol, you're going to put on weight, which is not going to be good for you.

1136
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:41.000
Certainly your lower back.

1137
01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:44.450
You can be walking around like you're in your third trimester and you'd never

1138
01:07:44.451 --> 01:07:45.560
given birth. You know what I mean?

1139
01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:51.410
Terminal pregnancy of fucking booze and pizza.

1140
01:07:51.810 --> 01:07:56.600
All right, everybody, that is the, um, Fezza podcast for this week.

1141
01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:58.040
All right? Always listen to your gut.

1142
01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:03.140
Go fuck yourselves and I'll check in on you on Thursday. Gulf Bruins.

1143
01:08:03.141 --> 01:08:05.480
Go Celtics. Go fuck yourselves.
