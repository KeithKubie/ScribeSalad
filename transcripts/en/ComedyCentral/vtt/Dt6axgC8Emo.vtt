AFTER A CASE OF PNEUMONIA

TO COLLAPSE THIS PAST WEEKEND,

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.339
THE CONSPIRACY THEORISTS
OF TWITTER ARE CLAIMING

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:08.041
THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN
REPLACED WITH A BODY DOUBLE,

00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:11.645
WHICH THEY'VE PROVEN
USING A DEFUNCT VERSION OF

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:13.881
PHOTOSHOP

-(LAUGHTER)
-UH...

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.150
COINCIDENTALLY, THIS ALSO
HAPPENS TO BE A PICTURE

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:19.286
OF BILL CLINTON'S
WORST NIGHTMARE. UM...

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:21.955
NOW, COMEDIANS, ASSUMING
THE SAME PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:24.491
BARACK OBAMA IS A MUSLIM
FROM OUTER SPACE ARE CORRECT,

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:27.761
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE DUTIES
OF HILLARY'S BODY DOUBLE?

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:30.130
KATE WALSH.

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:32.366
ALSO BEATING DONALD TRUMP
IN A LANDSLIDE.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.867
-HARDWICK: ALL RIGHT.
-AH.

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:36.537
ALL RIGHT. POINTS FOR THAT.
JIM JEFFERIES.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.938
UH, STAYING HOME

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:39.973
WITH BILL'S BODY DOUBLE
WHILE HE'S AT THE STRIP CLUB.

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:41.341
-HARDWICK: ALL RIGHT, POINTS.
-OH.

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:43.477
MICHELLE BUTEAU.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.279
SHE'S HER SECRET SHOPPER.
SHE HAS TO GO TRY ON

00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:46.480
THE HIGH-WASTED PLEATED PANTS

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:48.015
TO MAKE SURE
THERE'S NO ♪ CAMEL TOE!

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:49.316
HARDWICK:
YEAH. PERFECT.

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:50.350
-CAMEL NO!
-HARDWICK: THAT'S IT.

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:51.652
-(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)
-VERY IMPORTANT.

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:53.153
-IT'S LIKE A CAMEL HOOF.
-HARDWICK: ALTHOUGH

00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:54.655
IT'S FINE
IF YOU SING IT LIKE THAT.

00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:57.991
-THEN IT'S ALL RIGHT.
♪ CAMEL TOE... -♪ TOE...

00:00:58.025 --> 00:00:59.326
♪ CAMEL TOE.

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:00.861
WALSH: EXCEPT IT MAKES IT SEEM
LIKE SOMETHING WE ALL

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:02.629
-ASPIRE TO.
-(LAUGHTER)

00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:05.599
-WHICH WE DO. -HARDWICK:
I'M WORKING ON IT, YOU KNOW.

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:06.967
-BRING IT BACK.
-I TUCK IT UP THERE.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.502
-I CROSS MY FINGERS, YEAH.
-THAT'S THE MOOSE KNUCKLE.

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:09.970
-MOOSE KNUCKLE.
-THAT'S WHAT I DO. NEXT...

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:12.105
NO, IT FEELS GOOD SOMETIMES.
IT'S LIKE I CALL IT A "FUDGIE."

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:13.407
-IT'S A FRONT WEDGIE.
-(LAUGHTER)

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.642
-IT SOUNDS DELICIOUS.
-FUDGIE.

00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:15.742
-FUDGIE.
