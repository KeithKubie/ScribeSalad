00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.410
If we unfold your brain, okay?

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.390
Which is generally painful, all right?

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.760
What we have to do is we have to sort
of take all this crinkled stuff and

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.770
then open it up and layer it.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.620
What you would see is something
that looks like this.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.550
And bare with me here, okay?

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.590
What's happened here is,
this here is your eyeball, right there.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.220
This back area is V1, they're showing,

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.070
this is on the inside,
this is on the outside.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.760
Here's your nose here.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.610
This is the,
these are your visual cortex areas here.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.417
And, if I were to peel it out, so take
this brain and flatten it out, okay?

00:00:37.417 --> 00:00:41.721
You would get a map that looks something
like this, so this big area here is V1,

00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:43.750
that's this area back in here.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.140
It wraps around.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.460
Then there's these other visual areas.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.170
Anything starting with
a v is a visual area.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.350
And then it goes all the way up and

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.920
here's that, so this is wrapping
around this whole body, right?

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.090
Here's that somatic sensory,
the feeling.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.240
Here's your motor cortex,
whole bunch of these other areas.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.500
Okay, this is what you would see.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.190
All right, but
of course this is just a drawing.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.310
Now I want to show you a picture
that's kind of cool and

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.900
kind of gross at the same time,
all right?

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.820
And here's what we're going to do,
and again, PETA folks, turn this off.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.970
All right.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.367
You take an animal, a living animal,
you immobilize its eye by giving

00:01:22.367 --> 00:01:27.875
an injection that prevents the eye
muscles from moving the eye, okay?

00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:30.515
You put up a flashing pattern
that's in like some rings,

00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:33.815
that alternate sort of bright and
dark spots, and you turn that on, but

00:01:33.815 --> 00:01:36.950
remember the eye can't move, so
the eye is fixed at the same point.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.545
You then inject essentially a type
of radioactive substance into

00:01:43.545 --> 00:01:50.583
the bloodstream that binds with sort
of the oxygenated red blood cells.

00:01:50.583 --> 00:01:57.140
And the more cells work,
the more oxygen they consume, okay?

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.360
So, you can measure, so this is like,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.640
one of the first ways of measuring the
activity of the blood cell, of, of the,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.790
of the brain cells by,
you have them do this work for a while,

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.940
while this radioactive tracer's
connected to red blood cells and oxygen.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.719
And what happens is the blood cells
that are doing a lot of work,

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.440
build up a lot of this
radioactive material.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.690
But of course, you have to get a picture
of that radioactive material, and

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.720
it's a very thin little bit of material,
in a very thin part of the brain.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.100
So what you have to do is what they
refer to as euthanize the animal.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.773
So the animal is, is, killed.

00:02:32.773 --> 00:02:39.120
You then, very carefully,
un-peel its brain.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.550
And you can take a radiograph,
you can actually measure, you know, you,

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.870
you can think of it as simply as
putting the brain, that brain tissue

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.860
next to a photographic plate, and
the radioactivity makes an image, okay?

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.960
There's a little more to it than that.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.906
When you do that,
you get this remarkable picture, and

00:02:54.906 --> 00:02:56.542
this one comes from 1988.

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:59.621
So, even though this is sort
of very fundamental work,

00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:01.333
it's not all that old, okay?

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:07.000
And here is what the animal
was looking at, okay?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.492
It's macaque.

00:03:08.492 --> 00:03:14.140
All right, so here you can see the, the
visual stimulus the animal's looking at.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.010
And here is the,
the picture of its brain.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.110
And what's so cool is that
this structure is preserved.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.070
This is what's referred to
as retinotopic mapping,

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.260
is preserved within the cortex, okay?

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.090
So, when you move a little bit in the
retina, you move a bit in the cortex.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.680
Now what's also really cool
is that it is not one-to-one,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.180
in terms of, how much cortical area
is devoted to how much of the retina?

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.440
In fact, the way it's drawn

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.960
out is sometimes referred
to as log polar, et cetera.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.710
And again, this is where we've
unfolded your, your visual field.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.300
And you see that like this little area,
1 2 3 4,

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.490
is looking at a lot
on the visual cortex.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.130
And this area out here,
okay, is much, much smaller.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.010
So you use more brain real estate for
that tiny little area in the middle

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.450
of your visual field, than you use
real estate for bigger areas out here.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.810
Which also, I mean, yes,

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.760
it makes sense, because that's where
all the processing needs to be.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.500
But the fact that you can actually find
this in the actual tissue is, you know,

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.850
in some sense remarkable.
