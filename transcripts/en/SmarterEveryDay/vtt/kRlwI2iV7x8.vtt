00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
Hey, it's me Destin welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.520
Here's the deal

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:09.540
Um, I'm in a super weird place in life right. I've got four kids. I'm an engineer. I've got this YouTube thing

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.509
I give talks, but my channel name is Smarter Every Day

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.850
I've been wanting to go back and get a PhD for years, but it's never felt right.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.570
It feels right now. I met a guy; his name is Dr. Kavan Hazeli. We click, we're on the same wavelength

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.160
I'm going to get a PhD and there's more to it than that.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.220
Dr. Hazeli applied for a National Science Foundation grant. Over a five-year period, he's got a million bucks

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.220
And he's asked me if I'd come work with him as a part of my PhD I could help work with

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:46.460
transfer students for research, and the research is incredible. Like that's the thing about the University of Alabama in Huntsville, right?

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.519
This is a school located right next to Marshall Space Flight Center. You got all these army organizations nearby. There is a ton of

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.139
Research that happens at UAH so here's the deal. In this video

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.600
I'm going to show you three research programs that are actively looking for

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.520
undergraduate transfer students. Topic number one

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.080
3D lattice structures printed by NASA. We're testing the strength. Check out. Dr. Hazeli's lab.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.460
I'm about to film Dr.Hazeli when he doesn't expect it

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.060
Dr. Hazeli
Hey

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.420
Okay, so so this is doctor Hazeli and he's in charge of the lab here

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.791
It's... what what do we call this? It's the

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.880
so what we do here basically, we are we are learning about material behavior, so we try to understand

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.660
how materials reacts with different environments could be impacts could be loading could be just cycling the materials and

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.720
The entire idea is learned from the material behavior and in for manufacturing

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.100
so Dr. Hazeli showed me this and he's like "are you interested in getting a PhD," and I said

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.000
Yes

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.120
Because what do you call this so we call them lattices structures. Basically we

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:02.519
remove the mass from materials by carefully printing them out so the idea behind them is make the matter as light yet strong

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.869
Enough to withstand a lot of pressure and lots of different environments

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.160
So we have this set of the topology which was given to us by NASA

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.100
Our ultimate goal is to optimize the topology

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.440
Which one is strongest?

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.000
For quasi-static compression test Octet Truss is the strongest one

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.860
What what about for impact, is it different?

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.319
We haven't tried here, so we wanted to do it today maybe

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.069
Is it possible that impact is different and quasi static

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.300
yes, possible
why?

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.820
Because the mechanisms by which material deform at highest strain rate is different than quasi-static

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.860
Okay, Andrew is about to do this first shot and it's a dodecahedron, right?

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.060
Yes, right

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.630
Dodecahedron. So the way this works is there's this large piston over there?

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.019
He pressurizes the piston, slams it into this long rod

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:53.638
This rod is going to impact the sample right there

00:02:53.639 --> 00:03:00.929
So you can get the input and output energy of this impact and you can see how much energy that particular sample absorbed

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.720
Three-two-one

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.129
Three-two-one

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.020
So it got squished

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.300
Is it like, perfectly flat?

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.040
Yes
Let me see

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.780
Wait nuh-uh

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.960
And it's hot!
It's hot?

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:28.300
Yeah, you cannot dissipate a lot of heat when deformation is very fast so that amount of pressure

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.972
stored in the material. This was very hot

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.760
So it's hot right now?
Yeah
Can I feel it? Oh, it sure is

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.320
It sure is so that was dodecahedron
right
What are you going to do next?

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.700
So the next is a rhombic dodecahedron

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.379
sweet? Let's do it. This is a big deal like everybody knows you can 3D print metals

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:49.688
But this problem is very difficult. For example stress equals force divided by area, but what is the cross-sectional area?

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:54.459
Do you treat it like a bolt material? Do you measure the cross-section of each individual leg on the topology?

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:59.049
What is the angle, how does it matter blah blah blah, there's a ton of stuff

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.979
We're measuring the overall strain of the material. We're acquitting that to a stress

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:10.629
This is the future of metal. Like we are figuring out how to work as humans with 3D printed

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.980
structures and is fantastic. So that's one option for research. Another one is Dr. Gabe Xu who's working at the plasma

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:23.880
Electrodynamic research lab. This is incredible stuff. 
Okay, so Dr. Xu is... just.. I mean I like walk in the room and

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.480
He's showing me an ion thruster. That's how it rolls here.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.189
The planned use is eventually, we want to develop it for small satellites, Cube sets

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.820
1U, maybe not 1U, say 3U or 9U  Cube Sats

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.380
A lot of them have orbit maneuvering capabilities

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.680
So what kind of ISP, would you see from something like this?  I mean I've played a little bit of Kerbal Space Program

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.280
[laughs] For very small ones like these, ISP, you may be looking at it. I'll say like a thousand seconds

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.860
Whoa

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.490
Those are startup transients
Startup transients?

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.840
Are you not entertained?! I walk in and the man's firing an ion thruster

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.400
And he's like, "oh whatever, just startup transient. It's not a big deal." What?! What's hap-

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.240
Dr. Xu just made it work like MacGyver, only ion propulsion. Is that pretty much what happened?

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.360
like MacGyver? [scoff] MacGyver you know

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.860
oh come on just embrace it

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.280
[laughs] So there is a electromag.. electromagnet wrapped around

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.980
the thruster, which, without it turned on [...?...]

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:31.100
Generate a magnetic field inside to trap the electrons to reduce the electron currents of the anode basically

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.980
So we're trying to control the amount of current that the anode is seeing

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.400
really? So is, is thrust directly proportional with current?

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.800
thrust is propor... [waves hands] kind of

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.129
It's is proportional to the acceleration voltage, and how many ions come out which you can sort of say is current?

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:52.680
Aaand it just died
[Laughs]

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.200
So to be clear dr. Xu is interested in getting research assistants at the undergrad level

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:04.159
Which would be what these students are doing here, so they can basically come work with you and develop ion propulsion

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.700
yeah, we've got different propulsion plasma projects

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.910
That's awesome

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.910
I know right? Is that awesome or what? Okay, the last lab. I've actually featured this on Smarter Every Day in the past

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.369
It's called the atom lab. They are researching

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.240
How butterfly wings work and they're doing it with these really

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:26.840
cool cameras that can calculate the position of a butterfly wing just by putting a reflector on his wing when he flies.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:32.720
okay, I'm in the atom lab with Dr. Kang and you get to do some pretty cool stuff with butterflies, right?

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.540
mm hmm
What do you do?

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:40.200
so we are interested in butterfly flights or in particular, the monarch butterflies

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:45.830
Because they are known for their migration distance, which is the longest among insects.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:53.680
no one really understands how they are able to make that distance which can be as long as

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.120
4,000 kilometers, so we are trying to understand their aerodynamic

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:04.380
mechanisms and to apply that to develop bio-inspired micro air vehicles

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:11.620
these cameras emit infrared rays which will reflect off of these markers and we can treat those markers

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.340
When we have a bunch of cameras, we can triangulate those markers to one position in space

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:23.980
You can study the motion or the kinematics of the butterfly and the way it flaps 
so this is the CFD

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:30.560
Simulation and here we are seeing the work the [?] activities that the wing is producing will interact

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:38.220
The fluid around it 
so is that is that a vortex that you're showing us?
That is, that is a vortex.  those are three-dimensional shapes of the vortex around the wing.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:46.800
So you're modeling vortex shedding 
yes
using computational fluid dynamics 
exactly
and retro-reflective

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:53.620
imagery from actual
yes
biological specimens
yes, yes, that's where we are going, towards that, yeah

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:59.860
And the whole point is to make a micro air vehicle or at least study the efficiency of

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:08.240
The butterfly so that we can understand how to apply that toward of micro air vehicle
The possibility of actually using it to do, cool things

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:13.800
That's rad!
This flapper is hooked up to a force transducer at the bottom and

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:20.960
this measures the force produced by the flapper and we can see the forces in our

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.240
software which is directly connected to the force transducer

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:30.640
[Mechanical flapping noises]

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.460
So lets do a...
I don't know why that's so exciting but it

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:38.740
It reminds me of those birds. You remember the old birds that you could wind up and throw?
yeah, and then they fly, yeah

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.340
You're trying to figure out by flapping

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.740
modes how a butterfly steers

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.180
I'm trying to get the communication between

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:56.020
The flapper and our transmitters
She's trying to develop our remote controller so that she can

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:02.160
control something like this 
are you doing this?
Yes
This looks like electrical engineering

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.140
[laughs] A Little bit 
Really? So, that's awesome!

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:11.460
What year are you 
I'm a junior
Really? Are you gonna be a grad student?

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.260
I am going to grad school, yes.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.360
So the whole, the whole point of this whole program Dr. Hazeli is

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.920
Undergrads can come in and they can work with you on the matrix stuff the squishing

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:28.340
Structure, designing the light structure material, for impact situation
And it's that's probably what I'm working on
Exactly

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:34.760
Yeah, and so and then there's also the ion propulsion and plasma. 
That's true and also we have the project about

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.040
supersonic wind tunnel with the Prof. Ligrani

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:38.960
 

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:45.320
and you have already discussed about Dr. Xu now
and also here in the atom lab

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:55.120
Students come to the program. They have opportunity to interact with the more senior students and also the professors or to get some hands-on experience

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:59.260
About the active research which is important for education and the government

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.740
This is a big deal, so if you want to check this out

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.360
You can go to -- you made a website, didn't you?   
We did.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.820
matrix.uah.edu
matrix.uah.edu
yes that's right

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.620
you can check it out, work with me work with Dr. Hazeli, work with butterfly wings

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:21.200
big deal!  I'm excited about this 
so go to the website matrix.uah.edu

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:26.280
and apply and and who is it for? It's for transfer students? 
for transfer students basically

00:10:26.299 --> 00:10:30.199
They get to pay for their education through the NSF money we have, and in return

00:10:30.199 --> 00:10:32.688
They need to improve their GPA and be involved with the research

00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:36.649
So it's not for free. You actually have to work hard and do a good job

00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:42.979
Well, they don't have to but if they need to stay in the program...
[laughs] so yeah you gotta work harder

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:51.640
So is that what you're thinking, Dr. Kang? Yeah, okay, cool anyway matrix.uah.edu. That's an NSF grant

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:56.740
That doctor Hazeli is leading up, and I'm working on so go check it out. Thanks

00:10:56.749 --> 00:10:59.360
bye
