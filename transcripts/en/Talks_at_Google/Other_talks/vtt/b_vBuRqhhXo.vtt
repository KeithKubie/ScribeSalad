ALEC FOSTER: Welcome to the
ClickHole talks at Google.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.350
My name is Alec
Foster, and I'm very

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.920
pleased to welcome our
honorable guests, the founding

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.940
editors of ClickHole, Jermaine
Affonso and Ben Berkley.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.760
Without any further ado,
let's give them a warm,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.810
Google-y here's to you.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.322
From us, here's to you.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.530
BEN BERKLEY: Hello.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.990
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Hello.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.490
Thank you.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.917
Thank you so much for that.

00:00:29.917 --> 00:00:31.000
We're thrilled to be here.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.182
We're so excited to
be here at Google.

00:00:33.182 --> 00:00:33.890
BEN BERKLEY: Yes.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.780
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
My name is Jermaine.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.821
BEN BERKLEY: And I'm Ben.

00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:38.850
JERMAINE AFFONSO: And we're the
founding editors of ClickHole,

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.620
like Alec said.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.370
And we're really just
so excited to be here.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.977
We're pumped.

00:00:42.977 --> 00:00:44.310
BEN BERKLEY: So, so, so excited.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.101
JERMAINE AFFONSO: We
wanted to put together

00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:49.310
something really special for
you guys and I hope we have.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.560
I think this is really good.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.559
BEN BERKLEY: I think so.

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:52.110
I think so.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.130
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
But just in case, we

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.252
set up a little e-mail
address for feedback.

00:01:00.252 --> 00:01:01.460
So this is just for you guys.

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:05.830
BEN BERKLEY: Yes,
please, please, please

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.280
take advantage of this great
service we're providing you.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.436
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
ClickHoleGoogleT

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:10.352
alkFeedback@yahoo.com.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.370
We just want you guys,
whatever thoughts you have,

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.310
whether it's positive, negative,
we'd love to hear any of it.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.340
You can send them
after this, fine.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.774
But I think in about
10, 15 minutes or so.

00:01:24.774 --> 00:01:26.190
I think we want
to check into that

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.342
and just look to see what
you guys are saying, what

00:01:28.342 --> 00:01:30.300
you guys are thinking,
sort of incorporate that

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.770
into the presentation.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.160
BEN BERKLEY: We
want to put together

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.442
the best possible
presentation for you.

00:01:33.442 --> 00:01:34.900
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
For you Googlers.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.450
BEN BERKLEY: Yes.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.960
JERMAINE AFFONSO: So yeah,
without further ado, I think--

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.830
BEN BERKLEY: Let's jump in.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:39.660
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
Jump right into this.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.490
So I don't know how many of
you guys are familiar with us,

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.500
or really--

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.250
BEN BERKLEY: I am.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.833
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
You know what we do.

00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:46.040
Great.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.180
So yeah, let's show some
of the stuff that we do.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.337
BEN BERKLEY: Yeah, so
here's a thing that we do.

00:01:50.337 --> 00:01:50.920
"Heartwarming!

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.430
This fraternity
brother came out as gay

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.179
and was still just as
much of an asshole."

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.462
[LAUGHTER] This is
such an inspiring tale.

00:01:57.462 --> 00:01:59.420
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Yeah,
he's still just so much

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.060
of a dickhead.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.330
And it's just nice.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.830
It's great.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.670
It's feel good story.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.960
BEN BERKLEY: He's so brave.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.740
And we've also done
things like, "Awesome!

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.470
This lucky school
got two proms."

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.190
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Two proms.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.500
What could be better?

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.150
Across the city from each other.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.000
It's great.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.550
So great.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.280
BEN BERKLEY: So much fun.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.290
Both sides had a lot of fun.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.280
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Yeah.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.821
BEN BERKLEY: And "5
Disney princesses

00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:22.067
reimagined as Caucasian."

00:02:22.067 --> 00:02:24.650
JERMAINE AFFONSO: We like to do
things little inspiring things

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.520
for little white girls
that are out there, just

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.075
to let them know that they
can do anything they want.

00:02:30.075 --> 00:02:31.200
BEN BERKLEY: You can do it.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.950
They got this.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.470
JERMAINE AFFONSO: So
that's what this is.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.886
BEN BERKLEY: But the real thing
we want to talk about here

00:02:35.886 --> 00:02:38.530
is I guess, at this point,
is why are we even here?

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.380
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
Yeah, why are we here?

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.421
BEN BERKLEY: There it is.

00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:42.842
The big question.

00:02:42.842 --> 00:02:44.550
JERMAINE AFFONSO: So
the way this started

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.300
actually was that we received
a letter in our office

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.525
from Google, which
was really exciting.

00:02:51.525 --> 00:02:52.400
BEN BERKLEY: Amazing.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.350
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
It was exciting.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.800
We got to see Google letterhead.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.220
We were pumped.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.310
And we actually have
the letter here just

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.915
to kind of reveal
the why exactly.

00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:01.790
We're going to read it
out loud for you guys.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.310
BEN BERKLEY: Also the letterhead
is gorgeous, you guys.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.960
It's so good.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.080
JERMAINE AFFONSO: I
love the new logo.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.770
BEN BERKLEY: Yes.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.853
JERMAINE AFFONSO: All
right, so here's the letter.

00:03:08.853 --> 00:03:12.090
"Dear ClickHole, This is
Sergey Brin and Larry Page,

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.996
two men who found Google.com.

00:03:14.996 --> 00:03:17.320
We are writing this letter
from our company's latest

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.610
innovation, a bicycle
that can write letters

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.840
and knows the date
the pope will die.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.750
Today we are writing you
because Google needs your help.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.000
Every day our researchers
are innovating technologies

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.700
as varied as little
doodles and automobiles

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.939
that despise humanity.

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:34.480
But even still,
there is one question

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.070
we've never been able to answer.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.040
Viral content.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.670
How?

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.170
For over 10 years, we locked
researchers in a room,

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.160
having them shriek things
at each other like, content

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.060
going viral.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.920
Why?

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.880
Please content viral.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.240
And the reason for viral
content, we need to know it.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.200
And we've yielded no results.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.670
Even now, Google has over
12 intelligent employees,

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.390
and we're all clueless.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.500
This is why we're inviting
you, ClickHole, to come

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.920
to our lavish California
prison to tell us

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.320
how and why viral content.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.410
We need this.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.340
We need you.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.770
Love, Sergey and Larry."

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.150
BEN BERKLEY: That's so exciting.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.790
JERMAINE AFFONSO: It
was really exciting.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:12.690
It warmed our hearts.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.061
And we decided to come out here
and answer the big question.

00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:16.769
BEN BERKLEY: Yes.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.852
JERMAINE AFFONSO: The
massive question of our age.

00:04:18.852 --> 00:04:21.820
BEN BERKLEY: Which
is how viral content?

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.320
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
How viral content?

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.020
BEN BERKLEY: How?

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.770
JERMAINE AFFONSO: And now we are
going to answer that for you.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.478
BEN BERKLEY: Yes.

00:04:26.478 --> 00:04:27.580
We've got some steps.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.570
We've figured it out.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:29.550
We know how to do it.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.175
You're going to know
how to do it, too.

00:04:31.175 --> 00:04:32.929
So the first step is
go on the internet.

00:04:32.929 --> 00:04:34.470
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
Go on the internet.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.090
BEN BERKLEY: Pretty simple.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.630
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
But the question

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.790
is, what is the internet?

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:37.480
BEN BERKLEY: How do you find it?

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.400
What does it look like?

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.290
JERMAINE AFFONSO: What
does it look like?

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.920
BEN BERKLEY: This
is the internet.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.610
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
That's the internet.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.070
BEN BERKLEY: OK, step two.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.137
Familiarize yourself with
what's popular online.

00:04:44.137 --> 00:04:45.720
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
You're going to want

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.267
to know the big sites, all
the big sites of today.

00:04:48.267 --> 00:04:50.350
BEN BERKLEY: But Jermaine,
what are the big sites?

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.400
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Well,
we did a lot of research.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.850
BEN BERKLEY: Yes.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.650
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Here are
the big sites to share.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.316
BEN BERKLEY: OK.

00:04:54.316 --> 00:04:56.292
We've got Amazon.

00:04:56.292 --> 00:04:57.500
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Amazon.com.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.087
Go on there.

00:04:58.087 --> 00:05:00.170
You can get anything you
want mailed right to you.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.420
BEN BERKLEY: Any time of day.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.840
It's incredible.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.340
All right.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.010
Facebook.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.134
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Facebook.

00:05:05.134 --> 00:05:07.545
Connect to your friends and
family, all day any day.

00:05:07.545 --> 00:05:08.420
BEN BERKLEY: So cool.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.830
So, so, so cool.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:11.507
Bing.

00:05:11.507 --> 00:05:12.840
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Bing is great.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:13.797
BEN BERKLEY: Yeah.

00:05:13.797 --> 00:05:15.880
JERMAINE AFFONSO: If you
have a question, anything

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.330
you want to look
up, you can connect

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.220
to all these other sites.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.761
It's amazing.

00:05:18.761 --> 00:05:21.200
BEN BERKLEY: The world
is at your fingertips.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.080
And there's another one, which--

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.705
JERMAINE AFFONSO: I
forgot what it was.

00:05:24.705 --> 00:05:25.214
What was it?

00:05:25.214 --> 00:05:26.130
BEN BERKLEY: LinkedIn.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.590
JERMAINE AFFONSO: LinkedIn.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.437
BEN BERKLEY: Wow.

00:05:28.437 --> 00:05:29.270
Those are the sites.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.610
Those the only big sites.

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.430
OK.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.100
Step three.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.650
Identifying internet content.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.100
So it can be really confusing
out there, the dividing line.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.380
What is internet content?

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.292
What is it maybe not?

00:05:40.292 --> 00:05:41.250
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Yeah.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.630
We put together a very
handy little rubric for you.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:44.450
BEN BERKLEY: Yes.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.724
Let's run this test.

00:05:45.724 --> 00:05:46.890
So is this internet content?

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:47.880
Jermaine, what do you think?

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.030
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
I don't think so.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.620
BEN BERKLEY: I think
you are correct.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.200
It is not.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.600
It is a fish on a plate.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.755
This right here?

00:05:53.755 --> 00:05:54.630
JERMAINE AFFONSO: No.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.671
BEN BERKLEY: Human woman.

00:05:55.671 --> 00:05:57.680
You are correct.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.305
How about this?

00:05:58.305 --> 00:05:59.471
JERMAINE AFFONSO: All right.

00:05:59.471 --> 00:06:01.380
Seven sloths who are
almost too adorable

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.800
to be thrown off the top
of the Chrysler Building.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.290
BEN BERKLEY: You got this.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.750
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
That's content.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:05.130
BEN BERKLEY: You got it.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.830
Yes.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:06.860
Yes.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:07.790
Content.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.400
So now you know it.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.240
That's huge.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.640
All right, step four.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.200
You're going to want to call
the internet's best friend,

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.990
see if he thinks the internet
will like the content

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.824
that you're sharing.

00:06:15.824 --> 00:06:18.240
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Well, who
is the internet's best friend?

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.359
Well, the internet's best
friend is actually Gabe.

00:06:20.359 --> 00:06:22.150
BEN BERKLEY: Yeah, so
they're best friends.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.660
They went to high
school together.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.840
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Yeah, they
were in the same prom group.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.690
BEN BERKLEY: Yeah, they
went to Benihana for dinner.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.445
Really great.

00:06:27.445 --> 00:06:28.590
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Yeah,
so you can contact him.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:29.950
BEN BERKLEY: Lifelong friends.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:30.730
Step five.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.050
You're going to want to
remember all those steps.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.175
If you don't remember the
steps, you can't do them.

00:06:35.175 --> 00:06:37.132
So let's recap.

00:06:37.132 --> 00:06:38.590
So step one was go
on the internet.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.500
Step two know what's
popular online.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.660
Step three is to identify
internet content.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.326
Step four is the
internet's best friend.

00:06:44.326 --> 00:06:46.620
And five, it's remember steps.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.410
That's a lot to remember.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.650
We know that.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.190
So we wanted to give you a
little device to remember this.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:58.090
So we pulled out the letters
you need to know, so right here.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.750
That will identify every step
pretty easily in your mind.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.860
Put them together.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.200
GHRA LARINDYNGS.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.160
Super easy.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:07.810
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
That may not look

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.643
like-- if you wanted
to make it even easier,

00:07:09.643 --> 00:07:12.570
let's mix those up into
something even easier.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.049
Garry Shandling.

00:07:14.049 --> 00:07:16.090
BEN BERKLEY: And when you
think Garry Shandling--

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:16.900
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
What do you think of?

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.150
Content going viral.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.734
BEN BERKLEY: Got it.

00:07:19.734 --> 00:07:20.900
JERMAINE AFFONSO: It's easy.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.440
BEN BERKLEY: That's it.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.380
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
It's real easy.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.130
BEN BERKLEY: Yeah.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:27.690
Now you can do--

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:28.870
JERMAINE AFFONSO: It.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:29.470
BEN BERKLEY: You did it.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:29.970
You got it.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:30.650
Viral content.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.280
You'd know how to make.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.650
JERMAINE AFFONSO: You
know how to do it.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.150
So give it up for yourselves.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.700
BEN BERKLEY: Yeah, let's--

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.580
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Give
it up for yourself.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.440
You know what else?

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.731
BEN BERKLEY: For viral content.

00:07:38.731 --> 00:07:41.210
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Give
it up for viral content.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.980
Because here's the
thing, at ClickHole

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.430
we believe, at the
end of the day,

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.980
that all content
deserves to go viral.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:47.930
All of it.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:48.310
BEN BERKLEY: Every single one.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.080
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Every
single piece of content.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:50.330
Let's hear it.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.200
Let's all say it together.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:51.790
Come on.

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:55.670
EVERYONE: All content
deserves to go viral.

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:56.670
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Again.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.420
EVERYONE: All the content
deserves to go viral.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.880
BEN BERKLEY: We're not talking
tens of thousands of pages.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.110
We're talking millions.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:07.330
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Every piece
of content deserves to go viral.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:08.470
BEN BERKLEY: All of it.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.261
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Here's
the thing, though.

00:08:10.261 --> 00:08:12.273
Unfortunately--
what just happened?

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:21.370
The thing is not all
content is able to go viral.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:27.290
In fact, every day
many pieces of content

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:31.350
fail to go viral for one reason
or another, many of them,

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:32.808
very young.

00:08:32.808 --> 00:08:33.679
BEN BERKLEY: So sad.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.179
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
And we've actually

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:37.820
put together a little
tribute to the content

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.919
we've lost, content
that didn't go viral.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:41.919
Let's do that right now.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:42.627
BEN BERKLEY: Yes.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.717
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:48.717 --> 00:08:51.212
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:34.686 --> 00:11:37.250
[END PLAYBACK]

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:40.824
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Well, I
think it's a good time to--

00:11:40.824 --> 00:11:41.740
BEN BERKLEY: Check in.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.250
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Check in
on some of your feedback.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.709
See what-- gotten
some e-mails, maybe.

00:11:46.709 --> 00:11:48.500
BEN BERKLEY: Let's see
what we've got here.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.330
Let's pop out of
this for a second.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:51.050
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Excuse us.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:52.220
BEN BERKLEY: Oh my goodness.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.010
We've got some e-mails here.

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.630
This is fantastic.

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:56.130
OK.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:57.240
Let's just see what we got.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.440
Let's start at the bottom, just
kind of read through these.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.720
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Yeah,
let's see what's going one.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.150
BEN BERKLEY: Is this too
[INAUDIBLE] for you guys?

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:04.730
The thing.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:06.980
How did I-- Let's do that.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:07.900
Cheated a little bit.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:08.495
OK.

00:12:08.495 --> 00:12:10.020
So this one's from
William Fivis.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.520
"Dear ClickHole, I
have one question

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.240
about your talk
at Google so far,

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.296
which is why aren't there
more pictures of sand?

00:12:15.296 --> 00:12:17.420
I was hoping to see at
least some pictures of sand.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.820
And so far I haven't seen any.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.015
Help me."

00:12:20.015 --> 00:12:20.890
JERMAINE AFFONSO: OK.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:21.340
BEN BERKLEY: Fair enough.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:21.860
JERMAINE AFFONSO: I
bet we can incorporate

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.776
some pictures of sand.

00:12:22.776 --> 00:12:24.211
BEN BERKLEY: Very good feedback.

00:12:24.211 --> 00:12:24.710
OK.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.330
Let's go back to the old inbox.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.140
OK.

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.390
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Jane Henley.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:30.570
What is this?

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.390
"Dear Phil, I don't know
how to tell you this,

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.042
but I don't love you anymore.

00:12:35.042 --> 00:12:36.750
I've had feelings for
your brother, Dave,

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.760
since I met him on
our wedding night.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.620
I can't keep
ignoring my feelings.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.667
We're in love, Phil.

00:12:41.667 --> 00:12:42.500
And I'm leaving you.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.744
Sincerely, Jane."

00:12:43.744 --> 00:12:44.910
BEN BERKLEY: She found love.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:45.980
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
She fell in love.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.146
BEN BERKLEY: Which is great.

00:12:47.146 --> 00:12:50.035
OK, good for her.

00:12:50.035 --> 00:12:51.321
Oh, what is this guy?

00:12:51.321 --> 00:12:52.570
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Who is this?

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:53.120
Steven Spielberg.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.120
BEN BERKLEY: Oh, my god.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.052
OK.

00:12:55.052 --> 00:12:57.557
"Dear ClickHole,
This talk is bad.

00:12:57.557 --> 00:12:59.890
The only thing worse than
this talk is working the child

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.990
actors, because they're
living scum who cannot act.

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.500
I'll never watch another
ClickHole talk again.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.580
And more importantly, I'll never
work with another child actor

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.200
again.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.810
Sincerely, Steven Spielberg."

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.030
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
Steven Spielberg, man.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:10.155
BEN BERKLEY: Living legend.

00:13:10.155 --> 00:13:10.960
That's huge.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.664
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
He's watching us.

00:13:12.664 --> 00:13:13.330
BEN BERKLEY: OK.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:14.735
Oh this doesn't look good.

00:13:14.735 --> 00:13:18.140
JERMAINE AFFONSO: It's
from a doctor, no?

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.290
"Dear Phil, We received
the results of your biopsy.

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:24.340
And we are sorry to report
that you have cancer.

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.060
It's inoperable.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.790
And we believe at the rate
it's currently spreading,

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.580
you have approximately
three months to live.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.250
I realize it's highly
unorthodox to e-mail

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:31.440
a patient the results
of their biopsies,

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.606
but we're making an exception
to the rule this time,

00:13:33.606 --> 00:13:35.210
because your cancer
is really bad.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:37.210
In fact, it's hard to
call what you have cancer,

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:39.520
because it's so, so much worse.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.730
Like it's really awful.

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:43.184
A nurse cried when
she saw your biopsy.

00:13:43.184 --> 00:13:44.850
She had to take the
rest of the day off.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:45.960
What I'm saying,
Phil, is that they're

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.960
going to name a state after you,
because your cancer is so bad.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.560
Jesus."

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.130
Anyway--

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:52.070
BEN BERKLEY: Oh boy.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:52.840
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Dr.
Henry Billingsley.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:53.690
BEN BERKLEY: Really
nice guy, though.

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:55.356
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
Seems like a nice man.

00:13:55.356 --> 00:13:58.189
BEN BERKLEY: OK, let's just
keep seeing what else we got.

00:13:58.189 --> 00:13:59.730
This looks positive.
"Dear ClickHole,

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.060
I haven't been
watching your talk.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.670
I just wanted to let you know
I'm a huge fan of e-mails.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:03.711
Can't get enough e-mails.

00:14:03.711 --> 00:14:04.410
Love them.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:05.740
Marsha Jennings"

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:06.610
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
I also like emails.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:07.651
BEN BERKLEY: I love them.

00:14:07.651 --> 00:14:08.380
They're great.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.170
Good.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:10.180
We're doing well.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.710
Got a lot of good feedback.

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:12.735
Ah, email confusion.

00:14:12.735 --> 00:14:13.480
Oh.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.790
OK.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.640
JERMAINE AFFONSO: "Dear
ClickHole, My name

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.380
is Phillip Henley.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.570
I recently discovered
that your email address,

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:23.877
ClickHoleGoogleT
alkFeedback@yahoo.com,

00:14:23.877 --> 00:14:26.085
is very similar to my email
address, ClickHoleGoogleT

00:14:26.085 --> 00:14:27.043
alkFeedback2@yahoo.com.

00:14:28.927 --> 00:14:30.760
And that you may be
getting some of my mail.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.482
Seems like a very easy mix up.

00:14:32.482 --> 00:14:34.565
Anyway, if you're getting
my emails, let me know."

00:14:34.565 --> 00:14:35.590
Oh, we can send them over.

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:36.390
BEN BERKLEY: That's great.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.380
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Seems
like such a nice guy.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:39.506
You should give him thanks.

00:14:39.506 --> 00:14:40.338
BEN BERKLEY: Thanks.

00:14:40.338 --> 00:14:41.060
That's sweet.

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:42.099
OK.

00:14:42.099 --> 00:14:42.640
I don't know.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.210
I guess we can see-- people
think this is not real.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:49.110
You are a hand idiot.

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.614
Sure.

00:14:49.614 --> 00:14:51.530
JERMAINE AFFONSO: I love
all of this feedback.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:53.100
People are so nice.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:57.587
BEN BERKLEY: Oh that's
actually-- that's not true.

00:14:57.587 --> 00:14:59.920
Yahoo email works a lot better
on our preferred browser,

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.420
Safari.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:04.710
What else?

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:05.210
Let me ask.

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:07.160
Oh, that's not good.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.830
Under the podium.

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:10.280
It looks pretty bolted down.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.800
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Yeah.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.550
Sorry, Tyler.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:15.490
I'm so sorry.

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:16.550
BEN BERKLEY: Thanks for
coming, though, Tyler.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:17.330
Thank you for coming.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:18.330
JERMAINE AFFONSO: It's
really nice to have you here.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.060
BEN BERKLEY: OK.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:23.284
Scares to go on the internet.

00:15:23.284 --> 00:15:24.200
I don't like this one.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.330
No.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.546
I don't know what it said.

00:15:27.546 --> 00:15:29.420
JERMAINE AFFONSO: That's
the same one, right?

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.450
BEN BERKLEY: Yeah, I just was
actually reading it this time.

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:32.260
I don't know.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:32.790
This is sad.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.120
This one's just sad.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.930
Come on, Derek.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.650
We don't need this, Derek.

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.100
Oh.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:40.790
This is great.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:41.960
That's actual feedback.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.300
That's really nice.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.600
Cool.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.435
Well, I feel like
we can incorporate

00:15:46.435 --> 00:15:47.560
some of this going forward.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.893
This is actually really helpful.

00:15:48.893 --> 00:15:50.790
Very, very helpful for us.

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:52.630
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
That we're an idiot.

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.710
BEN BERKLEY: Yeah,
we are and idiot.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:56.800
That's fine.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.820
All right.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:58.330
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
I think we want

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.510
to go a little bit into
the next section of this,

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:03.640
and take you guys sort of
actually behind the scenes

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:08.100
of ClickHole and what we do
and our writing process and all

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:08.685
that stuff.

00:16:08.685 --> 00:16:11.300
BEN BERKLEY: So let's
talk about how it's made.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.042
JERMAINE AFFONSO: How it's made.

00:16:13.042 --> 00:16:15.250
BEN BERKLEY: Well, we can
talk about just the numbers

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:17.700
of people behind it, such
as eight full time writers

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.240
and editors.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.570
We also have additional support
staff, freelance writers,

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:26.000
graphics, video,
people are incredible.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.170
It's a very, very
collaborative process.

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.970
A lot of hands touch it.

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.757
It's not something
where-- there is

00:16:31.757 --> 00:16:33.798
a reason there aren't by
lines on the site, which

00:16:33.798 --> 00:16:35.257
is because it is
that group effort.

00:16:35.257 --> 00:16:36.922
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
It's very cooperative.

00:16:36.922 --> 00:16:38.630
BEN BERKLEY: And these
are these people.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.338
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
Yeah, that's the group.

00:16:40.338 --> 00:16:43.060
And our new ClickHole hoodies
that are not available

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:43.560
anywhere.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:44.518
BEN BERKLEY: Don't ask.

00:16:44.518 --> 00:16:45.122
Don't ask.

00:16:45.122 --> 00:16:46.747
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
They're pretty sweet.

00:16:46.747 --> 00:16:47.980
BEN BERKLEY: Yeah.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.900
So everything starts
with a headline, which--

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.608
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
Yeah, so it's like it's

00:16:51.608 --> 00:16:54.320
kind of similar to the
onion process, which

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.005
is that every joke that you
see on ClickHole, that starts

00:16:57.005 --> 00:16:58.380
with the headline
of the article,

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.200
it always pitched in
the headline form.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.260
So you see "Amazing!

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.740
This school has two proms."

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.516
That's kind of what's
written on the page,

00:17:05.516 --> 00:17:07.599
and we kind of talk about
it and we go from there.

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:10.640
Basically every writer goes
home and comes up with anywhere

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.300
between 10 to 20 headlines,
come in with that,

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.869
they email them in, we put them
on a list, and we sit around,

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:22.530
kind of at this table, and talk
through the-- people will sort

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:26.170
of pitch an idea out loud, and
either it's met with resounding

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:29.610
silence and we all move
on, or we like it and laugh

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:32.399
and, as we're doing
in this lovely image--

00:17:32.399 --> 00:17:33.940
BEN BERKLEY: Two
people are laughing.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.898
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Everyone
else is dead silent.

00:17:39.467 --> 00:17:40.300
And then it goes in.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.216
It goes into the site.

00:17:41.216 --> 00:17:42.050
We brainstorm it.

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:43.990
We brainstorm the idea,
and then one writer

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:47.800
takes it home and actually
puts it all together

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.750
and writes the piece.

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:49.541
BEN BERKLEY: Right.

00:17:49.541 --> 00:17:52.640
And one thing that we should
talk about next is volume.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:57.270
So there are about 850 to a
1,000 ideas pitched every week,

00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:03.096
which ultimately maybe 50 or
so those end up going anywhere.

00:18:03.096 --> 00:18:06.540
So it's frustrating.

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:09.840
That's kind of the magic
of ClickHole, which

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.960
is stolen from the magic
of the onion, which that

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.500
is similar percentages at
work there, where you're just

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:21.710
pitching so many things and
then the quality standard is so

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:23.670
high that things
are being, jokes

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.110
are being knocked
down for reasons

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:28.550
that we can talk about later on.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:29.290
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Yeah,
we'll talk about it later.

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:30.876
But sometimes it's
very simple things,

00:18:30.876 --> 00:18:33.250
like it feels too similar to
something we've done before,

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:34.708
a lot of times it
feels too similar

00:18:34.708 --> 00:18:36.940
that someone has read on
Twitter, or something else.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:40.100
And then we kind of just want it
to feel original, fresh, and as

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:43.564
much from our own voice, and
unique, and the right level

00:18:43.564 --> 00:18:44.480
of funny, to be exact.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.146
BEN BERKLEY: A lot
of really funny stuff

00:18:46.146 --> 00:18:49.037
doesn't make it, which we can
show you some of that in a bit.

00:18:49.037 --> 00:18:50.120
So talking about graphics.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.690
I think this is something
that is underrated

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:56.450
on this site, which is we have
very talented graphic artist

00:18:56.450 --> 00:19:01.090
who build the world for us.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:03.270
I mean, the things they
can do on Photoshop,

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:04.521
I don't know how they're real.

00:19:04.521 --> 00:19:06.978
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Yeah, we ask
them to do some insane stuff

00:19:06.978 --> 00:19:08.770
and they always deliver
in amazing ways.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:10.610
BEN BERKLEY: Just taking
so many different elements

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:11.170
putting them together.

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:12.586
So we just have a
couple of before

00:19:12.586 --> 00:19:14.861
and afters to show
off here for them.

00:19:14.861 --> 00:19:16.860
JERMAINE AFFONSO: This
is the kindest man alive.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.004
Jon Hamm guarded this
nest of orphaned snake

00:19:19.004 --> 00:19:19.920
eggs for three months.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.503
Part of our Jon Hamm
character when he

00:19:21.503 --> 00:19:23.889
does good things for animals.

00:19:23.889 --> 00:19:25.930
So this is the first one,
at the beginning of it.

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:27.721
BEN BERKLEY: So this
is shot in our office,

00:19:27.721 --> 00:19:28.950
in the kitchen of our office.

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:33.770
And then all of a sudden,
that turns into that guy.

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:35.830
Taking another
look, we have meet

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:42.220
the puppetteer behind
blue ivy, which is funny.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.860
So this was just
shot in our studio.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:47.090
And then that all of a sudden
becomes that right there.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:54.000
JERMAINE AFFONSO: This Make
a Wish kid couldn't decide

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.208
what he wanted, so they slid
him along a deli counter

00:19:56.208 --> 00:19:58.670
like a sandwich.

00:19:58.670 --> 00:19:59.950
The headline.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:01.310
Let's look at the image.

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:05.610
This is Erik, one of our
graphics people with an actor.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:07.480
And then this was shot
also in our kitchen.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.540
And that became,
yeah, there you go.

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:17.110
BEN BERKLEY: Yep.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.630
So another wonderful thing
about working where we work

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.810
is the response to
everything we do.

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:26.180
It's fun.

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:27.210
It's crazy.

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:27.790
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
Like the onion,

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:29.550
like the satirical
thing, sometimes people

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:30.940
take things seriously.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:31.690
They take it real.

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:32.814
That's never the intention.

00:20:32.814 --> 00:20:34.810
The intention is always
that it's a joke.

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:35.630
But it happens.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:38.644
And people respond
in fantastic ways.

00:20:38.644 --> 00:20:40.060
So here are some
of the best ones.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:40.810
BEN BERKLEY: Yeah.

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:43.430
So here's a blog that
ran on ClickHole.

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:47.009
The ability to play as Bowser
has made our society more evil.

00:20:47.009 --> 00:20:48.550
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
So this entire blog

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.880
was just this guy
basically going insane,

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.860
like as soon as
Mario Kart came out

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:56.570
and people could play as
Bowser, society fell apart.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:59.850
The option to select the
unscrupulous Wario is vulgar,

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:03.520
but allowing gamers, often young
gamers, to select the wanton,

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.740
lascivious Koopa King
is beyond barbarous.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:07.830
It's outright criminal.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:09.336
So someone took this seriously.

00:21:09.336 --> 00:21:10.960
BEN BERKLEY: They
took it so seriously.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.793
I have the e-mail right
here, which is maybe

00:21:12.793 --> 00:21:17.340
the angriest e-mail I've ever
seen working at The Onion,

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:21.390
about Bowser, so
that's surprising.

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:24.620
And it's dreadfully long, so
we edited it a little bit,

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.390
but you'll get the gist.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:28.730
"When I was shown this
article about how Bowser

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:30.230
has been the problem
of our society

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:31.938
ever since he has
appeared in Mario Kart,

00:21:31.938 --> 00:21:34.720
I was appalled by the very
notion of this bullcrap.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.730
To blame one Nintendo
villain for being

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:38.470
playable in a game
of racing and say

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:41.230
he's the reason everything
bad is happening in the world

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:42.330
offends me.

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.650
People from the so-called
Bowser generation

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:47.830
said how it's affected them in
the blog, saying things like,

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:51.850
Bowser taught me that good is
stupid and that evil is good.

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:53.960
Or they said, my
little brother always

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.490
picks Bowser when we play Smash.

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.910
Something has died
inside him since that.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:02.800
Or even, 9/11 happened
just nine years later.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.910
Seriously?

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:05.340
What the hell?

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.740
This is not something
to say at all.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.750
How in the hell does
a villain character

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.610
get blamed for a
terrorist attack?

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:14.460
There are worse characters than
Bowser in the Nintendo company,

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.530
and even worse outside Nintendo.

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:18.920
To pin it on one
character is unacceptable.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.420
There have also
been plenty of games

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.590
where Bowser was a good
guy or worked with Mario

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:23.820
to defeat a greater enemy.

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.120
He's not all bad.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.279
But he isn't good either.

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:28.820
But this doesn't
mean he's bad enough

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.540
to wreak havoc by corrupting
children born after the game's

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.186
release.

00:22:32.186 --> 00:22:34.310
He's a great character who
is loved by many people,

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:36.540
and just get some kid would
play as him, doesn't he's

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.956
going to blow up a building
when he grows up, doesn't mean

00:22:38.956 --> 00:22:42.160
he's going to go mental and
set random civilians on fire,

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.960
it's just a kid playing a game.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.430
So that's why I'm not
asking, but demanding,

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:49.750
this article be removed
from the face of the planet

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.960
to prevent any uprising
this blogger creates

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.510
from his poorly written
story full of lies, possibly

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:56.531
hate, and useless information.

00:22:56.531 --> 00:22:57.530
Thank you for your time.

00:22:57.530 --> 00:22:59.030
And I will be
watching for that post

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:00.424
to be erased from mankind."

00:23:00.424 --> 00:23:01.840
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
Very passionate.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.460
BEN BERKLEY: Very
passionate about Bowser.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:05.667
Never saw that coming.

00:23:05.667 --> 00:23:07.250
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
This is another one.

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:09.180
Yeah, this is five tragedies.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:09.930
AUDIENCE: Classic.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:12.263
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Yeah, this
was a very popular article,

00:23:12.263 --> 00:23:15.490
and it had things like, in
the middle of Happy Gilmore,

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.680
Adam Sandler turned right to
the camera, and then said,

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:22.970
Princess Diana will die in three
years, and things like that.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:25.260
And it went online, people
thought it was a joke,

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.320
it was popular.

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.397
But then some people
took it seriously.

00:23:28.397 --> 00:23:29.980
And some people in
our comment section

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.746
would even say things like, I
actually remember that moment

00:23:32.746 --> 00:23:33.900
from Billy Madison.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.000
I totally remember that, when
it said the BP oil spill will

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.602
happen in five years.

00:23:38.602 --> 00:23:41.380
But what's also interesting
is that this article started

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:46.060
gaining traction among white
supremacists, who posted it

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:50.200
on their forums evidence
for why the Jews were

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.910
evil and magic, because they
could predict future tragedies.

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:56.347
And then if you look at
the form, it would go down

00:23:56.347 --> 00:23:58.180
and everyone would be
like, yeah, I knew it.

00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:59.100
I knew it.

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.849
I knew that Jew-- and
then just went down.

00:24:00.849 --> 00:24:02.410
And then eventually,
one person, sort

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:05.410
of a level-headed white
supremacist, came into the fray

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:08.110
and was like, guys,
guys, ClickHole

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:11.090
is a satire site made by
people who made The Onion.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:16.010
The Jews are evil, but not
because-- they're not magic.

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:18.606
This is a joke.

00:24:18.606 --> 00:24:19.480
That's what happened.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.539
This one.

00:24:20.539 --> 00:24:21.830
BEN BERKLEY: '90s kids rejoice.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:23.788
The spider eggs they used
to fill Beanie Babies

00:24:23.788 --> 00:24:27.020
are finally hatching.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:32.106
So this ClickHole's-- this
is a classic for us already.

00:24:32.106 --> 00:24:34.420
It's been our most viewed story.

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:36.340
It's a lot of fun.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:39.710
It's a very fun take on, a
very twisted take on nostalgia

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:44.220
and how that's played
out in the world.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.600
The feedback on this
may be a little sad.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.820
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Yeah, so we
got a call at our front desk

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:53.330
from an older woman,
presumably, who

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:56.930
was calling about her
son's Beanie Babies

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:58.890
and how she'd taken
them and wrapped them

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:01.280
all up in duct tape
and then she was

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.080
calling to find out
what else could she

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.020
do to prevent the
eggs from hatching?

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:07.490
She was desperate
to find out what

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:11.410
the next steps that she could
take, which was really sad.

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:15.750
BEN BERKLEY: But very
funny and great for us.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:20.510
So another one was this
campaign that happened with us.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:23.461
It was #StandForManny--
or #StandWithManny.

00:25:23.461 --> 00:25:24.210
I can't even read.

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:25.384
That's not good.

00:25:25.384 --> 00:25:27.550
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Yes, so
this was a little bit more

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:28.560
of a social media thing.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.530
It wasn't part of
a planned article.

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:32.650
We have a really great
social media guy, Dan,

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:35.210
who works on all of
our social media,

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.150
he engages with the
audience, basically,

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:39.210
and always is in the
comment section going

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:40.540
back and forth with people.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:44.170
And in this case, he's happened
to see someone tweet, just

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:47.270
a kid tweeted, this kind
of interesting thing.

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.280
"Fuck the school district
blocked ClickHole

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.319
and now I have nothing
to do in yearbook."

00:25:52.319 --> 00:25:54.110
And so he saw that and
was like, what if we

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:56.577
responded to this in a fun way?

00:25:56.577 --> 00:25:57.160
And so we did.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.035
This guy actually changed
his Twitter handle,

00:25:59.035 --> 00:26:01.417
which is going to be
a little confusing.

00:26:01.417 --> 00:26:02.500
This is what his original.

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.100
@mannyhodkin we will
not be silenced.

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.220
#StandWithManny.

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:07.960
So we tweeted that,
and it started

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.780
gaining all this traction
amongst our fans.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.870
People were tweeting at him,
tweeting at other people

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:15.730
to support #StandWithManny,
and someone

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:18.130
tweeted Barack Obama
should announce that he

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:19.479
supports #StandWithManny.

00:26:19.479 --> 00:26:21.770
I told everyone that if he
took God out of the schools,

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:24.960
ClickHole would be next.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.504
What happened to
the First Amendment?

00:26:26.504 --> 00:26:28.170
So this went on for
an entire afternoon.

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:29.620
It was kind of
just a fun example

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:33.881
of a very like impromptu thing
that kind of happened out

00:26:33.881 --> 00:26:36.130
of nowhere, like not even
planned in our writer's room

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:36.630
or anything.

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.930
It was just like a
really cool and fun way

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:40.160
to engage with our audience.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.670
BEN BERKLEY: Yes.

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:45.330
Let's move on to some favorites,
personal favorites for us,

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:47.460
which is a very hard task.

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.970
And we love them all.

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:53.837
So this is mine to start.

00:26:53.837 --> 00:26:54.670
Youngest child ever?

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:56.130
Jonas just three years old.

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:59.930
I just love how ClickHoles,
they don't understand the world.

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:02.290
It's just like a complete
lack of understanding

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:04.880
of what the world is and
how it actually functions.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.860
And it's delightful.

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.736
And then this.

00:27:08.736 --> 00:27:10.860
Share if you agree that
the ocean needs more places

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.280
for this guy to sit down.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.590
I just got to
support the whales.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:20.190
And then literally amazing, this
incredible dad loved his family

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:22.020
so much, he got eye
enlargement surgery

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.980
so he could look at them more.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:25.688
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
That's quite the image.

00:27:25.688 --> 00:27:29.022
BEN BERKLEY: It's so
twisted, but so beautiful.

00:27:29.022 --> 00:27:29.730
At the same time.

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:31.420
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
So excited about it.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:32.340
BEN BERKLEY: Jermaine,
your favorites.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:32.760
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Yeah.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:33.642
So I love this quiz.

00:27:33.642 --> 00:27:34.850
Someone mentioned it earlier.

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.090
Which one of my
garbage sons are you?

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:38.510
Which is really fun.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:40.250
And it's really
hard to articulate

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:42.750
why this is so great, unless
you've played through the quiz.

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.770
So you should really do that.

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:47.180
It's great.

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.630
Disgusting ISIS just
released a two-star review

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:52.160
of "In the Aeroplane
Over the Sea."

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.770
I also love this.

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:55.770
This is also like our
continuing ISIS character,

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:58.120
where they continually
try to take down America

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.387
and increasingly,
in the same ways,

00:28:00.387 --> 00:28:01.970
they recently put
up with the Pentagon

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:04.110
on eBay earlier this week.

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:05.140
Those bastards at ISIS.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:05.740
BEN BERKLEY: Monsters.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.281
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
This is one I love.

00:28:07.281 --> 00:28:10.481
Oh, also, I put on a
fat suit to understand

00:28:10.481 --> 00:28:11.730
what it's like to be your mom.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:16.880
I wanted to know what
it felt like when

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:20.470
your mom put on a raincoat
and went outside and everyone

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:21.025
yelled taxi.

00:28:21.025 --> 00:28:22.030
I love this one.

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:26.280
It's really a great way to
get the your mom joke back

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.842
in the site in a fun
and interesting way.

00:28:28.842 --> 00:28:29.800
BEN BERKLEY: It's time.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:30.740
It needs to get back.

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:32.739
All right, we're just
going to talk very briefly

00:28:32.739 --> 00:28:35.250
about the writers'
room, which we'll

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:36.500
do a Q and A in just a minute.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.844
And we can talk more
about that if you

00:28:37.844 --> 00:28:39.635
have some more specific
questions, but just

00:28:39.635 --> 00:28:42.770
kind of talking about how
certain things can come and go

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:43.990
in that room.

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:45.750
So we're going to
talk just a very,

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:48.534
very-- like if you wonder
where we get ideas,

00:28:48.534 --> 00:28:50.700
this is going to be a very,
very underwhelming story

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:51.280
potentially.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.730
But there is this video.

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:55.697
Whoa, one door, two people.

00:28:55.697 --> 00:28:58.030
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Which is
basically exactly what it is.

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:00.460
It's a door opens, two
people come out of it,

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:02.960
inspiring music
swells and plays.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:07.147
But the way this happened was
we were in our writer's room,

00:29:07.147 --> 00:29:08.980
literally about to start
a meeting, and then

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.930
Ben and our editorial
assistant Fran,

00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:14.642
they both just walked
into a door together.

00:29:14.642 --> 00:29:16.850
Like he walked in and then
she walked in right after.

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.910
And someone just said,
whoa, one door, two people.

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:23.030
And we were like, yes, yes.

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:24.560
We're going to put
it on the site.

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.440
Then two weeks later,
that was a video.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.690
BEN BERKLEY: Inspiring stuff.

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:32.860
And then there's this headline.

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:34.990
This sting ray misbehaved,
so we dropped it

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:36.856
through a paper shredder.

00:29:36.856 --> 00:29:38.480
JERMAINE AFFONSO: So
people really love

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.440
this idea in our writer's room.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.670
And I would say,
on average, I think

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:44.420
if people really
like an idea, it's

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:48.989
brainstormed maybe for, I don't
know, two to five minutes.

00:29:48.989 --> 00:29:51.530
If it's something we're excited
about, then we put it online.

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:54.310
We sat around talking
about this for 30 minutes.

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:55.390
I swear to God.

00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:58.420
And the brainstorms just got
increasingly more insane.

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.690
And we always have someone
typing at all times,

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:01.898
getting all these notes down.

00:30:01.898 --> 00:30:04.650
We have a little excerpt
from some of this.

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:06.304
He stung one of our friends.

00:30:06.304 --> 00:30:07.470
What were we supposed to do?

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:08.770
What a jackass.

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:11.720
It just went on for a long time.

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.190
BEN BERKLEY: If
stingrays aren't supposed

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:18.130
to go in paper shredders, then
how come they slide right down?

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:19.750
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
You can't spank him.

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:22.540
Their butt is a weapon.

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.240
You can only put him
through a shredder.

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.981
So this went on for 30 minutes.

00:30:25.981 --> 00:30:28.105
I think at the end of it
all, we ended up deciding,

00:30:28.105 --> 00:30:28.850
you know what?

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:30.550
This is really better
as a one liner.

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:31.990
We don't really need an article.

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:34.281
So it went on this section
of the site called next week

00:30:34.281 --> 00:30:37.590
on ClickHole, which is
just pure one liners that

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:39.600
never have articles with them.

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.142
BEN BERKLEY: So
that was a waste,

00:30:41.142 --> 00:30:42.600
except for in this
moment where you

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.564
get to know that this happened.

00:30:45.564 --> 00:30:47.480
So now we're going to
actually talk about what

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.790
ClickHole has taught us.

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:51.962
We've been at this now
for-- we launched last June.

00:30:51.962 --> 00:30:53.920
So we have a little bit
of time under our belts

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.040
and have just kind
of seen the way

00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:01.480
the world has taken this
site, and just kind of-- we're

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.930
reflecting.

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:04.830
It's a beautiful moment for us.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:07.630
So the first lesson is just
that the internet is weird.

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:09.770
Obviously a very good
lesson to take away.

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:10.100
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Yeah.

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.475
And I think to us
what that means

00:31:11.475 --> 00:31:13.774
is that the internet
is very absurd.

00:31:13.774 --> 00:31:15.690
Well, the Internet is
like the weirdest thing.

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:18.315
It exists, and so we all use it
all the time, which is strange.

00:31:18.315 --> 00:31:21.955
But the big thing
is that I think

00:31:21.955 --> 00:31:23.830
one of the big concerns
when we were starting

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:25.859
the site both internally
and externally

00:31:25.859 --> 00:31:28.400
is how are you going to make
fun of something that is already

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.679
a self parody of itself
and things that are already

00:31:30.679 --> 00:31:32.220
so weird, how are
you going to do it?

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.330
And I think with
the way we responded

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:39.620
to that was by honing in on this
very weird and surreal voice,

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.940
very specific tone,
and kind of trying

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:45.625
to out weird the internet
as much as possible.

00:31:45.625 --> 00:31:46.750
BEN BERKLEY: Which is hard.

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:48.375
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
Which is really hard,

00:31:48.375 --> 00:31:49.760
and it's a continuing process.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.480
But I think that's kind of
one of our big takeaways.

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.730
BEN BERKLEY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:54.910
Another one is that the
internet is also good.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:03.090
I think that was something where
we came into this not really

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:05.810
sure what would happen
when you interact

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:07.740
with the internet in
any way, because we've

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.414
both-- before
ClickHole happened,

00:32:09.414 --> 00:32:10.830
we were just working
at The Onion.

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:13.840
And The Onion is this monolith.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:17.150
The character of The Onion is
to never acknowledge our readers

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:19.650
in any positive way.

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:21.680
And so for us, it was OK.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.720
Now we have to do a
site where you probably

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.380
need to interact with people.

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:27.350
And then what you know
about the internet

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:32.360
is that the commenting
society is not a society.

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.730
It's anarchy.

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:36.440
And then we did ClickHole.

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.869
And we were surprised
that it's actually great.

00:32:38.869 --> 00:32:40.410
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
We really cool fans

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:44.300
that support jokes and don't
make it about themselves,

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:47.520
make it about the greater
thing, the greater joke,

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.640
and so we had
here's to you, which

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.014
was a very popular article.

00:32:51.014 --> 00:32:52.430
Basically we said
this is the most

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:53.660
viral image on the internet.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:54.620
We have a winner.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:55.730
It's most viral thing.

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:56.190
It's everywhere.

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:57.148
Everyone is sharing it.

00:32:57.148 --> 00:32:59.380
And so our fans
seemingly went out

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:02.370
of their way to try and
actually make it the most shared

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:03.760
image on the internet.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.210
Like every ClickHole
article will

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:06.710
have, in the Facebook
comments, will

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:09.090
have some iteration
of that here's to you

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:13.060
guy and some weird things
that happened to him.

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:14.700
Then in sort of a
different [? way ?],

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.840
we recently did
a campaign, let's

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:20.760
give Bob Dylan a nice
bed, which the idea

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.730
was to do a crowdfunding thing.

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:26.150
And you know Bob Dylan
is a music legend.

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:27.594
He's given us so many things.

00:33:27.594 --> 00:33:29.510
So we thought we ought
to give something back.

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:31.930
And what better than
a Sleep Number bed?

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:35.830
So we raised-- what
was it? $1,500?

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:36.626
More than that?

00:33:36.626 --> 00:33:38.610
To buy him a bed.

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:39.720
Everyone chipped in.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.470
And we had like a
reward system for people

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:43.500
who gave a certain amount.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.690
And we bought the bed,
we confirmed delivery

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:48.409
to Columbia Records, we haven't
confirmed that he has it.

00:33:48.409 --> 00:33:49.450
BEN BERKLEY: But we know.

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:50.283
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:56.550
BEN BERKLEY: There's no other
way that this could be going.

00:33:56.550 --> 00:34:02.196
A third lesson is that
stupid is also good.

00:34:02.196 --> 00:34:03.820
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
These are two things.

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:06.480
This one we did right
when the site launched.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.739
I believed the headline was,
we left a stick of butter

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:10.900
out in room temperature
and you won't

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:12.510
believe what happens next.

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:16.739
Then you've got a five hour
video of butter melting.

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:20.017
Then on top of that, we
did it again a year later.

00:34:20.017 --> 00:34:22.100
We left a stick of butter
out at room temperature,

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:25.330
you won't believe what happens
next, patriotic edition.

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:27.075
Flag in the thing.

00:34:27.075 --> 00:34:29.380
So we like stupid things.

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:31.380
BEN BERKLEY: Yeah,
and so I kind of

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:35.389
like to think of it that
we have the only work

00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:38.659
environment, maybe in the
world, where you can directly

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:41.380
say to your coworkers when
they present an idea to you,

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:44.880
that is so dumb, and that
is a genuine compliment.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:48.520
That's like the best
thing you can say to them.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.989
So that's weird.

00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:52.221
Another lesson is, oh, my god.

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:57.250
William.

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:59.270
William wanted those
pictures of sand.

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:01.030
See, we listened to
your feedback, people.

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.530
Come on.

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:02.988
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
Incorporate that.

00:35:02.988 --> 00:35:04.880
BEN BERKLEY: Look at that.

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.310
There's another one.

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:08.800
That's pretty good.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.110
You're welcome, William.

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:13.712
Lesson four is that
everything is amazing.

00:35:13.712 --> 00:35:14.670
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Yeah.

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:16.760
And I think that's a big
part of ClickHole's voice

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:20.630
is that we are excited
constantly about everything

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:22.240
in the world ever.

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.780
It doesn't matter
if it's good or bad.

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.790
Whatever it is ClickHole
will say it's amazing,

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:28.800
it's wow, great, cool.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.370
And I think that's a parody
of like [INAUDIBLE] culture.

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:35.510
Everything that you see on the
internet is the biggest thing.

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:36.840
It is the best thing.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:37.630
This is the thing.

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:39.380
You've got to click on this.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:42.150
And so that's kind of the
voice that we're going for.

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:45.480
And I think it's reflected
not just in our headlines,

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.260
but in the videos and
articles we make ourselves.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.609
Like this was Hamm
goes up an escalator.

00:35:50.609 --> 00:35:52.650
The headline was, yes,
Hamm goes up an escalator.

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:55.512
And the way it's shot is
inspiring and beautifully

00:35:55.512 --> 00:35:56.970
shows that Hamm
going up the thing.

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:58.590
And there's a
pause in the music.

00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:02.100
And it really
influences every aspect

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:04.192
of the site, that
enthusiasm and positivity.

00:36:04.192 --> 00:36:06.150
BEN BERKLEY: Yeah, and
comedically also sets it

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:07.060
aside a little bit.

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:09.700
Because most comedy
is coming from a place

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:12.670
that's a little bit less happy.

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:15.090
So it's one of the
few entities out there

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:17.040
that's really doing
something where

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.510
it's this hyperpositive comedy.

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:22.994
So that's kind of been
really nice to watch,

00:36:22.994 --> 00:36:24.660
and also very nice
for the people who've

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.034
worked on The
Onion who are like,

00:36:26.034 --> 00:36:30.820
oh, we can do something
a little bit more happy.

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:32.770
Which is great.

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:36.750
And then we have other
things, which is you guys.

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:37.880
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Yes.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:42.121
So we want to open up for Q and
A and just get any questions.

00:36:42.121 --> 00:36:43.746
BEN BERKLEY: Oh,
nobody's brave enough.

00:36:43.746 --> 00:36:44.718
OK.

00:36:44.718 --> 00:36:47.520
AUDIENCE: Hey, would you
say that this audience

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:51.476
is a representative sample
of your demographic?

00:36:51.476 --> 00:36:53.476
BEN BERKLEY: We haven't
looked at you guys once.

00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:57.759
Probably.

00:36:57.759 --> 00:36:58.550
AUDIENCE: Probably?

00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:59.250
OK.

00:36:59.250 --> 00:36:59.750
JERMAINE AFFONSO: I think so.

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:00.847
People who work at Google.

00:37:00.847 --> 00:37:02.430
BEN BERKLEY: Yeah,
I think exclusively

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:05.630
people who work at
Google are on our site.

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:09.667
And that's fine, because
there are so many of you.

00:37:09.667 --> 00:37:11.500
AUDIENCE: For the people
on VC, the question

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.330
is have any celebrities
taken the quotes

00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:15.940
that you publish on social media
seriously attributed to them?

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.314
BEN BERKLEY: I forgot there
are other people watching us.

00:37:18.314 --> 00:37:18.980
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.271
BEN BERKLEY: I don't like that.

00:37:20.271 --> 00:37:22.090
That's not good.

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:23.980
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
Yeah, actually.

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:25.390
BEN BERKLEY: Yeah.

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:26.749
Oh, Russell Crowe.

00:37:26.749 --> 00:37:28.790
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Russell
Crowe got really upset.

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:30.730
I wish I remembered what
we even said about him.

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:32.040
BEN BERKLEY: Yeah, I
called rubbish though.

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:32.730
AUDIENCE: Anderson Cooper?

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.400
BEN BERKLEY:
Anderson Cooper, yes.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.100
Anderson Cooper.

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.433
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Oh yeah,
Anderson Cooper got confused.

00:37:37.433 --> 00:37:39.560
We attributed him
to speaking at-- we

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.270
said that he gave a speech
at New York University,

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:47.130
and then he said like,
this really weird thing

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:50.379
about golfing to students, and
then hitting a hole in one.

00:37:50.379 --> 00:37:52.670
And then he was like, where
did you guys get this from?

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:54.800
I didn't speak at NYU.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.679
We've had a couple
of moments like that.

00:37:56.679 --> 00:37:58.970
AUDIENCE: Question is what's
the process for developing

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:00.950
quote like ClickVentures?

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:04.580
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Oh man,
those take a really long time.

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:07.480
Basically what happens is
a writer is set aside, goes

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.780
goes away for what?

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:10.020
Like a week?

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.745
And just sort of puts
one of them together.

00:38:12.745 --> 00:38:14.870
They're all pitched in the
room like the headlines,

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:20.080
so we had like one about
winning a cooking competition.

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:21.290
And we all liked the idea.

00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:22.330
We're like, OK, cool.

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:25.612
And then the writer just kind
of goes off, makes half of it,

00:38:25.612 --> 00:38:27.070
kind of starts
putting it together,

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:30.030
and then they come in
halfway through the week,

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:32.620
and check in with us, and
we all kind of look at it,

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:35.090
play through it,
offer suggestions.

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:39.790
It's cool because because
it's so elaborate and so hard

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:42.120
to put together, the
writers like really

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:46.230
get a full say in what it is and
not much editing happens to it,

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:48.689
not much else is touched, so
it's kind of the writer owns--

00:38:48.689 --> 00:38:50.896
BEN BERKLEY: Do we need to
clarify what ClickVentures

00:38:50.896 --> 00:38:51.870
are by the way?

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:52.250
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Maybe.

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:53.070
BEN BERKLEY: Maybe.

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:55.020
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
ClickVentures are--

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.650
we have this new feature,
which is just like a choose

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:00.340
your own adventure game
that you can sort of play

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.650
through various scenarios.

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:04.834
Our first one was, can
you survive a bear attack?

00:39:04.834 --> 00:39:06.250
And so you're
presented with that.

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:07.674
And you have to go through it.

00:39:07.674 --> 00:39:09.590
BEN BERKLEY: The answer
is almost entirely no.

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:11.381
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Most
of the time it's no.

00:39:11.381 --> 00:39:13.240
Yeah.

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:16.792
AUDIENCE: So instead of trying
to out BuzzFeed BuzzFeed, which

00:39:16.792 --> 00:39:18.750
when I heard there is
like going to be a satire

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:21.640
site of ClickBait, I was like,
how could they satire it?

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:24.450
You went with the more
surreal direction.

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:28.410
What do you see as like, apart
from surrealism, the sort

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:31.270
[INAUDIBLE] stuff,
what is the strength

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:32.820
and voice of CllickHole?

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.570
And what if BuzzFeed
starts going surreal?

00:39:36.384 --> 00:39:38.800
BEN BERKLEY: I mean, well, I
would just say for one thing,

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.700
we're never really that
concerned about other sites.

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:46.980
I think once we launched it,
we were moored by ClickBait

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:49.172
and that was a good
entry point for us.

00:39:49.172 --> 00:39:50.630
And then from there,
it just turned

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:55.360
into-- anything that's
on the internet, that's

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.411
our playground.

00:39:56.411 --> 00:39:56.910
Go for it.

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:59.880
Let's make the best
comedy site that there is.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:03.780
So we're not necessarily
looking at if they do,

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:06.620
which I guess they've
started doing more comedy.

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:07.330
OK.

00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:09.140
That's fine.

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.885
And then, voice?

00:40:10.885 --> 00:40:11.510
Rank the voice?

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:15.140
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Yeah, I mean
I think it's just so specific

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:18.952
and it's a specific
voice that we have that

00:40:18.952 --> 00:40:20.660
even if someone else
tried to be absurd--

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:23.950
and there are lots on the
internet that are absurd.

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:25.570
I just think that
our way of doing it

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:29.880
is so specific that there's kind
of room for everyone, in a way.

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.490
And I think people
like our stuff,

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:34.200
and will keep coming
in and checking

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.720
in on our voice and our
specific absurdities

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.360
and our little obsessions.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.000
BEN BERKLEY: And to clarify,
also just our big concern

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.410
at the outset was, how do
you satirize a moving target?

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:50.610
Because everything
that new media--

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:52.900
I hate that phrase--
if that's what

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:54.960
we're parodying with
ClickHole, like that's

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.831
changing all the time.

00:40:56.831 --> 00:40:58.830
So we wanted to make sure
it was flexible enough

00:40:58.830 --> 00:41:00.650
where we do actually sit down.

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:02.150
And you know,
yesterday we were just

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:03.660
talking like, OK, what's next?

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:06.900
And that's we
don't have answers.

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:10.556
But I think that's kind of
the challenge of ClickHole

00:41:10.556 --> 00:41:11.930
is that it's always
going to need

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:13.532
to be changing over the years.

00:41:13.532 --> 00:41:15.740
JERMAINE AFFONSO: And what's
really cool about-- just

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:17.906
to tie this in really fast
to the ClickVenture thing

00:41:17.906 --> 00:41:21.350
is that ClickVentures for us,
the choose your own adventure

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:21.850
things.

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:24.010
They don't really
exist elsewhere.

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:25.760
And so when we
first launched, we

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.990
did lists, which
are online, quizzes,

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:31.230
which are online, articles,
which obviously exist,

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:34.190
and then we kind of grew
into this other thing, which

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:35.330
wasn't parodying anything.

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:37.010
It was just getting
the voice that we

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:39.710
established through our
parody into this new form.

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:42.530
And so in that way, I think
we can keep doing that

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:45.450
and keep branching
out and growing

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:49.309
the legs of the monster kind
of in new and exciting ways.

00:41:49.309 --> 00:41:50.850
AUDIENCE: Question
is about sponsored

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:53.740
content and how the
sponsorships come into place.

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:55.890
BEN BERKLEY: I mean,
that's something where

00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:56.780
specifically us.

00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:00.490
We get to approached
by our business staff,

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:06.030
so the exact mechanics
of that can be hazy.

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:09.390
I mean, they send out
requests for proposals

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:14.150
to every site that exists
that has certain traffic

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:15.760
benchmarks and all
of that and has

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.350
the right demographic
and all that,

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:20.239
so I think we get a
lot of different things

00:42:20.239 --> 00:42:22.530
from a lot of different
companies coming through always

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:25.750
looking to do this and that.

00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:28.079
And [? Ford ?] worked for us.

00:42:28.079 --> 00:42:30.370
JERMAINE AFFONSO: I wish the
answer to that was cooler.

00:42:30.370 --> 00:42:32.380
BEN BERKLEY: Yeah,
that would be great.

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:34.340
I'm so sorry.

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:37.050
AUDIENCE: Question is are
there any off limits topics?

00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:40.160
JERMAINE AFFONSO: I think
coming from The Onion,

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:44.110
we've learned that you can
make fun of any subject.

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:46.140
It's all about picking
the right target.

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:49.370
And if you're picking the right
target, anything can happen.

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:51.360
You can make fun of any subject.

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:54.930
And in fact, you should make
fun of anything and everything.

00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:57.470
As long as it's always
about punching up and not

00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:58.380
punching down.

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:01.030
You never want to make
fun of the victim.

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:05.180
And that's really just
a big onion lesson

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:07.320
that we've carried
through to ClickHole.

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:10.870
So I would say no overall.

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:14.054
If anything, subjects
tend to be more avoided

00:43:14.054 --> 00:43:16.220
because they're like, is
this going to be too hacky?

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:19.010
Is everyone kind of just
making this joke on Twitter?

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:21.950
If we can't find a
unique enough take on it.

00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:24.990
But never because of the
dangerous or offending people

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:25.860
thing.

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:26.520
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.100
So I only see your
posts on Facebook,

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:29.530
because I don't have
accounts anywhere else.

00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:31.988
Have you guys discovered which
time works best for posting?

00:43:33.544 --> 00:43:34.960
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
There are people

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:39.500
that work on that constantly and
are always thinking about it.

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:41.880
I don't know.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:45.050
I also don't know if there's
really a science to that

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:46.320
still, even right now.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:51.370
It just seems it really
varies even week from week.

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:54.780
BEN BERKLEY: We're reinventing
the wheel every day,

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:56.710
which is hard.

00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:59.504
But yeah, I don't think
there's necessarily any--

00:43:59.504 --> 00:44:01.170
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
Yeah, it's really hard

00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:03.774
to say when would be the
best time to post something.

00:44:03.774 --> 00:44:05.690
I mean, I guess if you
try to think about when

00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:06.960
people are at work and--

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:07.330
BEN BERKLEY: Sure.

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:09.663
JERMAINE AFFONSO: And we don't
do anything new at night,

00:44:09.663 --> 00:44:13.350
so it's very obvious things
like that, but other than that,

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:14.097
not really.

00:44:14.097 --> 00:44:15.680
BEN BERKLEY: It's
also something great

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:18.320
we'll spread, regardless
of when it goes out.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.380
Like you can put something
out on a Friday night,

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:22.715
and if it's hitting the
right marks, then it's gone.

00:44:22.715 --> 00:44:24.590
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Yeah,
that's actually here.

00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:27.940
BEN BERKLEY: Like gone in the
way, like out into the world.

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.480
AUDIENCE: Kind of
dovetailing off

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:33.280
that question about what
time is best to post,

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.850
when creating headlines, is
that totally a human process?

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:38.540
Or do you guys have
any kind of formulas

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:39.840
for what's going to hit?

00:44:42.117 --> 00:44:44.450
JERMAINE AFFONSO: You know--
what were you going to say?

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:45.440
BEN BERKLEY: I was
going to say we always

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:48.300
talk it's impossible to ever
guess what's going to do.

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:50.860
JERMAINE AFFONSO: It's really
hard to tell what will do well.

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:53.990
I mean, I think probably
individually-- the thing

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:55.580
is, when you're
pitching these ideas,

00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:58.530
you a lot of times don't even
think about the audience, which

00:44:58.530 --> 00:44:59.897
is crazy to think about.

00:44:59.897 --> 00:45:01.980
But you're kind of thinking
about the other people

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.584
in the room, because you're
pitching towards-- obviously

00:45:04.584 --> 00:45:06.250
eventually it'll go
out to the audience.

00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:09.130
But before it gets there, it
has to get through eight writers

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:10.346
who have to like your idea.

00:45:10.346 --> 00:45:11.970
So I think a lot of
times people really

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:14.560
try to think about the
eight people in the room.

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.400
Are they going to like it?

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.620
Or how can I make them like it?

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:20.370
They've heard
[? different ?] [? types ?],

00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:23.990
so that's kind of
the first barrier.

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:26.290
In terms of what will
be popular and what

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:30.681
will not be popular online,
that's just really hard

00:45:30.681 --> 00:45:31.180
to tell.

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:33.980
I mean I feel like recently
we had a headline about Taylor

00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:39.640
Swift, about how she was getting
revenge on a fan for a tweet

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:42.109
over like three years, and
then she-- but like that one,

00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:43.150
you kind of have an idea.

00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:45.760
Like people like to talk about
her, maybe it'd be popular,

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:48.980
but even then,
it's hard to tell.

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:50.840
ALEC FOSTER: Question
is the horror

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:53.370
of the site a conscious part
of the editorial process?

00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:59.150
JERMAINE AFFONSO: I don't
know how-- we really

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:03.180
don't sit around, I think, and
dissect things that far down,

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:07.530
but I think that certain
influences are recurring

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:12.340
among certain writer's
work, and then

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:14.470
we just gravitate
towards them naturally.

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:16.345
So it's a very like
natural process,

00:46:16.345 --> 00:46:17.470
as opposed to sitting down.

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:18.930
Because I feel
like if we sat down

00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:20.200
and we were like, at
the very beginning,

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.491
we want to make a site that's
absurd, but also twisted,

00:46:22.491 --> 00:46:25.440
and also a little dark, and then
try to put it all in a formula,

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.650
I think it would feel
contrived and not good.

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:30.750
I think letting it
evolve naturally,

00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:33.190
letting the writer's
sensibilities kind of flow

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:39.100
together, and all blend
into one beautiful thing,

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:41.440
I think that's kind of
what has influenced all

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.220
of those elements of the site.

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:43.960
BEN BERKLEY: There's
also going to be

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:46.330
a bit of an inherent darkness
just based on the fact

00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:49.850
that this was born out of The
Onion, where that's something

00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:54.530
where most of the
staff-- they were either

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:58.680
on staff on The Onion, or
contributing for a while

00:46:58.680 --> 00:46:59.180
before.

00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:04.610
So there's a draw that draws
a certain sensibility, which

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:07.050
has some of those
elements, and I

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:12.682
think that also kind
of informs the site.

00:47:12.682 --> 00:47:14.890
AUDIENCE: Do you guys share
any ideas with The Onion?

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:17.380
Like if you have something
that feels like a good idea,

00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:19.292
but just isn't
totally right for--

00:47:19.292 --> 00:47:21.750
JERMAINE AFFONSO: I think a
lot of maybe individual writers

00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:22.375
will do things.

00:47:22.375 --> 00:47:25.264
Like sometimes an Onion-er
will email an idea over to me,

00:47:25.264 --> 00:47:27.180
and it's like, yeah,
let's put it on our list.

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:29.720
And I think writers
will pitch things

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:31.060
back and forth like that.

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:33.064
I don't know if there's
been any official like,

00:47:33.064 --> 00:47:34.730
oh, this would be
perfect for ClickHole.

00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:36.438
BEN BERKLEY: I don't
think it's happened.

00:47:36.438 --> 00:47:38.870
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Yeah, like
a staff-to-staff turnaround

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:41.328
of an idea, but individuals
will pitch ideas back and forth

00:47:41.328 --> 00:47:42.900
all the time for sure.

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:44.050
BEN BERKLEY: Yeah.

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:47.340
Yeah, they're all
pitched as videos.

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:51.580
In fact, we have specific
meetings and other-- Fridays,

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:54.010
for example, that's the day
where you pitch video ideas.

00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:58.310
And they can-- has everyone that
started out as like an article

00:47:58.310 --> 00:47:59.485
and then went video?

00:47:59.485 --> 00:48:00.860
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
Sometimes we'll

00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:05.160
have something that is pitched
as a headline, not a video.

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:07.700
Like I think we had beautiful.

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:10.270
This woman took a picture of
herself every day for a week.

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:11.937
BEN BERKLEY: Sure.

00:48:11.937 --> 00:48:13.770
JERMAINE AFFONSO: So
it was just like a grid

00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:14.780
of photos of a woman.

00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:15.456
And then we were
like, you know what

00:48:15.456 --> 00:48:17.530
would be amazing is
if on YouTube, people

00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:20.160
will put them all together with
a nice music bed underneath?

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:20.951
And so we did that.

00:48:20.951 --> 00:48:24.422
We made like a two second video
of her just like-- in one week.

00:48:24.422 --> 00:48:25.880
So something like
that will happen.

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:31.025
We'll add an element to a--
we'll add a video element

00:48:31.025 --> 00:48:32.770
to articles sometimes.

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:34.520
AUDIENCE: Any anecdotes
about the Pharaohs

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:38.761
of Silicon Valley, which is
the ClickHole Google visit.

00:48:38.761 --> 00:48:40.760
JERMAINE AFFONSO: I'm
trying to think if there's

00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:42.057
anything fun in the process.

00:48:42.057 --> 00:48:43.890
I mean the process was
probably very boring.

00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:48.040
It was written by one of our
writers, Adam Levine, who

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:50.920
sat down and put
that thing together.

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.300
And it's great.

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:54.750
Yeah, it was very, very simple.

00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:55.730
He pitched the idea.

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:59.960
It was like, what if we went
inside Google for a long form

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:01.170
journalism piece?

00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:04.690
And he wrote the first
draft and it was great.

00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:05.960
I mean, he's a good writer.

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:07.447
So not really much of a funny.

00:49:07.447 --> 00:49:09.780
BEN BERKLEY: Most of our
anecdotes are someone sat down,

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.290
then it happened.

00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:14.120
JERMAINE AFFONSO: Sat
down and typed an article.

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:15.010
Yes.

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:16.600
Yes.

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.460
100%, yes.

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:20.430
Please talk to us after.

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:20.930
Stay around.

00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:22.530
BEN BERKLEY: We had
an idea to do this.

00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:24.155
That was what we were
going to try to--

00:49:25.332 --> 00:49:26.790
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
This presentation

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:28.040
where we try to convince you--

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:30.420
BEN BERKLEY: That was
all about convincing us.

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:31.100
Yeah.

00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:31.380
OK.

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:33.171
JERMAINE AFFONSO: That
would be incredible.

00:49:33.171 --> 00:49:34.857
BEN BERKLEY: That
would be great.

00:49:34.857 --> 00:49:37.190
ALEC FOSTER: The question is
what are some headlines you

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:41.390
like that didn't
make it on the site?

00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:42.550
BEN BERKLEY: This is hard.

00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:45.915
Well, it's harder for you,
because if you don't like it,

00:49:45.915 --> 00:49:47.610
it doesn't go on site.

00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:49.540
So I don't know if there
is anything that you

00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:51.020
feel like you've missed out on.

00:49:56.369 --> 00:49:57.910
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
There've been times

00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:59.980
where we've rejected
an idea in the room,

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:03.600
and then later we're just
like let's just put it up,

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:06.030
which is not bad at all.

00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:09.280
But I really can't think
of an idea that-- I mean,

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:12.130
if something is
rejected from the room,

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:14.667
it's oftentimes because
it's wrong headed,

00:50:14.667 --> 00:50:15.750
and it doesn't feel right.

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:17.700
One idea that I
just thought of-- I

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:19.940
don't even know if I
like it, but it was

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:23.460
a video that was incredible.

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:28.260
Watch this plus-sized model
demolish a Subway sub.

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:32.940
It was like, we knew we
shouldn't do that idea.

00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:34.290
So like that's an idea.

00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:36.345
I mean, but I don't think
we should have done it.

00:50:36.345 --> 00:50:37.220
BEN BERKLEY: I agree.

00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:45.500
The question is more if-- it's
just a lot of other sites,

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.810
a lot of more potentially
respectable sites

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:52.170
are using more ClickBait
tactics in their headlines,

00:50:52.170 --> 00:50:53.910
and if that's just
kind of the way

00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:55.960
it's going to be
essentially is the question.

00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:58.890
And yeah, probably.

00:50:58.890 --> 00:51:01.270
Which we're from
being experts on this.

00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:03.480
We're just guys who sit
in a room in Chicago

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.040
and make things.

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:08.160
But I think also
what we also see

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:12.250
every day is that everybody
is jockeying for attention.

00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:15.210
That's like the only
capital on the internet.

00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:18.380
And that's why everything has to
be the most amazing thing that

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:19.479
exists.

00:51:19.479 --> 00:51:21.770
And it's more amazing than
the last thing that was also

00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:23.810
the most amazing thing.

00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:28.180
So I think probably that's
just going to be the way it is.

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:30.430
JERMAINE AFFONSO: It's
fascinating to watch, for sure.

00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:32.250
BEN BERKLEY: Yes, it is.

00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:34.944
AUDIENCE: How important is
YouTube to your strategy?

00:51:34.944 --> 00:51:36.860
And what do you think
YouTube could do better?

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:37.850
BEN BERKLEY: What is that?

00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:39.266
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
What did he say?

00:51:39.266 --> 00:51:41.635
AUDIENCE: Just in general.

00:51:41.635 --> 00:51:45.595
BEN BERKLEY: God, I'm so good.

00:51:45.595 --> 00:51:47.125
That's not fair.

00:51:47.125 --> 00:51:47.750
It's important.

00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:54.020
JERMAINE AFFONSO:
What do you think?

00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:55.480
BEN BERKLEY: We use it.

00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:57.670
JERMAINE AFFONSO: What do
we use it for, actually?

00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:59.900
I guess we put
videos up on YouTube.

00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:01.710
People watch them there.

00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:04.168
ALEC FOSTER: The question is
where do you get your pitches.

00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:07.750
BEN BERKLEY: I mean, I
think we just kind of just

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:12.340
go and try to find them
from some maddening place.

00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:13.960
I don't know where
ideas come from.

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:17.242
It's so weird and amorphous.

00:52:17.242 --> 00:52:18.950
The thing is I think
a lot of times ideas

00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:21.116
will get shot down in the
room because they feel too

00:52:21.116 --> 00:52:24.600
like a one for one
parody of something,

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:26.350
which is hard to explain
without examples.

00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:31.304
But yeah, I think you can look
online to a certain degree

00:52:31.304 --> 00:52:32.720
and look at what
people are doing.

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.470
But after a certain
point, it becomes kind

00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:35.620
of repetitive and constant.

00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:37.900
And if you want your
ideas to stand out

00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:40.690
from another writer's
list who's also

00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:44.280
drawing from the
same online pool,

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:47.550
you kind of have to just go
into a room in silence and sort

00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:51.500
of just think as weird as
possible, which is amazingly

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:53.966
fun and also frustrating.

00:52:53.966 --> 00:52:55.340
ALEC FOSTER: All
right, everyone.

00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:56.548
We're just about out of time.

00:52:56.548 --> 00:52:59.050
So before we leave,
please give a big

00:52:59.050 --> 00:53:01.920
thank you to our amazing guests.
