00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.130
- Tom Angel says this.

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.097
"Neil, do you agree with Carl
Sagan and most US voters that"

00:00:05.097 --> 00:00:06.045
- Yes.

00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:06.940
Yes, next.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.801
(audience and Chuck laugh)

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:14.780
- Hey Tom, there's your answer, Tom.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.780
There's your answer.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.180
- Yeah, there's very
little I disagree with.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.810
- And guess what, I'm gonna
go ahead and say that,

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:20.820
but quite frankly

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.653
- No, now we gotta know.

00:00:21.653 --> 00:00:22.539
I wanna know.

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:23.372
- Now you wanna know?

00:00:23.372 --> 00:00:24.205
- Yes.

00:00:24.205 --> 00:00:25.540
- "...That marijuana should be legalized."

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.259
- Oh. (laughing)

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:28.426
- [Both] Whoa!

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.329
- Yeah.

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.053
- Whoa.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.470
So, I think if you really analyze it

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.810
relative to other things that are legal,

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.410
there's no reason for it to ever to have

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.390
been made illegal in the system of laws.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.550
- That is extremely rational,
which I expect from you,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.080
and you're absolutely right.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.890
- I mean, alcohol is legal and it can mess

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.900
you up way more than smoking a few jays.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.733
- That's absolute.

00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:58.566
- Yeah, so.

00:00:58.566 --> 00:00:59.640
- Boy, let me tell you something.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.146
I can tell you have never
smoked weed in your life.

00:01:02.146 --> 00:01:04.070
(audience laughs)

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.900
'Cause you just like,
"smoking a few jays."

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.445
(audience laughs)

00:01:08.445 --> 00:01:11.255
It was like a ABC after-school special.

00:01:11.255 --> 00:01:12.760
(Neil laughs)

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.905
- Are you smoking a few jays there?

00:01:14.905 --> 00:01:15.760
(audience laughter)

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.520
- The last time I was
like in a cloud of it,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.843
that's how people spoke, so yeah.

00:01:20.843 --> 00:01:22.560
- Okay, right on.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.405
Okay.

00:01:23.405 --> 00:01:27.040
Alright, let's do one
quick one because you

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.978
- Oh, by the way, by the way,

00:01:27.978 --> 00:01:31.140
it's just funny because if you

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.740
wanna sound like Mickey Mouse,

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.100
you inhale the helium
from a helium balloon.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.933
- Okay.

00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:37.940
- But the way you do that
is you untie the knot

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:38.811
and you go

00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:39.644
(sucking in air)

00:01:39.644 --> 00:01:40.600
(laughing)

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.663
like you're sharing one, it's just.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.890
It's just, it's so

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.550
- Right exactly, in other words,

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.060
when kids are at a party,
sharing helium balloons,

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.352
they might as well be smoking some jays.

00:01:53.352 --> 00:01:56.935
(audience and Chuck laughs)
