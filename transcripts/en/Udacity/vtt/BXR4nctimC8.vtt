00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.840
As a quick quiz, suppose we have a direct trie, and

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.380
the first level is 16 bits, the next level is eight

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.980
bits, and the third level is the final eight bits. In

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.490
the worst case, how many accesses would be required per lookup?
