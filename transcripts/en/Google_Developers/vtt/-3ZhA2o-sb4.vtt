00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
FITZ: Hi, we're back.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.290
I'm Fitz.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:02.980
BEN: And I'm Ben.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.090
And we're here to talk with
some women about women in

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.130
technology and entrepreneurship.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:08.890
FITZ: And entrepreneurship.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.810
And here on my left--
what's your name?

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.370
MARY HIMINKOOL: Hi, I'm
Mary Himinkool.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.440
FITZ: Mary, and you
work at Google.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.580
Tell me a little bit about
what you do at Google.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.270
MARY HIMINKOOL: Sure, thanks.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.610
So I'm head of global
entrepreneurship at Google.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.720
Our team looks after all of
Google's programs and

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.960
partnerships to support
start-ups and entrepreneurs

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.950
around the world.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.930
FITZ: So that sounds like
you do a lot of travel.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:26.640
MARY HIMINKOOL: I do.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.430
I love the airplane.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.250
FITZ: So what are some of the
biggest challenges that you

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.860
see as part of that job?

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.880
MARY HIMINKOOL: There are
a lot of opportunities.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.240
You know, our mission
is to impact

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.720
start-ups across the world.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.180
We have projects live
in 25 countries.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.460
We work both with global
partners like Start-Up Weekend

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.260
and local partners in different
cities to try to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.270
help further the ecosystem.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.050
FITZ: And so you work in a
lot of different areas.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.460
I'd like to ask you to start
out by telling us, what are

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.540
some of the things you
do in women and

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.450
technology inside of Google?

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.300
MARY HIMINKOOL: Sure,
absolutely.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.870
So within Google we really
believe in fostering a culture

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.300
of diversity and inclusion where
we welcome different

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.960
perspectives.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.880
We try to operate as a global
company but really focus on

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.240
cultivating local culture
within the company.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.370
And so, we have actually
an employee resource

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.740
group, Women at Google.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.050
And there are 4,000 women across
Google globally, 30

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.990
different chapters.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.750
And we focus on fostering
innovation within Google and

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.540
then externally outreach into
the community as well.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.240
FITZ: So it's building these
communities of women at Google

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.420
to help each other out and
to support each other?

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.810
MARY HIMINKOOL: To support one
another and then to also

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.490
promote diversity among our user
base and to interact with

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.450
the community as well.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.140
So for example, we're working
right now with Women 2.0.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.600
Who--

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.290
Sepi is here with us today.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.590
And they're a great
partner of ours.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.030
BEN: Well, let's introduce--

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.540
I'm sorry.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.060
You said your name is Sepi?

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.940
SEPI NASIRI: Sepi Nasiri, yes.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:43.935
BEN: Great.

00:01:43.935 --> 00:01:45.670
And what do you do?

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.680
SEPI NASIRI: I head the global
partnership, sponsorships, and

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.960
events at Women 2.0 so I
do everything offline.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.260
BEN: Great.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.560
Can you tell us a little bit
more about Women 2.0?

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.860
SEPI NASIRI: Sure.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.390
Our mission is to help increase
the number of female

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.400
founders in technology
start-ups.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.820
And we do that online by telling
their stories and

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.330
offline by creating networking
events and conferences where

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.860
they can get together and talk
about entrepreneurship.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.140
BEN: Great.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.575
So then the two of you have
worked together in the past

00:02:13.575 --> 00:02:14.920
then, I assume, at
some of these?

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.170
MARY HIMINKOOL: We have
and we're working

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.570
together today as well.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.780
BEN: Wonderful.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.525
So I'm curious about your
experience as an entrepreneur,

00:02:20.525 --> 00:02:24.340
a female entrepreneur, how
did you get into this

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.000
in the first place?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.180
What's the background
story here?

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.020
SEPI NASIRI: The ingredients is,
you have amazing parents

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.170
who are entrepreneurs as well.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.000
So when I grew up I was able
to experience what it looks

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.760
like to be an entrepreneur.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.070
Particularly my dad.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.900
And now, everyone in the family
is entrepreneurs as

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.510
well, my brothers.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.420
And today when you look at
it, you're able to study

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.170
entrepreneurship.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.300
So things have changed
quite a bit.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.400
I started in the publishing
and then came to Silicon

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.820
Valley, fell in love
with technology,

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.360
and here I am today.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.040
FITZ: Mary, how did you
get to where you are?

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.780
I mean, is there a class for
studying to become head of

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.640
global entrepreneurship
at Google?

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.600
MARY HIMINKOOL: Definitiely
a lesson on the job.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.620
But I studied at Stanford
here in Silicon Valley.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.360
I actually studied sociology
and international policy.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.850
I was very fascinated by
opportunities, particularly in

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.050
emerging markets.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.840
I spent some time in Bangkok
there interning at the United

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.750
Nations and never thought
I would actually work in

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.540
technology, but then became
fascinated with technology as

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.730
that platform for actually
furthering development and

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.470
growing the internet economies
as a way towards development.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.990
And so now it's a privilege
and pleasure to work with

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.560
entrepreneurs, developers,
students, globally and try to

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.010
help further and empower the
next generation to be

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.590
successful.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.360
FITZ: So that's a good segue
to the next thing I want to

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.320
talk to you about.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.700
So you're working with these
entrepreneurs globally and

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.610
everything.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.620
Tell me a little bit about how
Google is working with these

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.980
external entrepreneurs,
including Sepi and Women 2.0.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.340
MARY HIMINKOOL: Sure.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.010
So track one for us is really
focused on partnerships.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.100
So how do we work with
like-minded organizations to

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.400
help further their footprint
and help them scale?

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.940
So Women 2.0, for
example, has a

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.790
fantastic series of programs.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.500
We like to figure out how to
incorporate Google tools and

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.330
technologies where they
can be helpful.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.480
The second bucket is really
focused around Google programs

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.640
where we can impact the
community directly.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.580
So we have a pilot we're running
right now in India, in

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.079
Singapore, and in Russia
called Women

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.440
Entrepreneurs on the Web.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.420
And it's basically a program to
get thousands of women on

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.510
the web using 10 Google products
to help build and

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.230
scale and market their
businesses.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.170
We've been really fascinated
by this.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.500
It's basically those products.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.900
But then women come together at
Google offices to receive

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.130
hands on training.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.990
And what we've found is that
connecting people online is

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.270
certainly very important.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.540
But connecting them offline and
building that community is

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.800
equally as important.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.540
FITZ: Getting that high
bandwidth face to face

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.300
conversation.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.840
MARY HIMINKOOL: Absolutely.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.700
And having access to that
infrastructure of mentors who

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.160
have failed and succeeded
and can help

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.570
you is really critical.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:51.720
FITZ: Maybe you guys want to
talk a little bit about

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.600
mentors, actually.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.470
BEN: I was going to say, yeah.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.470
So what sort of challenges have
you encountered as an

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.630
entrepreneur and have you had
mentors to work with?

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.440
SEPI NASIRI: As a female
entrepreneur, I think it's

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.680
quite hard to find mentors.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.740
Not just because there aren't
enough female entrepreneurs

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.450
who could be mentors but
sometimes they don't feel that

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.330
they have enough time or they
have the skill set.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.480
And so I think one way Google
is helping out with that is

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.600
recognizing who in their own
community or within Google is

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.830
able to give those mentorships
to the outside as well.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.770
BEN: And so does Women 2.0, does
that actually help create

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:35.280
mentorships?

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.320
Have you experienced
that or seen that

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.720
happen within the group?

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.110
SEPI NASIRI: Sure.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.440
One way we initiate that is with
our networking event, our

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.140
Founder Fridays, where we put
some spotlight on female

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.830
entrepreneurs who are successful
and with expressing

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.510
how they have become
successful.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.790
Today they are actually
mentoring the next generation

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.510
of entrepreneurs.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:57.060
BEN: That's great.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.720
Go ahead.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.360
FITZ: I want to come back
to one thing you said.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.910
You were talking about bringing
women entrepreneurs

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.120
into Google offices and helping
them use Google Apps

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.440
and that sort of thing
to make this happen.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.530
Can you give me example?

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.040
What's something that's really
helpful that we're teaching

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.010
folks and entrepreneurs
out there?

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.430
MARY HIMINKOOL: Sure.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.920
So we have a program called
Get Your Business Online.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.430
So in India, for example,
that would be Get

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.460
India Business Online.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.885
So this is for folks in small
businesses who do not yet have

00:06:20.885 --> 00:06:23.610
a web presence, which is a huge
challenge for a lot of

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:24.270
small businesses.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.110
So getting them set up with a
free website, free domain

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.400
hosting for a year.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.700
And then plugging into other
Google tools, Google+ for

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.260
example, leveraging the maps and
geo tools and making sure

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.800
they're able to get
up and running

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.576
as quickly as possible.

00:06:37.576 --> 00:06:37.920
FITZ: OK.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.030
And if they want to use other
tools that aren't

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:40.870
Google, it's still OK.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.870
But we're helping them use
the Google tools, right?

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:43.490
MARY HIMINKOOL: Absolutely.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.680
We want to promote businesses
getting online, leveraging the

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.060
best tools on the internet.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.970
We obviously have more

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.240
expertise on our own platforms.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.120
But one amazing tool has been
Google+ Hangouts, actually.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.800
And the ability to connect and
do remote mentorship, for

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.240
example, over Google+ Hangouts
with entrepreneurs from around

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.950
the world has been really
exciting to watch.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.560
FITZ: You said there wasn't
a class for how

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.190
to do what you do.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.160
It was a lot of on
the job training.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.930
Did you have mentors that
were helpful for you?

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:08.800
MARY HIMINKOOL: Most
definitely.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.970
Lifelong mentors throughout.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.650
Starting with, certainly, my
parents and a lot of amazing

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.420
entrepreneurs and colleagues
along the way.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.060
Everybody has been
super helpful.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.550
So I think that's the one
critical thing is don't be

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.570
afraid to ask questions, ask
for help, ask for advice.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.670
All inputs are welcome.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.670
And then you kind of pick
and glean your lessons.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.680
FITZ: And I think Ben and I
both have had some very

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.440
influential mentors
in our time.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.130
BEN: I think it's interesting
that both of you have had

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:36.400
parents as mentors to sort
of get into this area.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.010
One of the things I was talking
about earlier with you

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.020
was just the issue of being a
woman in this space and if

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.100
there are challenges
specific to that.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.450
Walk up to somebody and say,
yes, I'm an entrepreneur.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:48.450
I start companies.

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.740
And do you get strange reactions
because you're a

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:52.640
woman in this space?

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.180
Has that happened?

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.560
SEPI NASIRI: Not really because
I never look at myself

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.200
as a woman.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:02.450
I'm looking at myself as an
entrepreneur or a founder or a

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.500
technologist, whatever l am.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:09.060
And so going into a room, I'm
not looking at victimizing

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.250
myself, I'm looking at
empowering myself.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:13.770
So empowering yourself is
looking at my resources,

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:17.930
looking at my network, and who
can help me succeed instead of

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.620
looking at my shortcomings.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.140
BEN: Have you seen that to be
a problem with other people

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:26.050
you've worked with, where they
see themselves as a victim?

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:26.480
SEPI NASIRI: I don't
want to say victim.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.650
But they look at the
shortcomings and the negative

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:30.690
instead of the positive.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:35.059
There's always ways to improve
yourself by looking at where

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:36.169
are your resources?

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:39.179
What is available to you today
in educating yourself before

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:42.580
you step forward and do the
next step, whether it's in

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.130
building a product or a
service or going to an

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:49.850
interview or pitching your
company for funding?

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.070
BEN: So it really is
about attitude is

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:51.410
what it sounds like.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:52.370
FITZ: Yeah, it sounds
a lot like you're

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.430
saying, it's attitude.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.434
It's giving yourself permission
to be awesome.

00:08:56.434 --> 00:08:58.090
SEPI NASIRI: Yes, definitely.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:01.870
BEN: So I'm curious about what's
going on at Google I/O

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.590
related to women
in technology.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.080
FITZ: You want to talk
about that Mary?

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:05.440
MARY HIMINKOOL: Sure.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.670
So, a couple of exciting
things.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:09.660
Last night we kicked off with
a pre-I/O event called Women

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.370
Tech Makers at I/O. We had a
couple hundred women at the

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:13.750
Google San Francisco office.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:16.440
And we had a panel of Google
female executives actually

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.400
sharing some of their
experiences in leadership,

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.960
product innovation, and how
to foster a culture of

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.210
empowerment within a company.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:23.890
So that was fantastic.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:27.680
And on Friday morning, day three
at 9:00 AM, Sepi and I

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.830
will actually both be on a
panel, which is called

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.910
Designing For The Other Half:
Sexy Isn't Always Pink.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:36.580
And that'll be more of an
exploration of the product

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.410
business landscape.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:41.380
And how to design and market
products for everyone,

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.060
thinking about inclusion.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.340
So 9:00 AM on Friday.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.250
FITZ: 9:00 AM on Friday.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.810
And that will wind up
on YouTube after

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:46.800
I/O as well, right?

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.100
MARY HIMINKOOL: Absolutely.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:47.980
It will.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.130
FITZ: So let's talk about
pink for a second.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.030
So that's a typical thing.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.800
We're going to take a product
that's for the general public

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.590
and make it pink.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.470
And then it's called the
product for women.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.362
What do you guys feel
about that?

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.310
SEPI NASIRI: Well, I think
colors are important.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.370
I mean even if you look at
Google's colors there are lots

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:08.310
of different shades.

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:09.560
Women 2.0's is hot
pink, actually.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:13.690
I think it's catchy.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.290
But would I wear it every day?

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.080
Probably not.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.060
But I think it's an
amazing color.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.890
It's just an attitude
as well with that.

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:24.920
So not every product has to
be pink to be sexy or

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.330
appealing to women.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.700
BEN: What have you learned
about designing

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.740
products for women?

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.860
What are some of the wisdom
you've picked up?

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.180
SEPI NASIRI: Well I think women
design products that are

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.470
a solution to a problem.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.710
So it could be any
color, actually.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:43.530
Most likely the solution they
haven't found when they go out

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:44.500
and look for it.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.750
So what they did is say, OK.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.030
I can be the person
designing it.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.370
And it works.

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:50.690
It sells.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.680
FITZ: You told me an amazing
statistic before-- and this is

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.450
something good for everybody
watching this to listen--

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.340
that people who are early
adopters of a lot of the new

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.800
technology there are women.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.360
And can you talk about
that please?

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.390
SEPI NASIRI: Well, I
think it's 80% of

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.850
consumers today have--

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:10.740
and they're women-- who
have purchasing power.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:14.020
Whether you are an office
manager or HR or you're the

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.510
entrepreneur, we are controlling
the money.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.710
So we are going to also
to make the decision.

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.380
It's great to have women who
are designing for women and

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.660
the general public when they
have that idea of what is the

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.180
next best thing.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.140
BEN: I guess if I were designing
a game or an Android

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.800
app or something, is there a
mistake I might make that is a

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:38.000
common mistake that might make
it difficult for women to want

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.950
to purchase that
kind of thing?

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:41.450
SEPI NASIRI: If it's
not user-friendly

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:44.040
for the women, obviously.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.000
We have different
responsibilities, for example,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.510
if we have kids.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.970
So if it's a gadget that is not
working for me to have a

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:52.340
small purse or a big purse or
it doesn't fit in certain

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.180
ways, then yes.

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:57.050
Then you're missing out
on that particular

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:00.370
demographic or market.

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:00.960
BEN: Interesting.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.430
FITZ: So Mary do you want to
maybe talk a little bit about

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:07.860
that, about designing products
more for women or more

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:08.500
accessible?

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:08.660
MARY HIMINKOOL: Sure.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.860
I think it's about designing
for inclusion, really, and

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.280
just understanding and listening
to feedback from

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.140
your user base, right?

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.680
Regardless of gender or
demographic or where they're

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.640
coming from globally.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.450
It's really about, how do you
solicit that user feedback and

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.370
how do you incorporate it
and continue to test?

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.630
So I think of it more from an
inclusive perspective than

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:30.030
targeting any one specific
. gender.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.960
FITZ: To come back to what you
talked about earlier about

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.240
working internally at
Google, to be more

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.320
inclusive for women.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.295
What are something that
entrepreneurs or people who

00:12:38.295 --> 00:12:41.160
keep starting small companies
could do to do that?

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:41.600
MARY HIMINKOOL: Absolutely.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.900
So I think it's about building
the culture from the bottom

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.590
up, from the top down,
every direction.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.190
Really promoting flexibility
within the workplace and

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:51.360
leading by example.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.810
So really facilitating
leadership training among

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:57.910
women within the company and
bringing them together as a

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:02.360
community to help support
one another, too.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:02.820
BEN: Wonderful.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.260
I think we got to wrap
it up here guys.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.250
So thank you very much.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.120
FITZ: Yeah, did you guys have
any sort of parting

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:07.830
things you want to--

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:08.870
BEN: Parting comments?

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:11.000
FITZ: Parting recommendations
or comments?

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.530
MARY HIMINKOOL: Yeah, just
that we're really

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:12.200
excited to be here.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.270
We're excited about the
opportunities in technology

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:15.470
for both men and women.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.880
And we hope you tune into
the panel on Friday.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.240
FITZ: Friday at 9 o'clock.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:19.680
BEN: Great.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.380
Alright.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.480
Thank you very much.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.020
FITZ: Thanks a lot.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.270
Bye.
