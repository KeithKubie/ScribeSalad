00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.840
So what I show you is, is the opening,
and we typically use a disk or a square

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.670
that can it can, can also smooth
contours, but it'll typically break thin

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.650
connections eliminate small islands,
so small little spurious things.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.630
Also sometimes eliminate
some sharp peaks.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.070
The closing can smooth contours
where they, at the, concavities.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.780
It'll fuse narrow breaks, so

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.420
things that were supposed to be
connected but had a little hole in them.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.340
It'll, it'll do that.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.880
And it can, you know,
sort of fill in these gulfs.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.375
So often you'll do one followed
by the other, all right?

00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:38.917
So here's an example.

00:00:38.917 --> 00:00:40.910
This is the original image, okay?

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.150
And it's, it's a fake image obviously,
just to make the point.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.840
So here's our original image.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.910
And you'll notice it has,
you know, th, this cut out here,

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.290
th, these rough edges here, this kind of
noise here, these spurious things there.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.460
And the opening, all right,
does exactly what you think.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.770
It'll eat away this stuff, this stuff,
that stuff, and that stuff, all right?

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.620
And also these little ridges up here.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.530
A closing, all right, well,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.935
what that's going to do is that'll fill
in this hole, so that's gone there.

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:14.490
Fill in that whole thing, so that's gone
there, and fill in these things there.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.880
Okay, remember neither opening nor
closing are going to grow or

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.875
shrink things right?

00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:20.750
They're not erosions or dilations.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.880
One is a dilation
followed by an erosion.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.950
Which one is that?

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.970
That's a close and, the other one's
an erosion, followed by a dilation,

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.060
that's an open.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.200
Well, when you do an opening
followed by a closing, okay, so you

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.982
take this and then you close that, you
get rid of this, you get rid of this,

00:01:38.982 --> 00:01:42.780
you get rid of that, you get
the two underlying elements, okay?

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.900
So, the idea is that was what
you really wanted, all right?

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.460
And these kinds of operations
are what we use often.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.720
So to show you a real life example of
that here's a fingerprint example.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.190
Here's the original image.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.940
You, here are the ridges
that you want to find.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.380
There's a whole bunch of
spots you don't want to find.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.280
There are some gaps that are not real,
right there.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.830
And so what they do is they apply
an opening, followed by a closing.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.510
And you get this really
nice fingerprint image.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.930
Okay, so that's an example of,
of doing it for real.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.882
Something I'm not going to talk about
now, there's something called a hit or

00:02:18.882 --> 00:02:19.583
miss transform.

00:02:19.583 --> 00:02:22.374
It's basically how to
find a particular shape.

00:02:22.374 --> 00:02:26.247
By the way Lynn Shapiro,
I think it's in Shapiro and Stockman, or

00:02:26.247 --> 00:02:28.910
another book that Lynn
was associated with ha,

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.625
in their textbook, they have a whole
bunch of stuff on morphology.

00:02:32.625 --> 00:02:35.800
So if you need to know more of
the details you can go get that.
