00:00:07.476 --> 00:00:09.165
There have been many different things

00:00:09.165 --> 00:00:11.095
written and said about marriage.

00:00:11.095 --> 00:00:13.028
From the sweetly inspirational

00:00:13.028 --> 00:00:15.464
to the hilariously cynical.

00:00:15.464 --> 00:00:17.344
But what many of them have in common

00:00:17.344 --> 00:00:18.999
is that they sound like they express

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.046
a universal and timeless truth,

00:00:21.046 --> 00:00:23.862
when in fact nearly everything about marriage,

00:00:23.862 --> 00:00:25.370
from its main purpose

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.578
to the kinds of relationships it covers

00:00:27.578 --> 00:00:29.655
to the rights and responsibilities involved,

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:31.677
has varied greatly between different eras,

00:00:31.677 --> 00:00:34.597
cultures and social classes.

00:00:34.597 --> 00:00:36.151
So, let's take a quick look at

00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:38.067
the evolution of marriage.

00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:39.652
Pair bonding and raising children

00:00:39.652 --> 00:00:41.935
is as old as humanity itself.

00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:44.604
With the rise of sedentary agricultural societies

00:00:44.604 --> 00:00:46.519
about 10,000 years ago,

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:47.891
marriage was also a way

00:00:47.891 --> 00:00:50.122
of securing rights to land and property

00:00:50.122 --> 00:00:53.082
by designating children born under certain circumstances

00:00:53.082 --> 00:00:55.021
as rightful heirs.

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:57.963
As these societies became larger and more complex,

00:00:57.963 --> 00:00:59.880
marriage became not just a matter

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.634
between individuals and families,

00:01:01.634 --> 00:01:03.675
but also an official institution

00:01:03.675 --> 00:01:06.722
governed by religious and civil authorities.

00:01:06.722 --> 00:01:10.268
And it was already well established by 2100 B.C.

00:01:10.268 --> 00:01:12.521
when the earliest surviving written laws

00:01:12.521 --> 00:01:15.062
in the Mesopotamian Code of Ur-Nammu

00:01:15.062 --> 00:01:17.521
provided many specifics governing marriage,

00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:19.019
from punishments for adultery

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:22.771
to the legal status of children born to slaves.

00:01:22.771 --> 00:01:25.103
Many ancient civilizations allowed some form of

00:01:25.103 --> 00:01:27.491
multiple simultaneous marriage.

00:01:27.491 --> 00:01:29.686
And even today, less than a quarter of the world's

00:01:29.686 --> 00:01:32.495
hundreds of different cultures prohibit it.

00:01:32.495 --> 00:01:34.271
But just because something was allowed

00:01:34.271 --> 00:01:36.672
doesn't mean it was always possible.

00:01:36.672 --> 00:01:38.212
Demographic realities,

00:01:38.212 --> 00:01:40.796
as well as the link between marriage and wealth,

00:01:40.796 --> 00:01:42.521
meant that even though rulers and elites

00:01:42.521 --> 00:01:43.927
in Ancient Mesopotamia,

00:01:43.927 --> 00:01:45.343
Egypt and Israel

00:01:45.343 --> 00:01:47.637
had multiple concubines or wives,

00:01:47.637 --> 00:01:50.643
most commoners could only afford one or two

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:53.520
tending towards monogamy in practice.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.937
In other places, the tables were turned,

00:01:55.937 --> 00:01:57.604
and a woman could have multiple husbands

00:01:57.604 --> 00:01:59.400
as in the Himalayan Mountains

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.853
where all brothers in a family

00:02:00.853 --> 00:02:02.186
marrying the same woman

00:02:02.186 --> 00:02:03.937
kept the small amount of fertile land

00:02:03.937 --> 00:02:07.271
from being constantly divided into new households.

00:02:07.271 --> 00:02:08.407
Marriages could vary

00:02:08.407 --> 00:02:10.351
not only in the number of people they involved

00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:12.604
but the types of people as well.

00:02:12.604 --> 00:02:14.833
Although the names and laws for such arrangements

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:15.830
may have differed,

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.103
publicly recognized same-sex unions

00:02:18.103 --> 00:02:19.209
have popped up

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.753
in various civilizations throughout history.

00:02:21.753 --> 00:02:25.006
Mesopotamian prayers included blessings for such couples,

00:02:25.006 --> 00:02:27.604
while Native American Two-Spirit individuals

00:02:27.604 --> 00:02:30.306
had relationships with both sexes.

00:02:30.306 --> 00:02:32.473
The first instances of such arrangements

00:02:32.473 --> 00:02:33.936
actually being called "Marriage"

00:02:33.936 --> 00:02:35.058
come from Rome,

00:02:35.058 --> 00:02:36.937
where the Emperors Nero and Elagabalus

00:02:36.937 --> 00:02:39.520
both married men in public ceremonies

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.520
with the practice being explictly banned

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.686
in 342 A.D.

00:02:43.686 --> 00:02:45.151
But similar traditions survived

00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:46.822
well into the Christian era,

00:02:46.822 --> 00:02:48.354
such as Adelphopoiesis,

00:02:48.354 --> 00:02:50.854
or "brother-making" in Orthodox churches,

00:02:50.854 --> 00:02:53.103
and even an actual marriage between two men

00:02:53.103 --> 00:02:57.497
recorded in 1061 at a small chapel in Spain.

00:02:57.497 --> 00:02:59.043
Nor was marriage even necessarily

00:02:59.043 --> 00:03:01.254
between two living people.

00:03:01.254 --> 00:03:02.457
Ghost marriages,

00:03:02.457 --> 00:03:04.213
where either the bride or groom were deceased,

00:03:04.213 --> 00:03:05.546
were conducted in China

00:03:05.546 --> 00:03:07.468
to continue family lineages

00:03:07.468 --> 00:03:09.469
or appease restless spirits.

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:13.389
And some tribes in Sudan maintain similar practices.

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:14.807
Despite all these differences,

00:03:14.807 --> 00:03:16.435
a lot of marriages throughout history

00:03:16.435 --> 00:03:18.896
did have one thing in common.

00:03:18.896 --> 00:03:19.854
With crucial matters

00:03:19.854 --> 00:03:21.853
like property and reproduction at stake,

00:03:21.853 --> 00:03:23.354
they were way too important

00:03:23.354 --> 00:03:25.655
to depend on young love.

00:03:25.655 --> 00:03:27.520
Especially among the upperclasses,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.824
matches were often made by families or rulers.

00:03:30.824 --> 00:03:33.436
But even for commoners, who had some degree of choice,

00:03:33.436 --> 00:03:35.597
the main concern was practicality.

00:03:35.597 --> 00:03:37.581
The modern idea of marriage

00:03:37.581 --> 00:03:40.104
as being mainly about love and companionship

00:03:40.104 --> 00:03:42.916
only emerged in the last couple of centuries.

00:03:42.916 --> 00:03:44.214
With industrialization,

00:03:44.214 --> 00:03:45.212
urbanization

00:03:45.212 --> 00:03:46.923
and the growth of the middle class

00:03:46.923 --> 00:03:48.381
more people became independent

00:03:48.381 --> 00:03:50.186
from large extended families

00:03:50.186 --> 00:03:51.187
and were able to support

00:03:51.187 --> 00:03:53.050
a new household on their own.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.520
Encouraged by new ideas

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.686
from the Enlightenment,

00:03:55.686 --> 00:03:56.808
people began to focus

00:03:56.808 --> 00:03:59.269
on individual happiness and pursuits,

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.229
rather than familial duty or wealth and status,

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:03.531
at least some of the time.

00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:05.652
And this focus on individual happiness

00:04:05.652 --> 00:04:08.187
soon led to other transformations,

00:04:08.187 --> 00:04:10.322
such as easing restrictions on divorce

00:04:10.322 --> 00:04:12.989
and more people marrying at a later age.

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.688
So, as we continue to debate the role and definition

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:17.271
of marriage in the modern world,

00:04:17.271 --> 00:04:18.622
it might help to keep in mind

00:04:18.622 --> 00:04:21.270
that marriage has always been shaped by society,

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.291
and as a society's

00:04:22.291 --> 00:04:24.103
structure, values and goals

00:04:24.103 --> 00:04:25.196
change over time,

00:04:25.196 --> 00:04:28.811
its ideas of marriage will continue to change along with them.
