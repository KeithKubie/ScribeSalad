00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.600
Why should the idea of sex
outside be exciting?

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.009
Given how awkward, scratchy, sandy or
muddy it can be on a beach, halfway up a hillside

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:13.820
or in the shady bushes of a park â€“ compared
with the comfort of cotton sheets and a sprung

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.820
mattress?

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.360
As so often with sex, the pleasure is psychological,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.320
not physical.  It's a thought that is turning us on and the exciting idea

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.300
is that we can at last lose our normal self-consciousness and inhibition and take our sexuality

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.720
out into the world without embarrassment.
Shame normally profoundly colours how we perceive our own sexuality.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.860
From early adolescence we take great care to shield our sexual sides from others.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.039
They would have no interest, they might be sickened.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.480
We reserve our naked selves strictly for the bedroom, in the dark, late at night.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.040
The Biblical story of the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.320
reflects this embarrassment.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.520
It isn't just a quaint piece of theology, it's a universal account of

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.960
how we've travelled painfully from uninhibited toddlerhood to embarrassed adulthood.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.260
But with a lover to lend us new buoyancy,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.320
we are liable to feel more acceptable to ourselves again.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.700
Because they are representative of the normally brutal outer world

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.540
have found us desirable.  We acquire a background hope.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.480
That we might be able to do away with the normal punishing rules.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.380
Once again enjoy the favours of loving innocence.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.820
To suggest we go outside to have sex is a touching provocation,

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.160
a minor dare to imagine that society won't always have to be hostile or indifferent.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.160
To our vulnerable sexual selves

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.740
and by extension to our existence more generally.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.360
In truth, the sex can't do more than express a hope,

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.299
that the short blissful encounter in the park or behind the supermarket

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.540
is at least evidence of a defiant Utopian faith

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.320
that we can, with our lovers support, perhaps turn the wider world into what it so seldom is...

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.580
... our home.
