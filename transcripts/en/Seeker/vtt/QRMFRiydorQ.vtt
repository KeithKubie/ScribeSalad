00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.750
It’s one of the most enigmatic mysteries
of well… ever, how did such a prehistoric

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.240
people build Stonehenge?

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.419
And what was it even for?

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:13.429
It’s killing me that no one knows.

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:15.309
Hey guys Julia here for Dnews

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.440
From Druids, to aliens to sacred religious
site, to burial ground, stories and theories

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.250
abound for what Stonehenge was actually used
for.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.190
Some believe it was just a part of a larger
Neolithic ritual landscape that includes two

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.770
other sites, one called Avebury and one called
Marden Henge.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.149
Recently a Bronze Age Skeleton was found near
Marden Henge, in Wiltshire.

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.230
Marden Henge, is even larger than the other
more famous.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.160
The 4,000 year old teenager was burred with
an amber necklace and near the body were numerous

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.940
other artifacts, like blades, pottery and
jewelry.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.620
Maybe this find will give researchers a clue
into the life of those who built these sacred

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.989
sites, dental examinations could reveal diet
and these artifacts could hint at their culture

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.480
and who was it that built such massive monuments.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.059
The University of Reading headed the dig,
which researchers hope would shed some light

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.850
on the mysteries of Stonehenge.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.969
And one of the researchers wonders whether
Stonehenge, Marden Henge, and Avebury “competed

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.210
against each other or were used for different
rituals by the people who lived near them”.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.530
So as scientists are working out Marden Henge,
what do we even know about Stonehenge?

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.870
Stonehenge was probably named that in anglo-saxon
times, it’s translated to roughly, “hanging

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:16.870
stones”.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.790
But the name has taken on a life of its own.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.440
Other archaeological features are now called
“henges” as well.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.560
The term henge now refers to any earthwork
where there’s a small ditch inside or outside

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.670
of an embankment.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.880
The ground the site is built on was probably
a burial site dating as far back as 3000 BCE

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.790
Over the centuries the site went through a
few iterations, some of the earliest involving

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.360
earthenworks like long ditches.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.740
But it was consistently used as a site of
cremation.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.340
"It's now clear that burials were a major
component of Stonehenge in all its main stages,"

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.340
said Mike Parker Pearson, archaeology professor
at the University of Sheffield in England.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.280
Some of the oldest parts of the monument include
56 fire pits, most of which contain evidence

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.370
of cremation.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.120
The ritual site we know today, stones and
all, was probably erected in 2600 BCE and

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.300
work continued on the site for a millennium.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.090
The stones form concentric rings.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.319
The outer ring has huge sandstone blocks weighing
up to 30-tons and an inner ring and horseshoe

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.440
are made of 3- to 5-ton volcanic bluestone
blocks.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.540
While big stones are from a local quarry,
it seems odd to find those smaller blue stones

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.299
in the middle of field in the middle of England.

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.500
It’s a bit of mystery of where they came
from.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.500
For nearly a century people thought the blue
stones came from the Preseli Hills in Wales,

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.999
nearly 155 miles (250 km) away.

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:29.659
But a 2013 study published in the Journal
of Archaeological Science found that stones

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.120
were from Carn Goedog in Pembrokeshire, a
few miles away from the Preseli Hills.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.150
And some researchers think THESE stones were
the real draw for the prehistoric people visiting

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.209
the site, not the large ones we seem to be
in awe of.

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.329
Perhaps the blue stones were thought to have
healing powers.

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:45.480
But how did they get there?

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.480
NO ONE KNOWS.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.359
UGH WHY DON’T WE KNOW.

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.519
One hypothesis suggests that maybe they came
there by way of glacier, another idea includes

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.730
massive amounts of man power and a little
float down a river.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.180
As for what went on there, well we might never
know.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.840
It does seem like it was part of a large ritual
landscape where a long procession might have

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.019
taken place.

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.930
Near the site lies the Stonehenge Cursus or
the Greater Cursus- a two mile track of ditches.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.180
Angled with the sun and with pits that line
up during the midsummer solstice, it seems

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.529
the whole thing had some ritual purpose, something
to do with the sun, as well as being a place

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:18.529
of burial.

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:21.610
The rituals performed during the solstice
might have been grand processions with people

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.840
walking for miles as part of an elaborate
ceremony.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.849
There’s a series of graves near the site,
and the seem to be aligned in a way that tracks

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.980
the movements of the sun on the solstice.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.819
So the participants might have walked around
the site to each of the sites.

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.799
But that’s just one idea.

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.600
Other researchers believe the stone site was
erected as monument to the unification of

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.689
people from around what we call Britain.

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:45.400
Just the hauling and shape of the stones would
have been an act of unification because it

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.409
was such a huge undertaking that everyone
had to pitch in.

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:52.680
The building also coincided with a time when
a similar culture spread throughout the island.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.239
Houses and tools started to look the same
and made from the same materials.

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.180
No matter the story, it's’ clear that stonehenge
was part of a constantly changing sacred landscape

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.299
that remained significant for thousands of
years.

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.920
Will the site ever reveal its mysteries?

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:17.280
Probably not, but that won’t stop us from
wondering and searching for answers.
