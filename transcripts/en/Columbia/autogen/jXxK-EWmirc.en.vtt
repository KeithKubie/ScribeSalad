00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:21.280
thing was that the the we duplication of
 

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:21.960
thing was that the the we duplication of
syllables

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:21.970
syllables
 

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:25.620

was the common the common practice that

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:25.630
was the common the common practice that
 

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:29.549
was the common the common practice that
when you have reduplicated syllables the

00:23:29.549 --> 00:23:29.559
when you have reduplicated syllables the
 

00:23:29.559 --> 00:23:31.470
when you have reduplicated syllables the
suggestion is that it's it's not human

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:31.480
suggestion is that it's it's not human
 

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:37.919
suggestion is that it's it's not human
speech and these animal sounds are

00:23:37.919 --> 00:23:37.929
speech and these animal sounds are
 

00:23:37.929 --> 00:23:39.919
speech and these animal sounds are
actually quite interesting because

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:39.929
actually quite interesting because
 

00:23:39.929 --> 00:23:45.090
actually quite interesting because
they're you can't usually conjugate them

the appearance of empire
you have the apparent geographical

you have the apparent geographical
 

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:51.550
you have the apparent geographical
location at opposite ends of a great

Eastern Europe across to northern China
 

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:02.200
Eastern Europe across to northern China
and these seem to warrant a comparison

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:02.210
and these seem to warrant a comparison
 

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:06.160
and these seem to warrant a comparison
but then you say it's an empire well in

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:06.170
but then you say it's an empire well in
 

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.890
but then you say it's an empire well in
what sense it's an empire the Romans

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:08.900
what sense it's an empire the Romans

and so if you say an empire is a

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:15.940
and so if you say an empire is a
 

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:19.750
and so if you say an empire is a

European law in China the parallel of

European law in China the parallel of
 

00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:00.330

Roman law would be the great tong law

law so so Han doesn't have the that kind

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:20.110
law so so Han doesn't have the that kind
 

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:23.910
law so so Han doesn't have the that kind
of a parallel it doesn't lay down a

of a parallel it doesn't lay down a

pass a series of examinations this is

00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359
pass a series of examinations this is
 

00:35:37.359 --> 00:35:40.859

not a Hogg practice this is later later

Chinese history so Han doesn't have that

as well there is a census from the Han

this was a thesis put forward first I

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:05.000
this was a thesis put forward first I
 

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:13.960
this was a thesis put forward first I
think by a French

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:13.970
 

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:22.609

historian named Rashard Lefevre they
 

00:40:22.619 --> 00:40:31.839
historian named Rashard Lefevre they
know at and his thesis was that in Rome

00:40:31.839 --> 00:40:31.849
know at and his thesis was that in Rome
 

00:40:31.849 --> 00:40:36.670

all significant work was done by slaves

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:36.680
all significant work was done by slaves

all significant work was done by slaves
after Rome fell there was a shortage of

00:40:45.049 --> 00:40:45.059
after Rome fell there was a shortage of
 

00:40:45.059 --> 00:40:52.420
after Rome fell there was a shortage of
labour and this led people to invent new

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:52.430
labour and this led people to invent new
 

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:57.049
labour and this led people to invent new
ways to use animals and particularly it

00:40:57.049 --> 00:40:57.059
ways to use animals and particularly it
 

00:40:57.059 --> 00:40:59.569
ways to use animals and particularly it
led the French to invent new ways to use

00:40:59.569 --> 00:40:59.579
led the French to invent new ways to use
 

00:40:59.579 --> 00:41:03.499
led the French to invent new ways to use
animals to harness them more efficiently

the Roman slave economy as far as farm
 

00:41:27.029 --> 00:41:31.099

what we do is we put on a strap here to
 

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:37.710
what we do is we put on a strap here to
hold it in place but more importantly we

know it because they had slaves and
 

00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:47.370
know it because they had slaves and
therefore they were perfectly willing to

therefore they were perfectly willing to
 

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:50.870
therefore they were perfectly willing to
strangle their horses and use them for

00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880
strangle their horses and use them for
 

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:54.740

for a lot of labour and so the French

for a lot of labour and so the French
 

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:04.920
for a lot of labour and so the French
came along and they invented what did

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:04.930
came along and they invented what did
