WILLIAM FLOYD: Please, join
me in giving a warm welcome

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.430
to Bonita Stewart
and DeRay McKesson.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.818
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.640
BONITA STEWART: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.720
Well, thank you, William,
for just the introduction

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.880
to this very special talk
that we have this afternoon.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.480
I am personally excited
to sit next to DeRay

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.300
because he's just had such an
impact in one way or another

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.270
in all of our lives.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.580
So DeRay, let's just start--

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.330
you've had an incredible
personal journey.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.850
You follow things that
you're most passionate about.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.790
So I saw where you actually were
in the public school system,

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.550
human resources official there.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.880
But tell us about
your personal journey.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.501
And we talked about
being born in Baltimore

00:01:05.501 --> 00:01:06.750
or spending time in Minnesota.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.140
But how did you follow
all of these passions?

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.255
How did you set
out on this path?

00:01:13.255 --> 00:01:14.880
DERAY MCKESSON: So
I'll start by saying

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.940
it's an honor to be here.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:16.420
It's great to be here.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.330
It's always a joy to
talk about this work.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.560
I do wish though
that we didn't have

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.870
to spend so much time fighting
systems and structures that

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.120
were killing us so we could
go do the cool things that

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.410
make us joyous about the world.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.450
So I'm mindful of that.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.520
I think about this.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.100
I was in student government
my whole childhood,

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.600
and that was really
important to me.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.349
Both of my parents
were addicted to drugs.

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:37.440
My mother left when I was
three and she came back

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.230
when I was 30.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.320
I just turned 33--
this is my Jesus year.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.634
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:42.499
WILLIAM FLOYD: Amen.

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:44.040
DERAY MCKESSON: My
mother left, yeah.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.400
So she just came back a couple
of years ago-- three years ago.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.562
And my father got clean when
I was around three or four.

00:01:50.562 --> 00:01:52.520
And I think about that
because in so many ways,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.357
I grew up in a
community of recovery.

00:01:54.357 --> 00:01:56.190
I grew up seeing people
put their lives back

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.200
together in ways that
they didn't always think

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.960
was possible.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.850
And that was childhood for me.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.754
I'll never forget coming
down from my bedroom one day

00:02:03.754 --> 00:02:05.420
and I see this guy
sitting on the couch.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.200
And I'm like, he
looks really familiar.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.550
And it was one of
my sister's friends.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.410
And I'm like, why is he in
our house in the morning--

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.620
why is he on the couch?

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.220
And he was recovering and
my father was counseling him

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.550
during recovery.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.820
I have so many memories of that.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.420
And I think about
that all the time,

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.682
because I know what it's
like to see communities

00:02:21.682 --> 00:02:22.890
break and come back together.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.230
And I think about this
work and resistance

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.450
is seeing things break
and believing that they

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.186
can come back together.

00:02:29.186 --> 00:02:30.810
But I taught, and
teaching was probably

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.750
the single coolest,
most important,

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.127
magical thing I've ever done.

00:02:35.127 --> 00:02:37.710
I taught sixth grade math here
in the East New York, Brooklyn.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.145
And sixth grade is beautiful.

00:02:39.145 --> 00:02:40.770
Seventh grade is
puberty and deodorant,

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.323
but sixth grade is still--

00:02:42.323 --> 00:02:43.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.100
--a lot of magic.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.750
If you've never been
in a group of kids

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.208
who don't know they
need deodorant,

00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:49.320
that is seventh grade.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.930
Sixth grade is a lot of joy.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.420
And I'll never forget,
one day I was--

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.800
I taught 69 in 120
minute classes,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.490
which is a long time for a
11-year-old to do anything, let

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.660
alone math.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.987
And they were like,
can we go to gym early?

00:03:05.987 --> 00:03:08.070
And I'm like, absolutely,
you can go to gym early.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.600
I'm tired of you,
you're tired of me.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.820
We've been together
for a long time.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.861
First, second, third,
fifth, and seventh period--

00:03:12.861 --> 00:03:13.800
this one class.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.540
So I let them go.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.930
And they come back
really quickly

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.340
and they're back
in my classroom.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.939
I'm like, why are
you back so quick?

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.230
And I realize that they're
in love with the idea of gym

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.267
more than the work of gym.

00:03:25.267 --> 00:03:27.100
And I say that because
in moments like this,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.558
I think people are more in love
with the idea of resistance

00:03:29.558 --> 00:03:30.900
than the work of resistance.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.290
And the question for me now--

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.200
four years after we were in the
streets initially in Ferguson,

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.189
it's like, what does
the work look like?

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:39.730
How do we use spaces like this--
if we ever are going to just

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:40.960
keep talking about it--

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.720
to actually force people to
engage in the work and not just

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.550
the conversation
of these things?

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.530
So I got into it because
my friend got killed.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.580
I was on my couch and I
was like, this is crazy.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.464
So I'm going to go and the
least I can do is just go

00:03:53.464 --> 00:03:54.130
for the weekend.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.440
I was like, I'm going to
out for Saturday and Sunday.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.860
And I went, and
the second night I

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.109
was in St. Louis was the
first night I got tear gassed

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:01.390
and I was like, this is wild.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.869
I'll do whatever I can to
make sure that nobody else has

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:04.660
to experience this.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.610
So I quit and did all
these other things.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.710
And in hindsight now
I'm like, that was--

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.050
like, what was I doing.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.400
But I did it and so many
other people did it.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.230
I'm proud that I was
not the only person.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.969
There were so many
incredible people

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:18.510
in St. Louis who did whatever
they could to make a difference

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.907
and continue to do that work.

00:04:21.907 --> 00:04:23.740
WILLIAM FLOYD: As a
father of a 12-year-old,

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.007
I can attest, yes,
deodorant is big deal.

00:04:27.007 --> 00:04:28.090
DERAY MCKESSON: It's real.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.729
And you don't want to
hurt their feelings,

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.850
so you're like,
hey, that smell--

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.112
free gifts for class.

00:04:35.112 --> 00:04:36.070
WILLIAM FLOYD: Exactly.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.870
I have to stand over
him in the bathroom.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.420
Like, [INAUDIBLE]---- But you
mentioned a little earlier

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.710
about your personal experience
with communities breaking

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.490
and re-knitting them together.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.500
How does technology
play a role in that

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.791
from your point of view?

00:04:56.791 --> 00:04:58.040
DERAY MCKESSON: So two things.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.032
One is the platforms and
the second is the people,

00:05:01.032 --> 00:05:02.740
like you all, who make
these things real.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.549
When I think about Twitter--

00:05:04.549 --> 00:05:05.965
if not for Twitter,
Missouri would

00:05:05.965 --> 00:05:07.965
have tried to convince
you that we didn't exist.

00:05:07.965 --> 00:05:10.420
Literally, if we had not been
able to tell our own stories

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.770
in real time, they
would have been like,

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.770
those people aren't
really out there.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.144
And you're like,
are you kidding?

00:05:14.144 --> 00:05:17.590
People forget that in August,
September, and October of 2014,

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.452
it was illegal to stand
still in St. Louis.

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:21.160
So if you saw us
marching, it wasn't only

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.970
that marching was a
really cool thing to do,

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.100
it was the five-second rule.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.720
So if you sit still for
more than five seconds,

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.800
you were arrested.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.470
And we remember that
because that was crazy to us

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.300
and that was real.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.570
And we just adjusted.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.030
We sued them and it got
deemed unconstitutional.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.410
But if not for--

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.540
I remember my tweet about
the five-second rule

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.600
was the first public recorded
instance of the rule.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.450
So when we sued them,
I had to testify.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.660
And literally the judge
is like, what is Twitter?

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.505
And I'm like, it's Twitter.

00:05:47.505 --> 00:05:48.870
He's like, what is a tweet?

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.416
And we're literally
recounting my tweet thread

00:05:51.416 --> 00:05:52.540
about the five-second rule.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.592
And if not for
social media, we just

00:05:54.592 --> 00:05:56.050
wouldn't have been
able to do that.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.610
Jack the CEO of
Twitter is a friend

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.700
and I remember getting a
call from him being like,

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.480
DeRay, we're going to
buy this company that

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.480
is called Perioscope
because we don't have any--

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.820
I remember that call,
but that was late.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:07.780
We'd already been in--

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.220
all we could use was Vine.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.710
So in the beginning,
we'd literally--

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.420
we'd record a video
on our iPhones.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.010
Then we'd go run off to the
side, upload it in Vine,

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.940
and scroll through trying to
find the best six seconds,

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.080
and then post it online.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.410
That was our strategy to do,
because there was no Twitter

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:24.950
Video, there was
no Facebook Live,

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.680
there was no YouTube streaming.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.472
Those things didn't
exist back then.

00:06:28.472 --> 00:06:30.430
And there are critics of
us who will say things

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.638
like, you chased the cameras.

00:06:31.638 --> 00:06:33.670
And we're like, we
were the cameras.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:34.660
We were it.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.829
We were the people
telling the truth.

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:37.870
The second part of this--

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.200
it was like the people
in places like this--

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.540
I'm always mindful that
people made these things.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.360
These things don't just
emerge out of thin air.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.051
And what I found over
four years is that when

00:06:49.051 --> 00:06:50.050
we think about leaders--

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.640
we often get leaders,
whether they're

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.210
leaders in the country, not
this guy, but other people,

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.460
or leaders of companies--
and they do things like,

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.050
we're everybody's CEO.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.971
We don't just lead
the black people

00:07:00.971 --> 00:07:02.470
or the black and
brown people, we're

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.050
everybody-- they use that
language as if that's supposed

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.910
to be some inclusive statement.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.250
But the reality would be if
you were everybody's CEO,

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.650
you would be marshaling
and marching white people

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.150
to a vision of
equity and justice.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.550
Because that would be what
leadership looks like.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.150
I think what you
find in places--

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.470
I've definitely seen tech
companies hide behind

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.220
this vision of inclusivity that
is actually not about equity,

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.580
it's not about justice, but it's
this idea that tech is neutral.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.100
You're like, none of
this stuff is neutral.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.700
So I worry about what that
looks like in companies

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.810
across the tech community.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.020
And the second is, what
is people's proximity

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.079
to these issues?

00:07:39.079 --> 00:07:40.870
So you see a lot of
companies who are like,

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.209
we care and da, da, da.

00:07:42.209 --> 00:07:44.500
There are a lot of people
who think the country got bad

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.610
with the Muslim ban.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.400
And the country has
been bad way before--

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.920
the Muslim ban is bad.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.430
That is not the beginning
of the bad, though.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.602
Or it takes a tragedy
hitting one set of employees

00:07:54.602 --> 00:07:56.560
for people to be like,
oh, my god, the country.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.960
And you're like, how close
are you to these issues

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.010
that you say you
care about everyday?

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.630
And we actually
can be using tech

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.590
to do something really
interesting and cool about.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.750
I worry about what
that looks like.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.190
As somebody who's not in tech,
I know what the issues are.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.820
I want to believe that if people
who knew how to do something

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.100
in a tech space-- just
knew the issues better,

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.720
they'd be able to
help us brainstorm.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.940
So you think about, what
does it mean in California

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.270
that 1 in 11 homicides is
committed by an officer

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:23.860
or a third of all
the people killed

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.210
by a stranger in this
country is actually

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:26.334
killed by a police officer?

00:08:26.334 --> 00:08:29.377
Those are wild things.

00:08:29.377 --> 00:08:31.210
And want to believe
that we could figure out

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.159
how to capture data better
or we could figure out how

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:34.480
to visualize this stuff better.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.580
If you get killed in this
country and a newspaper

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:37.990
doesn't write about
you, you literally

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.100
are not in the dataset--

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.132
you don't exist.

00:08:40.132 --> 00:08:42.340
So any number you've ever
heard about police violence

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.499
comes from the aggregate
of newspaper reports.

00:08:44.499 --> 00:08:46.540
There are two years in
Florida recently that they

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.700
reported no killings by police.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.590
You're like, well, we
know that's not true.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:51.910
That's just a lie.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.340
So how do we help people
like you get close enough

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:58.030
to the issues so you can help us
brainstorm real systemic things

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.290
to do something about it?

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:01.330
BONITA STEWART: So
it's interesting

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.630
when you think about
a role of technology.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:05.720
My husband always jokes--

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.140
he said, who would have
thought Steve Jobs--

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:14.890
if he only knew that he was the
original purveyor of justice.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:18.610
Because with the
invention of the mobile--

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:20.490
the iPhone was a real start.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.260
And then aggregating
all of the apps,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.350
such as Twitter and
Instagram and YouTube--

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.930
all of this in
terms of technology

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.750
and putting it in
the hands of people.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.840
You talk a little
bit about the truth.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.920
And there's different
sides of it.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.410
One, in terms of now
everyone is carrying

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:42.450
the device, the device
that can either speak

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.550
to truth or in some cases--

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.210
one of the areas that
we're focused on,

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:48.480
which we announced with
the Google News initiative

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.890
is around media literacy,
so that people understand

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:57.000
what is the truth, being
a big supporter of quality

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.930
journalism.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.920
So how are you thinking
about technology

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.960
and driving the truth?

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.870
And what role, quite
frankly, could we

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.510
play as a technology company?

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:13.440
Because now there's things that
are popping up because people

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.550
have the devices.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:17.490
And we could probably
turn on the news tonight

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:21.840
and there will be some
story about someone

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.880
that has been
recorded, and they're

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.890
trying to explain the truth.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:30.540
And I do think particularly with
under-represented minorities,

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:35.190
quite frankly, that becomes,
for us, a source of truth.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:40.150
So how are you thinking about
the literacy, the truth,

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.575
and then the technology
all combined?

00:10:42.575 --> 00:10:43.950
DERAY MCKESSON:
Yeah, so we never

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.200
want to confuse
awareness for action.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.360
Understanding the problem
is a part of the work

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.100
and seeing that the
world is screwed up

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.600
has to be the first step.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.308
There are some people
who think that that

00:10:53.308 --> 00:10:54.600
is the whole equation, though.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.180
We just know that
that is not true.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.659
Especially four
years later, if you

00:10:57.659 --> 00:10:59.700
see another video of the
police killing somebody,

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.060
if you're shocked now,
it's like, where were you?

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.600
That is not necessarily a
special thing in this moment.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.130
What we'd also say though
is that there are people who

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.800
have yet to understand that
this is not a system of chances,

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.480
this is not a
system of constance,

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.277
this is a system of choices.

00:11:14.277 --> 00:11:16.110
The best thing that we
can do is help people

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.570
see what those choices were
that have been made before

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.920
to set us up to make a
different set of choices.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.780
That is what we think
is really important.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.572
So we think about the
police as an example.

00:11:24.572 --> 00:11:26.154
Four years ago I
would have been like,

00:11:26.154 --> 00:11:27.840
it's a screwed up
system with bad people

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.190
making bad decisions.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.270
Now I'm like, the
game is just rigged.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:33.090
So you look at California--

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:35.340
California has a law that
says any investigation

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.590
of an officer that lasts
more than a year can never

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.150
result in discipline
regardless of the outcome.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:41.510
That just doesn't make--

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.200
that's like a
different set of rules.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.700
In Cleveland,
disciplinary records

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.650
are destroyed after 60 days.

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:49.050
After one year,
different set of rules.

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.685
We're just not actually
playing the same game.

00:11:51.685 --> 00:11:54.724
And what we've started to do
is help people figure out,

00:11:54.724 --> 00:11:56.140
here's a game
that's being played.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.750
I think that's one of the things
that the right does really

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:58.280
well.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.030
They're very quiet
about it, but they just

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:01.990
change the playing field.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:04.920
We have been seduce to believe
that the best argument wins--

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.290
if we make the best
case and da, da, da.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:08.700
The best argument doesn't win.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.290
The argument that's
beat into people's

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:12.420
head over and over,
that is what wins.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.150
I think that we've forgotten
how to do that sometimes.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:16.950
When I think about
the role of tech,

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:19.107
I think there's some huge
data things that people

00:12:19.107 --> 00:12:19.940
could be working on.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.590
So you've probably heard people
talk about bail reform and all

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:23.640
this stuff with bail.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.530
There's actually
very little data

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.060
about bail-- it
just doesn't exist.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.570
So we know that when people go
before the judge or the bond

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:32.890
hearing or whatever, that
there's a stenographer taking

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:34.030
down everything.

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:37.530
But that the only place that
the bail amounts are recorded.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:41.370
So you've never seen a
study on bail by judge.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:42.790
You've never seen
a study on bail

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:48.000
by any demographic indicator,
because there is no data.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.690
So there's a ton of stuff
where there's just not data,

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:52.650
but we know these
issues are things.

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:55.934
If I ask you right now, what's
a felony, what would you say?

00:12:55.934 --> 00:12:57.850
WILLIAM FLOYD: What's
the technical definition

00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:57.970
of a felony?

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.160
DERAY MCKESSON: Give me
an example of a felony.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.330
WILLIAM FLOYD:
Breaking and entering.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:02.050
DERAY MCKESSON:
Breaking and entering.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.300
WILLIAM FLOYD: Stealing a car.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.900
DERAY MCKESSON: Stealing a car.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.040
That, to a certain extent.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:06.915
What would about you?

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.160
BONITA STEWART: If you
were robbing a bank.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.059
DERAY MCKESSON: Robbing a bank.

00:13:15.059 --> 00:13:16.850
Well, you ask most
people, what's a felony,

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:18.170
they say these big things.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:20.560
They're like, blowing up a
building, killing 10 people,

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.580
robbing a bank.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:24.890
In Virginia, up until this year,
theft over $200 is a felony.

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:27.332
In Florida, to this day,
theft over $300 is a felony.

00:13:27.332 --> 00:13:29.540
And in both of those states,
when you become a felon,

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.500
you permanently lose
the right to vote.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:32.180
That is wild.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.100
We've been conditioned
to think about felons

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.680
as people who have
killed 10 people, smiled,

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.110
and taken a picture.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:44.440
That's what you
think about a felon.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:48.770
A felony is stealing
a Chromebook, an iPod.

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:53.450
That is how people are being
disenfranchised and get scaled.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.210
But that's actually not the
story that you hear the most.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:00.027
In Oklahoma, up until 2001,
theft over $50 was a felony.

00:14:00.027 --> 00:14:01.610
So the way that we've
been conditioned

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.540
to think about these
problems is a real issue.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.139
So what we would say is that
people in tech, people who know

00:14:06.139 --> 00:14:07.430
how to look at aggregate data--

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:10.040
the more that we can uncover
and unearth these things

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.660
and visualize them
in a way that helps

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.420
people realize that the only
radical thing is the fact

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:15.976
that we are talking about it.

00:14:15.976 --> 00:14:17.600
The fact that we're
fighting the system

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.682
is not the radical piece.

00:14:18.682 --> 00:14:20.390
The fact that we have
to fight the system

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:22.970
is the crazy radical
thing in the first place.

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:24.620
But there are all
these minor things

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:25.310
that people just don't know.

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.730
The last thing I'll say is,
how many people are on a jury?

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:29.075
This is not a trick question.

00:14:29.075 --> 00:14:30.200
WILLIAM FLOYD: I have been.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:30.850
DERAY MCKESSON: How many people?

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:31.391
No, how many?

00:14:31.391 --> 00:14:32.580
WILLIAM FLOYD: Oh, how many?

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.080
12.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:33.990
DERAY MCKESSON: He's
like, I was one.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.489
Yes.

00:14:34.489 --> 00:14:35.151
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:35.151 --> 00:14:37.284
BONITA STEWART: It's
like, "12 Angry Men."

00:14:37.284 --> 00:14:38.575
That's how you can remember it.

00:14:38.575 --> 00:14:39.260
DERAY MCKESSON:
There are two states

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.510
in the country where it only
takes 10 of the 12 people

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:42.870
to convict you of a felony.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.870
So in Louisiana, you can
get convicted with life

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:48.410
without the possibility
of parole in a 10-2 vote,

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:49.410
which is so wild.

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:51.510
In Louisiana, it's directly
tied to integration.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:53.551
That when black people
started sitting on juries,

00:14:53.551 --> 00:14:55.554
they literally held a
constitutional convention

00:14:55.554 --> 00:14:56.970
so they could
change the threshold

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:59.636
so that black people would never
be able to lower the conviction

00:14:59.636 --> 00:15:00.257
rate.

00:15:00.257 --> 00:15:01.340
It's Louisiana and Oregon.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.830
In Oregon, it was about Jews.

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.880
Oregon is the only state
that banned black people

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.290
from living in the state.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.123
They had already
discriminated against some,

00:15:08.123 --> 00:15:09.820
so juries weren't the
best way to do it.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.990
But they did it for Jews.

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.610
That is nuts.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.305
So to this day, in
Louisiana right now--

00:15:15.305 --> 00:15:18.430
and hopefully it'll get changed
in November because it'll be up

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:19.490
at the ballot--

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:20.684
it only takes 10 people.

00:15:20.684 --> 00:15:22.100
And I only found
out because I did

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:26.270
a 6-hour tour of Angola,
which is the biggest prison

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:29.150
complex in the country.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.910
And I was I was asking one of
the inmates, what don't I know?

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:33.470
And he was like, you probably
don't know that it only takes

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:34.970
10 people to send us here.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:36.445
That is nuts.

00:15:36.445 --> 00:15:37.820
There are these
structural things

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:39.630
that don't make the
public conversation,

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:42.800
but actually are bringing
more people into the net.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.240
And we don't talk about those.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.780
We try to spend more time on
those things now than the stuff

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.510
that you see everyday
in the newspaper.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:53.840
WILLIAM FLOYD: Your comment
about awareness and action--

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.740
our forum today is actually
to tie those two together.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:00.830
Because you're right,
education and awareness--

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:02.220
we're beyond that.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.730
And I speak
personally, and I think

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.530
for many Googlers
in the room, they're

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.410
looking for ways to
connect and to drive

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:12.440
their awareness
and their outrage

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.740
into something that's
very constructive.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.720
Case in point, you
wrote the thing

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.980
about technology and data.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.630
I think one of the
organizations that's

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:28.220
here today that's tabling
outside after our talks is

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.522
the Vera Institute of Justice.

00:16:29.522 --> 00:16:30.980
DERAY MCKESSON:
Yeah, we love Vera.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:31.910
WILLIAM FLOYD: Yeah.

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.580
I sit on the board of the
Vera Institute of Justice.

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:37.430
And Google is
partnering with Vera

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:43.560
to do a project to
illuminate and bring out

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.600
how mass incarceration actually
is being driven by smaller

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.130
regional, smaller jurisdictions
around the country, not

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:52.880
the big cities.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.760
Actually, the big cities
are doing the lot,

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.980
either because they got
woke or they realize they

00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.490
don't have the money to do it--

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:02.060
to deemphasize incarceration.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.280
It's actually the
smaller jurisdictions

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:08.240
around the country, mostly in
red states and rural areas,

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.690
that, in the aggregate, is
driving up mass incarceration.

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:14.530
And our thought is let's
get the data out there.

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:18.619
Let's go out and educate
politicians and those folks who

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:21.260
live in those communities
on how they're actually

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:26.180
contributing to this overall
emphasis on incarceration.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.530
Just wanted to make that plug.

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:36.620
But I did want to ask you a
question though about stories

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:41.990
and surfacing stories, which
you do in your podcast.

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:47.450
To Bonita's point
about media literacy--

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:50.780
there's a role there of
surfacing news stories that

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:56.330
are actually getting suppressed
because of the deluge of what

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.700
we're reading in the
newspapers that are important.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.680
Can you tell us a
little bit about that,

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.477
like some stories that
you've recently come across?

00:18:03.477 --> 00:18:04.310
DERAY MCKESSON: Yes.

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:05.550
The podcast is called
"Pod Save The People."

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:06.258
Shout out to Sam.

00:18:06.258 --> 00:18:07.550
Sam is on the podcast, too.

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:10.812
Sam is here-- love Sam.

00:18:10.812 --> 00:18:12.520
So when I started the
podcast a year ago,

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.830
I wanted the first half to be
about all the news you don't

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:16.120
know that's really important.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.080
You're going to hear about Trump
whether you want to or not.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.600
So we didn't feel like we needed
to spend a whole lot of time

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.940
on him, because you're
going to hear him anyway.

00:18:25.211 --> 00:18:26.710
The way it works
is the four of us--

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:28.330
everybody picks their
piece of news every week,

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:29.240
they put it in the group chat.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.850
We don't hear your argument
about the news until we record.

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:34.522
So we're learning
when you say it.

00:18:34.522 --> 00:18:35.980
And there's some
things-- there was

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.440
a study that says that there's
pushing back on the idea

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.292
that people get more
conservative as they get older.

00:18:41.292 --> 00:18:43.750
And what the study is saying
is that poor people and people

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:46.190
of color actually
just never get older.

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:48.604
So it's not that people are
getting more conservative,

00:18:48.604 --> 00:18:51.270
it's that some people just never
have the luxury of getting old.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.140
And you're like, hadn't
thought about that--

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:54.340
that's really interesting.

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:57.040
Or on the news tomorrow--
you probably heard

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.570
about the straw ban in Seattle.

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:01.570
People talk about it as
a really important thing

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:02.450
for the environment.

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:04.325
The disability community
is really frustrated

00:19:04.325 --> 00:19:08.070
because there are people with
disabilities who needs straws.

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.840
And when you have now
made straws illegal,

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.420
what happens for people
who can't use their hands,

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.375
for people who need
disposable straws?

00:19:15.375 --> 00:19:17.500
A permanent straw is not
actually the most hygienic

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.560
for a set of people.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.061
So trying to look at these
issues that people take for

00:19:21.061 --> 00:19:23.060
granted and look at them
from a different angle.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.851
The straw story is
really interesting, too,

00:19:24.851 --> 00:19:27.490
because it's all predicated on
this study that says that we

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:29.590
use 500 million straws a day.

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:31.390
When you ask about
the study, the study

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:34.820
comes from a nine-year-old
who did a phone survey.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:35.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.680
That literally is the
source of the study.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.529
So Snopes and everybody
has tried to figure out,

00:19:41.529 --> 00:19:42.820
what's the source of the study?

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:44.694
And the guy's like, I
did it when I was nine.

00:19:44.694 --> 00:19:48.280
He's 16 now and
people are like--

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.470
every major news organization
has cited this study

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:53.050
as 500 million straws a day.

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:56.060
And you're like, uh--

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:59.130
was that a science fair project?

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:00.770
Where did the straw
study come from?

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:04.270
So we try and look at these
issues from a different angle,

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:06.989
hopefully setting listeners up
with a different set of skills

00:20:06.989 --> 00:20:08.530
to be able to ask
questions and think

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:11.504
about things in a way they
might not have otherwise.

00:20:11.504 --> 00:20:12.670
And then we give interviews.

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:17.500
Tomorrow is Ocasio-Cortez, who
is a big deal here in New York

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.790
and across the country.

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.949
And she was even more
impressive in person.

00:20:20.949 --> 00:20:22.990
We're going to have to
edit some of the interview

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.610
because it was an hour and
the whole podcast is an hour.

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:27.985
But I asked her this
question about her mom.

00:20:27.985 --> 00:20:29.860
I'm like, was your mom
there on election day?

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.485
And she's like, yeah,
my mom was there.

00:20:31.485 --> 00:20:33.693
And there wasn't really a
story about election night.

00:20:33.693 --> 00:20:35.500
She was like, my mom
stayed the next day,

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.450
and she's like, I was
doing all this media--

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:38.530
this is more media
than I've ever

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:39.780
done so I wasn't at the house.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.240
And she's like, my mom
calls and is like, hey,

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.780
the "New York
Post" just came by.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:44.920
She's like, OK, how was it?

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.390
She was like, oh, chill
interview-- not a big deal.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.274
And she's like, OK.

00:20:49.274 --> 00:20:50.690
Next day, front
page of the "Post"

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:52.690
is, Ocasio-Cortez
running for president.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:56.220
And she was like, mom,
what did you say to them?

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.905
And she's like, I told them my
baby could be present one day.

00:20:58.905 --> 00:20:59.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.110
She's like, never,
ever talk to the press.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:03.220
You're banned.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.710
If people-- just tell
them I'm not home.

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:10.140
She had other things
to say about politics.

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.349
But I thought she
was so great with it.

00:21:13.349 --> 00:21:15.640
But it was this conversation
when I started the podcast

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.190
about, how do we invite
people into conversations

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:20.590
that they might not
be a part of before?

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:24.055
So Ocasio-Cortez, we had
Snowden on really early.

00:21:24.055 --> 00:21:26.680
He was the third interview I did
to talk about the intersection

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.220
of security and race.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.179
Because Snowden doesn't
really talk about race.

00:21:30.179 --> 00:21:31.678
But I wanted to
create a space so we

00:21:31.678 --> 00:21:33.940
can talk about what race
looks like in the security

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.041
conversation.

00:21:35.041 --> 00:21:36.540
And those sort of
things-- we wanted

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:40.600
to be a home and a place led by
activists, where we could just

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.487
say what we want that
we believe is true.

00:21:43.487 --> 00:21:45.070
BONITA STEWART: If
you have questions,

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.100
this is an opportunity
to start lining up

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.740
and then we have a few
more questions for DeRay.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.960
I want to just circle back
on the law enforcement.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.290
We talked about
podcasts and audio

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:59.050
and the importance of audio.

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:04.670
But now, technology is
coming to police enforcement.

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:10.730
How do you think from an audio
perspective and technology--

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:16.940
the fact that this is now
being captured with video,

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.430
there's audio.

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:25.680
What is your view of the
technology in the law

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.970
enforcement and how you think
it will be used or not used?

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.520
Or the consequences we were
talking earlier about--

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:38.869
are there consequences based
on now having actual proof?

00:22:38.869 --> 00:22:40.410
DERAY MCKESSON: So
I think technology

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:43.180
has been in policing for better
or for worse for a long time.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.760
I think body cameras
are the newest

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.180
iteration that most people
have public language about.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.180
When the Obama administration
was still in play,

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.650
we had been talking
to their team.

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:54.030
They were partnering
with the university

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:56.280
to figure out if they could
use the audio specifically

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.680
to measure aggression
in an officer's voice.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.570
So not just looking
at the video,

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:03.300
but could we see spikes in
temper and things like that

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.410
just by the audio?

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:06.150
Which is an interesting
way to think

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:09.180
about using body cameras that
don't just rely on the footage.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.570
So that's an interesting thing.

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:12.774
I think we should follow-up
and see where they are.

00:23:12.774 --> 00:23:14.190
There is new
technology, too, that

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:19.020
allows to trigger
the body cameras,

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.640
like, when a police
door opens, things

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.110
like that, that don't
require the officer

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:23.640
to press a button
anymore, but just

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.520
automatically turn on the
dash cam or things like that.

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.490
We're in the minority
in the movement

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:31.110
conversation about cameras.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:34.050
Because a lot of people rightly
are nervous about body cameras

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:35.780
as being another
tool of surveillance.

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:39.346
That if community policing
really is your code for putting

00:23:39.346 --> 00:23:41.970
police in black neighborhoods--
because they're not going to be

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.386
on the Upper West Side in the
same way you're putting them

00:23:44.386 --> 00:23:45.490
in other places--

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:47.790
and if community policing
becomes this idea

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:50.550
that the police need to know
my kid's name not to kill them.

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:53.370
You don't need to play football
with my child not to kill him.

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:56.640
But that is how people use this
idea of community policing.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.837
If that is the case, you
put cameras on people

00:23:58.837 --> 00:24:01.170
and now you just are surveilling
the whole neighborhood.

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:02.940
So that is not a good thing.

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.680
What is interesting
about the video thing

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.860
is that in the 1%
of police officers

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.650
who are ever charged
with anything,

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:12.730
videos are actually
really important.

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:14.190
So that's where you get stuck.

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:15.648
It is the likelihood
of you getting

00:24:15.648 --> 00:24:17.310
charged without a video--

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:19.260
it's probably not happening.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:22.020
The video is our
only slight pathway

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.910
to there being some
sort of accountability,

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.880
which is why we veer to
video rather than not video.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.610
Which is a complicated
piece about it.

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.160
With all the technology
used in policing,

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.470
we believe that there
should be public oversight.

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:36.690
So what you find
in a lot of cities

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:39.210
is that the body camera
footage is actually

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:41.206
under the purview of
the police department.

00:24:41.206 --> 00:24:42.330
Only the police department.

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:43.620
Nobody has access to it.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.260
We don't believe that
that is a just way

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.580
to think about
any of this stuff.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:49.600
And that is really hard.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.790
So I that we're
in this new space

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:52.206
where people now
have the language

00:24:52.206 --> 00:24:54.570
to talk about the technology.

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:56.910
But the police would advocate
for all types of stuff.

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:58.320
They want facial recognition.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.330
It's like, y'all aren't
solving any crimes any better.

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:03.930
None of that's going to build
the trust that you broke.

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:05.359
And you broke the trust.

00:25:05.359 --> 00:25:06.900
I'm not convinced
technology is going

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.510
to be the salve
for how you rebuild

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:11.790
that trust in communities,
even if police want

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:13.718
that to be the magic bullet.

00:25:13.718 --> 00:25:16.650
BONITA STEWART: Interesting.

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:19.490
WILLIAM FLOYD: Why
don't we go to some Q&amp;A

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:20.770
before we come to a close.

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:21.853
BONITA STEWART: Johnathan.

00:25:21.853 --> 00:25:23.895
WILLIAM FLOYD: Johnathan,
why don't you start us.

00:25:23.895 --> 00:25:26.394
AUDIENCE: First of all, I just
want to say thank you, DeRay,

00:25:26.394 --> 00:25:28.770
not only for being here today
and sharing all your wisdom

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:31.940
with us, but for the sacrifices
that you've put yourself

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.690
in front of and the
sacrifices that you've

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:34.606
made in this movement.

00:25:34.606 --> 00:25:36.660
Because you've put
your body, your health,

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.786
and your time on the
line time and time again.

00:25:38.786 --> 00:25:40.410
So personally, I just
want to thank you

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:41.868
for that, because
that is something

00:25:41.868 --> 00:25:45.270
that often goes overlooked
when we talk about this work.

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:47.140
Two quick questions for you.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:51.270
First question being, when we
think about the work of making

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:53.880
change scalable-- something at
Google, we always talk about,

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.320
how can we solve
problems at scale?

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.927
And so oftentimes, people
grab on to one thing.

00:25:58.927 --> 00:26:01.260
Well, if we get body cameras,
that will solve the issue.

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:04.080
Or if we make sure that we
have community policing,

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.260
that will solve the issue.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:09.130
But these issues are much
deeper than just one solution.

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:10.872
So how, when you have
these conversations

00:26:10.872 --> 00:26:12.330
and try to get
people involved, how

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:15.540
do you keep a level of
depth to the conversation,

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.370
but still make it
attainable for people

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:19.110
to feel like, I feel
I can get involved--

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:21.690
this isn't too big enough
for me to get involved.

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:23.700
And the second
question I have is,

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:25.530
you have a popular
saying on the podcast

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:27.720
that we each owe a debt
that we can never pay back.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.610
So it's our job
to pay it forward

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:31.650
and to pay it to
the next generation.

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:34.080
How do you live that and
how do you pay it forward?

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.580
DERAY MCKESSON: So
one of the things

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:36.525
I didn't say about
the technology thing

00:26:36.525 --> 00:26:39.300
that I just thought of is
that what we learned recently

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:42.630
is that the biggest producer
of body cameras in the country

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:47.370
actually intentionally makes
the quality of the body cameras

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:50.730
really awful, to not be
better than the human eye.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:53.086
Because they want it
to be so that officers

00:26:53.086 --> 00:26:54.960
can say that they were
confused about the toy

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.532
gun or the real gun.

00:26:56.532 --> 00:26:57.990
But we actually
know the technology

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:00.180
exists today that can make
the body camera footage

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:01.450
crystal clear.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:04.650
But you've never seen a
crystal clear body camera.

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:06.689
Not because cameras
are bad in 2018,

00:27:06.689 --> 00:27:08.730
but because they're
intentionally made to be bad.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:11.640
So what would it look like if
we believe that body cameras are

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.120
part of the solution for
another company to make them

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.830
with clear footage.

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:19.080
So that you can't confuse
a toy gun with a real gun.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.650
Because on the footage we
would see that it is not.

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:23.580
We learned recently
that they actually

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:26.970
want the quality to be grainy,
so that there can be confusion.

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:29.830
Which is a wild, wild thing.

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:31.860
Your first question
about what do we.

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:37.380
We believe that 10 years ago, we
didn't know how we got here per

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:38.750
se, but we knew we were here.

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:40.650
We knew there was all these
black people getting locked up.

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:42.525
We knew there was all
these wild disparities.

00:27:42.525 --> 00:27:43.484
But we didn't know how.

00:27:43.484 --> 00:27:45.649
Now we're at a place-- and
this is one of the things

00:27:45.649 --> 00:27:48.150
that Sam and I and Brittany
are trying to figure out.

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:50.860
What would it be like to map
all the things that got us here?

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.960
So from mapping all
the felony theft

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.640
amounts across the
country to how much

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.440
prison phone calls cost to
all the contracts for ICE.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.910
What if we create a space
that is like, here's

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:05.870
how mass incarceration is
upheld in your city and town

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:08.204
and it's just there for people?

00:28:08.204 --> 00:28:09.870
So activists and
organizers and citizens

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:13.960
no longer have to spend 10 years
trying to find that random law

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.337
or uncover that thing.

00:28:15.337 --> 00:28:16.920
They actually know
what it is already.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.420
So they spend their
energy fighting

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:20.675
it as opposed to finding it.

00:28:20.675 --> 00:28:22.050
And so much of
the work right now

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:23.880
is people-- you spend all
day trying to find it.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.546
You're like, I think
this thing is bad--

00:28:25.546 --> 00:28:26.939
I don't know how it got here--

00:28:26.939 --> 00:28:27.480
I don't know.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.521
But we actually believe
that in this day and age,

00:28:29.521 --> 00:28:30.850
we can actually do that work.

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:33.210
A set of us can figure out
how to build that thing.

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:36.060
So you can know the felony
theft amount in your town.

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:38.791
You can know how many people
were killed by the police.

00:28:38.791 --> 00:28:41.290
I don't know if you remember
when Alton Sterling got killed,

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:43.690
there was a press conference
by the police chief.

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.270
And the police chief,
one of the things he says

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:47.490
is like, you should pick up
the phone and file a complaint.

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:48.755
In Baton Rouge, you
actually can't file

00:28:48.755 --> 00:28:49.880
a complaint over the phone.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.744
So that was a weird
thing that he said.

00:28:52.744 --> 00:28:54.660
There are a lot of places
in the country where

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:57.150
you can't file anonymous
complaints against the police.

00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:59.100
Every complaint has
to be signed and you

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:02.070
have to swear an
oath that it is true.

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:05.410
Mind you, I can call in 10
anonymous complaints about any

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:08.040
of you all right now to the
New York City Police Department

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.870
and they would take it as fact.

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:12.030
So how do we set it
up so that you already

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.520
know what the good and bad is
and you can fight about that?

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:15.978
And we spent a lot
of time on that.

00:29:15.978 --> 00:29:18.300
We believe that that is a
good on ramp for people.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.019
So you don't have to spend
all day trying to figure out

00:29:21.019 --> 00:29:22.560
what is bad and what
is not, somebody

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:23.869
can tell you those things.

00:29:23.869 --> 00:29:25.660
The second thing is
that the more you know,

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:26.534
the better you'll do.

00:29:26.534 --> 00:29:29.355
And there are people who
believe in immigration stuff

00:29:29.355 --> 00:29:31.105
and don't know anything
about immigration.

00:29:31.105 --> 00:29:33.180
You're like, that's
not really helpful.

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.610
So the closer, the more
proximate you are to an issue--

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:38.487
you find people, especially
people with skills in this way.

00:29:38.487 --> 00:29:40.320
They start to ask more
questions and they're

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.695
like, let me build a thing or
let me test this thing out,

00:29:42.695 --> 00:29:43.860
or let me partner.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.920
Those things are actually
really, really powerful.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.200
The idea of paying it forward--

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.060
what I try to do is, how do we
create space for other people?

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:54.670
So one of the things about the
pod is that, because it's mine,

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:56.759
I can get anybody on I want to.

00:29:56.759 --> 00:29:58.800
I was telling them backstage,
I had Stacey Abrams

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:03.780
on four months before it
was even a thing in Georgia.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.790
But she was like, I
need to be on early.

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:07.124
I'm like, got you.

00:30:07.124 --> 00:30:09.540
There's a black guy running
for the governor of Wisconsin.

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:10.770
I didn't even know he--

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:13.103
I didn't know there were a
lot of black people in Wisc--

00:30:13.103 --> 00:30:13.890
I didn't know.

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:15.350
We had him on, he was great.

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:16.517
He used to be a firefighter.

00:30:16.517 --> 00:30:18.016
We had this whole
great conversation

00:30:18.016 --> 00:30:18.870
about firefighting.

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:21.200
I asked him, is being a
firefighter on TV anything

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.680
like it is in real life?

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.680
And he's like, no, obviously.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.260
And he was like, if you
see firefighters on TV

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:29.930
shows talk in a burning
building, that's

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:31.025
the craziest thing ever.

00:30:31.025 --> 00:30:31.650
You can't talk.

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:33.770
He's like, the
building's burning.

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:35.720
He's like, there's no
conversations happening

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.750
in burning buildings.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:38.050
I was think, ah!

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:42.930
He also said,
occupational cancer

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:44.960
is the biggest cause of
death in firefighters.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.600
And I was like, is it the smoke?

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.725
And he was like, yeah, it's
not just smoke, though.

00:30:48.725 --> 00:30:50.960
It's what happens
when furniture burns.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.720
And I was like, if I wasn't
doing all this justice stuff,

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.719
I would do a whole project
on furniture burning.

00:30:55.719 --> 00:30:57.800
I hadn't even thought
about how the smoke changes

00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.600
when a refrigerator burns
and what that means.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.470
And he was like, after
20 years, it just

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:04.580
will seep into your skin.

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:05.900
It just will.

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.510
So the podcast is an interesting
space where we get to put

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:11.060
people on in a way that
otherwise wouldn't.

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:13.170
And the other thing is
that we spend a lot of time

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.140
connecting people behind
the scenes with this idea

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:16.860
that all the bad
people know each other,

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:19.276
even if they don't like each
other-- insert the Republican

00:31:19.276 --> 00:31:20.240
Party right now.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.070
The good people don't
all know each other.

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:24.731
So when we meet a dope artist
or a dope whatever, it's like,

00:31:24.731 --> 00:31:25.730
do you know this person?

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:27.230
Let me connect you
with this person.

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:29.610
So that we can create a
network of people who all

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:31.623
are a part of the same fight.

00:31:31.623 --> 00:31:34.707
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:34.707 --> 00:31:35.290
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:37.900
My name is Andrew Lebowitz,
I'm a new person to Google.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:38.840
I just wanted to
say, first of all,

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:39.980
thank you to DeRay
for doing the pod.

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.400
I love Crooked Media,
definitely listen to it a lot.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.232
Long drives in the car--
definitely makes it get easier.

00:31:45.232 --> 00:31:47.440
I wanted to run something
by you and get your opinion

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.600
on something.

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.740
It's from a book labeled
"Anti-Semite and Jew"

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:53.800
from 1944, published after
France was liberated but while

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.745
the Holocaust was
reaching a crescendo.

00:31:55.745 --> 00:31:59.590
It's by the philosopher
Jean-Paul Sartre.

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:01.120
"Never believe that
anti-Semites are

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.640
completely unaware of the
absurdity of their replies.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.310
They know that their remarks are
frivolous, open to challenge.

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:08.650
But they are amusing
themselves, for it

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:11.050
is their adversary who
is obliged to use words

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:12.070
responsibly.

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:14.320
Since he believes in
words, the anti-Semites

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.719
have the right to play.

00:32:15.719 --> 00:32:17.260
They even like to
play with discourse

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.850
for by giving
ridiculous reasons,

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:22.570
they discredit the seriousness
of their interlockers.

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:24.280
They delight in
acting in bad faith

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.560
since they seek not to
persuade by sound argument,

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.660
but to intimidate
and disconcert.

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:31.360
If you press them too closely,
they will abruptly fall silent.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.980
Loftily indicating
by some phrase

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.812
that the time for
argument is past."

00:32:34.812 --> 00:32:37.270
DERAY MCKESSON: I think that
one of the ways that whiteness

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:40.060
works is that whiteness
always sets a set of rules

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:41.490
that it never has to play by.

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:43.210
That is one of the
fundamental things.

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:44.950
So when you think about Trump--

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:48.040
it's incredible that Trump gets
to be this person who believes

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.540
in the importance
of law enforcement

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:52.080
while literally
dismantling the FBI.

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:52.799
If I came out--

00:32:52.799 --> 00:32:54.340
the FBI has already
visited my house.

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:56.470
But if I came out
and said this stuff--

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:58.960
if I said half the stuff
that he says about the FBI,

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.070
I get another visit.

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:01.960
But he is just firing
people left and right,

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:05.320
but still believes in law
enforcement or anything

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.420
about women and family value.

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:11.320
It's a fascinating
thing that happens.

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.060
My only reflection on that is--

00:33:15.291 --> 00:33:17.290
Ocasio-Cortez said this,
she was like, we should

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:19.090
be swinging for the fences.

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:20.780
The we go-- what does is it?

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:23.500
When they go low, we go high.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.260
We might go high into
oblivion sooner or later.

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:28.570
Our high should be because
we're swinging and fighting

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:31.160
everything below
us, not because we

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.270
are taking the high ground
in this moral space.

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:35.320
Especially when we're
fighting people who have

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.110
a loose sense of morals at all.

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:41.140
What I'm also reminded is that
change can come really quickly.

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.810
If they can rewrite the
tax code on scrap paper,

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:46.390
then we can do all this
stuff really quickly.

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:48.520
And part of the way that
the power balance works

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.700
is that we think that we have to
make this 20-year case, and da,

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:53.800
da, da.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.109
We don't actually have to--

00:33:55.109 --> 00:33:56.650
they literally
rewrote the tax code--

00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:58.090
I'm not being dramatic--
on the back of scrap paper.

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:00.370
It literally was on the
back of scrap paper.

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:02.230
And the congress people
hadn't even read it.

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:05.210
If they can do that, we can undo
all this stuff pretty quickly.

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:07.180
But half the battle
is convincing people

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.630
that that's even possible.

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:10.290
And we've got to
figure that out.

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:12.281
On the pod tomorrow
that comes out,

00:34:12.281 --> 00:34:14.489
we talk about the Trump
administration has declared--

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:16.310
literally, I'm not being
dramatic-- they have declared

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:17.839
the war on party
over, that there

00:34:17.839 --> 00:34:19.120
is no more poverty in America.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.320
That is a new point
that he just put out.

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:24.777
In the UN, there are 18.5
million people in poverty.

00:34:24.777 --> 00:34:26.610
Literally, Nikki Haley's
team is like, there

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:29.050
are only 250,000 people
in poverty in the country.

00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:31.219
You're like, what is going on?

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:34.929
But it is interesting that they
get that the original power is

00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:36.600
in definition.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.839
Being able to define the
terms is a huge sense of power

00:34:39.839 --> 00:34:41.681
and we can't concede that.

00:34:41.681 --> 00:34:43.389
And I think that we
have in so many ways.

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:44.679
You think about
even 'Abolish ICE'--

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:45.678
ICE should be abolished.

00:34:45.678 --> 00:34:46.760
ICE is bad.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.960
The end of ICE is
not the presence

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.280
of a pathway to citizenship.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.630
And we have confused it to.

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:55.120
So we can get ICE
out of here and still

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.490
have not won anything about
the immigration battle

00:34:57.490 --> 00:34:59.110
that we're actually fighting.

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:01.960
And part of that is that we've
ceded some ground on what

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.100
the immigration battle is.

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.740
The immigration battle
is not a battle of ICE.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:08.115
The immigration battle is
about a pathway to citizenship.

00:35:08.115 --> 00:35:10.448
And what we would say is that
the pathway to citizenship

00:35:10.448 --> 00:35:13.060
does not require the detention
and deportation of people.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:14.210
That is where ICE fits in.

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:16.900
But the macro argument
is always the big fight

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.984
we should be having, and we
lose that battle so many times.

00:35:19.984 --> 00:35:22.150
AUDIENCE: What do we do to
keep it, in your opinion?

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:23.920
DERAY MCKESSON: I think that
we fight it even when it feels

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:24.950
like we shouldn't.

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:26.810
So the ICE thing is--

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:28.479
everybody who
believes in a pathway

00:35:28.479 --> 00:35:30.520
to citizenship, that should
be our talking point.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.895
Every day should be like, and
ICE should be a part of it,

00:35:32.895 --> 00:35:35.530
but the macro argument is
about a pathway to citizenship.

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:37.406
It's not fighting about
this little thing.

00:35:37.406 --> 00:35:38.780
Because if we get
the end of ICE,

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:41.270
that actually still doesn't
get us a pathway to citizen--

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:43.990
we can get this small thing
and still not win the battle.

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:46.150
The right is really
good about always imag--

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:47.220
we know their vision.

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.370
Kick everybody out.

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:49.240
Can't come here.

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.370
White people onl--
their affirmative

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:53.500
is pretty clear to us.

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.100
And it was projected
that the country

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.260
is going to be a majority
minority by 2043-ish.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:01.600
It's now projected that the net
effect of his immigration act

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:04.090
is going to delay that
by another 10 years.

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:07.000
So they are playing a game
with a set of outcomes

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:07.960
that they get.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.674
And we get so invested
in the emotional piece--

00:36:10.674 --> 00:36:12.340
because you shouldn't
put kids in cages,

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:13.800
that is a true thing--

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.450
that sometimes we forget
the macro argument

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:17.980
that is actually the battle.

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.990
AUDIENCE: That's fair.

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.740
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:21.990
Thanks so much for being here.

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.990
I'm a huge fan.

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:25.035
I've been following
since Ferguson--

00:36:25.035 --> 00:36:26.780
since I was in law
school, watching

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:31.360
the videos coming straight
from people on the streets.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.870
And yeah, just appreciate
all the work that you do.

00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:35.740
My name's Alex.

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:38.840
I work at the Bronx Freedom
Fund, a revolving community

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.455
bail fund in the
Bronx and Queens.

00:36:41.455 --> 00:36:45.310
So I really appreciate you
mentioning bail and then

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:49.210
this farce that the
war on poverty is over.

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:52.820
Because there are currently
3,000 men and women,

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:55.090
predominantly of
color, on Rikers Island

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:57.190
right now who are only
there because they

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:58.610
can't afford to pay their bail.

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.970
And also, a lot of
them are children.

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:09.350
16 and 17-year-olds are still
on Rikers Island right now.

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:12.160
So I like that you
highlighted the fact

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:17.090
that there is currently
a scarcity of bail data.

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:20.110
So plug for us-- we're
actually spearheading

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:22.000
a court watching program.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.300
So if you're interested
on collecting bail data

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:30.360
or analyzing it, come
and see me outside.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:34.420
But what is the role of
community bail funds in turning

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:35.924
awareness into action?

00:37:35.924 --> 00:37:37.840
DERAY MCKESSON: So a
couple things about bail.

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.220
One, I want to believe-- and
I know nothing about tech.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.849
These are my dreams you
guys are going to hear.

00:37:42.849 --> 00:37:44.390
I want to believe
that somebody could

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:46.100
build a scraping
something that could

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.740
scrape all the
stenographer's notes

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:51.502
and make the bail data so
we don't have to only do--

00:37:51.502 --> 00:37:53.710
court watching is the only
way that we have any data.

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:56.080
And Chicago has a great
dataset from court watching.

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.350
I'm excited that
you're going to do it.

00:37:57.350 --> 00:37:59.920
We should do that because that's
the best we can do right now.

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:02.003
But because we know somebody
is in the court room,

00:38:02.003 --> 00:38:03.950
writing down the
approved bail amount--

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:06.560
it is on a paper somewhere.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:07.550
If that scan--

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:09.637
I want to believe some
smart person can figure out

00:38:09.637 --> 00:38:10.720
how to put that somewhere.

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:12.220
So that's my plug for it.

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:14.911
If that is what any of
you do, please make it.

00:38:14.911 --> 00:38:16.160
AUDIENCE: I've looked into it.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.370
So actually, you can get
the court transcripts

00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:21.800
from arraignments,
but they cost money.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.290
So it's really
just a money issue.

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:23.810
But it is possible.

00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:24.620
DERAY MCKESSON:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:25.890
We've been trying to
figure out, is there

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:27.270
a way-- we should
talk after this.

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:29.853
We've been impressed with this
for a couple years, being like,

00:38:29.853 --> 00:38:32.765
we know there has to
be a way to do this.

00:38:32.765 --> 00:38:35.015
The only missed opportunity
with the bail conversation

00:38:35.015 --> 00:38:36.295
is that people still--

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:41.420
emotionally, people
shouldn't be in jail

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:43.480
because of money things.

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.500
That's what they'll say
in a room like this.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:46.850
Then when you talk to them
privately they're like,

00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:47.910
but they killed somebody.

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:50.300
That's they're go-to.

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:52.272
Because everybody
has killed somebody--

00:38:52.272 --> 00:38:54.230
if you've been in jail,
you've killed somebody.

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:56.150
That's people's idea of it.

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.930
Which is not true.

00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:59.240
We arrest more people for
weed than all violent crimes

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:00.980
combined in this country.

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.257
That is also wild.

00:39:02.257 --> 00:39:04.340
But I think that what we've
not done a good job of

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:06.381
is helping people understand
what the end of bail

00:39:06.381 --> 00:39:07.750
actually looks like.

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:10.610
That when bail goes away,
it's replaced by three things.

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:13.017
Either you're just released
on your own recognizance,

00:39:13.017 --> 00:39:15.350
you're released with some
sort of community supervision,

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:17.374
like a check-in, an anklet,
something like that,

00:39:17.374 --> 00:39:19.790
or you're detained in what's
called preventative detention

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:21.650
because you actually
did kill 10 people,

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:24.290
like something was a real
problem so you probably

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:26.360
shouldn't be out in society.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:29.700
Everybody can be an expert
on explaining those three,

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:30.950
thinking about those three.

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:32.740
In the places we've
seen this happen--

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.820
DC got rid of
money bail in 1990.

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.680
One, the world didn't end.

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:39.390
This is actually not a
radical thing anymore.

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:41.140
We've actually already done it.

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:43.890
And there are a lot of
benefits to being out on bail.

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:46.580
People who are out on bail, they
do better in their court case.

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:46.850
Why?

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:48.516
Because they have
time to prepare that's

00:39:48.516 --> 00:39:49.311
not in a jail cell.

00:39:49.311 --> 00:39:51.560
There are all these things
that are a part of the bail

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.420
conversation I think
that we've just left out

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:54.836
a little bit because
we had people

00:39:54.836 --> 00:39:57.399
hooked on the emotional
part about money.

00:39:57.399 --> 00:39:59.690
But what I found is that
privately, people are actually

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:01.330
less hooked on that.

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:03.830
They waver a little bit on that
thing, because they're like,

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:04.705
they killed somebody.

00:40:04.705 --> 00:40:07.030
You're like, they didn't
kill somebody though.

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:08.780
Or if they're accused
of killing somebody,

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:10.113
they should have a real defense.

00:40:10.113 --> 00:40:13.037
And I think that is what I want
to see us do better in the bail

00:40:13.037 --> 00:40:15.120
and help people understand
that the bail funds are

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.454
the stopgap until we end bail.

00:40:17.454 --> 00:40:19.370
Some people think the
bail fund is the answer.

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:20.150
And you're like, no, no, no.

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:22.358
It's the answer today,
because we haven't figured out

00:40:22.358 --> 00:40:23.340
how to end bail.

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:25.940
But the end of bail is
not even radical anymore.

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:28.210
We did it 20 years ago.

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:29.620
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:31.869
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much
for being here and for all

00:40:31.869 --> 00:40:32.390
that you do.

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:33.830
Two part question.

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:35.259
Obviously, there's
so much and has

00:40:35.259 --> 00:40:36.800
been for so many
years that makes you

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.770
feel like you're losing hope.

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:42.120
When you think forward to
2018 and maybe into 2020,

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.954
are there candidates
out there that

00:40:43.954 --> 00:40:45.370
really bring you
hope and you feel

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:47.720
are inspiring that need
for change that we're all

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.010
looking for?

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:50.750
And then the second
piece is, since you

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:53.950
asked this of all your
guests on the pod, what

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:57.130
is a piece of advice that
has really stuck with you?

00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:59.530
DERAY MCKESSON: That is a
question that I ask on the pod.

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:02.150
Ocasio-Cortez was more impress--

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:04.420
I already loved her, and
then I met her and was like,

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.080
I might quit my job
and come work for Oc--

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.020
literally, me and Sam--

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:09.510
she doesn't have a policy person
and Sam does all our policy.

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:11.093
We both had this
moment like, Sam, you

00:41:11.093 --> 00:41:12.100
should go do her policy.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:13.890
Sam, you can't go
because we need you,

00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:15.770
but Ocasio-Cortez
needs you, too.

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:18.050
So Stacey Abrams, I'm
really hopeful about.

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:19.550
Mahlon Mitchell,
who's running to be

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:20.990
the governor of Wisconsin.

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:23.570
Ben Jealous, who is running to
be the governor of Maryland.

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:25.230
I'm excited about those people.

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.730
It's hard.

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:28.919
There's so many candidates
who want to be on the pod.

00:41:28.919 --> 00:41:30.460
I would just have
a pod of candidates

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:32.870
because there's so many
incredible people running,

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:35.150
so I just don't
get to all of them.

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:37.310
But I'm hopeful about
what we could do.

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:39.910
I'm interested in after
'18 how we actually

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:41.474
build a basin for 2020.

00:41:41.474 --> 00:41:43.640
How do we do that in a way
that's really thoughtful?

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:45.440
I think that getting out the
vote and all this stuff for '18

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.070
is really important.

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:48.110
I'm hopeful that we'll
be successful in taking

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:49.610
one part of Congress back.

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:51.950
But the game in 2020--
he could win again.

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:53.430
And I remember--
I supported him--

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:54.512
I supp-- I supported him.

00:41:54.512 --> 00:41:55.220
That is not true.

00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:56.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:00.110
My phone got hacked and I did
tweet out support for Trump.

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:02.692
But that was because
somebody hacked my phone.

00:42:02.692 --> 00:42:05.150
But I supported Hillary in "The
Washington Post" and people

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:07.132
really slammed me for--

00:42:07.132 --> 00:42:08.090
why are you doing this?

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:09.140
She's such a hypocrite.

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:10.556
It was like, because
he could win.

00:42:10.556 --> 00:42:11.630
This is real.

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:12.832
I believe him.

00:42:12.832 --> 00:42:15.290
And I remember talking to a
senior member of Hillary's team

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:17.040
not too long ago, and
she was like, DeRay,

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.960
there are people in the Muslim
community calling us now

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:21.350
and there are people in all
these racial minorities calling

00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:22.600
us being like, what can we do?

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.800
And she's like, I
tried to tell you all.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.126
I believe that--
again, about 2020--

00:42:27.126 --> 00:42:29.750
I remember people saying, DeRay,
he doesn't have a ground game.

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:30.916
He's not doing doorknocking.

00:42:30.916 --> 00:42:33.139
The Trump campaign did none
of the traditional stuff.

00:42:33.139 --> 00:42:35.180
Partly because the Russians
helped them, but also

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:39.520
because they knew that racism
was enough of a ground game.

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.200
That was actually an
effective strategy.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.390
And they will be able
to mobilize that again

00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:45.250
in 2020, unless
we figure out how

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:47.350
to build a different
electorate and tell

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:49.557
a different story about the
power of people's votes.

00:42:49.557 --> 00:42:51.140
And I think that we
are close to that.

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:52.676
I don't think that
we're there yet.

00:42:52.676 --> 00:42:54.550
And I was on the transition
team for the DNC,

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:58.192
so I believe in being on
the inside, da, da, da.

00:42:58.192 --> 00:42:59.900
I don't think they
got the answer either.

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.358
So I'm more committed
to, how do we

00:43:01.358 --> 00:43:04.730
build an infrastructure
outside of the system for 2020?

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:06.040
And I think that's important.

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:06.540
And

00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:09.123
Advise that I've gotten that's
stuck with me is this idea of--

00:43:12.961 --> 00:43:14.820
Cleo Wade, who is a
friend and a poet,

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:18.330
she has this saying that not
every ground is a battleground.

00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:19.350
And I really like that.

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:21.950
There's some times when
all we've done is fight--

00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:23.489
that's all we know how to do.

00:43:23.489 --> 00:43:25.280
And the fight has to
be a part of the work.

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.760
But there are some people who
every relationship is a battle,

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.340
because they have had to
fight the world for so long.

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:34.430
And I try and remind myself
that blackness is not only--

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:36.560
that we are more than
our pain, that we can

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:37.880
be something beautiful, too.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.830
And I never glorify--

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:43.160
people talk about this wave of
activism and like all of it.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.240
I'm like, yeah, it's a
lot of activism and stuff,

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.960
but I never want to glorify
the trauma that made us be

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:49.560
so active in the first place.

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:50.980
So I'm active because I
feel like I've got to be.

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:52.896
And I'm fighting for
the kids at [INAUDIBLE],,

00:43:52.896 --> 00:43:54.320
I'm fighting for
all these people.

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:56.320
But I should be able to
go back and be a teacher

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.330
and not have to worry about
the world falling apart.

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:01.430
I don't glorify the
pain that got us here

00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:03.770
and this idea of
not every ground

00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:05.516
is a battleground stays with me.

00:44:05.516 --> 00:44:07.700
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.360
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:12.110
A caveat on the
[INAUDIBLE] question is,

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:14.840
you talked about the data and
then also bringing the people

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:18.560
together to co--design,
so to speak,

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:22.670
what it is that this actionable
empathy can look like.

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:25.850
Any ideas on who those
organizations are?

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:28.220
Because you say you basically
are a dot connector.

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:29.750
So I'm wondering,
could you give us

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:32.150
some insight into who
those organizations are

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:35.107
and who are the people that
we should be working with?

00:44:35.107 --> 00:44:36.690
DERAY MCKESSON:
Here's the hard thing.

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:38.130
And Sam will be around
afterwards, too,

00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:39.290
so we can talk about this.

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:40.380
Sam, raise your hand.

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:40.880
We love Sam.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.290
Sam is great.

00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:44.990
I met Sam on Twitter
actually in 2015.

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:47.435
Sam literally tweeted, I want
to help out, or whatever.

00:44:47.435 --> 00:44:48.810
And I dinged him
my phone number.

00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:51.620
We had a great call, and I was
like, we should work together.

00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:53.250
We've been together
for a long time.

00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:57.830
But the hard part is that there
are two types of organizers.

00:44:57.830 --> 00:45:00.560
There's one set that really
wants to be the gatekeeper.

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.820
So they want you to do
as much work as you do,

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:05.090
as long as you keep
coming back to them.

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:06.980
There's another set of
organizers that say,

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:09.750
we want to give you the tools
for you to go do the thing.

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:11.810
There are way more of the
former than the latter.

00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:14.330
So some of the biggest
organizations doing good work

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:16.400
in this space
don't actually want

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.220
you to do anything that
is not the stuff that they

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:20.430
tell you to do.

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:22.000
And that's one of
the hardest pieces,

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.320
is that there aren't good
models of organization

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:28.010
to scale right now that could
take 2,000 volunteers, or 3,000

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:30.620
volunteers, or are
frankly interested in you

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:33.379
doing something that is
not at their direction.

00:45:33.379 --> 00:45:34.420
And that's the challenge.

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:35.836
What we would say
is that we think

00:45:35.836 --> 00:45:39.721
that we can build something that
allows more people to plug-in

00:45:39.721 --> 00:45:40.970
and then go do your own thing.

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:41.720
I don't care.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:42.710
If you want to--

00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:44.680
for example, there's
one company essentially,

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:46.430
that when people get
released from prison,

00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:48.200
the money they have
on commissary gets

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:49.890
put on a debit card--

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:51.816
something like a debit card.

00:45:51.816 --> 00:45:53.690
It's a debit card that
every time you use it,

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:55.070
it has a crazy transaction fee.

00:45:55.070 --> 00:45:56.310
It's a scam is what it is.

00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:57.685
AUDIENCE: It's
like the RushCard.

00:45:57.685 --> 00:46:00.000
DERAY MCKESSON: Yeah,
it's like-- ooooh.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:00.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:03.944
You're trying to get us in
trouble, talking about--

00:46:03.944 --> 00:46:05.360
it's something
like what you said.

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:09.980
But it's such a scam.

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:13.340
What I believe is that
if we made that public--

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:15.350
showed you every
place where that is--

00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:17.690
that if that was your
thing, you'd just go do it.

00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:19.710
You'd go dismantle it.

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:21.830
If you need help,
cool, we'll be there.

00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:23.690
But you don't need me to.

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:26.331
We did the first ever public
database of police [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:26.331 --> 00:46:28.580
in contracts and use of force
policies in the country,

00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:30.288
because nobody had
ever put them together

00:46:30.288 --> 00:46:31.460
so we did all this stuff.

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:33.260
Because there's some
places where we go and they

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:34.430
need our technical assistance.

00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:35.804
They need us to
come in and help,

00:46:35.804 --> 00:46:37.460
because we just
know the landscape.

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:38.720
There's some places
that use the data

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:39.790
and they just
fought on their own.

00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:40.665
And we're like, cool.

00:46:40.665 --> 00:46:42.380
As long as the outcome--

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:44.570
we don't care.

00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:47.090
What we do know is we
know the big buckets

00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:49.502
of where the problems are.

00:46:49.502 --> 00:46:50.960
What we're trying
to figure out is,

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.150
how do we get people
to help us find them?

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:58.370
So when we coded the 100
police unit contracts

00:46:58.370 --> 00:47:01.130
in the 100 largest cities,
we had all these volunteers

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:04.070
and Slack groups across the
country filling in Google Docs.

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:05.840
We're about to code
800 more, so we

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:09.560
have more volunteers helping us
sift through these contracts.

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:14.900
We can do it in two weeks what
would take us two years to do.

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:16.670
That's the interesting
scalable things.

00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:18.740
So there aren't great
models of it right now.

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:21.350
And what you find is that a lot
of even the best organizations

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:23.766
just don't-- they don't know
what they do with the dollars

00:47:23.766 --> 00:47:24.660
and the volunteers.

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:25.910
They just don't right now.

00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:27.890
So we're trying to
help people envision

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:30.646
organizing and being an activist
and a citizen differently.

00:47:30.646 --> 00:47:31.520
Does that make sense?

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:31.570
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:32.210
Yeah, yeah.

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:33.918
I'm going to talk to
Sam afterwards, too.

00:47:33.918 --> 00:47:34.670
Thank you.

00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:35.290
DERAY MCKESSON: Sam is in.

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:36.920
WILLIAM FLOYD: We have
time for one last question.

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:38.320
AUDIENCE: Oh, a lot of pressure.

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:39.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:41.230
WILLIAM FLOYD: Make it good.

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:43.760
AUDIENCE: So I've really enjoyed
everything that all of you

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:44.959
have been speaking about.

00:47:44.959 --> 00:47:46.000
And thank you for coming.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.540
Obviously, this has been
really, really helpful.

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:50.520
My question is around allyship.

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:55.010
So a lot of the things that
you're speaking around,

00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:57.560
a lot of times they come
off as minority problems,

00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:01.190
or black problems, or
problems that are focused

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:03.630
on one specific community.

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:05.789
But when I think back to
the Civil Rights movement,

00:48:05.789 --> 00:48:08.330
a lot of the people that were
in the crowd during the Freedom

00:48:08.330 --> 00:48:11.960
March, they were actually
people that were white.

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:14.390
So when you think
about allyship,

00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:17.550
I would be curious to hear
what you think about that.

00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:20.130
And who are people that you
think are doing that well?

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:22.460
And what's that call to
action look like for people

00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:23.984
that want to be allies?

00:48:23.984 --> 00:48:26.525
DERAY MCKESSON: So I think about
this big bucket is that when

00:48:26.525 --> 00:48:28.346
you think about allies
and accomplices--

00:48:28.346 --> 00:48:29.970
people's first
introduction to the work

00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:31.970
is almost always
being an ally and that

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:33.440
is standing in solidarity.

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:35.660
We think about
accomplices as people

00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:38.660
who see themselves
implicated in the work, too,

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:40.700
who are not just people
standing near you,

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:42.380
but standing side-by-side.

00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:46.600
Allies love you from a distance,
accomplices love you up close.

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:49.856
A difference of proximity
is the difference here.

00:48:49.856 --> 00:48:51.480
I was talking to
somebody the other day

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.060
who asked a similar question.

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:55.050
We were just one-on-one.

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:57.500
And he was like, I get
intersectionality--

00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:58.440
I get the idea.

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:00.650
But he's like, I
often need to think

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:03.392
about it in the frame of my
identity and I'm struggling.

00:49:03.392 --> 00:49:05.600
He's like, I'm not being
the best ally that I can be,

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.292
so can we talk about it?

00:49:07.292 --> 00:49:09.250
What I said to him is
that people misunderstand

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:12.590
intersectionality is about
being intersecting identities.

00:49:12.590 --> 00:49:15.640
And intersectionality is not
about intersecting identities.

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:18.070
Intersectionality is
about intersecting sets

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:19.840
of oppression.

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:24.670
So being a black, gay man
is about how my gayness

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:26.560
and being black intersect.

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:28.460
It's not just about
how my identity

00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:30.066
has just all come together.

00:49:30.066 --> 00:49:32.440
It is rooted in the idea that
these systems of oppression

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:33.164
intersect.

00:49:33.164 --> 00:49:34.330
And that's really important.

00:49:34.330 --> 00:49:36.663
And what I ask people now is,
when was the last time you

00:49:36.663 --> 00:49:38.080
didn't feel safe?

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.090
And what's interesting
is that when

00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:41.950
I've asked white men
when the last time

00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:43.380
they didn't feel safe,
they say things like,

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:43.960
when I didn't have money.

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:45.400
And I'm like, that
is fascinating.

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:46.976
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:46.976 --> 00:49:48.850
If that's the last time
you didn't feel safe,

00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:51.122
that is really interesting.

00:49:51.122 --> 00:49:53.080
And I asked a straight,
black man the other day

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:54.639
when he didn't feel
safe, and he was

00:49:54.639 --> 00:49:56.680
like, the last time I
didn't feel safe in my body

00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:57.940
was around the police.

00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:01.450
And that's also interesting,
that the last time

00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:03.714
you didn't feel safe in
your body is around a--

00:50:03.714 --> 00:50:05.880
you ask a woman when the
last they didn't feel safe,

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.870
it doesn't have anything
to do with the police.

00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:09.610
It might be about
the police, but women

00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:12.700
have all these stories about
not feeling safe in their body

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:14.700
just in society.

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:17.032
Or you ask queer
people, trans people,

00:50:17.032 --> 00:50:18.490
when's a time you
didn't feel safe,

00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:21.010
and you actually
understand what you

00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:23.230
don't see every day,
because you're just

00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:25.840
not proximate to it.

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.060
I found that question to be
really helpful for people

00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:29.810
who are struggling
with this allied thing,

00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:33.140
like, how close are you to the
issue and what don't you see?

00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:34.330
Especially in the workplace.

00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:36.472
You think about
in classrooms-- we

00:50:36.472 --> 00:50:38.680
sit in the back of the
classroom and we can literally

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:41.020
tally who gets called on.

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:42.700
If you sit in
classrooms and you tally

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:44.658
positive to negative
comments, you can actually

00:50:44.658 --> 00:50:46.210
learn a lot about a teacher.

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:48.535
Because when you see the
ratio is just so off,

00:50:48.535 --> 00:50:50.410
you're like, of course
the kids are bad today

00:50:50.410 --> 00:50:51.530
because you're mean.

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:55.990
That's why they're bad, because
you're not a nice person.

00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:57.550
But in the workplace
you can also

00:50:57.550 --> 00:50:59.500
tally who gets called on first.

00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:02.410
In a lot of workplaces that
call themselves progressive,

00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:06.100
it's always straight men who
are the first people to talk.

00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:07.390
What does that look like?

00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:09.796
I think, too, about workplaces
that look like this,

00:51:09.796 --> 00:51:11.170
it's like, what
does it mean when

00:51:11.170 --> 00:51:13.128
workplaces that look like
this say things like,

00:51:13.128 --> 00:51:14.410
we have the best workforce.

00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:17.230
And it's like, no black
people and no brown people.

00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:19.480
That is actually
signaling something.

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:23.650
That if you can say today, you
have the best workforce when

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:25.780
it's less than 3%
people of color,

00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:27.784
that is a value statement.

00:51:27.784 --> 00:51:29.200
And if you don't
see it like that,

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.892
that is a privilege
and a luxury not

00:51:30.892 --> 00:51:32.350
to be able to see
the way that that

00:51:32.350 --> 00:51:33.972
is being received by people.

00:51:33.972 --> 00:51:36.430
Not that you're working towards
having the best work place.

00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:38.530
But if you would say that
the best workplace is

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:40.570
one that does not
mimic a society

00:51:40.570 --> 00:51:43.200
we live in like this,
that is a real challenge.

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:46.250
So I've seen people show
with the language of allyship

00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:48.992
and not the practice
of allyship a lot,

00:51:48.992 --> 00:51:50.200
and especially in workplaces.

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:51.241
And what I've also seen--

00:51:51.241 --> 00:51:53.720
I did this talk at another
really big company.

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:57.290
And I had gone to the airport
with the Vice President

00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:59.950
of whatever he does
at the big place.

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:04.090
And he was the executive
sponsor for the black people.

00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:06.010
So I'm talking to the
black people later,

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:06.880
and all they had was complaints.

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:09.130
And I'm sitting up here and
I go to the executive guy.

00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:13.210
I'm like, you're not sponsoring
real well if the people got

00:52:13.210 --> 00:52:14.560
all these complaints.

00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:16.150
You are sponsoring
from a distance

00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:17.410
and that's just not cool.

00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:18.760
So you need to figure that out.

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:20.500
And in workplaces
like this, is what

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:22.660
you often find is that
there's a lot of really

00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:25.180
good systemic work happening
until one white person feels

00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:29.316
uncomfortable, and
people are like, no.

00:52:29.316 --> 00:52:30.940
It could be 30 black
people being like,

00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:33.430
I think this is
an issue that we--

00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:37.090
and the one white person
who has a fragile moment

00:52:37.090 --> 00:52:39.370
can shut everything down.

00:52:39.370 --> 00:52:43.480
When a structure allows that
to happen, that is a conver--

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:45.332
we need to talk about that.

00:52:45.332 --> 00:52:47.290
And I think about that
with the allyship piece,

00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:49.600
is that I've seen people
in positions of power.

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:51.554
Again, they will
come to something

00:52:51.554 --> 00:52:53.470
like this talk with me
and talk about the fact

00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:55.390
that they were here for
the next three months

00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:58.210
and not change any practice
that they've ever done.

00:52:58.210 --> 00:53:00.862
And I get that and
that's not cool.

00:53:00.862 --> 00:53:02.320
So we need to figure
out, how do we

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:06.150
make spaces where we can
challenge systems internally

00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:08.770
so that they don't reproduce
the same sort of things

00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:13.300
that cause us to have these
talks in the first place?

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:15.370
I'm more nervous
about that four years

00:53:15.370 --> 00:53:18.130
after the protests began
than I was at the beginning.

00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:20.620
We've been to a million talks,
a million of all this stuff.

00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:22.332
You've been to it,
I've been to it.

00:53:22.332 --> 00:53:24.040
And some people actually
haven't changed.

00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:26.620
And I do think the confrontation
and the challenging

00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:29.615
of those people has to be
front and center in this work.

00:53:29.615 --> 00:53:30.990
We're you about
to say something?

00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:31.300
AUDIENCE: No.

00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:32.150
DERAY MCKESSON: OK.

00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:34.920
And the last thing I
would say is this thing

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:38.210
that we call caretaking--

00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:40.360
caretaking and splitting
are two different things.

00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:41.943
What you find with
some white people--

00:53:41.943 --> 00:53:43.150
and black people do it--

00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:45.051
is that a white
person has a moment--

00:53:45.051 --> 00:53:47.050
they're like, oh, my god,
I get white privilege.

00:53:47.050 --> 00:53:47.710
I get it.

00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:48.949
This is bad.

00:53:48.949 --> 00:53:50.740
Then they split from
the other white people

00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:52.392
and they go near
people of color.

00:53:52.392 --> 00:53:54.100
They're like, you
white people are crazy,

00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:56.141
we're going to go hang
out with the black people.

00:53:56.141 --> 00:53:59.110
And that feels like the right
thing to do in those moments.

00:53:59.110 --> 00:54:01.290
But the danger of splitting
is that-- white people,

00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:03.540
you need to go-- you need
to be with the white people.

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.510
You need to be teaching
the white people,

00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:06.860
they've got to get
their stuff together.

00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:09.026
And white people have to
start leading white people.

00:54:09.026 --> 00:54:10.430
So it's not that
you shouldn't be

00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:11.638
proximate to people of color.

00:54:11.638 --> 00:54:12.230
You should be.

00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:16.490
But you shouldn't split
holy and use your proximity

00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:19.420
to black people as a
sense of credentialing.

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:22.165
Because that actually doesn't
push us forward in the work.

00:54:22.165 --> 00:54:23.540
And the second
thing that happens

00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:26.964
that we call this sense
of caretaking is that--

00:54:26.964 --> 00:54:28.380
people of color,
you've definitely

00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:30.921
experienced this-- you'll be in
a room, you'll say something,

00:54:30.921 --> 00:54:32.037
people will say nothing.

00:54:32.037 --> 00:54:32.870
They'll be like, OK.

00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:34.560
A white person says the same
thing and people are like,

00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:35.360
great idea.

00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:37.610
And you're like,
what just happened?

00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:40.067
And what you find is
that people will coddle

00:54:40.067 --> 00:54:41.900
the white per-- they'll
be like, oh, my god,

00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:43.159
that was such an insight.

00:54:43.159 --> 00:54:45.200
That thing about race that
you said was so great.

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:46.991
And you're like, I
literally just said that

00:54:46.991 --> 00:54:48.620
and that's my life all day.

00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:52.460
We need to be mindful that
white people's discomfort is

00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:55.279
because they are just realizing
what's happening in the world

00:54:55.279 --> 00:54:57.320
and that we shouldn't
coddle people through that.

00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:00.050
We should be around
them and support people,

00:55:00.050 --> 00:55:01.580
but that is not coddling.

00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:04.000
And a lot of what we do
know is coddle people.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.260
And that white privilege
is really important only

00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:09.119
insofar as people link that
back to a systemic factor.

00:55:09.119 --> 00:55:10.910
So if your understanding
of white privilege

00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:13.749
is limited to, oh, the
world is crazy and whatever,

00:55:13.749 --> 00:55:15.540
and you've not yet done
the work to realize

00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:17.960
that a system allowed
that to happen for you,

00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:20.500
then you actually haven't
done the work yet.

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:23.360
And that is a long
answer to this question

00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:25.530
of what allyship looks like.

00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:27.132
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:27.132 --> 00:55:28.340
BONITA STEWART: But a great--

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:29.173
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:55:29.173 --> 00:55:31.276
BONITA STEWART: --question
and a great answer.

00:55:31.276 --> 00:55:32.150
DERAY MCKESSON: Cool.

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.810
It's good to be here.

00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:34.430
My book comes out
in September, it's

00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:36.013
called "On the Other
Side of Freedom."

00:55:36.013 --> 00:55:38.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:40.241
Excited about that.

00:55:40.241 --> 00:55:42.210
And please listen to the pod--

00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:43.380
Sam will be here, too.

00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:44.380
I'd love to talk to
whoever's around.

00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:45.910
We are trying to
figure out, how do

00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:49.630
we create just more
space so people can have

00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:51.610
less gatekeepers in the work?

00:55:51.610 --> 00:55:53.470
You should be able
to do good work

00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:55.610
and not have to be a
member of anything,

00:55:55.610 --> 00:55:57.362
not have to join a network.

00:55:57.362 --> 00:55:59.320
You should be able to do
good work because work

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:03.100
is good to do, not because
you want to join something

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:04.480
for your whole life.

00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:06.080
How do we use tech
to allow people

00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:08.754
to do that is a question
that we have every day.

00:56:08.754 --> 00:56:09.670
BONITA STEWART: Great.

00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:10.710
WILLIAM FLOYD: We'd like
to help you answer that.

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:12.130
DeRay, thank you for the time.

00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:13.213
BONITA STEWART: Thank you.

00:56:13.213 --> 00:56:16.080
[APPLAUSE]
