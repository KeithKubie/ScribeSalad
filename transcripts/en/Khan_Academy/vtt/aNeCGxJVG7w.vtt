00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.570
Divide.

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:07.440
Simplify the answer and write
as a mixed number.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.720
So we have 4 divided by 2/3, and
we've seen when you divide

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.900
by the fraction, it's the same
thing as multiplying by its

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.940
reciprocal.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.260
So this is going to be the
same thing as 4 times the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.840
reciprocal of 2/3, which is 3/2,
just swapping the bottom

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.050
and the top number, the
denominator and the numerator.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.220
Now, 4, we've seen this before,
where we're saying,

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.330
OK, well, we know how to
multiply fractions.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.660
You multiply the numerators
times each other and the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.170
denominators times
each other, but 4

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.410
doesn't look like a fraction.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.880
Well, you always have to
remember: a whole number can

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.650
be written as that same
whole number over one.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.610
4 is the same thing as 4/1.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.740
And now this becomes kind of
a plain vanilla multiplying

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.140
fractions problem.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.710
And so we can just
multiply it out.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.900
We could just say this is 4
times 3, which would be 12

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.040
over 1 times 2, which
would be 2.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.390
Or we could divide right now.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.190
Well, let's do it both
ways, actually.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.320
So we could say this is 4 times
3 in the numerator,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.800
which is 12, over 1 times 2 in
the denominator, which is 2.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.150
Now, what is 12 divided by 2?

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.780
12/2 is the same thing
as 12 divided by 2.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.310
Well, this is equal to 6.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.740
Or another way we could think
about it is divide the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.230
numerator by 2.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.420
Well, that would give you 6.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.310
And divide the denominator
by 2.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.340
That'll give you 1.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.900
6/1, which is the
same thing as 6.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.720
Now, the other thing we could've
done at this stage

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.870
right here is say, well, look,
we have things in the

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.570
numerator divisible by 2, we
have things in the denominator

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.480
divisible by 2, so let's
divide both by 2.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.960
So 4 divided by 2 is 2.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.770
2 divided by 2 is 1.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.930
So it becomes 2 times 3, which
is 6, over 1 times 1 over 1,

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.220
or this is equal to 6.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.520
Now, this could be a fun one
to visualize so let's think

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.490
about what this is.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.780
4 divided by 2/3.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.270
Let's draw four boxes here.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.890
Let me do this.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.979
So let's say I have one,
two-- let me separate

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.460
them a little bit.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.090
One, two, three, and four.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.120
And you can view 4 divided by
2/3 as let's divide these four

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.570
boxes into groups of 2/3 of a
box and figure out how many

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.910
groups do we have.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.390
So where are our groups?

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.800
So let's see the first group is
going to have 2/3 of a box

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.320
in it, so the first group is
going to look like this.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.140
It's going to have
2/3 of a box.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.670
Now, the next group is going to
have 2/3 of a box, so it'll

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.560
have 1/3 from here and
then it'll have 1/3

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.090
from the next box.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.160
The next group is going to
have 2/3 of the box.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.770
There's 2/3 left right
over here.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.520
Then the group after that will
have another 2/3 of a box.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.870
That is that right over there.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.450
Then the next will have 1/3 from
here and 1/3 from here,

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.510
so it'll have 1/3 from here
and 1/3 from here.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.630
That'll be 2/3.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.170
And then the last group will
have 2/3, the leftover on this

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.500
box right here.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.150
Now, how many groups
of 2/3 do we have?

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:13.190
We have one, two, three, four,
five, six, so we have six.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.190
Four can be divided into
six groups of 2/3.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.290
So it's just like regular
division, sometimes a little

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.970
harder to visualize because
we're dealing with fractions.
