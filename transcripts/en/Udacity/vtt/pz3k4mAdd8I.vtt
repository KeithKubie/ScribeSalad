00:00:00.172 --> 00:00:03.840
The next type of break points I want to
talk about are symbolic break points.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.535
And the use of symbolic break points,
here we go, is eerily similar to how

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:12.854
we created break points in LLDB using
the break point set command and

00:00:12.854 --> 00:00:15.560
passing the selector option.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.100
So to add the symbolic breakpoint,
we are now at this menu, and

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.920
we need to specify a symbol.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.330
And like we did earlier,
we'll use the selector viewDidLoad.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.540
And after we hit Enter, it really only
appears as if one breakpoint has been

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.220
set, but looks can be deceiving.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:41.080
If we run the application,
as soon as we run, and I'll stop now.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.930
We can see that it expanded out
into all the different cases,

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.940
all the different places where
this particular selector matched.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.520
And if we extend the navigator,
we can see some more information

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.150
in regards to which particular
viewDidLoad we're talking about.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.340
We'll drag it back and now we'll
check the other options that we have.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.220
And we can see that, besides
the things we've already assumed,

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.980
we can specify a particular module.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.906
And so let's add UIKit to
the module field, and hit Enter.

00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:16.066
And now we'll run again.

00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:18.318
And stop.

00:01:18.318 --> 00:01:22.266
You can see that our list
has shrunk to include only

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:27.700
the viewDidLoads matching that
are in the UI kit module.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.300
So with that in mind, let's go ahead and
try another exercise.
