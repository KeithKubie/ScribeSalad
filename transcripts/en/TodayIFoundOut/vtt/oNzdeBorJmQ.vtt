00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:10.679
In the summer of 1982, a 33-year old unemployed
royal fanatic twice scaled a 14-foot wall

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.900
topped with barbed wire and revolving spikes,
shimmied up a drainpipe, entered Buckingham

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.480
Palace through unlocked windows, sat on the
Queen’s throne and even enjoyed a brief

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.539
tête-à-tête with Her Majesty.

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.470
Michael Fagan was born on August 8, 1948 in
London.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.009
Married in 1972, at the time he broke into
the Palace, Michael had four children ages

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.149
3 to 10.

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.289
Although previously having worked as a decorator
and painter, Michael was out of work when

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:38.350
he began planning his break-ins.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.149
Telling his mother that he was visiting his
“girlfriend – Elizabeth Regina,” Fagan

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.230
made 12 trips to the Palace in the months
before his eventual intrusion.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.800
For his first break-in, in June of 1982, Fagan
claimed he had entered the Palace through

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.999
the window of a maid’s room; and, although
she immediately reported the break-in, when

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:58.989
security personnel were unable to find him,
they assumed she imagined it.

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.879
Fagan then says he spent the rest of that
evening exploring the Queen’s home, finding

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.730
the rooms of both Prince Charles and Princess
Diana.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.790
There for awhile and unable to locate a water
closet, Fagan claims he peed in the corgi

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:11.790
food.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.490
He also says he drunk some wine he found in
Prince Charles’ room.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.610
Feeling like, in his words, Goldilocks, Fagan
also took turns sitting on several thrones.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.430
Although he claims it was harder getting out
than in, Fagan said he eventually left through

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.030
the back gardens and, once again, simply climbed
over a wall.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.860
The day after the first intrusion, Fagan tried
to steal a car and was imprisoned for three

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.050
weeks before being released on bail.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.290
He entered the Palace for the second time
the next day.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.500
Beginning at about 7:00 a.m., Fagan once again
scaled the wall and climbed up a drainpipe,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.080
this time to the roof of the Palace where
he left his sandals and socks.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.860
He shimmied across a narrow ledge and entered
the building through another unlocked window.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.140
Fagan then, in his words, “follow[ed] the
pictures,” to determine which apartments

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.400
were the Queen’s.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.090
During this time, Fagan set off at least one
alarm, which was ignored; it was later determined

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.291
that several other alarms had been improperly
installed.

00:02:02.291 --> 00:02:06.760
In any event, at about 7:15 a.m., he broke
a glass ashtray and then carried one of the

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.489
shards with him into the Queen’s bedroom
where “he intended to slash his wrists in

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:11.740
the presence of Her Majesty.”

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.330
After he opened the curtains near her bed,
Queen Elizabeth pressed the night alarm, but

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.240
due several coincidences, no one was there
to hear, or respond to, it: the night watchman

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.830
had already gone home, and the domestic help
that normally would have been in the pantry

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.950
to hear the alarm were cleaning another room
and walking the dogs, respectively.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.640
Fagan claims that the Queen was wearing a
knee-length Liberty print nightie when she

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.590
exclaimed, “Wawrt are you doing here?!”

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.170
She then telephoned for help at about 7:18
a.m., but assistance was late in arriving,

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.950
so the Queen, with the assistance of a maid,
coerced Fagan into a pantry by saying he could

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.750
find a cigarette there.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.000
Finally locating a footman, the Queen and
the maid left him in charge of Fagan; the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.420
footman not only supplied Fagan with cigarettes,
but, at least according to Fagan, also gave

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.650
him a glass of the Queen’s Famous Grouse
whiskey that she kept on hand.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.380
According to the official report, the Queen
remained on the scene but was occupied with

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.870
keeping her corgis away from Fagan, who was
becoming increasingly agitated.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.010
Fagan later claimed that his brief foray into
breaking and entering was the result of taking

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.330
too many “magic mushrooms,” from which
he was still high.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.160
In the end, Fagan wasn’t charged for the
break-ins, although he spent time in mental

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.620
institution for psychiatric evaluation in
1982.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.180
After the break-in, Fagan continued to get
into trouble with authorities, including assaulting

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.380
a police officer and dealing heroin.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.940
In 1987, he was charged with indecent exposure,
although, according to Fagan, he had simply

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.580
removed his pants when he dove into the water
to retrieve some tackle (he had been fishing,

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.840
and smoking pot, with some friends).

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.020
Although the in-court testimony from the female
witness was that he had “a huge erection,”

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:53.100
Fagan challenged this, noting “‘her husband
must be like that’ . . . measuring a tiny

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:07.680
distance with his thumb and forefinger.”
