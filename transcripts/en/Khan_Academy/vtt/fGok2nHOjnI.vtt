00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.099
- Fourteen superheroes met on the moon

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.457
for a top secret gathering.

00:00:05.457 --> 00:00:06.757
Fascinating.

00:00:06.757 --> 00:00:11.690
Three of them turned out to
be evil villains in disguise.

00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:12.573
Uh oh.

00:00:12.573 --> 00:00:15.150
How many were real superheroes?

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.764
Real superheroes.

00:00:16.764 --> 00:00:19.921
So pause this video and see
if you can figure this out.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.737
Now you've had your try,
let's work on it together.

00:00:23.737 --> 00:00:26.302
So fourteen superheroes met on the moon.

00:00:26.303 --> 00:00:27.173
So let's write that down.

00:00:27.173 --> 00:00:29.412
Fourteen met on the moon.

00:00:29.413 --> 00:00:31.538
I'll put a little circle
around it like that.

00:00:31.538 --> 00:00:33.337
So fourteen met on the moon.

00:00:33.337 --> 00:00:36.320
Now of that fourteen, they
tell us that three of them

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.292
turned out to be evil
villains in disguise.

00:00:39.292 --> 00:00:43.437
So three of them are evil villains.

00:00:43.437 --> 00:00:46.583
So of the fourteen,
we're either dealing with

00:00:46.583 --> 00:00:48.242
the three evil villains,

00:00:48.243 --> 00:00:51.203
or we're dealing with real superheroes.

00:00:51.203 --> 00:00:53.448
One way to think about it is
the fourteen are made up of

00:00:53.448 --> 00:00:56.153
evil villains or real superheroes.

00:00:56.153 --> 00:00:57.580
So this question mark right over here,

00:00:57.581 --> 00:00:59.694
this is the real superheroes.

00:00:59.694 --> 00:01:01.621
This is what we need to figure out.

00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:04.558
And so this relationship could
be written in different ways.

00:01:04.558 --> 00:01:06.102
You could write...

00:01:06.102 --> 00:01:08.853
You could write that the three villains

00:01:08.853 --> 00:01:12.393
plus the question mark, real superheroes,

00:01:12.394 --> 00:01:14.913
plus the question mark, real superheroes,

00:01:14.913 --> 00:01:18.535
is going to be equal to the
total number of characters

00:01:18.535 --> 00:01:20.416
that met on the moon.

00:01:20.416 --> 00:01:23.979
Or you could say, well if
three plus question mark

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.036
is fourteen, well then
fourteen minus three,

00:01:28.036 --> 00:01:32.043
minus three, is going to
be equal to question mark.

00:01:32.043 --> 00:01:34.040
Is going to be equal to question mark.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.456
And you see it right over here.

00:01:35.456 --> 00:01:38.126
The fourteen is made up of
three and question mark.

00:01:38.126 --> 00:01:41.365
So if you take fourteen minus
three, you're just going to

00:01:41.365 --> 00:01:43.942
be left with the number
of real superheroes.

00:01:43.942 --> 00:01:46.651
So what's fourteen minus three?

00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:49.545
Well, there's several
ways you could do this.

00:01:49.546 --> 00:01:51.566
But one way is, let's
see, fourteen minus one

00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:53.052
is going to be thirteen.

00:01:53.052 --> 00:01:54.492
Fourteen minus two is twelve.

00:01:54.492 --> 00:01:56.384
Fourteen minus three is eleven.

00:01:56.384 --> 00:01:59.425
So we have eleven is equal...

00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:03.291
Eleven is equal to question mark.

00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:04.568
Or question mark is equal to eleven,

00:02:04.568 --> 00:02:06.565
or there are eleven real superheroes.

00:02:06.565 --> 00:02:08.770
Now let's do one more.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.733
Let's do one more.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.530
We found many sea monsters
in the nearby lake.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.178
Nine of them have stripes.

00:02:18.178 --> 00:02:21.526
Five of them have spots.

00:02:21.526 --> 00:02:24.945
How many sea monsters are in the lake?

00:02:25.253 --> 00:02:26.691
How many sea monsters are in the lake?

00:02:26.692 --> 00:02:28.046
So what are they telling us?

00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:29.868
So the total...

00:02:29.868 --> 00:02:31.064
How many sea monsters in the lake?

00:02:31.064 --> 00:02:32.747
This is the total number of sea monsters.

00:02:32.747 --> 00:02:34.198
This is what we're trying to figure out,

00:02:34.198 --> 00:02:36.404
the total number of sea monsters.

00:02:36.404 --> 00:02:38.261
That's how many sea
monsters are in the lake.

00:02:38.261 --> 00:02:39.422
And they tell us,

00:02:39.422 --> 00:02:42.638
they tell us that nine
of them have stripes.

00:02:42.638 --> 00:02:45.726
Nine of them have stripes.

00:02:45.726 --> 00:02:48.942
And five of them have spots.

00:02:48.942 --> 00:02:51.716
Five of them have spots.

00:02:51.716 --> 00:02:56.116
So all of the sea monsters are going to be

00:02:56.116 --> 00:02:59.935
the nine that have stripes,
plus the five that have spots.

00:02:59.935 --> 00:03:04.440
So we could write nine plus five.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.445
Nine plus five is equal to question mark.

00:03:08.445 --> 00:03:10.697
Is equal to question mark.

00:03:10.697 --> 00:03:13.123
And so what is nine plus five?

00:03:13.123 --> 00:03:15.283
Well you might have
that memorized already.

00:03:15.283 --> 00:03:16.803
That is fourteen.

00:03:16.803 --> 00:03:18.498
Or if you don't, you could
see say, well let's see.

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:21.899
Nine plus one is going to be ten.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.221
Nine plus two is eleven,
nine plus three is twelve,

00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:27.623
nine plus four is thirteen,
nine plus five is fourteen.

00:03:27.623 --> 00:03:30.780
So you have fourteen is
equal to question mark.

00:03:30.781 --> 00:03:33.462
Or how many sea monsters are in the lake?

00:03:33.462 --> 00:03:34.981
Fourteen.
