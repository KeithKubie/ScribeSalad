&gt;&gt;Presenter: Hello everyone and welcome to
yet another Google live installment of Authors

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.650
at Google in San Francisco. We've got today
a science writer, Marc Kaufman, speaking on

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.440
his book 'First Contact'. And although I can't
yet say we've definitively found life on other

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.750
planets, I think we've got a lot of great
updates from the science community as to how

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.980
far we've progressed and how close we're coming
to at least understanding what it means when

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.000
we say 'extraterrestrial life' and what we
could possibly learn from it. This is Marc's

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.910
first book. Although we're very excited to
showcase it, it will also be featured as part

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.370
of the National Book Festival in the National
Mall in DC. He's been interviewed on Fresh

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.250
Air on NPR and we are happy to welcome him
as part of the Authors at Google series. Thanks.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.219
[applause]
&gt;&gt;Marc Kaufman: Thanks very much. Thank you

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.410
all very much. I am really delighted to be
here. I feel in a sense that we are kind of

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:08.079
kindred spirits in a sense that I was really
drawn into a subject that is extremely cutting

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:14.069
edge and that could not have existed 15 years
ago in terms of the kinds of information that's

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:19.209
really being generated now, just as you are.
We have knowledge and we have technology that

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:24.659
didn't exist before and we're now able to
find things that we couldn't before. So this

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.539
is a remarkable time particularly in this
world of, of life beyond earth. And just a

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.299
little bit about myself. I'm a reporter at
the Washington Post. I've been there for 10

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.760
years or so. I used to be at the Philadelphia
Inquirer. I've been a foreign correspondent

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.590
a lot and I'll get into it later. I kind of
came linked into being a science writer but

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.810
it is extraordinarily cool and I am very glad
I was able to do it. All right, so here we

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.640
go. This is, I put together some slides here
and we'll just kind of talk about them as

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:02.169
we go along. And feel free to ask questions
along the time, along the discussion.

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:08.149
As when you think about it, there has really
been since the beginning of humankind as far

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:16.769
as we know a desire, an instinct, to see life
or to feel that there is life in the skies.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.920
You think about where's heaven? It's up in
the skies. Where's God? Up in the skies. Where,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:30.489
where are angels? Or in more recent, more
secular days, E.T. and Star Wars and whatever

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:36.850
else. There's just kind of an innate desire
to, for that to be true. And that's, you kind

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.680
of wonder is that a, just a simple hope that
we're not alone in the world or in the universe

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.579
or is it something kind of instinctive, kind
of deep inside of us that we can't really

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:56.849
parse through. As, as this issue has been
dealt with over the years and it has been

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:03.290
very kind of vociferously argued going back
to the Greeks and Romans as to whether or

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.900
not there, there can be planets outside of
the Solar System and so on. And then life

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.030
outside it, it has all been on the basis of
belief because they didn't really have any

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.010
scientific knowledge to work with or they
would, there was a rational kind of aspect

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.739
to it where they would try to impute certain
knowledge but it really was ultimately based

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.349
on belief and in that sense, it ran into a
lot of obstacles.

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:39.079
This is a statue of Giordano Bruno who is
kind of the patron saint of astrobiology which

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:45.099
is the science that we're going to be talking
about today. He was a Dominican monk who later

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:52.010
became a free thinker of sorts and was a believer
in what was called the multiplicity of worlds

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.049
which meant he thought that there were a lot
of different planets out there and that there

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.890
were different people who lived on them or
different beings. And he was burned at the

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:07.219
stake. That was, he also had, had been involved
in what was considered a number of other heresies

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:13.080
but that was, I think, number two or three.
So it was , this is a subject that, that brings

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:20.139
up surprisingly strong emotions as again we
will get into in the future, as we go further.

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.810
But this is, as I saying before, kind of new
to human kind that there is, there really

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:35.850
is a science to ET life. It is called 'astrobiology'.
And it is a remarkable kind of umbrella discipline

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:44.550
in the sense that it includes everything from
microbiology, geo-microbiology, chemistry,

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:54.340
planetary science, geology, all the way to
cosmology. And it, none of those are themselves

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:03.120
necessarily astrobiology. But there has been
a real instinct in, in and an organized effort

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.450
in the last 10 years, or 15 years or so to
bring it together into a particular overriding

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:15.840
discipline. Every two years they have a, a
conference. There was one in Santa Clara two

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.490
years ago, one in Texas this year. About 10,000
people show up, some of the best and brightest

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:29.080
scientists on earth. And they, they talk about
astrobiology from the perspective of their

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:36.020
own fields for the most part. But it's all
with that, that movement forward toward, 'Hey,

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.950
we think that there's life out there and we're
gonna try to one, understand what that life

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.639
might be; two, how we might identify it; three,
how we could maybe figure out that it was

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:49.669
there once before and isn't there anymore'
and so on.

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:59.099
So there I've kind of taken to, to likening
it to a stealth Apollo program. It is a massive

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:03.300
effort. It's going on around the world. There
are tens, hundreds of thousands of scientists

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:09.680
involved in one way or another in, in the
pursuit but until recently very few people

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.530
have really known about it. And I think even
now, you know about specific bits of news

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:19.360
that come up but you don't necessarily, there
isn't a general understanding that this has

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.720
been hardwired into a NASA and the European
Space Administration and to the whole effort

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:34.410
of dealing with life beyond, with space issues
generally. Astrobiology is right at the center

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:39.820
of it.
As I was saying, I was a foreign correspondent,

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:45.510
a lot of other things until I became a science
writer five, six years ago. My editor said,

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.310
'You know, you should really learn a little
bit more about this.' So I went up to a journalism

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:56.060
boot camp at MIT and the subject was the universe.
We were supposed to learn about all, everything

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:01.440
in the universe in four days. I'm not sure
we succeeded but we did learn a lot about

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.810
super massive black holes, the Big Bang and
how galaxies are formed. And all of it was

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:13.090
deeply fascinating. But it wasn't until this
woman arrived that, that things really gelled

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:23.729
for me. She is, her name is Sara Seager. She
is a, she has a named chair at MIT and tenure

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:31.530
which she got at age 34. So you can imagine
that she is like a total whiz. And she got

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:38.690
up there and she said, 'In my lifetime, I
am almost virtually sure that we will find

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:45.159
life beyond Earth.' And there I was, at MIT,
and this was someone who obviously knew a

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:50.900
great deal about this and was speaking with
a lot of authority. So I said to myself, not

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:56.440
so much as a science, as a science, from the
perspective of science, since my perspective

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:01.210
in science then was somewhat limited. But
as a journalist, which I had been for a long

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:07.759
time, I said, 'What a story.' You know, no
one is really looking at this in the sense

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:16.330
of telling the, the public as it were that,
that is what the best and the brightest are

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:27.530
beginning to or have concluded, that we're
on that kind of trajectory and it's just a

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:32.861
question of time. Just want to start a little
bit in terms of stepping back. A lot of astrobiology

00:08:32.861 --> 00:08:39.670
now involves the search for and the understanding
of microbial life and there's an instinct,

00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:43.130
perhaps not here but in some places to say,
'Well they're just little microbes. You can't

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:53.070
see them. What's the big deal?' But as you
can see, for three billion of the 3.8 billion

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:57.170
years that there have been, that there has
been life on Earth, it was just microbes.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:02.480
So all of us and everything else that you
see around here that's living, came out of

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:09.270
that soup of single cell organisms that was,
what was life here for most of the time that

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:16.010
there has been life. So microbes are a big
deal. And this gets into the world of extremophiles

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:23.770
which are microbes that live in places where
they should not be living. The research on

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:30.310
this started a number of decades ago but really
has picked up in the last 10 and then 5 years.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:35.900
It began with the black smokers. These are
hydrothermal vents at the bottom of oceans,

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:44.370
basically something akin to a volcano erupting
there. The temperatures get up to 750 degrees.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:52.670
There is nothing living right there at the
750 degrees but if you go out to 250, 200

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:57.380
which everyone assumed was well too high for
anything to survive, they're finding thriving

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.420
microbial communities. And if you go a little
bit further, you're going to find these long

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:10.310
tubeworms which is extremely bizarre.
In ice, this is a relatively new set of understandings.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:18.590
This was being done at the Taylor Glacier
near, outside McMurdo in Antarctica. Researchers

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:25.120
go there. They dig into glaciers and they
find, they take out cubes, bring them home,

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:33.130
melt them and they find microbial life. It
turns out that, that when the ice crystallizes,

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:38.180
the H-2-O really stays in the center. Everything
else, salts, everything that isn't H-2-O is

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:44.500
kind of kicked out to a little tiny river
or whatever outside and that is the environment

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:49.230
in which the microbes survive. They get the
nutrients because it's been kicked out and

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:57.320
they are able and they have some kind of fluid
that they can, that they can work in. Until

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:05.700
1995, there was no knowledge really that,
that underneath the ice of Antarctica, there

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:12.580
is a huge set of lakes including Lake Vostok
which is roughly the size of Lake Ontario.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:20.000
It's two miles down and the Russians are right
at the very edge of breaking through and into

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.770
Lake Vostok. They've been finding microbial
life along with other researchers all the

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:30.640
way down and the expectation is that down
in this lake, two miles down, they're gonna

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.940
find all kinds of living things.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:41.460
Mono Lake in your neighborhood and its arsenic
bugs. You perhaps have read about this in

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:45.680
recent months and actually just today, there's
been additional information about it. This

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:53.960
was, there are two things going on here. Mono
Lake is a terminal lake. It doesn't go anywhere

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:58.860
so elements get very highly concentrated.
Arsenic runs off the Sierra Nevadas and into

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:05.200
here and so there's more arsenic here than
I think anywhere else. So it was interesting

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.240
when they found microbial life living in the
arsenic. But then some researchers took it

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:18.630
a step further and basically just doing benchwork
to begin with, worked on these microbes to

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:27.490
the point where they were, they were, essentially
the arsenic had replaced phosphorus which

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:32.371
everyone believes, and had believed until
that point, was essential for all DNA, for

00:12:32.371 --> 00:12:41.330
all cell membranes, for a lot of other things
in the cell. And she had a paper, Felisa Wolfe-Simon

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:51.320
had a paper published last fall in which she
said,' We believe that, that these are creatures

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:58.220
that are entirely differ, potentially entirely
different than anything else that has originated

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:03.350
on Earth because it in fact does not have
the phosphorus but rather has the arsenic.'

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:08.510
It's a, it's a, the whole world is called
the 'Shadow Biosphere' and it raises the question

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:14.560
of, 'Well, if there was a genesis of life
here on Earth once, why not twice? Why not

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:21.210
three times? And what might be out there that
we're just not looking for and is there but

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:27.190
is, is in different forms that we, we would
not be identifying.' Very controversial. She

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:32.620
got clobbered for some of her research. And
the Blogosphere just went wild on this for

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:40.850
some time. Just yesterday, her rebuttal was
published in the Journal of Science and basically

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:47.170
she said, 'We think that we're on to something
here.' And while she's gotten a lot of enemies,

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:54.360
she got a lot of collaborators as well.
The Atacama Desert in Northern Chile, the

00:13:54.360 --> 00:14:02.090
driest place on Earth. NASA goes down there
a lot for, for Mars Missions to see what conditions

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:07.250
would be like. It rains in some of the places
once every 10 years. You know a little bit

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:11.980
of rain and yet underneath the rocks, you
go down a little bit, you're gonna find again

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:19.080
microbial life; something that wasn't known
until 5, 10 years ago. I thought you folks

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:27.050
in particular would enjoy this. This is a,
an autonomous submersible that has been tested

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:35.500
down in Antarctica under the glacial ice in
one of these lakes and it can go on its own

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:42.830
up to a mile and a half, two miles and, and
collects data and it can make some kinds of

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:48.300
autonomous decisions about what might be interesting
and what might not be and then can come back

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:55.820
to this hole and come back up. This is not
so much an issue of being able to find things

00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:02.470
we didn't know was there but it's, the technology
is gradually being put together for future

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:08.190
missions, and this is all about Europa. The
moon of Jupiter which is, has a huge crust

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:16.560
of ice and a vast ocean underneath the ice
and the expectation now is that it's, it's

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.770
one of the best possible locations for finding
[inaudible]. And of course, it's not going

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:24.860
to be easy getting through 14 miles of ice
to get through it. You might have to bring

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:31.290
in a nuclear weapon or something. But we'll
see how that works out. In any case, Tullis

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:38.661
Onstott, he's now at Princeton and a well-known
professor but he started off in the world

00:15:38.661 --> 00:15:44.170
of extremophiles as an unknown guy. He had
no funding from NSF, no funding from anyone,

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:52.860
from NASA, anyone. He had done some original
work on, on looking for microbial life deep

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:59.870
underground, not in water but under the soil.
And was not really getting too far so he said,

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:06.890
'Okay. Where can I go really deeply down?'
And did research and found the deepest mines

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:13.630
on earth are in South Africa, the gold mines,
diamond mines. He took $6000 of his own money

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:18.510
and went to South Africa and made connections
with some scientists there and over a period

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:25.760
of a couple of years was able to go into some
of the mines and to go, you can't really see

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:30.160
it too well here but this is a bore hole where
a little bit of water is coming out. They

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:37.790
would collect the water and then take it into
their labs and see what they found. And after

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:46.020
some period of time, this is what they found,
this arrow like thing. It's called 'Desulfidorous

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:56.800
Audaxiator' which is the weirdest microbe
ever found. It is approximately 2.5 miles

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:02.080
down underground. It has been utterly cut
off from the surface of the Earth for they

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:07.829
think 10 to 40 million years, meaning that
it has gotten no organic material, nothing

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:15.409
that had to do with photosynthesis. It lives,
its energy source is the radioactive decay

00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:24.360
of rocks and it, it uses that to break hydrogen
sulfide into elements that it can use to metabolize

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:31.960
and survive. It reproduces very slowly but
it reproduces. And as far as we can tell at

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:39.570
this point, it is, it is prevalent through
this, this area of, of South Africa. And the

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:46.470
implication of it is it's probably prevalent
or something like it is right below us too.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:53.220
This is a whole new world that no one really
imagined more than 10 years ago that, that

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:59.200
the, that the microbial life deep down below
us actually there's probably a greater mass

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:07.450
of that than there is of life above the surface
of Earth.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:11.590
This is just to show you that I indeed went
down there. It was very, very hot. It was,

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:20.470
the ambient temperature was about 140 degrees.
A hundred and sixty degrees inside the walls

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:28.539
and the, something that I had not fully understood
was that there's a lot, there's a lot of water

00:18:28.539 --> 00:18:32.331
that comes through these through the little
fissures in rocks. And that sometimes there

00:18:32.331 --> 00:18:38.850
are lakes and ponds within the rock and that's
where these microbes can live. And a lot of

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:47.370
it is just within the fissures of rocks. And,
and again, they, but they, they get the water

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:51.570
they need to get to do the tests from the
bore holes that are put in there. They get

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:58.190
it and they bring it back up. The, the aspect
of, of being down there that I found most

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:06.529
remarkable, it is very stark, very hot, very,
it feels like that if there is any place on

00:19:06.529 --> 00:19:10.750
Earth where you're not going to find something
living, it's here. But as because of what

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:16.490
I knew, you walk through these miles of caves
or of tunnels and you realize there's life

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:27.679
everywhere. It's just like this little microscopic
stuff and it's in the rocks. And remember

00:19:27.679 --> 00:19:34.679
my, to get to us, you need microbes so that's
where it all starts. Okay.

00:19:34.679 --> 00:19:40.590
NASA is, the consensus view now and this is
again a, a, quite a new thing within the last

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:45.070
five or 10 years. The consensus view is that
Mars had a period four billion years or so

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:51.529
ago where it was quite wet and it was warm.
It had a mag -- some kind of magnetic field

00:19:51.529 --> 00:19:56.320
which helped keep it, keep an atmosphere in
place which allowed for all of this to happen.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:01.350
This is obviously a rendering rather than
a reality but we, we know that there are all

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:10.519
these gullies and deltas and whatever else.
And so there is now this view that Mars was

00:20:10.519 --> 00:20:15.830
a potentially habitable place during that
period. This however was Earth at roughly

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:22.149
that period. We were getting clobbered by
a large, by a small planet that knocked into

00:20:22.149 --> 00:20:31.529
us, became the moon. It was an extremely uninhabitable
place for probably half a billion years or

00:20:31.529 --> 00:20:41.690
more. Through, through some of this geomicrobiology,
there has been the dates of the early, of

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:47.590
the detection of the earliest microbial life
goes back to about 3.8 billion years meaning

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:56.300
that life as far as we can tell began very
quickly. Either that it began very quickly

00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:01.499
between roughly 4 billion and 3.8 billion
years and we have no idea how this happened.

00:21:01.499 --> 00:21:09.700
But either it began very quickly or microbes
can live in very complicated, harsh environments.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:17.249
An asteroid hits Mars, kicks up some, some
rocks that have microbes in them. They troll

00:21:17.249 --> 00:21:24.429
around for a million years, two million years.
They land on Earth. We're all Martians. [laughter]

00:21:24.429 --> 00:21:31.269
[pause]
This is Mars now. It does not look like a

00:21:31.269 --> 00:21:36.309
very hospitable place. It looks like a beach
but without the hot dogs or anything. This

00:21:36.309 --> 00:21:44.499
is, this is the Phoenix Mission which went
up two years ago or so. And it went to the

00:21:44.499 --> 00:21:50.870
North Polar area and this is what it found.
It doesn't look like a big deal but that is

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:57.690
water ice and its right below the surface.
And this kind of confirms in a way what that

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:04.330
description earlier that Mars once had a lot
of water and was, and was no doubt warm. And

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:10.210
there is now an understanding that, that the
water, that this kind of ice is prevalent

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:18.830
throughout Mars under the surface. Here's
some more of those gullies. Now here is one

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:25.551
of the things to me that's very interesting.
Mike Mumma is one of the premier scientists

00:22:25.551 --> 00:22:32.279
slash astrobiologists. Just to backtrack for
a second, he grew up in Lancaster County,

00:22:32.279 --> 00:22:37.910
Pennsylvania which is a very conservative,
Amish area. He himself is not from an Amish

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:48.020
family but was very close to it. But he was
kind of an independent soul and had his own

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:53.000
sources of income when he was young. He had
a paper route and so on. So he was a free

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.419
thinker in that context and he would go to
church and in church he would be told that

00:22:58.419 --> 00:23:04.320
life began 4000 years ago and there was no
such thing as evolution and blah, blah. And

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:10.480
then at age 11, he had his first science class
and he learned about evolution and that maybe

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:15.789
it was four billion instead of six thousand
years and whatever. So he went to his minister

00:23:15.789 --> 00:23:20.900
and said, 'I don't understand. I am being
told such entirely different things.' And

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:25.970
as he described it, the minister told him
'The teacher was wrong and if you are going

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:31.059
to be in our church, this is what you have
to understand that.' So being the kind of

00:23:31.059 --> 00:23:38.279
person that he was, he left the church and
became a - the kind of person who is kind

00:23:38.279 --> 00:23:44.499
of the ultimate astrobiologist, who is, who
is taking nothing for granted, is challenging

00:23:44.499 --> 00:23:52.710
everything, is, is eager to kind of take on
conventional wisdom, if, especially if, the

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:55.149
science or the knowledge is leading him in
that direction.

00:23:55.149 --> 00:24:03.460
Well it took him 18 years but he came through
a year and a half ago with one of the major

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:09.210
discoveries of astrobiology. We know that
there is, there's trace amounts of methane

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:14.169
in the atmosphere of Mars and no one thought
it was a big deal since it was so little.

00:24:14.169 --> 00:24:19.399
But what he did was, was to refine it and
say, 'Well, wait a second. There are trace

00:24:19.399 --> 00:24:25.809
amounts but if you look at specific places,
at specific times,' and he did this with high-tech,

00:24:25.809 --> 00:24:32.320
with extremely sophisticated telescopes and
spectrometers, 'If you look at specific places,

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:40.590
specific times, you're gonna find large outpourings
of methane' and this is something that's kind

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:44.840
of revolutionized again the understanding
of Mars because it means that either there's

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:50.620
life down there. 90% of methane on Earth comes
from biological sources. Doesn't mean that

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:55.450
this is necessarily biological but it would,
if it's not biological, then that means Mars

00:24:55.450 --> 00:25:01.830
still is geologically alive which everyone
also assumed was not possible, that it had

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:10.620
died long ago. So methane on Mars is, is one
of the major breakthroughs and it, going back

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:18.049
to what I was saying earlier about the extremophiles,
it is a really interesting, potential insight

00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:26.350
because there's this whole class of, of bacteria
called methanogens and they produce methane.

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:33.679
And they could be perhaps living way deep
underground in Mars. Maybe they were earlier

00:25:33.679 --> 00:25:39.519
on the surface but then as Mars became far
more inhospitable, they went down. And so

00:25:39.519 --> 00:25:47.580
now, they are sending out this. The, both
NASA and European Space Administrations were

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:52.530
sufficiently impressed by all of this that
they changed their whole plans for a, for

00:25:52.530 --> 00:26:01.509
a mission in 2016, 2018. And it's gonna be
going to Mars to basically, to search for

00:26:01.509 --> 00:26:07.330
methane. Just a little view here of what it's
like in -- this is a place called Paranal

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:13.260
in northern Chile. This is the place where
it never rains and so obviously there are

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:20.629
no clouds. And this is where all the big mirrors
are now being built, utterly spectacular,

00:26:20.629 --> 00:26:26.971
utterly dry. They have an eight meter telescope
but, which is the largest that there is now.

00:26:26.971 --> 00:26:31.590
No, I think the largest is 10 meters. But
the Europeans are now building a 42 meter

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:39.710
telescope so in, in the, the years ahead,
the ability to see things that additional

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:47.820
technology that will lead to additional knowledge
is already in motion. As I, I went down with

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:54.129
Mumma to Paranal and this is what it looks
like and, and I remember driving on that road

00:26:54.129 --> 00:26:59.850
after going through the desert for two and
a half hours or so and arriving to that white

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:04.799
building and there wasn't a soul around. It
was like a neutron bomb had gone off. There

00:27:04.799 --> 00:27:13.490
was just nobody and I had no idea where, where
the telescopes were, where anything was. But

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:18.539
I was ushered out of the car and brought to
this dome here, this, I'm not sure you folks

00:27:18.539 --> 00:27:22.610
have it so much on the West Coast. But on
the East Coast, that's the kind of dome where

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:29.429
you put salt in for alongside the road when,
when the snow's gonna to be coming. So I'm

00:27:29.429 --> 00:27:34.570
walking down here saying, 'Why am I going
to the salt dome?' But underneath the soil,

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:42.649
this is what they built. It is, this is the
residence for, for folks who work here. And

00:27:42.649 --> 00:27:50.909
it is just extraordinarily beautiful and cool
and so bizarre in that kind of context. It

00:27:50.909 --> 00:27:55.899
was, it was wonderful to be there and just
as an experience but it was also an insight

00:27:55.899 --> 00:28:02.070
into what potentially sometime in the future
we can be doing, making on Mars or other places

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:12.529
that are equally un-, inhospitable. As it
turns out, the first astrobiology mission

00:28:12.529 --> 00:28:19.960
to Mars since Viking which was 1976 is going
up this, this fall. It's called, this is called

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:27.640
'Curiosity'. It is orders of magnitude more
sophisticated than what happened when Viking

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:33.269
went up. Viking was a remarkable success.
Two landers survived. They made it down. They

00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:39.909
did a bunch of tests, created a huge controversy
as to whether or not they found life. And

00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:44.830
it's still being argued today. But, so they
had interesting technology but they didn't

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:49.650
have nearly sufficient technology and they
didn't have nearly sufficient knowledge. With

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:56.429
a lot more going on now, this thing's going
to be able to land and within a year or two

00:28:56.429 --> 00:29:00.571
after the landing, we'll have some really
definitive answers about whether or not there

00:29:00.571 --> 00:29:06.059
are organics there, whether or not there is
signs that there was life, that, that then

00:29:06.059 --> 00:29:11.379
had impact on the rocks and other kinds of
things. So that is still going on despite

00:29:11.379 --> 00:29:14.600
what everyone says that NASA is dead or whatever.
That's not true.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:20.929
Okay. Step back for a second.
The universe is really, really big. This is

00:29:20.929 --> 00:29:28.019
the number of stars in the universe today.
Every couple years they put another zero at

00:29:28.019 --> 00:29:40.450
the end of it. It's, it's almost again to
me beyond comprehension. And the, well, in

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:46.309
the context of life, we'll see that this means
that the canvas that everything is being played

00:29:46.309 --> 00:29:55.440
on is vast. This is the Hubble Ultra Deep
which again amazing pictures. All of these

00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:02.429
dots are not stars but rather solar systems,
but rather galaxies, some of them a hundred

00:30:02.429 --> 00:30:08.889
million light years across. And the faintest
things are, go back to 14 billion years. So

00:30:08.889 --> 00:30:15.210
the magnitude of both the size of what we're
dealing with and the number of objects and

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:19.629
stars and whatever else we are dealing with
is huge and the amount of time is huge. So

00:30:19.629 --> 00:30:29.860
when we think about life, it, it's, it plays
out in such a, in such large, in such a large

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:37.129
arena that when people say, 'Well, we haven't
been visited by anyone. How could it be that

00:30:37.129 --> 00:30:41.440
there's intelligent life in the universe but
we haven't known about it?' Well, this is

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:47.110
just a small, teeny, tiny speck of the universe
that we know about and a very small, teeny,

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:53.659
tiny speck of time. There could have been
very sophisticated civilizations a billion

00:30:53.659 --> 00:31:04.899
years ago and then they died out, as we will.
Okay. The, in terms of the logic of extraterrestrial

00:31:04.899 --> 00:31:13.239
life, in recent years, they have also found
that everything needed for life is out there,

00:31:13.239 --> 00:31:21.259
like way out there. This was a once exploded
star. The green are polyaromatic hydrocarbons

00:31:21.259 --> 00:31:28.649
which are fairly complex rings of hydrocarbon
and so that's out there. Water's out there.

00:31:28.649 --> 00:31:33.490
Oxygen's out there. Hydrogen's out there.
Nitrogen's out there. Everything that you

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:41.109
need for life is out there. And one of the
ways we know about this, I mean they have

00:31:41.109 --> 00:31:45.700
been able to detect it through spectrometers
but they also know through meteorites that,

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:54.049
that land here. This is the best known meteor
or the most studied meteorite in history.

00:31:54.049 --> 00:31:59.490
It fell in Australia in the late '60's, the
Murchison meteorite. And just very quickly

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:08.340
what they found in addition to a lot of interesting
stuff was virtually every -- there are 20

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:13.429
amino acids that make up the proteins that
make up us. These are amino acids are not

00:32:13.429 --> 00:32:18.570
living things but they're essential building
blocks. All of the 20 amino acids that were

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:25.399
needed for life were found in the Murchison.
There were also, I don't know, upwards of

00:32:25.399 --> 00:32:33.759
a hundred others that were non-terrestrial
so this clearly came from beyond but again,

00:32:33.759 --> 00:32:40.359
so amino acids as well as water and hydrocarbons
are out there. As are nuclear bases also were

00:32:40.359 --> 00:32:46.690
found in here. So again how things might be
coming our direction and into every other

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:56.840
planet. The world of exoplanets is, is really,
really hot right now. They are finding, they

00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:04.389
have identified more than 500 exoplanets,
planets beyond our solar system. But, and

00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:12.109
there are candidates of about 1500 more but
the expectation now is that they are, they're

00:33:12.109 --> 00:33:16.879
out there in our own universe in the billions
in our own galaxy in the billions and in our

00:33:16.879 --> 00:33:25.970
own universe in the many, many hundreds of
billions. So planets are extremely common.

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:31.130
This is the Kepler Mission which is going
out now to- it's looking at just one four

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:38.859
hundredth of the sky and it's trying to make
a census of, of the planets that are there.

00:33:38.859 --> 00:33:48.320
It uses the, the transit, transit light system
where it identifies, it looks at the stars,

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:52.559
looks at all of the stars that are like a
hundred thousand, a hundred fifty thousand

00:33:52.559 --> 00:33:58.350
stars at once and it looks for just slight
declines in the amount of light radiation

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:02.649
that's coming out. And if, if they could find
that a couple times, that means there's an

00:34:02.649 --> 00:34:10.250
orbit and that means that there's a planet
going there. These are, this is actually the

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:15.630
grid that they look on. These are not the
actual planets but you can see that they're

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:21.650
finding not only super Jupiters which is what
they found early on, but getting down to Earth's

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:27.850
size and Neptune's size and so on. And now
this is very, very far away. I mean this is

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:33.570
hundreds of light years away. So they're doing
a census here. They're not trying to find

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:40.040
places where they might actually, where they
might actually go. However, this, this is

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:44.360
Paul Butler who is, I spent, I had the good
fortune of spending a lot of time with down

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:53.120
in Australia. He does a lot of different kind
of planet hunting. He uses radio velocity,

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:59.320
kind of the wobble of the sun, of the star
that would be created by the presence of an

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:05.450
exoplanet and so the gravitational pull is
-- very complex kind of stuff. But he, unlike

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:12.230
the folks who like to go to Atacama which
is so clear, he goes to this place in Australia

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:17.351
which, as you can see from the trees, is kind
of wet, which means that there's often a lot

00:35:17.351 --> 00:35:22.250
of rain and not too many astronomers want
to go there anymore. But he loves going there

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:27.700
because to do his method, he has to be observing
a month, two months, three months at a time.

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:32.330
And so he goes there and does that. He just
sits there and every night and he is, he is

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:39.550
personally been responsible for, or personally
or as a team responsible for about half of

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:51.200
the 500 plus exoplanets that have been clearly
identified. And that's his Doppler shift method.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:57.860
He somewhat controversially, he and a colleague
announced earlier this year that they had

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:03.200
found what, what was then considered to be
their first Goldilocks planet which means

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:10.640
it's in a habitable zone, close enough to
its star that, that there could be, that,

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:16.900
that water wouldn't boil away and also far
enough the other way around. Close enough

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:22.400
so there could be liquid water and far enough
so that there, everything wouldn't be frozen.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:28.510
This is kind of the Holy Grail of, of the
Kepler Mission as well and of, of exoplanet

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:34.370
work generally is to find planets that are
in habitable zones. And most recently, a gentleman

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:39.990
named Geoff Marcy who is from your area. He's
at Berkley. He is another one of the great

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:46.750
planet hunters, put out a paper that based
on what they have found so far, this is like

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:53.320
extrapolation on extrapolation. But even so,
they said in our solar system -- I'm sorry.

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:58.970
In our galaxy, there is every reason to think
that there are billions of planets in habitable

00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:08.690
zones. So final thing along these lines. They
are also able to find increasingly what kind

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:15.330
of chemicals are, what kind of elements are
in the atmospheres of stars far, far away.

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:21.230
Or planets, rather, far, far away. Mostly
they have found carbon dioxide and methane.

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:26.570
That's not biological kind of methane. But
what they're looking for is oxygen and ozone.

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:35.590
Oxygen binds very quickly with whatever's
around. And it, it will be found in large

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:41.100
amounts in an atmosphere only if there's something
biological there creating it. So if they find

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:46.890
oxygen or ozone in large amounts in, in an
atmosphere, in a very distant atmosphere,

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:53.530
then they're like 97% sure that they can then
say there's life there.

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:58.670
So, here's the logic of, of what I've been
putting together. And again, I'm a reporter

00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:04.810
and brought this and an author now, hopefully
and brought this together from all these scientists.

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:10.320
But life, a lot more tenacious than previously
imagined; billions of exoplanets likely to

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:17.410
exist; habitable zones common; the molecules
and compounds needed for life as we know it

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:25.220
are out there. If life started once, why not
elsewhere? And, and here is kind of the clincher

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:31.210
in a way, and why finding microbial life on
Mars or Europa or wherever else might be so

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:39.150
important. If there's just one genesis in
our little solar system, then you say, 'Okay.

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:43.520
Maybe it's an anomaly. I don't know. Maybe
it's weird it would be an anomaly. But I guess

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:49.490
it's conceivable.' But if there were two,
if life started on two different planets and

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:55.540
it wasn't the same kind of life, then you
reach the point where probability says like

00:38:55.540 --> 00:39:02.370
this, that life has to be a common place elsewhere
or across, throughout the universe. And it

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:07.260
would be impossible that just one chump change
kind of solar system would end up with two

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:13.830
varieties of, two origins of life.
So what are we looking for in terms of life?

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:20.910
Not this. It would be nice but not likely.
These are called 'snotties'. They're bacteria.

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:27.340
They grow in caves. They're very primitive.
You know it wouldn't be, it's not like it's

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:34.170
someone you could talk to but the whole logic
again is if you find it, then the logic of

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:41.630
evolution says that, 'Why wouldn't that turn
into a snow leopard someday?' Long day, long

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:53.010
in the distance. This is a nematode which
is going to be in the news next week. It,

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:59.770
there's going to be an article in the Journal
of Nature which says that in those same South

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:06.640
African mines that not only did they find
single cell microbes but they also found this

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:13.260
thing which is a roundworm which is complex
as these things go. That it has a nervous

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:19.110
system, it has a respiratory system, it has
a system to take in food and to get rid of

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:26.391
it. And they found it in the same, in the
same area not, they couldn't identify it as

00:40:26.391 --> 00:40:32.560
being as old as the bacteria but it's kind
of as a proof of principle that you can have

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:39.761
complex life way, way down. It harkens back
to Mars and methane that might be coming out

00:40:39.761 --> 00:40:45.050
of there and our understanding of where you
look for life and what life might be. Well,

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:52.100
he found it two miles down and was complex
life. This is just a fun thing. This was put

00:40:52.100 --> 00:41:00.400
together by NASA. The logic of our understanding
of, of the world of the universe is, is like

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:07.030
so totally off reality. You could, if you
were in a, on a planet where there were binary

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:14.510
stars, photosynthesis could very easily not
only turn trees strange colors like this but

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:16.960
you could actually there was a paper that
was put out recently.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:21.850
You can have leaves that are photosynthesized,
that are photosynthetic and are totally black

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:31.980
which I thought was a lot of fun. One last
step back. Alpha Centauri, this is the nearest

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:39.430
star system that has planets. It's 4.2 light
years away which by the comparison of a lot

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:44.190
of the other stuff seems like it's not much.
But since the whole idea of wormholes and

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:51.230
warp speed is fiction as opposed to fact,
our ability to get to places like this is,

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:57.460
is going to be, unless you guys come up with
it, it's not going to happen for a long time.

00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:04.570
So what we're left with is SETI for better
or worse. When I started this, I didn't know

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:10.090
a whole lot about SETI and what I did I was
kind of skeptical, truth be told. But the

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:16.050
more I learned, I realized that one, it's
essential to this whole understanding, this

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:23.310
whole picture of, of extraterrestrial life
because if we do find microbial life on Mars,

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:29.600
how are we going to know what might else be
out there? It's too far away. So they're listening

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:35.000
and they also have gotten a lot of their science
is much more rigorous. They have this array

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.730
at Hat Creek. Forty two dishes now. They hoped
to go up to 500. Alas, they just ran out of

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:45.900
money to operate [laughs] so they're not operating
there anymore. But it was all money that was

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:53.410
donated, a lot of it was donated by Paul Allen
or other fairly wealthy and savvy people in

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:59.960
Silicon Valley. So it's not like they're saying,
it's not like this is craziness. Their partners

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:05.670
are the University of California Berkley Radio
Astronomy Lab. So its sophisticated stuff

00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:12.320
and they will again get the money and they
will start once more. In my travels, I was

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:18.120
in, I went to Japan where their first ever
major SETI observation -- this guy is named

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:23.060
Shin-ya Narusawa. He wants to be the Carl
Sagan of Japan. And as you can see, he's got

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:30.080
already people, a lot of media there. There
were 23 observatories. Over two days, they

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:35.210
were all looking at one star system that had
been recommended by Carl Sagan and Paul Horowitz,

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:42.550
two of the icons of, of this whole world.
They looked. They didn't find anything but

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:49.170
the whole idea was to figure out a way to
do everything together. I will end with this

00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:56.980
note. When I, after this was over and after
the stories began coming out about what they

00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:02.860
had been doing, I was with Shin-ya and he
started to get calls, a lot of calls and he

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:08.760
was rolling his eyes and talking at length
and you could tell he was trying to calm people

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:14.370
down. And he's speaking Japanese; I didn't
know what he was saying. But I later asked

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:18.220
what was happening and he said, 'Well you
know whenever we do something like this and

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:23.950
whenever we, there's, there's press about
it, we get all these calls from people saying,

00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:31.190
"Don't let them know we're here". [laughs]
"That this is dangerous". Now of course, we're

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:38.360
not letting them know we're here. They're
just listening. But there is this whole discussion

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:45.750
going on now about whether or not we should
also do METI which is 'messaging of extraterrestrial

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:52.850
intelligence' which for the most part is not
being done because of calls like this. And

00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:58.470
Stephen Hawking very famously said the same
recently, that sending out messages would

00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:05.870
be too dangerous. That when superior technologies,
or societies with superior technology interact

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:11.990
with those with inferior technology, meaning
us, that it always turns out poorly for the

00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:19.780
latter. And so, but that's a discussion that
really, that's going on now and it'll be exciting

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:25.220
to, to follow. And a final thought, I kind
of bring this back to the world of belief.

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:32.480
I mean there is this incredible body of science
now that's been put together. And yet we're

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:38.360
now still left with this question of 'Well,
you know, extraterrestrial life. Is it bad?

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:43.100
Is it good? Are they going to hurt us? Are
they going to not hurt us?' And, and in a

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:50.560
way, it's sobering that that is still there
but it's the same process hopefully will occur

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:57.770
where belief is gradually kind of chopped
down and knocked in, and put aside as science

00:45:57.770 --> 00:46:07.000
moves forward and finds realities which has
happened and hopefully will happen a lot more.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.220
Thank you.
