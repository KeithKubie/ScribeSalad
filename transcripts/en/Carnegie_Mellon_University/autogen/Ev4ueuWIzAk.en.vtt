00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:00.540
view that Dean Garrett has been talking
 

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:04.130
view that Dean Garrett has been talking
about for quite some time as a city as a

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:04.140
about for quite some time as a city as a
 

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.220

smart city is really a system of

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:07.230
smart city is really a system of
 

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:11.210

multiple systems these various silos

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:11.220
multiple systems these various silos
 

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.430
multiple systems these various silos
think of them as a system of its own but

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440
think of them as a system of its own but
 

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.290
think of them as a system of its own but
it's really as a city is really a system

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:15.300
it's really as a city is really a system
 

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.120
it's really as a city is really a system
of systems so we need to worry about

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:17.130
of systems so we need to worry about
 

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:21.980
of systems so we need to worry about

and then meanwhile there has to be a

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:22.500
and then meanwhile there has to be a
 

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.710
and then meanwhile there has to be a
policy framework in place that basically

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720
policy framework in place that basically
 

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.800
policy framework in place that basically
makes the the business model of the

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:27.810
makes the the business model of the
 

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.290
makes the the business model of the
operation be sustainable with

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:30.300

point eloquently as well that the

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:34.800
point eloquently as well that the
 

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.310
point eloquently as well that the
benefits are equitable across the

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320
benefits are equitable across the
 

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.390
benefits are equitable across the
resistance of the metropolitan region

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400
resistance of the metropolitan region
 

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.220
resistance of the metropolitan region
right so there's basically the

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:40.230
right so there's basically the
 

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:42.860
right so there's basically the
innovation angle but an innovation by

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:42.870
innovation angle but an innovation by
 

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:45.200
innovation angle but an innovation by
itself is basically sits on a shelf we

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:45.210
itself is basically sits on a shelf we
 

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:46.190
itself is basically sits on a shelf we
need to be able to actually work with

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200

the policy framework supporting it so

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080
the policy framework supporting it so
 

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.240
the policy framework supporting it so
those are really two complementary

00:18:59.240 --> 00:18:59.250
those are really two complementary
 

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.940
those are really two complementary

that it does not work if you have a good

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:27.690
that it does not work if you have a good
 

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:29.840
that it does not work if you have a good
model you can test it the model if it

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:29.850
model you can test it the model if it
 

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:31.760

works well in the model maybe there are

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:31.770
works well in the model maybe there are
 

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:33.140
works well in the model maybe there are
good chances actually works in the real

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:33.150

can we model that sequence if so if you
 

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.470
can we model that sequence if so if you
have that model in place we can inject

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480
have that model in place we can inject
 

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.440
