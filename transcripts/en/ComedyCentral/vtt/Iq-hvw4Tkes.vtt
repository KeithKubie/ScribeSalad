00:00:01.735 --> 00:00:02.969
- Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:04.771
it is an honor for us
to have on the show,

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:08.108 align:start size:84% position:16%
the infamous dictator
Benito Mussolini!

00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:09.943
- Hi,

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:10.810
(applause)

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.912
- [Benito] Grazie.

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:15.648
- Now Benito, may
I call you Benito?

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:18.685
- Well my friends
call me Benito.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:21.855
But none of them
are brown, so no.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.823
(booing)

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:24.657
Hey!

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:27.060
- Oh he was joking!

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.695
(laughter and applause)

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.530
Oh my goodness when
I need good ratings,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.333 align:start size:84% position:16%
racists are the big
hilarious, am I right?

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.234
Very funny.

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:38.071 align:start size:94% position:6%
Now Mr. Mussolini, I don't
mean to embarrass you,

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:42.776
but we have found something
very special from your past.

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:43.777
Take a look.

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:49.015 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Oh Diego, that house is
the first place I politically

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:52.685
persecuted someone for
being different than me.

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:54.254
- Aww!

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:55.655
Am I right, a round of applause.

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:56.623
He really tells it
like it is folks,

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:58.458
really tells it like it is.

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:01.227
Mr. Mussolini, let's
take a serious note.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:02.729
You have been known
to say some pretty

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.231
controversial things,

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:08.835 align:start size:84% position:16%
some would even say,
hateful rhetoric.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:10.370
- Okay, that's true.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.971 align:start position:0%
- Now in light of that, there's
a question I must ask you

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:15.208 align:start size:84% position:16%
that the folks at
home deserve to know.

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.511
Is Mussolini a ticklish man?

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:20.747
Is he ticklish?

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:21.748
Should I tickle him?

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:23.750
May I tickle you?

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.851
- Okay.

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:26.386
- Okay, let's try it on.

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:28.154 align:start size:81% position:19%
Oh, here comes
the tickle master!

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:31.091
(roaring laughter)

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:33.460
The tickle man want to aha!

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.829
- Oh you have humanized me!

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.165 align:start size:84% position:16%
- We'll be right back,
oh tickle tickle!
