HelloTalk is a platform

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:09.551
that connects language learners all over the world

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:11.727
which makes language learning fun and engaging

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.271
My name is Zackery Ngai, founder and CEO of HelloTalk

00:00:16.527 --> 00:00:20.047
I was born in Hainan, and grew up in Hong Kong

00:00:20.111 --> 00:00:21.327
I have also studied in the United States

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:22.735
and worked in South Korea

00:00:22.863 --> 00:00:27.019
Through my multicultural experiences

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:28.939
I founded HelloTalk

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:31.831
I hope every language learner

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:34.263
gets to connect with native speakers

00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:36.631
and have real conversations

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:39.383
Since its launch in 2013

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:42.327
it has gained overwhelming popularity among language learners

00:00:42.647 --> 00:00:45.911
We have over 12M users globally

00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:48.663
and last year we won the award

00:00:48.791 --> 00:00:51.095
of Google Play's Best of 2017 for Social Apps

00:00:51.863 --> 00:00:54.231
It’s very challenging

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.363
to develop a real-time chat app like HelloTalk

00:00:56.363 --> 00:00:56.938
Fortunately

00:00:56.938 --> 00:01:00.237
we have the Google Play Console to help improve app quality

00:01:02.378 --> 00:01:05.883
Android vitals collects and displays data about app performance

00:01:05.883 --> 00:01:08.123
including a detailed breakdown by device

00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:11.151
This allows quick optimization for target devices

00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:15.124
to help improve crash rates and user experience

00:01:15.188 --> 00:01:16.276
With Android vitals

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.668
HelloTalk has reduced ANR (app not responding) rate by 60%

00:01:19.796 --> 00:01:23.444
and excessive wakeups by 95%

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.692
HelloTalk has built a stable business model with subscriptions

00:01:29.204 --> 00:01:31.316
After adopting Google Play subscription model

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.004
we saw an increase of 350% in revenue compared to previous year

00:01:34.324 --> 00:01:38.164
HelloTalk’s renewal rate is around 75%

00:01:38.484 --> 00:01:41.620
When auto renewal payment fails

00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:44.820
users are granted a 7-day grace period to fix payment issues

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:49.364
which improved renewal decline recovery by 13%

00:01:49.812 --> 00:01:54.164
We also run introductory pricing offer for potential buyers

00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:57.400
our short-term income has also nearly quadrupled

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.548
HelloTalk has been a global communications platform since day one

00:02:02.868 --> 00:02:05.300
Users can practise over 100 languages

00:02:05.428 --> 00:02:08.500
with learning partners from 200 countries

00:02:08.884 --> 00:02:11.001
Play Console analytics show us that 

00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:12.892
retention rates in Japan and South Korea 

00:02:12.956 --> 00:02:15.732
are much higher than internal average

00:02:15.796 --> 00:02:17.908
This provides us with a good reason to invest more in localizing the app

00:02:17.972 --> 00:02:21.812
for these two countries - from language to operations

00:02:21.876 --> 00:02:23.220
Thanks to Google Play

00:02:23.604 --> 00:02:26.036
HelloTalk’s rating in Play Store

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.980
has climbed from 3.7 to above 4.3

00:02:29.044 --> 00:02:32.244
which strengthens our determination to create better user experiences

00:02:32.308 --> 00:02:33.524
through new technology

00:02:33.588 --> 00:02:35.060
We sincerely hope that

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:38.900
everyone can master at least 3 languages

00:02:39.028 --> 00:02:41.332
while making new friends in different countries

00:02:41.396 --> 00:02:42.484
and enjoying the happiness

00:02:42.676 --> 00:02:46.196
brought by culture diversity through HelloTalk
