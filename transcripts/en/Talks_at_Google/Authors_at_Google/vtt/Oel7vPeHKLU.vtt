CAMILLE JAMES: Hi, my name
is Camille James.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.810
I'm from the family programs
team here at Google, and we're

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.920
very excited to have Kathy
Ireland with us here today.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.740
So on behalf of talks
at Google, we'd like

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.720
to welcome you all.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.210
We're going to watch a short
intro video before Kathy comes

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.180
to the stage.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.770
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.100
-So Dorothy, just in time
for this year's "Sports

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.810
Illustrated" swimsuit issue.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.710
You have our interesting cover
for "Forbes" with Kathy

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.450
Ireland, who it turns out,
is a bit of a mogul.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.410
How'd that happen?

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.810
-That's right.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.890
When you think of Kathy Ireland,
you really still

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.590
think of the swimsuit model, the
gorgeous young girl from

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.910
the cover of the magazines.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.860
But the truth is that in the
time since she stopped being a

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.580
swimsuit model, she's been
building a very big, very

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.730
legitimate business.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.480
-Hi, I'm Kathy Ireland.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.330
At Kathy Ireland Office by Bush
Furniture, we're finding

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.670
solutions for people
in business.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.300
Our design--

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.800
-How come we don't know more
about that, though?

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.750
From what you said and what
you reported, she actually

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.930
sells more merchandise than
Martha Stewart does.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.490
None of the same publicity
around it.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.780
-Yeah.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.120
She keeps it under the radar.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.510
I mean, she said herself that
she is glad that she's been

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.650
able to build her company
under the radar.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.400
But part of keeping it under
the radar means that she's

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.120
selling some things that a lot
of people don't think about.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.420
She sells flooring.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.680
There's about $400 million in
replacement windows that are

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.540
sold that are Kathy Ireland
replacement windows.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.020
-People buy Kathy Ireland
replacement windows?

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.180
-Yeah.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.560
I mean, who knew what a
replacement window was?

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.450
-Looking in this vignette,
lightning, upholstery, window

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.680
treatments, rugs, and more is
all available from our Kathy

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.110
Ireland collections.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.120
-But on top of that, she also
has a big bridal business.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.410
She has villas in Hawaii and in
Los Angeles where you can

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.650
go and have a wedding.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.070
She does wedding dresses.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.960
She has tableware.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.420
She has jewelry.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.040
I mean, almost anything you
can think of around that,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.560
there's a Kathy Ireland branded
product that you could

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.920
use in your wedding.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.710
-So how big is this business?

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.520
You spent some time with the
numbers, and I know that

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.950
they're a little opaque
about them.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:59.290
-Yeah.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.740
They don't love to talk about
the numbers over at Kathy

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.690
Ireland Worldwide.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.570
It's a private company.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.010
I mean, that's their right.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.630
But we did crunch the numbers.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.364
-And how much of that
does she own?

00:02:08.364 --> 00:02:10.190
-She owns 100% of the company.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.950
-So Kathy Ireland, while not a
billionaire, and probably not

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.120
any time soon, in terms of
top earners in and around

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.290
Hollywood, how is she doing?

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.100
-At "Forbes" here, we
look at people who

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.040
earn billions of dollars.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.000
So by some of our rich list
people it's not so big.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.880
But when you look at the
Hollywood world, they don't

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.320
earn hundreds of millions
of dollars, generally.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.560
So for her to be worth even half
a billion dollars is an

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.860
impressive achievement.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.750
-So how did that happen?

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.180
-It started with a
line of socks.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.910
Someone came to her and
said, would you

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.070
model a line of socks?

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.130
This was in around 1993.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.540
She was coming to the end
of her modeling career.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.280
She said, you know what?

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.950
I don't want to model your
socks, I want to go into

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:47.880
business with you.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.250
I want these to be Kathy Ireland
socks, and I want to

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.750
have some ownership
in this company.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:53.680
From there they moved into

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.930
sportswear, eventually swimsuits.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.850
She was very specific she did
not want to start with

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.850
swimsuits because her feeling
was, of course people are

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.940
going to buy swimsuits
with my name on them.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:03.890
Will they buy stocks?

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.330
If they can buy socks, then I
see that there's going to be a

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.840
legitimate business here.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.650
-So how do we get to replacement
windows?

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.420
-She had a line of clothing
at Kmart for a long time.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.690
She came to the realization that
home goods are a little

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.570
more stable.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.530
They don't change as often.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.340
You could start to make
inroads in there.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.350
Her first thing that she did
in home goods was floors.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.115
Very unsexy.

00:03:25.115 --> 00:03:28.270
But her feeling was we started
with socks as the foundation

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.890
for our clothing line, we'll
start with floors as the

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.000
foundation for our
home goods line.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.590
And from there it grew, And she
realized that in this very

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.600
unsexy business of furniture,
there were no brands.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.120
And if something says Kathy
Ireland, it's just that little

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.730
thing that makes people
buying furniture

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.620
say, oh, Kathy Ireland.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.060
I associate that
with something.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.790
With some kind of glamor or some
kind of assurance more

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.670
than this name that I've
never heard of.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.310
So maybe I'll get the Kathy
Ireland one instead.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.100
The brand is powerful in the
furniture business, which most

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.210
people don't know much about.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.510
-So you go up, you visit
her at her house.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.620
You sit-in on a business meeting
and something catches

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.040
your eye there?

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.630
-Yes.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.150
I was sitting in her living room
and there's an Oscar in

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.950
her living room.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.620
-As far as we know, we've never
seen her in something

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.600
Oscar worthy.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.000
-No.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.880
I mean, she certainly has
had an acting career.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.440
But she herself will admit
that she was not the best

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.920
actress out there.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.720
It turns out the Oscar was a
gift from Elizabeth Taylor.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.870
And it turns out that Elizabeth
Taylor and Kathy

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.340
Ireland were very, very close.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.080
When Kathy Ireland talks about
Elizabeth Taylor, she talks

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.770
about her in the
present tense.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.180
She can't talk about her as
somebody who's passed.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.500
That's how close she
was in life.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.120
She learned a lot about jewelry
from Elizabeth Taylor.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.020
Elizabeth Taylor, of course, had
this mammoth, $50 million,

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.070
maybe, collection worth of
jewelry, and she taught Kathy

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.670
Ireland to look at jewelery.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.450
Kathy built herself up her
own collection of jewelry

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.850
-And her people say
it's worth?

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.860
-They say it's estimated at
maybe around $25 million.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.230
But it's not kept in her home.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.960
It's kept in a safe
in Los Angeles.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.395
And they felt it was
very important that

00:04:58.395 --> 00:04:59.420
I point that out.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.750
The more you talk to Kathy
island, the more sort of

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.640
strange details start to come
out about her and her company.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.980
She was very influenced
by Warren Buffett.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.000
So she has furniture at the
Nebraska Furniture Mart, which

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.910
is owned by Berkshire
Hathaway.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.130
She does flooring with Shaw
Furniture, which is also owned

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.630
by Berkshire Hathaway.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.850
She really looks up to Warren
Buffett as somebody who she

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:20.650
wants to emulate.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.010
And in fact, her company is
becoming a wide conglomerate

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.020
of lots of different kinds of
businesses, almost in the same

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.920
sort of way that Berkshire
Hathaway is, but at a much

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.170
lower valuation.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:43.680

CAMILLE JAMES: Now,
for a quick intro.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.730
Launched in 1993, Kathy Ireland
Worldwide is the 25th

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.430
most popular,
powerfully-licensed brand in

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.300
the world, ranking higher than
Martha Stewart, Tommy Bahama,

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.650
and Polo Ralph Lauren.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.650
As chair, CEO, and chief
designer of an entity that is

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.340
now $2 billion--

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.850
I'm sorry, now a $2 billion
industry according to

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.580
"Forbes," which sells over
45,000 products in over 50,000

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.950
retail stores in 50 countries.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.430
No wonder "Forbes" has named
Kathy a Super Mogul and the

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.890
first lady of flyover country.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.830
Fairchild Publications named
her one of the 50 Most

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.110
Influential People in Fashion.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.660
Kathy resides in Southern
California with her husband

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.590
Greg and their three
children--

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.680
Eric, Lily, and Chloe--

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.110
balancing her responsibilities
as a wife, a mother, a

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.270

an entrepreneur.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.594
So ladies and gentlemen and
Googlers, welcome Kathy.

you, Camille.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.340
CAMILLE JAMES: Thank you.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.730
KATHY IRELAND: Thank
you, Camille.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:53.880
Hello, everybody.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.220
It's so great to be here
At Googleplex.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.650
This place is incredible.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.640
And being here in beautiful
Mountain View, it makes me

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:08.580
very mindful we are in the
heartland of great leaders.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.440
And those great leaders include
your very own Sergey

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.240
Brin, Larry Page,
Eric Schmidt.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.270
And they're great leaders
because they lead an

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.330
incredible team.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.500
And that's all of you.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.770
There is incredible awareness
about Google, about this team,

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.710
about all of you.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.540
If people are aware of me,
it's usually fragmented.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.170
If you didn't blink, you might
have caught my very brief

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.300
twirl on "Dancing with
the Stars" before

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.550
I got the big boot.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:44.860
I'm looking around here.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.750
Maybe your parents might
remember me as that model

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:52.570
person from back in
the last century.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:57.570
And you have incredible people
come and speak with you.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:02.260
So when you found out you got
me, it's likely that some of

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.130
you might have thought,
Kathy Ireland?

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.830
Oh, come on.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:06.880
What's she going to do today?

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.410
Dig up as old pose and
teach it to us?

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:11.090
Well, OK.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.340
If you're interested,
all right.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.030
After a really big meal-- and
you guys have great food at

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.600
this facility--

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.975
turns sideways.

00:08:18.975 --> 00:08:20.450
Suck it in.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.930
Twist at the torso,
and you create the

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.170
illusion of a waistline.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.630
It's all an illusion.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.920
And then, after indulging in
desserts, which I love to do,

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.760
get yourself a really good
photo retoucher.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.580
Mine is a woman named
Paulinda.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.640
Today with Photoshop, anything
can be done.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.600
It is wonderful.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.640
Those are my biggest secrets
of modeling.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.050
You can see with that pose,
I was OK as a model.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.410
Certainly, not super.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:53.370
Always knew I belonged on the
other side of the lens.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:57.190
Design and business
were my passions.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:02.550
And I was more interested in
designing the red carpet than

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.040
walking it.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.090
The truly supermodels who worked
in that industry when I

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:14.690
did included Cindy, Cheryl,
Christie, Naomi, Heidi, Tyra.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:19.390
These supermodels were and
continue to be seen and heard

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:20.910
everywhere.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:25.430
I was occasionally seen,
very rarely heard.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.160
Yes, my job description
was shut up and pose.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.240
When I had the rare occasion to
speak, a critic said that I

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.560
had a voice that could
kill small animals.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.640
Not a real confidence builder.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:45.660
Criticism can be a gift,
sometimes wrapped in a really

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.300
nasty package.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.750
And in order to discern if it's
noise that needs to be

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:56.950
tossed away, turned off, or if
there's something we can learn

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.270
from it, we've got to open it.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:59.110
And I had to admit.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:00.950
I was 25 years old.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.540
I couldn't even order a pizza.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.840
I had a really high voice and
they thought I was a kid

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.090
making a prank phone call.

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:11.050
So that criticism was a fork
in the road for me.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:15.490
It forced me to decide if I
would let the cruelty of those

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:21.780
remarks forever silence me or
if, despite the criticism, I

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.540
would speak out on issues
of importance.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:30.530
And I'm so happy to be
here with you today.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.410
It's mind boggling to be here.

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:35.020
We had a fantastic tour today.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:39.620
I mean, everybody has been so
kind, from Cliff to Mike,

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.040
Matt, Gobi, Abigail.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.860
Just amazing.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:50.520
And your history, it's
so inspiring.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:55.430
From 1842 when this was a
Mexican land grant divided

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:59.160
into Mountain View
and in Sunnyvale.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:05.080
And to think, I'm excited with
your stewardship what the next

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.720
5 years, 10 years, 50 years
are going to look like.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.510
We know that this town, its
growth was attributed to

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:15.180
agriculture.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:19.430
And those seeds, they continue
to germinate, to flourish.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:22.940
But instead of turning into
plants, those seeds are the

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:27.690
ideas that are flourishing
and that are

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:30.340
serving people globally.

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.320
And for that, we thank you.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.290
You are truly amazing.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:38.050
And it's exciting what's
happening.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.090
I'm going to share with you just
a little bit about our

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:44.730
family dynamic, so you'll
understand why modeling didn't

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:45.760
rank high--

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.420
the achievement level.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.370
My husband, as well as being an
emergency room physician,

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:53.160
is a commercial fisherman.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.050
When he's not saving lives,
he's killing lobster.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:57.570
Mom worked as a nurse.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.800
My dad worked with labor
relations with the farm worker

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.580
Cesar Chavez.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.610
So great people.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.110
My husband would come home from
work and talk about a

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:07.420
life he helped save.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.500
And I'd come home and it's
like, well, I came

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.850
up with a new pose.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:12.735
And you all saw it.

00:12:12.735 --> 00:12:14.020
So you know what I mean.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.480
It was a really pathetic
time in my life.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.580
I mean, I'm telling you, I had
a full-on pity party-- the

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.000
cake, ice cream, hat,
the whole works.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.600
I had the arrogance to expect
that I ought to receive all of

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:31.890
my fulfillment from my work when
all I had to do was open

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.630
my eyes and extend my arms.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:36.880
There are needs all around.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.490
And with Google.org, you
understand that.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:46.310
And we're all so grateful for
the incredible work that you

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:51.310
do, everything for working to
eradicate poverty, to serve

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:52.940
people through education.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.740
What you do to help
the environment--

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:55.690
amazing.

00:12:55.690 --> 00:13:00.520
There is so, so much that we
need to learn from you.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.420
And something that I had to
learn during that time was to

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:08.160
get over my hubris and
to learn to be a

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.630
servant and a student.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.165
I love to learn.

00:13:12.165 --> 00:13:16.410
Being mentored and mentoring,
those are passions of mine.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.960
And through Google, we can be
mentored by people in the

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.170
present, the past instantly.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:27.070
In the video, I talked about
Elizabeth Taylor.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:31.540
If you Google Elizabeth Taylor,
you'll learn about her

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.170
legendary film career.

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.400
You'll see gorgeous images.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.620
You'll learn about her
work with HIV/AIDS.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:43.880
What cannot be contained, even
in the pages of Google, is her

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.590
enormous heart.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:49.790
And what a privilege to be
mentored by this woman in the

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:53.720
'80s when the AIDS epidemic
was just reaching us.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.220
She was frustrated that so
little was being done.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.500
Why isn't anybody
doing anything?

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.160
One day she looked in
the mirror and she

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.570
said, wait a minute.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:06.580
I'm somebody and I
can do something.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.580
When she called her friends
to ask for help,

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.110
they hung up on her.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:13.410
She received death threats.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:17.060
Her business associates pleaded
with her to just let

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.780
this thing alone.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:21.580
She didn't let any
of that stop her.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.510
She boldly moved forward and
established the Elizabeth

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:28.580
Taylor HIV/AIDS Foundation
and amFAR.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:33.900
And there is so much that she
did that we will never know

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.770
because some of it wasn't
even legal.

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:37.840
But she wouldn't let
that stop her.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.320
And she continues to be the
Joan of Arc of AIDS.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.790
And her work continues
from heaven today.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.920
Being mentored is powerful.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:52.330
And as we get that opportunity,
then to give back

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:58.390
and to mentor, to be able to
share with others a little bit

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:02.410
about our journey, that
is a joy for me.

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:05.740
Most of my lessons I've
learned the hard way.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.440
I look at failure
as education.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.530
In that respect, I'm
very well educated.

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:14.140
And I hope there's something
from our journey that can

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.670
benefit yours as well.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:21.370
Today, many women are
called mompreneurs.

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:23.460
Are there any moms here today?

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.820
Anybody out here?

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.596
Oh, you, too?

00:15:27.596 --> 00:15:29.470
Yes.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:30.570
How many kids do you have?

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:30.940
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.450
KATHY IRELAND: Two.

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:33.375
And what about you?

00:15:33.375 --> 00:15:33.630
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:34.410
KATHY IRELAND: Two.

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.280
And what are their ages?

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.100
AUDIENCE: Five and eight.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:37.880
KATHY IRELAND: Five and eight.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:41.700
KATHY IRELAND: And you never
stop being a mom.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:46.380
I mean, it goes on and on.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:49.820
When I was a kid, something that
frustrated me is when--

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:55.560
my mom's, when her career was
being a mom, that people would

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.840
say, well, you don't work.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.560
I was like, what?

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.680
Are you kidding me, that's the
hardest job in the world.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.250
And all moms work whether
we get paid or not.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:09.370
I can't think of anything more
challenging or important than

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:10.250
raising children.

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:13.030
And I think sadly in our
society, because a paycheck

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.670
isn't attached, that the
career of being a mom

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:20.435
oftentimes doesn't receive the
empathy and the respect that

00:16:20.435 --> 00:16:21.230
it deserves.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.490
But I am so happy to be a
mompreneur and to share with

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:30.100
you our journey from the beach
to the board room and beyond.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.890
Something I love about
Googleplex is you are

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:34.850
passionate people.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:37.350
And I love that 20%
of your time is

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:39.770
devoted to your passions.

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:44.610
And out of those, of that time,
the innovations are just

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:45.490
astounding.

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.580
I mean, from Gmail, all of it.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.280
It's incredible.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:53.640
And my passion have always
been design and business.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.950
My first job was a combination
of both.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:59.040
I was four years old, sold
painted rocks from my wagon

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.820
with my sister Mary.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:04.589
Mary being three years older,
designs more sophisticated,

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:05.970
sold hers for a dime.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:08.050
I sold mine for a nickel.

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:11.099
And even at that reduced rate,
I did really well.

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:13.260
I learned at a young age
that my customers

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.430
appreciate a good value.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:18.490
And I've got to admit, I was
tempted to market my rocks,

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:21.579
buy two of mine for
one of Mary's.

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:24.030
But I realized that would
be unfair competition.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:28.550
And it's much more fun to
celebrate our differences and

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:31.220
to work in partnership
together.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:34.780
From there, when I was about
seven, started designing

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:39.340
handbags and jewelry to
coordinate with the 1970s

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.400
halter dresses that my mom sewed
from our home and we

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.120
sold at beach fairs.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.840
My first serious job, though,
was a paper route.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.530
11 years old and my dad kind of
gently shoves a newspaper

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:56.900
under my nose with an ad that
read newspaper carrier wanted.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.200
Are you the boy for the job?

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.090
So dad knew what kind of
reaction that was going

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:04.080
to get out of me.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:08.000
I wrote to the newspaper and I
said, no, I'm not the boy for

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.060
the job, I'm the girl
for the job.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:12.950
I can do this route just
as well as any boy.

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:14.650
I deserve a chance.

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:18.260
First day, New Year's day,
papers are extra thick and I'm

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.970
a really scrawny 11-year-old
thinking, what have I gotten

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:23.680
myself into?

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:27.330
I'm peddling up this really
steep hill and I notice this

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:29.060
man standing at the end
of his driveway.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:32.420
And as I got closer, it was
very apparent that he was

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.880
upset about something.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.940
The veins were popping
out of his neck.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.160
His face was beet red.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:42.830
And as I handed him his paper,
he began yelling at me.

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:44.410
What are you doing here?

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:46.530
This is a boy's job.

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:48.450
You have no business
being here.

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:51.850
You are never going to last.

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:54.720
And I didn't let
him see me cry.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:59.040
But to this day, I'm really
grateful to that man.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.500
There were a lot of days
I wanted to quit.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.120
I wouldn't give him
that satisfaction.

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.580
And I couldn't because
what about the girls

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.320
coming up behind me?

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:11.590
And what would that say to the
person who wrote that ad that

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:14.210
I rejected in the first place?

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:18.940
And I'm curious, anybody here
at any point in your life,

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:22.070
have you ever been discriminated
against?

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:23.060
You're too young?

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.250
You're too old?

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:25.330
You're too this color?

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.740
Too that size?

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:27.780
Yeah.

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.290
All right, some of you.

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:30.180
It stinks.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.140
It really, really stinks.

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:36.650
And I encourage you
not to ever let

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:39.300
anyone else define you.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:44.130
Here at Google, you think
outside the box.

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:47.430
And in order to think outside
the box, you can never allow

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:49.780
anyone to put you in a box.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.070
I'm too odd-shaped.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:55.290
I don't fit in anybody's box.

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:58.930
And I'm grateful for the lessons
that I learned on that

00:19:58.930 --> 00:19:59.510
paper route.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:03.710
My dad taught me, Kathy,
give 110%.

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:07.950
If the customer expects the
paper on the driveway, you put

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:08.900
it on the front porch.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.355
And that was the foundation of
my learning to under promise

00:20:12.355 --> 00:20:14.520
and over deliver.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.640
And more than 30 years
later, still the girl

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.440
with a paper route.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.130
Modeling was not part
of the plan.

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:24.040
Ended up being a great
education.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.910
Entire time I worked in that
industry, I was trying and

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:31.860
failing at businesses before
we started our brand in '93

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:35.600
from my kitchen table with
a single pair of socks.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.320
Now, when I modeled,
people teased me.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.590
They said, you're so cheap.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:42.380
Why don't you buy some better
clothes or drive a nicer car?

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.270
At least pay for
valet parking.

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:47.540
I was investing in people.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:55.420
The way people are treated is
far more important than any

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.995
profit margin.

00:20:56.995 --> 00:20:58.300
And I love sports.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:02.820
I love the idea of working
towards a common goal.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.800
And we have a wonderfully
diverse team.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.270
And I know that you do
as well, at Google.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.670
And I love that.

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:12.220
If everybody were just like
us, it would be so boring.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.650
And we have some great debate.

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:14.730
And that's awesome.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:15.340
And I love it.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:18.180
It keeps us growing
and thinking.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.500
I know my strengths, and I'm
very well aware of my

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:21.340
weaknesses.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:25.430
I believe in always learning
new things, always growing.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:28.350
Yet, to be efficient, to
focus, to develop those

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:32.410
strengths and work with people
who are strong in areas where

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:33.350
we are not.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:38.010
So someone with a great eye who
would become our creative

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:40.470
director, an art director,
someone with strengths in

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:43.850
production and marketing,
a vision strategist.

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:47.310
And I was actually offered
the opportunity to model

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:48.980
this pair of socks.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.080
Not quite as glamorous
as it sounds.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:55.030
It was a really tiny budget,
no exotic locations, and no

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:56.770
much needed photo retoucher.

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:58.190
But it was a job.

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:01.100
And it was at a time when not
a lot of job offers were

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.490
coming my way.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:06.170
Still, I felt if I didn't close
the door on that chapter

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:08.560
of my life, I might
not live my dream

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.950
of design and business.

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:12.560
And I liked the people.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.750
And as you here know,
life and business,

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.550
it's all about people.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:20.310
It's about relationships.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:22.620
And I thought this would
be a great place

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:23.960
to start our brand.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.980
Some say it's counterintuitive,
but for me

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.280
it made perfect sense.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:31.490
If women embrace something as
basic as a pair of socks, what

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:36.060
could our team bring as far as
innovation, design, fashion?

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.600
If they embrace that, we might
be onto something.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.390
So the work began.

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:45.110
We conducted family-based focus
groups, surprise factory

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.530
inspections.

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:48.230
You learn a lot when you
show up unannounced.

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:51.950
And it's a practice
we continue today.

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:54.420
Thoroughly research these
potential new partners.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:56.720
Took out the first in
a series of loans.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.630
And John Carrasco, our genius
creative director, he and I

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:01.960
loaded up our backpacks.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:05.420
We hit the road and presented
our socks to retailers.

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:08.720
And the doors slammed
in our faces.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.220
You're not good enough.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.960
Love the socks, but
who needs you?

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.910
You can't start a brand
with a pair of socks.

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:17.920
It's never been done.

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.760
As you all know, it's never been
done does not mean that

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.270
it can't be done.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:24.270
That's noise.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:27.270
And in order to succeed in life
and in business, we have

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:31.320
to turn off that noise so we
can move forward with the

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.390
plans for our life.

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:35.960
One of the greatest gifts of
that long ago modeling

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.460
career-- and I didn't realize
it at the time--

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.240
it was all the rejection.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.740
Because when people said no and
slammed doors, it didn't

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.560
destroy me.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.710
I was used to it.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:48.340
It was OK.

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.690
It's like, OK, at least
we're talking.

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:52.410
We'll come back tomorrow.

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:54.440
Maybe your circumstances
will have changed.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.340
Or maybe you'll be
in a better mood.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:01.330
And that gift of rejection, it
really leads to perseverance.

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:05.400
And it doesn't feel like it at
the time, but please, when

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:09.960
you're facing rejection, know
that it can be a beautiful

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.010
gift later on.

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:13.490
In the early days of our brand,
there were times when

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:16.080
we slept in airports in an
effort to save money.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.440
And some people think
of sleeping in an

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.050
airport as a big deal.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:22.250
It's not a big deal.

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:26.220
What ever material things we
have to give up to live our

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:27.816
dream, it's not a sacrifice.

00:24:27.816 --> 00:24:30.140
It's a bold investment.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:33.560
And that bold investment made it
possible for us to sell our

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.590
100 millionth pair of socks.

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:40.070
In the early days, we sold our
socks in a handful of sporting

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.010
good stores, including
Big Five.

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:46.420
Then a major mass retailer
started carrying our socks.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:51.430
And one day, CEO calls me in
to inform me that the socks

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:53.440
are a blow out.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.880
And we had just had
our first baby in

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.940
diapers, so blowout had--

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:01.400
you moms know, had a really
different meaning.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.000
But he assured me,
no, this is OK.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:03.670
It's a good thing.

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:06.320
In fact, they asked for
exclusivity at their channel

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.220
of distribution.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.200
And our brand grew.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.880
It grew to include a complete
line of apparel and

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.480
accessories.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.100
As our brand grew, so
did our spending.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:22.200
Bigger, fancier office spaces
than we truly needed.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.090
Airport sleepovers, those
days were long gone.

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:29.210
But our banks, our financial
advisers, assured us that our

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:32.740
sending was far below the norm
for a company of our size.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:36.410
Besides, we had a contract that
guaranteed security for

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:38.500
years to come.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.230
Then one day, I get
a phone call.

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:42.310
A little more than surprising.

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:46.670
It seems that this retailer was
having a few challenges.

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:47.820
Next?

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:51.370
A crashing avalanche
of reality.

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:55.370
This retailer was filing
bankruptcy.

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:56.730
What?

00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:00.190
A $40 billion giant bankrupt?

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:01.940
No way.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:03.310
Way.

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:07.480
Next, I get a call from the
bank to set up a lunch for

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:12.790
what they politely referred
to as the situation.

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:16.810
And I had enjoyed lunch with a
bank on several occasions,

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:19.840
always sharing our business
plan, keeping them up to date.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.960
But this time was
very different.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.460
This time it was crystal
clear that I was going

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.470
to pick up the check.

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:30.810
With this retailer underwater,
our bank was reacting to

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:33.130
change instantly.

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:36.740
Not going to spend another
dime on them.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.730
And while reaching for the
credit card, one of the kind,

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:45.520
fatherly bankers smiled and
said, you know, you and your

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.260
partners are personally
responsible

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.980
for the entire liability.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:56.192
If this doesn't work out, we can
take away all your homes.

00:26:56.192 --> 00:26:59.220
His smile was chilling.

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.640
I should have known better.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:05.690
Particularly since we had 37
team members with families on

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:07.610
our payroll, it was the largest

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:10.210
bankruptcy in retail history.

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:14.390
And my heart still breaks for
the thousands of people who

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:17.680
lost their jobs, insurance,
benefits, stock.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.860
But today with new management,
that retailer is a healthier

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.860
company, and we are, too.

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:25.220
But those days were
pretty grim.

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:27.930
We scrambled and scurried
24/7 days.

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:31.090
And we still do that.

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:34.340
And it makes me think of what
you all do at Google.

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:35.650
When I look around--

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:38.840
and some people talk
about these days of

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.840
being days of challenge.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:44.220
Clearly, you see them as
days of opportunity.

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:51.080
When businesses are closing, how
life-changing that people

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.530
can go to Google.

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:54.650
They can get connected
with others

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:56.320
around the world instantly.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.180
You bring opportunities and
you make it a reality.

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:02.870
And that is enormous.

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:07.350
Before the bankruptcy, our
internal plan was to move to

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:10.800
the independent channel
of distribution.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.130
We felt that being dependent
upon one retailer was not a

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:18.930
solution for our customer
or our team.

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:20.835
The bankruptcy slowed
our clock.

00:28:20.835 --> 00:28:23.830
I'll never walk away from
anyone during their most

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:24.730
difficult time.

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:27.590
When it was clear they were
going to be healthy, we

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:30.060
implemented that plan.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.540
Again, people said
it's impossible.

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.700
You can't start at
mass and go up.

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:37.650
It's never been done.

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:41.190
For years we were able
to operate our

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:44.760
business under the radar.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:48.650
And as a private person owning a
private company, that suited

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:50.360
me just fine.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:54.120
One of the reasons we were able
to be beneath the radar

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.780
is because typically independent
retailers don't

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:59.010
have large ad budgets.

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:03.470
So while others were buying
awareness, we were building

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:06.450
relationships one at a time.

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:07.770
And that's what you do.

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:09.390
You connect people.

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:12.290
And you help build those
relationships.

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.770
And that's exciting and
that's powerful.

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:20.620
And bringing your technology
to our retail partners, to

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:23.520
family businesses that have been
around for generations

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:27.030
that will not survive without
it, that is exciting.

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:29.330
And I thank you for that.

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:39.050
"Forbes" outed our business
for its growth.

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:43.760
And others in the media
commented as well.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:49.420
And that forced me out of my
shy and selfish shell of

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:53.070
quietness to connect and
share with others.

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:59.060
And as I mature, I realize that
it is so not about me.

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:03.570
And that my comfort is
absolutely irrelevant when

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:07.400
there are needs everywhere.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:11.720
And I'm so grateful for what all
of you do because you make

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:16.180
it possible for us to fulfill
our personal, our

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:19.370
professional, and our
philanthropic goals.

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:22.250
And you make it possible for
us to do this instantly.

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:24.710
So thank you for that.

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:29.800
Sometimes people ask us,
what are your secrets?

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:33.000
And to us, they're
pretty simple.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.240
Consider others as more
important than yourself.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.720
Never stop auditioning.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.840
Bring value.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.420
Be creative.

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:43.270
Be honest.

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:44.800
Be of service.

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:49.410
I love your non-official mission
of don't be evil.

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:50.360
I love that.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:56.230
It speaks volumes of you.

00:30:56.230 --> 00:31:00.180
And I think something that we
share in common as your

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:05.220
company is about connecting and
that's so much of what we

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:10.980
do as well, and we've
got to get ourselves

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.440
in order to do that.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.310
We can't get in our own way.

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:17.850
We all have these epiphanies at
different moments in life.

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:21.850
I prefer to think of them
as breakthroughs, those

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:26.330
crystalline moments when
life just hits us.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:33.410
And we either fall apart,
collapse and break down, or we

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:38.170
break the bonds that seek to
destroy and defeat us.

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:42.280
We get back up and
we break through.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:47.080
Some personal examples of
breakthroughs in my life

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:51.790
include breaking through health
challenges, an accident

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:55.080
that tore my nose from my face,
smashed my teeth, left

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:58.320
me unconscious, and my
face unrecognizable.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.590
My physician husband fearing
I'd be brain dead.

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:05.970
A disaster at sea that nearly
took my husband's life.

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:09.360
I spoke to you about that brush
with bankruptcy from our

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.770
then only retail partner.

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:15.230
The loss of loved ones.

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:19.640
A miscarriage that our
family still mourns.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:24.960
A life-changing misdiagnosis
and a diagnosis of down

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:30.500
syndrome for the youngest member
of our extended family.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:36.420
Each one of you here have or is
currently facing equal or

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:39.570
far greater crises.

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:41.390
And yet, you are here.

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:47.410
And you are a shining example
that you don't break down, you

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:48.560
break through.

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.230
And you inspire.

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:54.270
You encourage.

00:32:56.952 --> 00:33:01.830
In spending time here on this
campus today, getting to see

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:04.850
how you work, it feels
like a family.

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:07.160
And I love that.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:12.940
And getting to talk with some of
you, it's been an exciting

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:13.690
experience.

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:19.110
Because each one of us,
we are our own brand.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:21.360
And you might be thinking,
she's crazy.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.130
She's talking about her
brand, and then she's

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:24.060
saying I'm a brand.

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:24.730
I'm not a brand.

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:25.570
I'm a person.

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:27.430
Yes, we're people.

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:28.570
And we are brands.

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:33.230
And every experience with us is
a lasting brand impression.

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:36.930
The question is, what kind
of a brand are we?

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:40.210
Are we innovative, creative?

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:41.980
Are we solution-oriented?

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:43.900
Do we get along well
with others?

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:47.630
Do we consider showing up five
minutes early being on time or

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:49.460
are we perpetually late?

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.850
Are we complicated and cranky?

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:55.320
Do we bring our drama with
us everywhere we go?

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.550
And we are all works
in progress.

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:01.860
Unfortunately, every day we
get to make the choice if

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:05.740
we're going to break down
or break through.

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:09.360
And brands succeed because
they simplify

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.719
the selection process.

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:15.840
They build upon an existing
relationship.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:19.120
Will a brand or a service
succeed if the product or

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.739
service is inferior?

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:21.920
Absolutely not.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:26.290
The quickest way to destroy
any brand is poor quality

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:29.389
merchandise or service.

00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:34.600
Generally speaking, men
will buy products

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.880
and women join brands.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.040
There's that loyalty,
that relationship.

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:52.260
And when there is a product of
comparable or lesser price

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:56.590
versus a well-branded product,
the well-branded

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:59.670
product will succeed.

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:03.610
And this is particularly true
during economic uncertainties

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:05.160
and societal changes.

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:08.480
Women shop where they have that
trusted relationship.

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.170
We've got to earn that trust.

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:12.100
And we've got to get it right.

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:14.000
But building that
relationship.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.920
And again, that's what
you at Google do.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:20.730
You build relationships, and you
connect us, and you make

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:22.000
it possible.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.480
And that is powerful.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:28.650
Google is an iconic brand.

00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:30.690
Other examples of
iconic brands--

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:34.180
Disney, Coca-Cola, Nike.

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:38.350
Iconic brands are known as much
for how they make us feel

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:40.010
as for what they do.

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:43.910
Iconic brands trade in the
world of emotion where

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:47.930
measurements cannot apply.

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:50.380
And the consistency
is so important.

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:53.440
Your bold, beautiful
Google logo, that

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:56.380
is recognized worldwide.

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:57.370
And it's powerful.

00:35:57.370 --> 00:36:00.970
And we know what we're getting
when we go to Google.

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:03.080
When we're drinking our
Starbucks coffee, if that

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:06.410
circular logo were suddenly
dropped to the bottom with no

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:09.700
notice, we wouldn't trust
what we were drinking.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:15.070
So with our marketing, with our
branding, with ourselves

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:20.780
it's so important that we are
consistent with who we are and

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:21.810
what we're all about.

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:24.010
And I love your name--

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:24.860
Google.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:25.890
It's awesome.

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:29.020
When our youngest child Chloe
was in kindergarten, she came

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:32.270
home from school one day and
she told me she loved me

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:33.410
Googleplex.

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:35.260
And I just love that.

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:37.820
I love it.

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:42.280
And before I close, I've got
to shout out to the women.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.430
Not to neglect the guys.

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:46.290
Love the guys.

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:49.680
And girls, we have so much
to learn from the guys.

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:50.530
We really do.

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:53.080
You are really good
at delegating.

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:55.990
And when you have your
priorities, you're good at

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:57.110
putting yourselves on it.

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:59.260
And we need to learn
from that.

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:04.460
We just go to this guilt thing
if we try to spend any time to

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:05.890
take care of ourselves.

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:10.460
Frequently, women will ask
me, how do you do it all?

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:13.300
And my answer is, I don't.

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:17.270
And oftentimes, I do
it really badly.

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:20.570
I was 40 years old before
I learned that no

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:22.380
was a complete sentence.

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:24.940
No thank you was better,
but no works.

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:25.640
It's OK.

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:30.530
And oftentimes, we've got to
say no to good things in an

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:35.270
effort to be able to say
yes to great things.

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:39.070
When I flew out last night to
come be with you today, the

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:43.620
flight attendant said, in case
of emergency, put on your own

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:48.770
oxygen mask first, and then take
care of those around you.

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:50.270
And it made me think, what
if we did that in a

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:52.810
prophylactic way?

00:37:52.810 --> 00:37:59.100
And I had the privilege of
speaking at a conference that

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:00.970
included some amazing women--

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:03.950
Dr. Maya Angelou, Barbara
Walters--

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:07.120
and the topic came up, can
women have it all?

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.960
And Barbara Walters said,
no, I don't believe

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.505
women can have it all.

00:38:11.505 --> 00:38:14.860
And respectfully, I disagree.

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:19.610
I think we can have it all,
but not all at once.

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:21.820
Our lives come in seasons.

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:24.970
And at each season of our
life, we've got to

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:26.670
prioritize our time.

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:30.560
For me, it's my faith, family,
and then being of service

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:31.100
through our work.

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.320
And the minute those priorities
are out of order,

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.370
I'm a disaster.

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:35.880
Coping skills are
out the window.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.930
Stress is unmanageable.

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:40.310
I'm floundering around on the
floor trying to get from point

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:44.130
A to point B. It just
doesn't work.

00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:48.750
What I love about Google is
I see that there's so much

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:50.630
protection for you.

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:53.350
I see the opportunities here.

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:55.670
I see the child care.

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:57.920
And just making it
all possible.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:00.620
And that is fantastic.

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:04.940
And I encourage everyone, if you
haven't already, to think

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:06.690
about, what are your values?

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:07.810
What's important to you?

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:10.750
And it's so important that you
have conviction for your

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:15.200
values to really know why you
value what you value.

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:19.300
And to put boundaries in place
to protect them because they

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:23.570
will be challenged.

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:27.070
In our business, something that
we do, we're constantly

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:31.880
working with new people,
new relationships.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.010
And we go through our
legal process.

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:36.030
We get everything
out in the open.

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:39.270
Potential concerns
all in writing.

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:41.330
Everything is signed.

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:44.215
And then we take those
contracts, we put them away in

00:39:44.215 --> 00:39:46.740
the drawer, and we start
treating one

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:49.530
another like family.

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:51.600
I never had a family business.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.590
But today, we have a
business family.

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:58.120
And I believe that when
you treat your family

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.810
members the way you--

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:02.970
when you treat your business
family the way you would want

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:06.360
your family members to be
treated, there's no limit to

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.540
what we can accomplish
together.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:11.890
And you were certainly a family
here at Googleplex.

00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:16.420
And there is no limit to what
you will accomplish.

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:20.080
And in speaking of family, just
a shout out to some of

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.030
our team members--

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:23.100
Selena, Miles, and Chris.

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:26.290
And Christopher Spencer, who
is our Google expert--

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:29.920
and he keeps our business
all things Google.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.450
Just so wonderful.

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:33.000
We're so grateful for that.

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:38.960
You're an amazing family.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:41.800
And I imagine that it's going
to take a few hundred years

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:45.540
for you to fully realize the
return on your investment in

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:47.390
the Klingon interface.

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:50.680
You guys are incredible.

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:54.920
And you make me realize that
there are no limits.

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:59.040
I'm encouraged and inspired
by all of you.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.410
And in closing, I'm going to
share with you something--

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:06.580
it's not my own, but I believe
it to be true.

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:11.370
I've learned that all that you
give is all that you get.

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:13.960
So give it all you've got.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:18.385
Here's to life and every
joy it brings.

00:41:18.385 --> 00:41:23.700
Here's to life and dreamers
and their dreams.

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:27.350
May all your storms
be weathered.

00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:30.570
May all that's good
get better.

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:32.170
Here's to life.

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:33.510
Here's to love.

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:36.080
Here's to each and
every one of you.

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.786
Thank you, and God bless you.

00:41:38.786 --> 00:41:44.935
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:44.935 --> 00:41:46.040
KATHY IRELAND: You're
so sweet.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:46.800
Thank you.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.200
Does anybody have
any questions?

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.240
AUDIENCE: Are there businesses
that you've entered and then

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:52.270
had to shut down later?

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:54.840
Or ones that you decided
not to enter?

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:57.150
For example, there's, as far
as I know, no such thing as

00:41:57.150 --> 00:42:00.580
Kathy Ireland Fine China.

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:02.020
KATHY IRELAND: I'm sorry, you
said as far as you know, there

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:03.160
is Kathy Ireland Fine China?

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:03.940
AUDIENCE: There is not.

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:04.240
KATHY IRELAND: Oh.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:06.670
Yes, coming.

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:08.900
And what is your name?

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:09.400
AUDIENCE: Neil.

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:09.950
KATHY IRELAND: Neil.

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:12.320
Neil, thank you for that.

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.250
Kathy Ireland Home by Gorham.

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:15.600
It's coming out.

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:18.520
No, it's been in development.

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:19.850
Yes.

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:23.490
One of the things that really
helps us is our mission.

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:27.110
We have it in bold letters, in
English and in Spanish in our

00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:28.020
headquarters.

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:31.070
Sometimes people think our team
is a cult because we're

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:32.860
confidently reiterating it.

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:35.170
Most of us, we've been together
over 20 years.

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:38.150
Our mission began with finding
solutions for families,

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:39.900
especially busy moms.

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:42.860
We've expanded to finding
solutions for people in love

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:45.200
and finding solutions for
people in business.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:49.360
So when a team member has an
idea for a new product, we go

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:50.180
to that mission.

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:52.540
OK, it's a great idea, but
where's the solution?

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:54.280
How does it maker
her day better?

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:57.280
She's going through life
and it is hard.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.080
When I became a mom for
the first time, a

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:01.510
shower became a luxury.

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:03.020
And going to the store.

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:05.990
Even how we choose our retail
partners is critical.

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:08.810
She's got car seats, diapers,
temper tantrums.

00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:11.470
She makes it out the driveway,
that's a victory in itself.

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:13.460
So we've got to make sure
it's a good shopping

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:16.580
experience for her.

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:17.970
And it's time.

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:20.090
It's a getting to know
you process.

00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:22.860
When all the other elements
are in place, we also have

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:24.850
four promises for
all the products

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:26.100
we design and market--

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:28.800
fashion, quality, value,
and safety.

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.230
They have to be in place.

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:34.220
You asked if we ever had to walk
away from relationships?

00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:35.840
Yes, sadly.

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:38.270
We do our homework as
much as we can, but

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:39.590
things in life happen.

00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:43.660
There was a partner who felt
that because they were in the

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:48.370
legal limits of safety
that it was OK.

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:52.080
But they were not at the highest
standard of legal

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:53.190
limits for safety.

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:57.520
And with that mission statement,
serving families,

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:01.490
safety being one of our core
promises, we walked away for

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:02.630
millions of dollars.

00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:04.400
We gave our banks
heart attacks.

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:07.350
It's one of the reasons I love
having a private company.

00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:10.620
Because it allows us the
freedom to do that.

00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:12.550
But the getting to know your
process is critical.

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:13.920
Kicking the tires.

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.660
And we invite people to kick
the tires with us.

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:19.840
We try to be as transparent
as possible.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:23.390
Find out everything you can do
about us, so we can-- we look

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:25.900
at it as a marriage, a long-time
relationship.

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:27.555
That's what we're looking for.

00:44:27.555 --> 00:44:28.030
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:30.010
KATHY IRELAND: Thank
you, Neil.

00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:31.240
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name is Albert.

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:32.450
Just started two weeks ago.

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:34.900
This is a perk that they didn't
tell me of beforehand.

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:36.670
KATHY IRELAND: You're
a Noogler?

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:38.380
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:40.990
My question to you is, so you
had an extremely successful

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:42.240
supermodel career.

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:49.220
So you had an extremely
successful supermodel career

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:50.690
that you could have
easily said at the

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:52.130
end of it, I'm done.

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:57.820
I've had a wonderful career,
and kind of sailed off into

00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:58.490
the sunset.

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:01.235
What made you want to start
your own business?

00:45:01.235 --> 00:45:05.750
What gave you that push
to say, this isn't

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:07.000
enough, I want more?

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:10.840
KATHY IRELAND: The pity party
that I mentioned.

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:17.480
allowed me to take my eyes off
myself and look around.

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:20.360
And see that it wasn't just
about me and having

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:21.850
my own needs met.

00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:25.020
But there were so many
opportunities.

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:29.320
And that was a critical turning
point in my life.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.090
I entered the modeling
industry as a

00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:33.420
business person already.

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.770
I really thought it wasn't
part of my plan.

00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:38.440
I thought I might be able to
save some money for college or

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:39.450
to start a business.

00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:43.000
The reason it went on so long is
because I failed at so many

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:43.840
other businesses.

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:46.430
It took me a long time
to get started.

00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:49.950
So it was always a
passion of mine.

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:53.200
And one of the things I learned
the hard way is when

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.710
you have a business, you've got
to be passionate about it.

00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:58.300
And then, it's not work.

00:45:58.300 --> 00:45:59.310
I don't imagine--

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:01.810
I can't imagine ever retiring.

00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:06.340
I imagine shifting and changing
focus here and there,

00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:08.940
being true to those
priorities.

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:14.100
As we talk about moving beyond,
I see my pivot just

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:15.710
going to honor those
priorities.

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:20.410
And I see what you all do as
Google as a huge facilitator

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:23.820
to make those dreams
a reality.

00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:24.220
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:25.672
KATHY IRELAND: Thank you.

00:46:25.672 --> 00:46:29.160
AUDIENCE: I guess my question
kind of had to do with women

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:32.530
in the workplace and how you
would approach that.

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:35.270
Before I came to Google, I was
working at a law firm and we

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:37.240
handled a lot of gender
discrimination cases

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:38.765
on behalf of women.

00:46:38.765 --> 00:46:41.330
And it seemed to me that
something that happened quite

00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:44.790
often, especially for younger
women, was that they kind of

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:48.520
fell into the stereotype of
being the pretty young thing

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:50.000
around the office.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.660
And I was just wondering you,
as a business woman, did you

00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:56.290
feel like beauty was something
that was an obstacle for you

00:46:56.290 --> 00:47:00.740
to go past for people to take
you seriously, or did you feel

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:03.320
more like it was something that
you could capitalize upon

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:06.190
to improve upon your business?

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:06.760
KATHY IRELAND: Thank you.

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:09.620
And while you're sweet to
put me in that category.

00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:17.080
But I often still feel that
many times if I were--

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:19.470
because women will say to me,
well, it's easy for you.

00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:22.490
You had this modeling
background, so it gets you a

00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:24.230
foot in the door.

00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:28.180
I really believe that if I would
show up at a business

00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:32.440
meeting with my business plan
and my sketches in hand, my

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:36.540
ideas as a CEO would be taken
seriously much more quickly

00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:40.160
than having that baggage of that
perception from that long

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.470
ago career.

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:43.560
And what a woman who doesn't
have that has,

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.860
she has a clean slate.

00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:49.360
So she gets to invent her
brand however she wants.

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:50.900
And that is the gift.

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:55.980
And as far as your question
about what's expected in the

00:47:55.980 --> 00:48:00.470
workplace, how women
are perceived, I

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:03.050
continue to see it.

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:05.570
One of my first in the
home industry--

00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:08.320
I went to a meeting
of salespeople.

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:09.580
And it was all guys.

00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:14.580
I was like, is there a meeting
or where's all the women?

00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:15.820
They didn't have any women.

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:18.990
I was like. you guys, who's
buying the furniture?

00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:20.240
Can we have a little balance?

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:25.490
And it takes time.

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:29.140
I just encourage women to fight

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:31.950
against that, to persevere.

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:35.600
And with love, we can teach.

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:39.090
And it's powerful.

00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:40.620
I'm very rebellious.

00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:45.100
And I think I encourage
people to rebel

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:47.150
against negative things.

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:48.890
And to be strong.

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:52.370
There's so many things we
need to rebel against.

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:57.510
But for years, I only wore like
full-on business suits

00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:59.500
because I wanted to be
taken seriously.

00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:02.220
And it was Elizabeth Taylor
who gave me so much grief.

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:04.320
She just said, you know what?

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:05.220
You don't need to do that.

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.720
Wear what you want to
wear and let them

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:08.700
deal with their stuff.

00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:10.600
You be true to yourself.

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.270
And if you feel like wearing
the pantsuit, fine.

00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:15.290
But don't feel like--

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:20.910
I think I was allowing other
people to shape me.

00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:23.990
And we just be true
to who we are.

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:25.350
And we do our best.

00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:28.210
And it becomes their
problem, not ours.

00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:28.910
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:31.448
KATHY IRELAND: Thank you.

00:49:31.448 --> 00:49:32.670
AUDIENCE: Hey, Kathy.

00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:34.440
I just wanted to thank you once
again for coming out here

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.560
and talking to all of us.

00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:37.910
I had a quick question about
your business side, and how

00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:39.730
you talked about you had
a family business.

00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:42.310
And kind of more of a business
family and whatnot.

00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:44.170
If you ever thought about going
public or kind of your

00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:44.790
views on that?

00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:46.650
Because I know you brought up
how you're private right now

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:49.135
and you're very happy with the
structure of that, just kind

00:49:49.135 --> 00:49:51.850
of want to hear your
two cents.

00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:55.970
KATHY IRELAND: I cannot
imagine going public.

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:58.180
I wouldn't go public
in a titular sense.

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:01.010
I've been accused of being
a control freak.

00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:03.150
But I'm passionate
about what we do.

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:03.960
Every area.

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:07.570
And so I can't imagine
giving that up.

00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:10.110
Would we ever work with
public companies?

00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:10.450
Yes.

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:13.200
I mean, there's ways
of doing that.

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:16.570
But for our company, I
enjoy the privacy.

00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:23.340
If we want to give our banks
heart attacks and give away

00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:25.890
more than what we--

00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:26.870
we can do that.

00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:29.730
We have that luxury.

00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:32.130
I mean, just this week, we've
had team members--

00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:34.970
one of our dear team members,
his father died.

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:38.100
And he needs to go away
and be with family.

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:39.780
And I see how Google--

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:42.950
from what I see, how everyone is
treated, I really love it.

00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:44.570
I mean, I don't know
everything.

00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:47.680
But it just seems like a
really great company.

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:50.750
You're taken care of.

00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:54.280
But in this point in time,
I love the privacy.

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:57.910
Wall Street looks for a really
quick return, and that

00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:58.690
frightens me.

00:50:58.690 --> 00:51:01.320
Because when we're building
relationships,

00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:02.500
we're looking long-term.

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:04.310
I don't know how to
make a quick buck.

00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:07.420
When people do that--

00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:08.380
we've never done it.

00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:10.510
It's built over time.

00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:13.280
And it's by cultivating those
relationships, so I don't

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.270
think I would be very good
at a public company.

00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:16.470
But thank you.

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.760
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:19.050
Thank you.

00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:21.350
KATHY IRELAND: Thank you.

00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:24.140
Anybody else, any questions?

00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:25.940
Thank you all so much
for coming out.

00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:27.070
It was really great to spend
this time with you.

00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:27.370
Thank you.

00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:30.520
[APPLAUSE]
