00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:20.080
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington, DC.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.380
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: Good morning.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.480
I'm Stephanie Marcus from
the Science Technology

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.370
and Business division
here at the Library.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.030
I'd like to welcome
you to today's program,

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.350
which is the transiting
exoplanet survey satellite,

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.980
lovingly known as TESS.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.200
The program is the fourth in
our 2015 series of lectures,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.410
presented through a partnership
with our division and NASA Goddard.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.210
And this is actually the ninth year

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.830
that we've had this wonderful
relationship, and we've been able

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.870
to bring these very
stimulating talks to the Library.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.670
And we are definitely looking
forward to our tenth season

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.980
and starting to gather topics and
get the speakers for next year.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.130
This year we still have
a couple of programs.

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.610 position:56%
One in November and one in December.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.390
And in November, we're going to
hear about asteroids, meteorites,

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.130
comets, yeah, popular topic.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.340
And then in December, we get
to hear about the Pluto flyby

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.330 position:56%
that everybody's been talking about.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.690
So please check our website
and come to those talks.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.960 position:56%
Today, our speaker is Dr. Stephen
Rinehart, who's is an Astrophysicist

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.900
and the Associate Chief
of the Laboratory

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.640
for Observational Cosmology
at NASA Goddard.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.910
Dr. Rinehart knew as a little kid
that he wanted to be a scientist,

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.880
and he also decided as a child
that he was going to go to MIT,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.760
which he did, and that's where
he earned his BS in physics.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.390
And then he went to Cornell
for his MS and PhD in physics.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.050
He was a postdoc research
associate in London,

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.980
and we won't talk about that.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.430
He seems to think that it
was very difficult to live

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.780
in London as a graduate student.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.950
And then he was able to get a
National Research Council postdoc

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.620
fellowship at NASA Goddard,
and he's been there ever since.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.090
He became a full-time employee
there in 2004 as an Astrophysicist.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.690
And his wife is also
at NASA Goddard.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:42.570 position:56%
So they have one child who's named
Joshe, which means star in Japanese.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.310
And he said, of course,
what else would a couple

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.890 position:56%
of astrophysicists name their child.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:55.190
And his mother-in-law is
here, she's right there.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:04.110
All I have to say beyond that is
exoplanets, the Goldilocks zone,

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.110
alien life, these are things
that humans have been interested

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.560
in for a long, long time, even
going back to the ancient Greeks

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.310
who wondered if there were
other worlds like ours.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.790
So I think that Dr. Rinehart
can let us in on some

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.940
of those secrets that
TESS might tell us.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.510
Please welcome Dr. Rinehart
to the Library of Congress.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.170
[ Applause ]

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.470
&gt;&gt; Stephen Rinehart: Thank you.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.660
So that's a great introduction.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.470
My daughter Joshe is
also at Goddard,

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.580
they have the child development
center there [laughter].

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.140
She also occasionally comes
by some great pictures

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.440
of her working in my lab.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.540
But don't tell labor people.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.590
I'm very happy to be here
today to talk about TESS,

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.910
the transiting exoplanet
survey satellite.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.340
Before I really talk about it,

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.300
I'm going to give credit
where credit is due.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.960
It's being built in partnership
by MIT, NASA Goddard, Orbital ATK,

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.580
and a number of other partners.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.880
The principle investigator
is Dr. George Ricker at MIT.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.930
Now, this is going to be the
next NASA explorer mission,

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.470
and it's really focused on finding
new planets around other stars,

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.910
new exoplanets, particularly
those around nearby bright stars.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.330
So let me really start
out with a little bit

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.790
of context, and, in fact, history.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.710
Humans have known that there
were planets besides the Earth

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.390
for a very, very long time.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:40.100 position:56%
In fact, the ancient Babylonians,
over 4000 years ago, around the turn

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.200
of the second millennium, recorded
observations of Mercury, Venus,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.380
Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.090
So as long as 4000 years ago,

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.870
we've known that there were other
planets in our solar system.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.830
We only missed 2, Uranus
and Neptune.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.130
That's pretty amazing.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.140
So we've known for a very, very
long time, longer than the Greeks,

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.350
that there were other
planets out there.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.750
Nobody knows this, this is like
an obscure fact, by the way.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.880 position:56%
If we skip forward in time from 4000
years ago to about 400 years ago,

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.490
there was a guy that some of you
may have heard of, Giordano Bruno.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.930
Bruno was a famous
astronomer of his era.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.470
A very, very well-known, very
well-respected astronomer.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:24.030
And in 1584, he laid out a
postulate, and his postulate was,

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.210
that if you look at the sky
and see all these stars,

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.970
all of those stars
are suns like our own.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.240
Around each one of those
suns there could be planets,

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.840
and some of those planets
could be like Earth.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.640
And on those planets, there could
be life forms, something like us.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.460
And, fourth, and most
importantly, from his perspective,

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.380
those life forms could have souls.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.110
Now, that last bit is what
got him burned at the stake,

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.870
and I'm going to not talk about
that all because that's theology

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.780
and philosophy, not science.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.890
But we know that the other 3 parts,

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.100
we know that the first one
is essentially correct.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.860
While stars are, in
fact, very, very diverse,

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.560
our sun is a star like many others.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.380
We also know that the second
part, that there are planets

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.400
around all those stars, that's
pretty close to true too.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.230
There are lots and lots of
planets around a lot of stars.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.200 position:56%
As for the third, that maybe there's
life on some of those planets,

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.500
we have a little way to go.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.350
And hopefully, within my lifetime,
or my daughter's lifetime,

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.340
we'll actually be able to
talk about the possibility

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.640
of life on other planets.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.300
And at the end of this talk,
I'll say a little bit more

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.760
about how we might get there.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.350
So let's just jump forward again in
time, to now to about 40 years ago.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.580
I don't know if any of you are
science-fiction fans, I am.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.980 position:56%
But if you looked at
science-fiction works that were made

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:50.360
in this century, whether it be
in TV, movies, or literature,

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.930
the idea that there were
planets around stars, in fact,

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.260
planets around a lot of
stars, is ubiquitous.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.550
It just assumes to be true.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:04.230
Now, at the time of all of these
works, there was no evidence,

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.060
direct or indirect,
of a single exoplanet,

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.050
a single planet around
any other star.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.280
We had not yet found
any evidence whatsoever.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.040
And yet the human imagination
said, they simply have to be there.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.660
Now, all this changed
in around 1989,

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.110
when someone made the
first measurement

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.020
that showed it was possible
for us to find exoplanets.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.600
And this kicked off the
great exoplanet search.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.170
In fact, this week, ironically,
because we didn't really think

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:35.860
about this when we
scheduled this talk,

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.930
this week marks the twentieth
anniversary of the first discovery

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.270
of an exoplanet around
a main sequence star.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.960
Since we realized we could do
it, people started looking,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.260
and things have taken off.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.820
In fact, you'll notice
in one second,

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.840
I have changed the scale bar,
in 2014, because there were

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.270
over 900 planets confirmed
last year alone.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.010
So to date, we have, and
I have to look at my slide

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.250
because the number keeps
changing, as of Monday,

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:08.420
we had 1892 confirmed exoplanets,
planets around other stars

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.160
that we've actually been
able to observe and measure,

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.760
mostly indirectly, but we
know that they are there.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.630 position:56%
Now, you'll notice on this slide
I've got all these different colors.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:20.030
That's to indicate that there
are a lot of different methods

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.180
that people have used
to find exoplanets.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.940
And they all have advantages
and disadvantages.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.430
But the 2 that I want to talk
about most today are the 2

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.670
that have been most successful.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:34.130
And also because they have
the most relevance for TESS.

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.140
The first of these is the transit
method itself, and I'll describe

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.140
that method in more
detail in a minute.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.870 position:56%
But all of these, all the objects
that are represented by the red part

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.970
of the bar, are transiting
exoplanets.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:50.410
And over half of those
planets are transiting planets.

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.430
And in fact, over 1000 of the
confirmed planets were discovered

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.800
with one mission, the Kepler
Mission, which has looked

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.120
for transiting exoplanets.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.390
I'll say more about
Kepler in a bit too.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.950
The other topic, the other
method I want to say something

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:04.450 position:56%
about is the radial velocity method.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.080
Those of the objects in blue.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.530 position:56%
That's the oldest and most venerable
method for finding exoplanets.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:13.140
And it has a very important
role in how we follow

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.740
up on observations from TESS.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.350
And I'll say more about
that in a minute.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:19.880
So what are all these objects?

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.820
I'm a scientist, I like
plotting things, so bear with me.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.080
If you look at the vertical
axis here is the mass

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.570
of a planet, in Jupiter masses.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.020
The horizontal axis is the duration

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:35.000
of that planet's year,
the orbital period.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.710
And what you can see is that
if we plot all of these planets

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.730
that have been confirmed so far,

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.660
they're really pretty
much all over the place.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.830
They're largely up in this corner.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:46.130
There's not a lot down here.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:47.570
But there are even
a handful down here.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.980
Although those yellow ones
are awfully hard to spot.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.870 position:56%
To give you a little bit of context,

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:57.460
let me add in our solar
system planets.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.090
Now, there should be
a couple of things

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.640
that strike you right
away about this.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.860
The first is that there are
only a handful of exoplanets

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:10.290
down in this regime where our
own planets lie, in this plot.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:13.650
Now, there's 2 lessons
that I take away from that.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:15.840
The first is that finding
planets like the ones

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.850
in our solar system is
really, really hard.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:22.930
In fact, it is easier to find
planets the bigger they are,

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.190
pretty much no matter
what method you are using.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.690
Which means we're bias towards
finding things up in here.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:31.760
It is also, for the
most successful methods,

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.260
easier to find planets the closer
they are to their host star.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.420
So things in here.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.530
So it's no surprise, the first
planets we found were all

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:41.830
up in this range.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.830 position:56%
And as we've gotten better, as we've
gotten better at the techniques

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:48.770
and we've explored new techniques,
we've pushed that boundary down,

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:52.320 position:56%
until now we're starting to just
now see some of the planets that are

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.860
like those in our own solar system.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.100
The second thing I want to
take away from this is, to me,

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.930
actually more interesting.

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.690
And that's that while there
aren't a lot of planets like those

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:06.290
in our solar system, but gosh
there are a lot of planets here.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:09.800
So while our solar system
planets are down here,

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.600
we don't have anything
like these objects.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.410
These are completely new.

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:14.900
These are things that we never saw

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.380
until we started looking
for exoplanets.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.510
And for theorists, this
has been a big problem.

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:22.450
Now, most of us, probably
not the guy

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:26.040 position:56%
who wrote this particular theory,
but most of us like new observations

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.080
like this because they
overturn theory.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.560
They make us say that the theory
is no good, we need a new one.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.770
And that's always pretty exciting.

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:38.330 position:56%
We've found a lot of things in this
data that we never expected to find.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.570
Let me give you a couple
of quick examples.

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:45.390
There's the hot Jupiters,
also known as roasters.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:49.880
These are Jupiter -sized
planets, but they're in orbits

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.180
of less than about 10 days.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.680
They're closer to their host
star than Mercury is to our sun.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.010
They're boiling hot.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:12:00.210
In some cases, they're so
hot that you can see evidence

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:02.800
that there are comet-like
tails, as the atmosphere

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.870
of the planet is being boiled off
and blown away by its host star.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:09.050
Again, if you talked to
a theorist 25 years ago,

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:10.870
and you told him this
object existed,

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.170
they would tell you you were nuts.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:14.270
It makes no sense, it
shouldn't be there.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:15.920
And yet now we know that they are.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:21.190
And theory has evolved to
explain why we actually see them.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:23.740
Another class of objects we
didn't expect were what we call

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.410
the super-Earths.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.240
Again, if I went back in time,
and I talked to theorists,

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.120
what the one thing they
would've told me is that,

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.330
the way that planets
form is that it's easy

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.390
to form a rock about Earth size.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:38.750
Once you get beyond Earth size,
if you have enough material,

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.600
you go into sort of a
runaway accretion mode.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.040
You just grab everything
that's nearby.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.040
So you race straight
from Earth sized

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.650
up to Uranus sized with
nothing in between.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:51.250
So if I were to look at a thousand
exoplanets, I'll see a bunch

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.070
down here, and I'll
see a bunch up here,

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:56.130
and I won't see anything
in that box at all.

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:59.300
Obviously the theorists
were right -- I mean wrong.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.880
Because that box is
very well populated

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.370
with lots and lots of planets.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.780
And these are the super-Earths.

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.840
Now, again, we have no examples of
these planets in our solar system,

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.230
so we don't actually
know what they're like.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:17.280 position:56%
Now, on one end of the large end,
things like a 2 Earth radius planet,

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.050
those are probably more
like Uranus than Earth.

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:22.120
They're probably big icy balls.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:27.200 position:56%
But on the low end, something that's
say 10% or 20% larger than Earth,

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.840
well, that's probably
a rocky planet.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.310
It might be Earthlike.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.140
It might even be habitable.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:36.240
So that leads me to the
topic of habitability.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.660
The habitable zone and
the goldilocks zone.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.650 position:56%
Before I talk about that though, let
me give you a couple of statistics.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:46.460
We have found, like I said,
almost 1900 exoplanets.

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:49.820
And from those studies, we've been
able to draw some very serious

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:54.360
and very important inferences
about the population of exoplanets.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.250
So, for instance, we know

00:13:56.250 --> 00:14:01.780
that in our galaxy there is
approximately 1 planet per star.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.790
That's not to say all
stars have planets.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:06.360
Some stars like our own have many.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.720
Some have none.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.250
But on average, there
are as many planets

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.060
in this galaxy as there are stars.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.750
That's amazing at just
the sheer number

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.030
of planets that are out there.

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:17.030
We also know that about 1/6,

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:22.040
17% of all stars have Earth
sized planets around them.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.520
Again, this is, you know,
shocking, 1/6 of a very,

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.780
very large number is
still a very large number.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.440 position:56%
That's a lot of Earth-sized planets.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.370
That's a lot of potential.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:34.190
And perhaps most interestingly,
22% of stars that are

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:38.540
like our sun have planets
in their habitable zones.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:42.940
These are potential places
where we might find life.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.630
Now, what do I mean
by habitable zone.

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.280
This also known as
the goldilocks zone,

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.530
for reasons that will become
apparent very quickly.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:54.940 position:56%
It is the range of distances from a
star where you can have liquid water

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.680
on the surface of the planet.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.640
If you get too close to the star,
then the water gets too hot,

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.430
it boils off, it then evaporates,

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:04.810
and you're left with
a dry dusty rock.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:09.260
No water. Not really a
great place for life.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.480
If it gets too far
away from the star,

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.880
then all that water precipitates
out, it freezes, it turns into ice,

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.850
and now you have a rocky
ball that's covered

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:18.720
with a thick layer
of ice on top of it.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.990
Again, not really a
great place for life.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.350
But if you're not too hot,
and you're not too cold,

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:29.050
if you're just right, then you
can have all the conditions --

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:34.750
one of the key conditions
for formation of life.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.050
Now, you'll note, of course,

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:37.620
that where that habitable
zone is is different

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.480
for different kinds of stars.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.710
On this plot, these are 4
different kinds of stars.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:45.020
And you can see that
for a small cool star,

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:49.620 position:56%
the habitable zone is closer than it
is for a star like our own, which,

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:54.720
it's not hot, but it's hotter,
where it gets much farther out.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.040
And you can see, these are some of
the planets that we found that are

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.730
in the habitable zones
of their host stars.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:04.040
These kinds of objects are going to
be really, really exciting things

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.510
to study over the next few decades.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:10.100
In addition to all of
that, there's a couple

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:11.760
of really wacky things
I always like to mention

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.060
because I think they're weird.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.460
We have found planets
around binary stars.

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.320
Think tattooing, for you
science-fiction fans.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:22.090
We have found planets in
highly eccentric orbits,

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.970
orbits that go really, really close
to their host star but then come

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:27.480
out past the orbit of Earth.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.780
No particular reason to believe

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.880
that such an object should
ever exist, in yet it does.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.450
We've even found planets
around a wide range

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:37.010 position:56%
of host stars, including dead stars.

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:41.330
In fact, in 1992, we found
the first small exoplanets

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.360
around neutron stars.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.870
These are the remnants, the husks,

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:50.300
left over after supernova
of normal stars.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:55.140
And it's hard to believe, but
the planets, either formed later

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.550
or survived, a supernova.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:01.140
Again, not something
we would have expected.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.690
So all this now sort of leads
me to the topic of TESS itself.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:08.510
And when I talk about TESS.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:18:30.370
[ Inaudible ]

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:32.840
Shows you what we would
get in real time.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.820 position:56%
See that as the planet goes
across, the brightest the star gets.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:40.180
These 3 plots on the right
are actual transit data

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.650
as measured by the Kepler mission.

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:45.660
And these are detections
of actual planets.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.860
Obviously, this bottom one
here, that's a big planet.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.890
It's pretty easy to see
that in that data, by eye,

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:56.090
you can observe immediately
that there's a transit there.

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:59.580
This top one, on the
other hand, that is --

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.930
well, I refer to that as a
statistical tour de force.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:06.150
That was just an amazing bit
of analysis by Tom Barclay

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.940
and his collaborators to
pull that out of the data.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.110
That planet was, and
I believe it still is,

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.970
the smallest exoplanet ever found.

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:16.870
It's smaller than Mercury.

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:20.490
And it really just goes to show
that this technique can be very,

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:25.490
very powerful in finding
even the smallest of planets.

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:28.170
It's not easy to do, because what
you're trying to do, remember,

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:30.070
is you're trying to
measure a difference.

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.860
And looking at a star, a
star is already pretty faint.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:37.020
Now you're looking at a,
in the case of planets,

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.650
less than a percent difference
in the brightness of the star.

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.340
You're trying to measure
a small change

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:45.290
in something that's
already pretty faint.

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:47.310
So I've mentioned Kepler
a couple of times now,

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.900
so let me say a few words
about what Kepler is.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:54.020
Kepler was a mission, or is a
mission, it's now the K2 mission,

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:58.480
looking for exoplanets by looking
for transits, much like TESS.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.040
So why do we need TESS, what's
the difference between the two?

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:07.230
Well, the difference at its core
is largely a philosophical one.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:10.360
Kepler was about finding
lots of exoplanets.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.180
It was about statistics.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:15.770
Ultimately, the goal was to measure
a quantity that we call eta-Earth,

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:18.650
which is the frequency
of Earth surround stars,

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:23.700 position:56%
how common are Earth-sized planets
around all of the stars that we see.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:27.770
It was not designed to get
detailed characteristics

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:29.270
of all these exoplanets.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.340
It was just there to do a census.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:35.730
It was the mailer that we get
every 10 years, that's all.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:38.150
TESS, on the other hand, is
looking around the neighborhood

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:40.310
to see what things
are actually like.

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:45.360
It's looking only within a
well, very nearby distance,

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.310
to look for bright nearby stars
that have transit exoplanets.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:51.950
It's about finding the planets
that are really well-suited

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.660
for follow-up observations,
for finding those objects

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.310
that we're going to
want to be studying

00:20:56.310 --> 00:21:00.050
for the next 10, 20,
maybe even 30 years.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:03.240
Now, this philosophy
is actually very clear,

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.660
if you look at the way the
different surveys are done.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:10.940 position:56%
For Kepler, it looked in a
relatively small portion of the sky.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:17.080
But it looked out a long, long
way, over about 3000 light-years.

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:22.350
TESS, by contrast, only looks about
a few hundred light-years away,

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:27.400
but it covers almost the entire
sky, more than 400 times more area

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.540
of sky thank Kepler covered.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:34.220
So it really is focused on trying
to find those exoplanets that are

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:36.400
around bright nearby stars.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.860
Now, you're going to hear me
say bright nearby stars a lot,

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.150
because it's really important.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:43.450
How does TESS do this?

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:45.320
Let's go to the second
part of the name.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:50.510
The transiting exoplanet survey
satellite, the survey part of TESS.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:53.670
Tess has 4 cameras, each
one of which has a 24

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:55.560
by 24 degree field of view.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:00.800
So at any one time, it's looking
at a 24 by 96 degree patch of sky.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.030
This is a really big field of view.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.820
And in that field of view,
it's looking at a whole bunch

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:10.660
of individual targets
with small sets of data,

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:14.000
to try to find those
transiting events.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.040
Each one of those observing
sectors is observed for 27 days.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.660
And over the course of the year,

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.580
we tile 13 of those
observing sectors together

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.210
to cover almost the
entirety of one hemisphere.

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:28.180
Then we flip around and we repeat
that, and do the same thing

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.490
for the other hemisphere.

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:33.280
So at the end of 2 years,
we've covered the entire sky

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.810
with a coverage map that
looks something like this.

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:38.130
So you can see that most of
the sky has been observed

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.150
for at least 27 days.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:44.470
And where those observing sectors
overlap, or those tiles intersect,

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.600 position:56%
you get much longer observing times.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.350
And in fact, up here, at the polls,

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:52.940
you get almost 1 full
year of time coverage.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.950
That's really important
because it's at the polls

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:58.400
that that longer time coverage
that you're able to find planets

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.980
with longer periods, and
you're actually more sensitive

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.690
to small planets.

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:06.390
So this leads me to this question
of, what will TESS actually find?

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:10.590
Well, this is just a
simulation, it's only a model.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:14.210
But all those red dots are
planets that we expect to find

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:17.620
with TESS in the core data.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:23.010
The blue dots, which are impossible
to see for you, are other planets

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:25.580
that we expect to find
in ancillary data.

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:30.340 position:56%
But the key ones, the core ones, the
ones that are most important to me,

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.740
to us, are those red dots.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.450
Now, you'll see, they're
all over the sky.

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:39.080
Now, they are concentrated at
the polls, as you would expect,

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:43.050
because that's where our long
baseline time coverage is.

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:46.830
But there are a lot more
around the entire sky.

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:52.120
Let me convert those dots into
numbers, because I'm a numbers guy.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.840
You see that with TESS
we're expecting to find

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.220
over 500 new small planets.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.430
That's just in the core data.

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:03.400
That excludes the extra ancillary
data that we're going to getting.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.010
And this is going to
be a huge increase.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:11.680
We have only a few hundred small
planets that we know of right now.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.300
So we're going to more than double
the size of that set of targets.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.900
But that's not the best part.

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.210
The best part is the fact that
they're going to be close by.

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:24.780
So let's take a look, if I look
at how far away these planets are,

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:29.660
and I compare planets
that are known in blue,

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.730
the black dots are
Kepler detected planets,

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:34.710
and the red dots are TESS
expected TESS planets,

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:37.380
you'll see so far we've got
all red dots, a few blue.

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:40.690
There's the first black dot,
over 100 light-years away.

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:44.210
Here's the Kepler targets.

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:45.970
They go out a heck of a long way.

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:49.010
In fact, they go out
beyond the simulation.

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:55.880
But the TESS targets are almost all
within a few hundred light-years.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.530
So they really are the
bright nearby stars.

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:02.900
Why is this so important?

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:06.180
Well, one of the things that we've
learned from all the exoplanets

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:10.150 position:56%
that have been done so far, and this
is a really exciting field didn't

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:12.140
exist 20 years ago, but now it is

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:16.830 position:56%
like perhaps the single most vibrant
part of the astronomical community.

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:21.670
One of the things we've learned
is that there's a lot more planets

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:25.580
out there than we expected, and
that they're very different.

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.690
They're not homogenous bodies.

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:31.710
They're not Earths and
Venuses and Mars and Jupiters.

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:34.390
There's planets that are sort of
like this and sort of like this

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:37.290
and like this, but
they're all different.

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:38.590
What we'd really like to do is

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:41.550
to start doing what I call
comparative planetology,

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:44.850
actually making measurements of
other planets that are out there,

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:48.430
exoplanets, and say, these 2
planets look similar in some ways

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:51.440
but they're different in other
ways, can we understand why.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.920
Can we start to understand
how planets turn

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.590
into the objects that they are.

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:59.810 position:56%
And to do that we need to actually
do the characterization measurements

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:04.960
to actually measure the properties
of individual exoplanets.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.520
Now, this all starts with
the TESS data itself.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.250
You learn 2 important
things just from looking

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:12.740
at the transit data
that TESS acquires.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:15.800
The first thing you learn
is how big the planet is.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:20.850
This may be kind of obvious to
some of you, but just in case.

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:26.100
The size of that dip in
brightness is determined entirely

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:29.230
by how big the planet
is relative to the star.

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:34.670 position:56%
So if you have Jupiter transiting in
front of our sun, Jupiter will block

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:39.050
about 1% of the light from the sun.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:43.660
If, by contrast, I have
Earth orbiting the sun,

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:49.190
Earth is this little dot right
there, it only blocks about 1/100

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:52.560
of 1% of light from the sun.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:58.330 position:56%
So, you know, that dip in brightness
is just the ratio of the area,

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:02.550
projected area, of the planet
to the area of the star.

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:05.510
Pretty easy, straightforward.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:09.630
You can also note that you can get
the orbital period of a planet,

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:11.280
you can tell how long a year is.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.470
If I'm looking at the
Earth transiting the sun,

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:19.470
then that transit event will occur
exactly every 365 and 1/4 days.

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:20.870
And I would go low and behold,

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:25.040
that planet has a year
that's 365 and 1/4 days long.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.680
Furthermore, if I look carefully
at how long this transit lasts

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:33.710
and that the shape of the entry
and exit from that transit event,

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:37.180
I can start talking about things
like the eccentricity of the orbit,

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.270
the inclination angle of the orbit,

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:41.050
and a number of other
parameters as well.

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:45.130
I can learn a lot about
the orbital parameters

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:48.570
of a planet just from
the transit data.

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:54.020
Unfortunately, this
is really not enough.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.900
If I were to take a bunch
of planets, as I have done,

00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:00.980
and plot their radius on one axes,
so this is their radius relative

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:05.130 position:56%
to Earth, and plot their mass on the
other axes, that's the mass relative

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:11.240
to Earth, they appear all sort
of in this band on that plot.

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:15.190
Now, you'll see the green above
dots are super-Earth planets,

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:17.640
blue dots are other exoplanets,
particularly giants up here.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:21.420
And these pink squares are
planets in our own solar system.

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:25.480
These 4 lines, hydrogen,
water, rock, and iron,

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.100
are what we call phase curves.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:31.650
They are the how big a planet
would be if it had this mass

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:34.000
and was made out of this material.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.190
This is kind of obvious, right.

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:39.890
If I have a bowling
ball and a soccer ball,

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:43.720
they have the same radius, but the
bowling ball weighs a lot more.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:46.550
If I have a shock put and a bowling
ball, they weigh about the same,

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:49.180
but the shock put's a
lot smaller in radius.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:51.160
The same thing is true for planets.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.750
If I just measure the
radius of a planet,

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:57.530
and let's say measure something
here at 2 Earth radii, well,

00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:59.950
all those of those things are
about 2 Earth radii and they vary

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:03.120
from water-like planets to rocky
planets to planets that are heavier

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.830
and may even be iron-like.

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:09.810
Vice versa, if I just had a
mass measurement, then, well,

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:12.410
I've got something here that looks
heavier than iron, that's weird.

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:15.750
I've got several things that are
rocky, and one thing that's watery,

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.650
and then some things that are
kind of lying above that curve.

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:22.150
So if I have just radius,
it's not enough.

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:25.800 position:56%
If I had just mass, it's not enough.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.610
Both of those things
give me some idea of what

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:32.360
that planet might be like, but they
don't really tell me nearly enough

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.540
to start understanding
what it really is like.

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.840
I need both.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.180
If I have both, I have a density

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:40.040
and I can tell you what the gross
composition of that planet is.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.930
I can tell you whether it's a
lump of rock, a big bowl of ice

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:46.550
and water, a gas giant,
or maybe something bizarre

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:50.440
like an enormous chunk of
iron in the middle of nowhere.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.200
So how do I get that
second measurement?

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.340
With the transit data,
I've gotten the radius.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:56.250
Now I want to get the mass.

00:29:56.250 --> 00:30:00.270
So this brings me to the
radial velocity technique.

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:04.340 position:56%
The radial velocity technique is
actually the oldest technique having

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.980
been used for finding exoplanets.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.090
And it works like this.

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:12.820
If I look at the light from a star
and I break that into the spectrum,

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.650
into very, very small
chunks of light,

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:17.460
then what I see are a whole bunch

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:22.990
of very narrow absorption
bands, absorption lines, even.

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:26.300
If I watch those lines carefully,

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.590
then I can learn a
lot about the star.

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:31.240
If that star has a
planet orbiting it,

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.370
then the planet doesn't
just orbit the star,

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:35.350
the star orbits the planet as well.

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:38.840
In fact, they both orbit the
center of mass of the system.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:42.340
So for every orbit
this planet makes,

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:45.570
the star is doing a
tiny little pirouette.

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:48.760
So if you're watching that
spectrum, then what you will see is

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:52.140
that as the star comes
towards you in that pirouette,

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:55.240
the lines all shift a little bit
bluer, they get a little bit bluer

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.030
than they would be otherwise,
from the Doppler effect.

00:30:58.030 --> 00:30:59.750
As the star goes away from you,

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:02.340
they get a little bit redder
from the Doppler effect.

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:06.020
So over time, I see these
lines doing this, moving back

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:08.620
and forth, and back and forth.

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:11.870
And if I measure the frequency
at which they go back and forth,

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:13.750
I now know the orbital period,

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:16.940
I know how long the
year is for that planet.

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:20.400
If I also measure the amplitude,
how far those things move,

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.300
I can tell you how
massive that planet is.

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.740
So if I have that measurement,
in combination

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:28.770
with the transit measurement, I can
tell you what that planet is made

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:31.360
out of, roughly speaking.

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:35.380
So this means that
follow-up observations

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:38.000
of the TESS targets are going
to be really, really critical.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.430
And in fact, part of the TESS
program is to have people

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:44.130
with ground-based telescopes
following up on these targets,

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:48.230
to try to make the
measurements to get the masses.

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:51.160
This is not an easy
measurement to make.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.930
And well, in fact, it's
extremely challenging.

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:55.370
So let me give you an example.

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:58.320
Kepler, with all those planets
that go out very, very far away,

00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.980
while it has been responsible
for the detection

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:03.800
of over 1000 exoplanets,
1000 confirmed exoplanets,

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:07.710
there almost 4700 additional
exoplanet candidates

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:10.930
that Kepler has found that
have not yet been confirmed.

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:12.810
And for many of those,
they haven't been confirmed

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:16.500
because those stars are down here.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.500
They are simply too
faint for us to make

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:23.570
that radial velocity measurement
in order to measure the mass.

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:24.870
So what would you like?

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:27.490
You'd like planets
around brighter stars,

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:30.700
maybe bright nearby stars, in fact.

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:33.600
And you see, that with TESS,
of course, the stars are about,

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:37.080
on average, 100 times
brighter than those for Kepler.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.730
So for Kepler to get a mass of
some of these planets down in here,

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:46.210
I need weeks or months or many
months of telescope time in order

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:48.130
to make that measurement.

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:52.160
With Kepler -- I'm sorry,
with TESS, it will take hours.

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.740
And in fact, some of these stars
are visible to the naked eye.

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:58.160
An amateur astronomer,
somebody with 4 inch telescope,

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.190 position:56%
could go in their backyard and if
they have a decent camera behind it,

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:04.220 position:56%
could actually measure that transit.

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.830
Maybe not from DC, it's
too hazy and polluted.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:10.150 position:56%
But they go out to West Virginia
somewhere and make that measurement.

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:12.510
I think that's amazing.

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:17.010 position:56%
So a big key difference between
Kepler and TESS is that with Kepler,

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:19.500
you find a new exoplanet
candidate, and you go,

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.110
can we make that follow-up
measurement?

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:22.990
Is it even possible?

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:24.360
With TESS, it's going to be,

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:27.750 position:56%
we've got all these exoplanet
candidates, which one do we do next?

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:32.810
It's a problem of prioritization,
not one of possibility.

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:37.120
So as I mentioned before, TESS
actually has partners lined

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.510
up to make a bunch of
these measurements.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:41.340
The Las Cumbres Observatory --

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:46.430 position:56%
actually it's the Las Cumbres Global
Observatory Telescope, I believe.

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:50.990
Pardon, if any of you speak French,
I'm about to do something horrible.

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:53.300
The Observatory Haute-Provence.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.630
My friend's pronunciation,
I keep being told is awful.

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:59.540
And the HARPS Instrument, which is
the high accuracy radial velocity

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:01.340
planetary search project.

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:04.880
So these are all partners who
are going to be helping us

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.490
in doing that follow-up work.

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:08.130
And there's a lot of
other partners here,

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:13.090
there's just not enough
room to put them on a slide.

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:15.340
Unfortunately, even once
we have that measurement,

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:18.090
we still don't really know
that much about the planets.

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:22.590
Now we know roughly what -- we can
tell it's a rock, that's about it.

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:24.030
Venus and Earth are both rocks.

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:26.120
They have about the same mass.

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.080
They have about the same radius.

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:31.270
They're both in the
habitable zone of the sun.

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:36.270 position:56%
And yet, it's a gorgeous day outside
here in Washington, DC, on Earth.

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:39.110
There is no place on Venus where
we can stand on the surface

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:43.240
and be alive for more
than about a millisecond.

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:45.640
I like it here, I'm
not going to go there.

00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:49.020
We were talking outside about would
I go to Mars, the answer is maybe.

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.690
I wouldn't go to Venus.

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:55.090
But if I just had the mass and
radius, they look the same.

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:56.530
I'd like to be able to
tell the difference.

00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:58.760
I'd like to know which planets
out there are Earthlike,

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.100
which ones are Venous like,
which ones are Mars like.

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:02.400
How do I do that?

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.840
Well, you need yet
another measurement.

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:08.350
What you really want
to see is the spectrum

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:10.500
of the atmosphere of the planet.

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:13.590
Now, for Earth, this is
this lime and green here.

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:16.270 position:56%
You see all these big deep features.

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:18.270
Those are almost all due to water.

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:19.600
Some of them are due
to carbon dioxide,

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.850
but they're almost
mostly due to water.

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:23.940
And that's a very good sign.

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:26.150
We like water on planets.

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:29.210
Mars, by contrast, here in blue,
really doesn't have many features

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:32.600
at all because it's
atmosphere is thin and tenuous

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.080
and doesn't have much in it.

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:38.400
Venus has a lot of features,
but they are not water features.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.730
They are things like carbon
dioxide and sulfur-based chemicals.

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:44.390
It's a very different atmosphere,

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:46.170
so its spectrum is
very, very different.

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:48.890
If I had a spectrum of
an exoplanet like this,

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:52.920
I could tell you immediately if it
was one of -- like one of these 3,

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.810
or if it was something
completely different,

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:57.160
which I really think is likely.

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:00.240 position:56%
So how do you make that measurement?

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.900
Now we're getting really
into the weeds,

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.190
now things get really hard to do.

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:06.780
We do that with a technique
we call transfer spectroscopy.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:10.450
Now, so imagine for a moment
that you've got a planet.

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:12.870
And let's imagine that this
planet has an atmosphere,

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:18.230
a big thick atmosphere, and that
atmosphere absorbs all green light.

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:19.560 position:56%
All red light goes right through it.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.050
All blue light goes
right through it.

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:24.240
But all green light gets completely
absorbed by the atmosphere.

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:27.900
Then if I look at that planet,
and I watch the transit occur

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:32.730
in red light, what I see
is that just the rock.

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:34.350
I just see the rock
passing from the star.

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:35.650
I see the transit.

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:36.950
Everything is great.

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:39.270
If I look in blue light,
I see the same thing.

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:41.390
But if I look in green light,

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:45.060
suddenly the atmosphere is
absorbing light from the star too,

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:47.180
so now the planet doesn't
look like it's the rock,

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:48.930
it looks like it's a bigger rock,

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:52.530
because the atmosphere is also
blocking out light from the star.

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:54.540
So when I observe that transit,

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:57.900 position:56%
I see that the transit starts a
little earlier, ends a little later,

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:00.560
and it's a little bit deeper.

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.920
If I do this at a lot of
different wavelengths,

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:05.850
then what I'm measuring is the
apparent size of the planet

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:08.480
as a function of wavelength.

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.840
That tells me what's
in the atmosphere.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.720 position:56%
That is a spectrum of the atmosphere

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:16.100
and tells me what its
composition is.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:20.500
Now, this is a very, very, very
challenging measurement to make.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.620
Remember, I talked about it before,

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:24.920
a transit measurement
itself is hard,

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.850
because you're measuring
the difference.

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:28.510
You're measuring this
change in brightness

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:31.040
of something that's
already pretty faint.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:35.050
To do transit spectroscopy, you're
trying to measure the change

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:38.740
in the change of something
that's already pretty faint.

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:41.920
So this is an extremely
challenging measurement to make.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.410
And if you want to be
able to make it, you need,

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:47.250
let me guess, bright nearby stars.

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:51.040
In fact, you want really
bright stars.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.770
You want stars that you could
see through a pair of binoculars,

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:56.110
if not brighter than that.

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:59.930
These are all the exoplanets
that are currently known,

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:08.630
as of last night, around very
bright stars, and which transit,

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:10.900
and there are 30 of them.

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:13.770
Most of them, of course, are up
here, they're the giant planets.

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:16.310
In fact, they're the roasters.

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:19.590
But there are a few down in here.

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:24.040
Unfortunately, those are all --
there, A, only a handful of them.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:28.230
And, B, when I say that they are
bright, they're right at the cutoff

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:30.960
of what I consider bright enough.

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.790
They're not really bright.

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:34.600
TESS changes that.

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.150
With TESS, suddenly we have
hundreds of these planets

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:39.540
that are bright enough
for us to make

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:41.490
that transit spectroscopy
measurement.

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:43.690
Hundreds of planets where
we will be able to go

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:46.200
and actually tell you
what the atmosphere

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.380
of that plan is made out of.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:53.570 position:56%
And in fact, with future facilities,
like the James Webb space telescope,

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:56.020
which should launch in about 2018,

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:58.420
and with future ground-based
telescopes, they are people working

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:00.610
on 20 and 30 meter
ground-based telescopes,

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:03.410
that eventually will
actually get built.

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:05.710
With facilities like those,
we'll actually be able

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:08.770
to measure the atmospheres
of planets in this range,

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:10.920
all of these we'll be able to do,
but we'll also be able to do some

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.390
of these small ones as well.

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:14.120
We won't get down to
the Earth-sized planets.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.570
That's going to take
something even more powerful

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:18.630
than what's in the drawing boards.

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:21.620
But we will be able to do
these super-Earth planets.

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:25.630
And we may well find some actual
signs of habitable worlds.

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:27.980
And that's really, really exciting.

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:32.110
Now, ultimately, we
want to do better

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:34.120
than even these transit
spectroscopy.

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:37.520
Ultimately, we would like to
actually observe a planet directly

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:41.150
and see a spectrum
that looks like this.

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:44.450
We would like to see a really high
quality spectrum directly measure

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:45.860
the planet.

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:48.450
This is actually the
spectrum of the Earth,

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:50.940
as measured reflected off the moon.

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:53.390
A very elegant little experiment.

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:55.310
And you can see in this spectrum,

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.360
there's a lot of stuff
going on in our atmosphere.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:59.570
Our atmosphere is very complex.

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:04.400 position:56%
But there's a couple of key features
that are, to me, as an astronomer,

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.300
really interesting, and
there are things, to me,

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.180
that individually indicate

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:12.110
that there might be a
nice place for people.

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:15.760
I see Rayleigh scattering, which
tells me that there's a blue sky.

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:18.140
I see very strong oxygen features.

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:20.060
Well, where's the oxygen come from?

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.390
It comes from a lot of places,
but when they're this strong,

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:25.360
there's something on that
planet that's producing oxygen.

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.610
In our case, it's plant life.

00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:30.680
Okay, it's not definitive, but
there's a strong indication here

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:33.920
that there might be plant
life on this planet.

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.220
Then I see water features.

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:36.570
I see a lot of water features.

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:42.650 position:56%
That tells me that water is not only
present but abundant on this planet.

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:45.140
That there might even be
big bodies of liquid water

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:47.110
on the surface of this planet.

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:51.000
Again, this is one of the things
that we consider critical,

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.770
necessary for the formation
of life as we know it.

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:57.160
Then we also see my
favorite feature,

00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.430
the methane feature, out here.

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:06.480 position:56%
On Earth, methane is almost entirely
produced by biological life.

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:12.110
Whether it is bacteria on
the ground or in jungles,

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:14.860
breaking down organic matter,
or flatulent livestock,

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:16.160
almost all of the methane

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:19.660
in our atmosphere is actually
produced by biological life.

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:22.880
So if we saw the combination of all
of these features in the spectrum

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:28.510
of an exoplanet, we would have,
not a definitive, but a very, very,

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:33.490 position:56%
very strong case that that planet
is habitable and maybe even habited.

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:36.910
Again, we're not going to be
able to make that measurement

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:39.980 position:56%
in the near future, that's something
that will happen down the line.

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:42.690
And maybe it will be a target
that's been found by TESS.

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:45.570
I think it is likely that the first
time we see a spectrum like that,

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:48.420
it will be something
that TESS finds.

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:50.270
But that spectrum will have to wait

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:52.340
for the next generation
of space telescopes.

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:56.930
Which brings me to my final
actual slide, which is to point

00:41:56.930 --> 00:42:00.810
out that TESS is part
of a long line.

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:03.210
Exoplanets is a new
field, as I said before,

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:05.160 position:56%
it's really only about 20 years old.

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.080
And it's really only
been in the past 10 years

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:10.140
that it's really taken
off in a powerful way.

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:12.420
And it's built on the
legacy of a lot

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.700
of other facilities and missions.

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:17.050
It started with ground-based
observatories.

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:19.870
But then the Hubble space telescope
has made great discoveries.

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:22.370
Spitzer has been used
to study exoplanets.

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:25.710 position:56%
And the Kepler mission that I
talked about is responsible for more

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:29.400
than half the exoplanets that we
know about, that we've confirmed.

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.100
TESS is the next logical step.

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:34.540
Because we're no longer interested
in just finding exoplanets,

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:36.340
we're interested now
in finding exoplanets

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:37.900
that we can actually study.

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:41.700
We're actually interested in
learning what exoplanets are like.

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:44.480
And this is a very big
departure, this is a new direction,

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:49.460
this is opening the door
for comparative planetology.

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:52.530
Beyond TESS, JWST is going
to be a critical facility

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:54.090
for following up these objects.

00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:59.620
We're going to have the target list
that exoplanet scientists are going

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:01.620
to be using for the next 20 years.

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:05.340
And JWST is going to be the
best way to study those objects

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:08.560
over the next decade
or maybe longer.

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:11.140
Beyond that, the WFirst
NASA mission, which is going

00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:14.710
to launch sometime in the next
decade, I think it's 2023,

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:19.030
but please don't quote me on that.

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:21.310
That is going to also be
used to study exoplanets.

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:25.170
And beyond that, astronomers
are looking at possible missions

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:26.470
in the long-term, something

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:28.860
like what's shown here is
the New World telescope,

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:33.010
even larger telescopes that are
optimized solely for the purpose

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:35.560
of getting a spectrum
of an exoplanet,

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:39.470
something that looks like that.

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:44.370
And ultimately, maybe before I die,

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:48.100
we will actually have not just
a whole range of exoplanets,

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:51.380
but we'll have a wide
variety of exo-Earths.

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:53.540
We will be able to
talk about the fact

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:58.810 position:56%
that our Earth is a unique object,
but there are other Earth's similar,

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:00.550
similar enough that
they could support life.

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:03.120
And we can start understanding
the differences between planets

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:06.680
that are habitable, not just
the differences between planets.

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.480
Thank you.

we all live a really long time

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:18.910
so we can learn more about this.

[ Inaudible Question ]

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:56.560 position:56%
So let me see if I can pull this up.

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.280
So the question was,
the first exoplanets

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:01.960
that were found were large
planets, and they were close

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:05.750
to their own sun; they were close
in, these were the hot Jupiters.

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:11.010
Have we gotten better or closer
to finding things that are more

00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:12.690
like our own solar system?

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:15.880 position:56%
Well, the answer is, the short
answer is, yes, we've gotten better.

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:20.010
Originally we found things that
were all up in this regime,

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:21.950
but now you can see that
there's a lot of planets that are

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:24.510 position:56%
in the same general area as Jupiter.

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:26.560
There's a few that
get close to Saturn.

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:29.160
There's a few scattered in
here with the rocky planets.

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:31.400
So we are doing better,
but we have a ways to go.

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:34.460
One of the fundamental
limitations is the fact

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:37.450
that stars themselves
are not well behaved.

00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:41.450
Stars are intrinsically
noisy, if you've looked

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:43.990
at sun spots or solar flares.

00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:47.280
All stars do that at some
level, in fact, our star is,

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.500
in the grand scheme of
things, relatively quiet.

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:53.480
So we try to make measurements of
these planets around other stars,

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:57.900
we have to take into account the
fact that there's all this activity

00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:59.830
of the star that interferes
with out measurement.

00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:01.130
But we are getting better.

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:04.870
It is unclear how far we
can go from the ground.

00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:08.170
It's unclear how far we can
go with these techniques.

00:46:08.170 --> 00:46:14.510 position:56%
But we're going to keep pushing that
until we get as far as we can go.

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:37.040
[ Inaudible Questions ]

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:39.020
Let me see if I can
repeat the question.

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:42.570
So the question is,
what about giant stars?

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:48.890
Do we see smaller stars eclipsing
or transiting other larger stars?

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:54.490
Do we see -- okay, I think
that's about it, right?

00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:55.880
The short answer is yes.

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:59.250
In fact, we find a lot of what
we call eclipsing binaries.

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:03.250 position:56%
And in many cases, those are 2
stars that are around the same size,

00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:05.120
that can be very different in size.

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.060
But, in fact, one of the
biggest sources of noise

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:10.210
that we've got are
eclipsing binaries.

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:14.460
Because if you have a big star and
a little star, it produces a signal

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:17.020
that looks a lot like
a transiting exoplanet.

00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:19.690
You know, if you look
at it in more detail,

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:25.060
you realize that's not a planet,
but it takes some extra work.

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:31.220
Now, as for giant stars, typically
we don't observe giant stars

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:33.060
on purpose.

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:36.780
The reason for that is that, if I
have a planet around a giant star,

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:41.220 position:56%
remember, that signal, that drop in
brightness, is the ratio of the area

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:42.970
of the planet to the
area of the star.

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:47.810
If the area of the star is this,
then my signal drops like a rock,

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:50.320
and now I've got no
depth to measure,

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:53.360
because it's so small
it's not miserable.

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:56.860
So we don't on purpose
look at giant stars.

00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:00.640
Now, for TESS, this ancillary
data, when I mentioned briefly,

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:02.480
is we're going to be getting
these full frame images.

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.800
We're going to be taking pictures
of the entire observation sector,

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:10.200
that entire 24 by 96 degree
field of view, every 30 minutes.

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:16.310
And anything that's in that data,
if there's a transiting something

00:48:16.310 --> 00:48:21.350
around a giant star, we'll have the
data, it's possible we'll find it.

00:48:21.350 --> 00:48:24.540
That will be a very difficult
bit of analysis to do.

have no planets around them.

know that for a fact.

a very, very distant orbit,

00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:28.520

to detect the methods

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:31.870
that are really effective,
like transfer rate of velocity.

[ Inaudible Question ]

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.720
What we can say is that there
are some stars out there

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:45.130
that don't have any planets
within a certain distance,

00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:48.970
but that's about it.

00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:54.620
And there's other stars where we
can make theoretical arguments

00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:56.060
that there shouldn't
be any planets, right.

00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:59.690
If I see a supergiant, a star
that has just recently gone

00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:01.910
into the supergiant phase,
if it had any planets,

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:04.970
they should've been
sucked up and eaten.

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:06.690
They shouldn't be there.

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:08.790
But I don't know for a fact
that there aren't any there.

00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:11.360
One of the limitations of both
the rate of velocity technique

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:15.020
and the transit technique is that
it requires a given orientation.

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:17.920 position:56%
If I have, you know, if it's
orbiting this way, then it transits,

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.600
the planet passes in
front of the sun.

00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:23.510
But if the orbit is
inclined this way,

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:25.870
it never transits,
there is no transit.

00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:28.680
Likewise, the radial
velocity measurement,

00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:32.350
if it's aligned this way,
then that star is moving back

00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:34.540
and forth relative to
your line of sight.

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:38.440 position:56%
But if that orbit is inclined this
direction, then it's moving this way

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:40.450
in your line of sight, and
you get no Doppler effect,

00:50:40.450 --> 00:50:42.310
so you can't see it.

00:50:42.310 --> 00:50:45.890
So there's a lot of limitations,

00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:47.950
but it's essentially
a statistical argument

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:53.460
that what we're seeing is
consistent with these numbers.

00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:55.130
If the number were
significantly higher,

00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:56.780 position:56%
we would expect to find more things.

00:50:56.780 --> 00:51:01.930
But if there's some unexpected
unknown population of planets

00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:08.350
out at 10 times Pluto's distance,
that we've never seen before, well,

00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:10.970
we can't count those because
they shouldn't be there

00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:14.900
and we haven't seen them.

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:17.370
&gt;&gt; Who's your favorite
sci-fi writer?

00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:18.900
&gt;&gt; Who's my favorite
science fiction writer.

00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:22.170
Well, that's going to
depend on whether I talk

00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:25.190
about modern era or classic era.

00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:29.440
In the classic era, I think
it has to be Frank Herbert.

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:34.730
The Dune books were always --
I have a first edition of Dune,

00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:38.050
and that's the only first
edition I own of anything.

00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:41.210
So that's going to
be the classic era.

00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:45.140
In the modern era, the modern era,
I'm a huge fan of John Schultz.

00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:48.190
But there's a lot of
good work coming out now.

00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:50.230
It's very different than a lot
of the classic science fiction

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:51.530
but it's a lot of fun to read.

00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:57.780
&gt;&gt; Are we the only country
studying exoplanets,

00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:00.240
or are there other
countries doing similar things

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:01.960
and we share information?

00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:03.780
&gt;&gt; Are we the only
country studying exoplanets

00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:05.650
and do we share information?

00:52:05.650 --> 00:52:08.100
Everybody and their brother
is studying exoplanets.

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:13.270
In fact, one of the
premier groups that has --

00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:18.300
let me pull up the right plot.

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:23.390 position:56%
One of the premier groups that has
made radial velocity measurements is

00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:26.720
a group out of Geneva.

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:31.030
In fact, in these early days, it
was a competition between a group

00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:36.190
at Geneva and a Carnegie
California Hawaii collaboration,

00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:38.270
where the 2 who were competing
and seeing who could get that one

00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:42.590
out first, and they
were neck and neck.

00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:44.840 position:56%
So it's a very international effort.

00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:51.670
In fact, even on TESS, you saw
the OHP in France is collaborating

00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:53.200
with us to make follow-up
observations.

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:56.160
We also have the E-ELT telescope
in Europe, the Japanese.

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:58.490
We just had the science
team meeting last week,

00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:01.060
and the Japanese are going
to be collaborating on some

00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:02.610
of these follow-up measurements.

00:53:02.610 --> 00:53:05.040
Everybody wants to be involved.

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:09.500 position:56%
In the missions, so far, the only --

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:12.870
there have been a few
dedicated exoplanet missions,

00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:14.520
Kepler is the big one.

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:17.710
But the Europeans have flown
something called Chiaps [phonetic].

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:21.050
They are now in development
of a mission called Plato,

00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:22.350
which is a lot like TESS.

00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:27.540
It's a bigger version than TESS
and it will observe more of the sky

00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:31.620
for longer, but it won't
launch for about another 8

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:34.420
or 9 years, so it's a ways away.

00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:38.360
And they call it Plato, not
Plato, I don't know why.

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:40.950
And of course, they're
collaborating.

00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:45.270
The Europeans are involved and the
Canadians are involved with JWST.

00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:49.120
And we expect that for these kinds
of missions where the science --

00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:53.550
I hate to say this
because it sounds so trite,

00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:55.540
but science doesn't
have national borders.

00:53:55.540 --> 00:54:00.260
When it comes to this data, we
share data openly and publicly,

00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:01.680
and we don't hide anything.

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:04.660
Because we try to get to the truth.

00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:07.810
So I don't care who it
is that helps me out.

00:54:07.810 --> 00:54:09.690
It sounds so -- anyway.

00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:12.300
Other questions?

00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:17.730
&gt;&gt; That's a lovely way to end.

00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:19.030
&gt;&gt; So cheesy.

00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:21.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Dr. Rinehart.

00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:25.070
[ Applause ]

00:54:25.070 --> 00:54:28.730
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
