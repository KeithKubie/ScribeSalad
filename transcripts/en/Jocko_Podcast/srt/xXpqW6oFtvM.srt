1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,540
Juggle.

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:05,860
What if I don't have time to explain
the why to my troops for a decision I'm

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,950
making during an operation
US army first lieutenant.

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,430
So awesome.
Thanks for your service.

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,330
US Army first lieutenant gets some and I,

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:22,350
I talk about troops and people
in general never wanting a path,

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,390
a plan to be imposed upon them.
And so that's,

8
00:00:28,391 --> 00:00:30,550
that's what this question
is kind of based around.

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,391
Cause I'm going to saying look,
you know,

10
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:34,360
you don't want to just force people
to do some plan. You want to say, Hey,

11
00:00:34,361 --> 00:00:36,460
what do you think you
should do? And Hey, here's,

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,350
here's what we're doing and
here's why we're doing it.

13
00:00:38,351 --> 00:00:41,440
This is why it's important that gets
people to take ownership of it and

14
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:42,490
therefore they do a better job.

15
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,310
So he must have heard me say
that and now he's saying, look,

16
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:46,240
sometimes I ain't got time to,

17
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,060
to be explaining the why when
we're getting this going on.

18
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,060
And that's why this idea of explaining
the why is true 99% of the time in an

19
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,440
administrative situation,

20
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,100
in a situation where things are under
control and we've got time to think about

21
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:03,700
what's happening, that's when you can go
and say, Hey, what's your, what's your,

22
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,950
you know, what do you think? How
do you think we should do this?

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,960
This is why I want to accomplish this.

24
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:10,240
This is the commanders and 10
you can do it and all that stuff.

25
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,190
And that makes sense.
Again,

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,400
in a administrative situation when there's
chaos and when there's May Hamot and

27
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,930
when there's uncertainty,
actually the opposite is true.

28
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,300
You actually want your
troops to you. They,

29
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:31,210
they want,

30
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:36,270
they want to see and hear
clear directives from you.

31
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,940
They want to know what they should
do in no one certain terms. And it's,

32
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:47,320
you can think of situations where if
you've seen, let's say a car accident,

33
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,140
right? And you see people
that are kind of frazzled.

34
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,270
If someone steps up into that situation,

35
00:01:52,271 --> 00:01:53,740
no one's doing anything that
they're supposed to be doing.

36
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,070
If someone steps up and says you
to start dragging that person over.

37
00:01:57,071 --> 00:02:01,120
There you go. Call nine one one they
actually teach that. You know when you,

38
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,600
when you're learning about how
to handle a traumatic situations,

39
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,720
somebody needs to step up, step
back, take charge of the situation.

40
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,400
Everybody wants that to happen.

41
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,480
And that's true in a combat scenario.
Again,

42
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:15,820
this is different from when
we're in the rear and we're,

43
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,960
we're formulating a plan and we're
safely going over whatever ideas we have.

44
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,230
And that's when you want to get impact,

45
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,260
input and feedback and
you let your subordinate
leadership come up with a plan.

46
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:30,790
That's all good. But that's
not true during a, like I said,

47
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:35,740
during a pressure situation, when
there's a critical scenario unfolding,

48
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,780
people want to be led.

49
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,040
Now when you lead them
in those situations,

50
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,910
you can still give orders
by Commander's intent.

51
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,300
You can still just give intent.
So an example of that,

52
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,500
and I actually wrote my example down,

53
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,220
you can say like Delta one six we need
high ground on the other side of that

54
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:58,540
road, make it happen. So then the
delta one, six commander goes, okay,

55
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,880
I need high on the other side of the road.
There's a good building.

56
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,920
It looks like that's when
we can take, hey, you know,

57
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:06,370
t squad come with me and they go over and
take down the building. I gave them a,

58
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,060
uh, still gave him commander's intent. I
gave him very clear commander's intent.

59
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,930
I didn't really tell him why. I didn't
say, Hey, what do you think would be best?

60
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:16,090
Do you think it's a good idea
to get high ground? No. I said,

61
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:19,150
go get high ground on the other side of
the street. That's what I told him to do,

62
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,700
so I'm going to let them figure it out.
They understand what the intent is.

63
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,670
You could say something a
little bit more specific.

64
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:30,010
You could give them an actual, an
actual directive. You could say,

65
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,440
Charlie wants six gag,
take two squads,

66
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,330
assault building 34 on the
other side of the road.

67
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,340
Get high ground on the rooftop.

68
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:41,110
Go now where you have something
that's more specific. Again,

69
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,900
it's not commander's intent.
It's directly I'm telling you what to do.

70
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,580
And a lot of times people
are gonna want that.

71
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,520
They're going to want to hear exactly
what to do in these pressors situations.

72
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,290
So depending on the level of experience
that your subordinate leadership has,

73
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,730
depends on maybe how specific you're
going to get with just given commander's

74
00:03:57,731 --> 00:04:00,100
intent versus giving
something very specific to do.

75
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,690
Both of those are the right answers.

76
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,110
If you have a good really good leader
underneath you and you can just give them

77
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,390
the intent and even let them come
up with a plan, cool. Go with that.

78
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,980
If you've got somebody that
needs a little more guidance,

79
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:10,450
give them a little bit
more specific guidance.

80
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,260
Now obviously, one part of that
is you've got to have trust.

81
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,000
You got to have trust with the,

82
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,490
with the subordinate leadership
with that you're working with,

83
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:24,400
whether that's you working with your
whole platoon and you just got to trust

84
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:27,070
your, your squad leaders and
your, your fire team leaders.

85
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,770
But you got to build that trust through,

86
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,810
through training and
through hard training,

87
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:37,600
through coaching them and mentoring.
And again,

88
00:04:37,601 --> 00:04:41,530
I hate using the word coaching
and mentoring because that
always gives an air of

89
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,000
superiority and I'm not going to want
to come off across as superior to other

90
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:49,990
people. Why do I not want to come
off as superior to other people?

91
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,270
Well, number one, because it unifies
our team more. And number two,

92
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,370
cause I'm not superior to other people,
right?

93
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,860
I'm another person and my subordinates,

94
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:02,830
even though they might not have as
much time in rank or experiences me,

95
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:07,240
they still might have great ideas
and I respect that. So this isn't a,

96
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,081
hey,

97
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:11,500
I don't want to use coach
or mentor because I'm
manipulating them and I want to

98
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:12,334
make sure that they,

99
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,610
that they listened to me because I'm
being a certain way with them. No, no.

100
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,260
I legitimately respect what they're
saying. That's the difference here.

101
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,940
So, but that's my goal is to build trust.
And the other way that you build trust,

102
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:27,850
and I've said this before, is
by giving trust. You know, hey,

103
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:30,580
I trust that you can do this. Hey Echo,
you're going to go take down the building.

104
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,550
I trust your plan and come up with it,
make it happen. Boom, you could do it.

105
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,240
You trust me more when I trust you, you
trust me. And that's what we want to do.

106
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:43,230
Now when the operation is over and now
you're in a post operational debrief,

107
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,710
then you can discuss why you gave a
certain order or you can get feedback from

108
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:52,840
them on why they executed it a certain
way and you can get the questions going

109
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:57,740
back and forth and through that little
question and answer period that takes

110
00:05:57,741 --> 00:06:00,950
place during or post operational debrief.
We get to know each other more.

111
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,920
We build more trust and we
become better as a team.

112
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,920
So that's the way it works.

113
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,440
You don't always have time to explain
why pressure situations you lead.
