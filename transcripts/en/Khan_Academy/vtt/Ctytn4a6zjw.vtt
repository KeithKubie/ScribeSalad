00:00:00.376 --> 00:00:01.851
- [Voiceover] Let's say that you know

00:00:01.851 --> 00:00:04.544
your probability of making a free throw.

00:00:04.544 --> 00:00:07.142
You know that the probability...

00:00:07.144 --> 00:00:10.000
The probability, and let's
say of scoring a free throw

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.589
because make and miss,
they both start with M

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:14.249
and that can get confusing,

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:18.241
so let's say the probability of scoring...

00:00:18.428 --> 00:00:22.199
scoring a free throw, is equal to,

00:00:22.306 --> 00:00:24.268
is going to be, say 70%.

00:00:24.268 --> 00:00:26.253
If we want to write it as a percent

00:00:26.253 --> 00:00:28.052
or we could write it as 0.7

00:00:28.052 --> 00:00:29.840
if we write it as a decimal.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.170
Let's say the probability of
missing a free throw, then

00:00:33.357 --> 00:00:34.425
and this is just going to come

00:00:34.425 --> 00:00:36.434
straight out of what we just wrote down,

00:00:36.434 --> 00:00:40.298
the probability of missing,

00:00:40.532 --> 00:00:43.005
of missing a free throw,
is just going to be

00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:44.479
100% minus this.

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:45.860
You're either going to make or miss,

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.010
you're going to score or miss,

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.078
I don't want to use make in this

00:00:48.078 --> 00:00:49.343
because they both start with M

00:00:49.343 --> 00:00:52.733
so this is going to be a 30% probability,

00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:55.159
or if we write it as a decimal, 0.3

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:56.912
One minus this is 0.7.

00:00:56.912 --> 00:00:58.619
These are the only two possibilities,

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:00.708
so they have to add up to 100%,

00:01:00.708 --> 00:01:02.775
or they have to add up to one.

00:01:02.775 --> 00:01:06.464
Now, let's say that you were
going to take six attempts.

00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:11.271
What we are curious
about, is the probability

00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:16.435
of exactly two scores

00:01:22.127 --> 00:01:24.342
in six attempts.

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:30.694
So let's think about what that is

00:01:30.694 --> 00:01:32.064
and I encourage you to get inspired

00:01:32.064 --> 00:01:33.643
at any point in this video

00:01:33.643 --> 00:01:35.199
you should pause it and you should try

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:37.648
to work through what
we're asking right now,

00:01:37.648 --> 00:01:40.086
so this is what we want to figure out,

00:01:40.086 --> 00:01:42.454
the probability of exactly two scores

00:01:42.454 --> 00:01:45.308
in six attempts.

00:01:45.635 --> 00:01:47.574
So, let's think about the way,

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:49.350
let's think about the particular ways

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.032
of getting two scores in six attempts

00:01:52.032 --> 00:01:53.076
and think about the probability for

00:01:53.076 --> 00:01:54.702
any one of those particular ways,

00:01:54.702 --> 00:01:56.536
and then we can think about how many ways

00:01:56.536 --> 00:01:59.227
can we get two scores in six attempts?

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.120
So, for example, you could get

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.302
you could make the first two free throws,

00:02:04.302 --> 00:02:09.302
so it could be score, score and
then you miss the next four.

00:02:09.875 --> 00:02:14.875
So score, score, and then it's
miss, miss, miss, and miss.

00:02:16.631 --> 00:02:19.684
So what's the probability of
this exact thing happening?

00:02:19.684 --> 00:02:21.308
This exact thing?

00:02:21.321 --> 00:02:25.779
Well, you have a 0.7 chance of making,

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:28.681
of scoring on the first one,

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:33.673
then you have a 0.7 chance
of scoring on the second one,

00:02:33.673 --> 00:02:38.396
and then you have a 0.3 chance
of missing the next four.

00:02:38.665 --> 00:02:41.403
So, the probability of
this exact circumstance

00:02:41.637 --> 00:02:44.259
is going to be what I am writing down.

00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:47.708
Hopefully you don't get
the multiplication symbols

00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:49.461
confused with the decimals, I'm trying to

00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:51.398
write them a little bit higher.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.204
Times 0.3, and what is
this going to be equal to?

00:02:56.264 --> 00:02:58.573
Well, this is going to be equal to...

00:02:58.783 --> 00:03:03.783
This is going to be 0.7 squared

00:03:04.007 --> 00:03:09.007
times 0.3 to the one, two, three, fourth--

00:03:11.797 --> 00:03:13.144
to the fourth power.

00:03:13.144 --> 00:03:16.278
Now, is this the only way to
get two scores in six attempts?

00:03:16.278 --> 00:03:19.413
No, there's many ways of getting
two scores in six attempts.

00:03:19.413 --> 00:03:24.413
For example, maybe you miss the
first one, the first attempt

00:03:25.484 --> 00:03:28.839
and then you make the
second attempt, you score,

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:31.788
then you miss the third attempt,

00:03:31.788 --> 00:03:35.280
and let's just say you
make the fourth attempt,

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.019
and then you miss the next two.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.934
You miss, and you miss.

00:03:41.934 --> 00:03:45.219
This is another way to get
two scores in six attempts,

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:48.040
and what's the probability
of this happening?

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.596
Well, you'll see, it's
going to be exactly this,

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:51.941
it's just we're multiplying
in a different order.

00:03:51.941 --> 00:03:56.941
This is going to be 0.3 times 0.7

00:03:59.765 --> 00:04:02.029
you have a 30% chance of
missing the first one,

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:05.081
a 70% chance of making the second one,

00:04:05.187 --> 00:04:10.187
and then times 0.3, a 30%
chance of missing the third,

00:04:10.202 --> 00:04:14.321
times a 70 percent chance
of making the fourth,

00:04:14.358 --> 00:04:16.517
times a 30% chance

00:04:16.517 --> 00:04:18.862
for each of the next two misses

00:04:18.862 --> 00:04:21.263
if you wanted the exact circumstance,

00:04:23.157 --> 00:04:25.444
this is once again going to be 0.7

00:04:25.444 --> 00:04:28.103
and if you just rearrange the
order that you're multiplying,

00:04:28.103 --> 00:04:31.051
this is going to be 0.7 squared

00:04:31.051 --> 00:04:33.930
times 0.3 to the fourth power,

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.216
so for any one of these particular ways

00:04:37.216 --> 00:04:39.387
to get exactly two scores in six attempts,

00:04:39.387 --> 00:04:41.325
the probability is going to be this.

00:04:41.325 --> 00:04:43.659
So, the probability of
getting exactly two scores

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:45.470
in six attempts, well it's going to be

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.898
any one of these probabilities

00:04:46.898 --> 00:04:49.069
times the number of ways

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:54.069
you can get two scores in six attempts.

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:56.394
Well, how...

00:04:56.394 --> 00:04:58.507
If you have out of six attempts,

00:04:58.507 --> 00:05:00.678
you're choosing two of
them to have scores,

00:05:00.678 --> 00:05:02.941
how many ways are there?

00:05:02.941 --> 00:05:03.858
Well, as you can imagine,

00:05:03.858 --> 00:05:05.484
this is a combinatorics problem,

00:05:05.484 --> 00:05:07.713
so you could write this as

00:05:07.713 --> 00:05:09.721
you could write this,
let me see how I could...

00:05:09.721 --> 00:05:12.947
You're going to take six attempts.

00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:17.534
You could write this as six choose,

00:05:17.534 --> 00:05:19.566
what we're trying to, you're
picking from six things,

00:05:19.566 --> 00:05:22.503
six attempts, and you're
picking two of them,

00:05:22.503 --> 00:05:26.624
or two of them are
going to need to be made

00:05:26.624 --> 00:05:28.969
if you want to meet these circumstances.

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:29.991
This is going to tell us the number

00:05:29.991 --> 00:05:31.616
of different ways you can make

00:05:31.616 --> 00:05:33.496
two scores in six attempts.

00:05:33.496 --> 00:05:35.226
Of course, we can write this as kind of

00:05:35.226 --> 00:05:37.293
a binomial coefficient notation.

00:05:37.293 --> 00:05:40.982
We can write this is as six, choose two

00:05:43.538 --> 00:05:45.651
and we can just apply the formula

00:05:45.651 --> 00:05:49.343
for combinations, and if this
looks completely unfamiliar

00:05:49.343 --> 00:05:52.419
I encourage you to look up
combinations on Khan Academy

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:53.847
and then we go into some detail

00:05:53.847 --> 00:05:56.192
on the reasoning behind the formula

00:05:56.192 --> 00:05:58.224
that makes a lot of sense.

00:05:58.224 --> 00:06:03.224
This is going to be equal to six factorial

00:06:03.355 --> 00:06:06.174
over two factorial

00:06:07.987 --> 00:06:11.259
times six minus two factorial.

00:06:11.725 --> 00:06:16.725
Six minus two factorial,

00:06:17.473 --> 00:06:20.223
I'm going to do the
factorial in green again,

00:06:20.933 --> 00:06:22.234
and what's this going to be equal to?

00:06:22.234 --> 00:06:25.477
This is going to be
equal to six times five

00:06:25.477 --> 00:06:28.822
times four times three times two,

00:06:28.822 --> 00:06:30.698
and I'll just throw in the one there

00:06:30.698 --> 00:06:32.335
although it doesn't change the value,

00:06:32.335 --> 00:06:35.456
over two times one.

00:06:37.745 --> 00:06:39.243
And six minus two is four,

00:06:39.243 --> 00:06:41.460
so that's going to be four factorial,

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.097
so this right over here is four factorial

00:06:43.097 --> 00:06:48.097
so times four times three
times two times one.

00:06:48.286 --> 00:06:50.376
Well, that and that is going to cancel,

00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:55.170
and the six divided by two
is three, so this is 15.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.220
There's 15 different
ways that you could get

00:06:59.558 --> 00:07:03.308
two things out of six, I
guess, is one way to say it

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.496
or there's 15 different ways

00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:12.376
that you could get two things out of six.

00:07:12.376 --> 00:07:13.456
Another way of thinking about it

00:07:13.456 --> 00:07:15.940
is there's 15 different ways

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.643
to make two out of six free throws.

00:07:19.643 --> 00:07:21.594
Now, the probability for each of those

00:07:21.594 --> 00:07:23.033
is this right over here.

00:07:23.033 --> 00:07:26.516
The probability of exactly
two scores in six attempts,

00:07:26.516 --> 00:07:29.207
this is where we deserve a
little bit of a drumroll.

00:07:29.209 --> 00:07:31.193
This is going to be

00:07:33.516 --> 00:07:38.516
six choose two times 0.7 squared.

00:07:41.724 --> 00:07:45.321
This is two, you're going to make two

00:07:45.613 --> 00:07:48.304
and then it's 0.3

00:07:50.349 --> 00:07:53.832
to the fourth power.

00:07:53.832 --> 00:07:57.524
These will necessarily add up to six.

00:07:57.524 --> 00:08:00.147
So this right over here was a three,

00:08:00.147 --> 00:08:01.982
then this right over here would be a three

00:08:01.982 --> 00:08:03.874
and then this would be six minus three

00:08:03.874 --> 00:08:05.395
or three right over here.

00:08:05.395 --> 00:08:07.008
Now, what is this value?

00:08:07.008 --> 00:08:10.199
Well, it's going to be equal to

00:08:12.175 --> 00:08:15.249
we have our 15, three times five

00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:17.317
so we have this business right over here.

00:08:17.317 --> 00:08:21.100
It's going to be 15 times

00:08:22.565 --> 00:08:26.082
let's see, in yellow, 0.7 times 0.7

00:08:26.082 --> 00:08:30.271
is going to be times 0.49

00:08:30.377 --> 00:08:32.676
and let's see, three to the fourth power

00:08:32.676 --> 00:08:34.787
would be 81.

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:39.223
But, I am multiplying four decimals,

00:08:39.223 --> 00:08:40.547
each of them have one space

00:08:40.547 --> 00:08:42.172
to the right of the decimal point

00:08:42.172 --> 00:08:44.947
so this is, I'm going to have four spaces

00:08:44.947 --> 00:08:46.073
to the right of the decimal

00:08:46.073 --> 00:08:51.073
so 0.0081

00:08:51.111 --> 00:08:54.408
so there you go, whatever this number is,

00:08:54.408 --> 00:08:56.672
and actually I might as
well get a calculator out

00:08:56.672 --> 00:08:59.595
and calculate it, so this is going to be

00:08:59.621 --> 00:09:02.151
this is going to be...

00:09:02.151 --> 00:09:03.184
Let me...

00:09:03.184 --> 00:09:08.184
So, it's 15 times 0.49

00:09:09.978 --> 00:09:14.978
times 0.0081

00:09:18.464 --> 00:09:23.464
and we get 0.059535

00:09:25.337 --> 00:09:27.531
so this is going to be equal to,

00:09:27.531 --> 00:09:29.063
let me write it down.

00:09:29.063 --> 00:09:32.186
Actually, I wish I had a
little bit more real estate

00:09:32.186 --> 00:09:35.318
right over here, but I'll
write it in a very bold color.

00:09:35.378 --> 00:09:37.073
This is going to be,

00:09:37.073 --> 00:09:39.697
well, actually, I'm kind
of out of bold colors.

00:09:39.697 --> 00:09:42.170
I'll write it in a
slightly less bold color.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:47.170
This is going to be equal to 0.05935

00:09:50.646 --> 00:09:52.991
if we wanted the exact
number, or we could say

00:09:52.991 --> 00:09:55.695
this is approximately, if we
round to the nearest percentage

00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:59.585
this is approximately
a six percent chance,

00:09:59.585 --> 00:10:04.275
six percent probability of
getting exactly two scores

00:10:04.275 --> 00:10:05.981
in the six attempts.

00:10:05.981 --> 00:10:07.177
I didn't say two or more,

00:10:07.177 --> 00:10:10.369
I just said exactly two
scores in the six attempts.

00:10:10.369 --> 00:10:12.424
Actually, it's a fairly low probability

00:10:12.424 --> 00:10:14.514
because I have a pretty
high free throw percentage.

00:10:14.514 --> 00:10:16.627
If someone has this high
of a free throw percentage

00:10:16.627 --> 00:10:18.101
it's actually reasonably unlikely

00:10:18.101 --> 00:10:20.063
that they're only going to make two scores

00:10:20.063 --> 00:10:23.037
in the six attempts.
