00:00:00.637 --> 00:00:02.378
- [Voiceover] Let's say
that we have a particle

00:00:02.378 --> 00:00:04.824
that's traveling in one
dimension, and its position

00:00:04.824 --> 00:00:07.859
as a function of time is given as t

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.859
to the third power plus
two over t-squared.

00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:17.140
What I would like you to
do is pause this video

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.140
and figure out what the
average acceleration is

00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:26.676
of this particle over the
interval, the closed interval,

00:00:26.676 --> 00:00:30.645
from t is equal to one
to t is equal to two.

00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:32.024
What is this?

00:00:32.024 --> 00:00:34.725
What is this going to be equal to?

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:37.115
Assuming you've given a
go, and the first thing you

00:00:37.115 --> 00:00:38.996
might have realized is we're
trying to get the average

00:00:38.996 --> 00:00:41.024
value of a function that we
don't know explicitly at.

00:00:41.024 --> 00:00:42.026
We know the position function

00:00:42.026 --> 00:00:43.814
but not the acceleration function.

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:47.166
But luckily, we also know
that the acceleration function

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.649
is derivative with respective
time of the velocity function

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.337
which is the derivative with respect

00:00:51.337 --> 00:00:53.329
to time of the position function.

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.393
The acceleration function is
the second derivative of this.

00:00:56.393 --> 00:00:59.078
We have to just find its average
value over this interval.

00:00:59.078 --> 00:01:00.356
Let's do that.

00:01:00.356 --> 00:01:02.063
Let's take the derivative of this twice.

00:01:02.063 --> 00:01:03.918
But before we do that, let
me just even rewrite this.

00:01:03.918 --> 00:01:04.604
It's just going to be a little bit

00:01:04.604 --> 00:01:06.932
easier to differentiate it.

00:01:06.932 --> 00:01:09.120
If we just take each of these
two terms in the numerator

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.943
and divide them by t
squared, we're going to get t

00:01:10.943 --> 00:01:13.936
to the third, divided by
t-squared is just the t.

00:01:13.936 --> 00:01:16.016
Then two divided by T
squared, we could write that

00:01:16.016 --> 00:01:19.851
as plus two t to the negative two power.

00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:23.063
Now, let's take the derivative.

00:01:23.063 --> 00:01:26.600
The velocity function, as
the velocity as the function

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.920
of time, just the derivative
with this with respect to time.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.152
It's going to be derivative
of t with respect to t as one.

00:01:33.152 --> 00:01:35.148
Derivative of two t to the negative two.

00:01:35.148 --> 00:01:39.758
Let's see, negative two times
positive two is negative four.

00:01:39.758 --> 00:01:43.108
T to the, we just decremented
the exponent here,

00:01:43.108 --> 00:01:47.729
t to the negative three power.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.019
Now, to find acceleration as
a function of time, we just

00:01:50.019 --> 00:01:52.884
find, take the derivative of
this with respect to time.

00:01:52.884 --> 00:01:57.346
Acceleration as a function
of time is equal to,

00:01:57.346 --> 00:01:59.184
actually it's already used
at color for the average

00:01:59.184 --> 00:02:01.929
so let me do a different color now.

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.725
Acceleration has a
function of time is just

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:07.560
the derivative of this with respect to t.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.070
Derivative of a constant with respect

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.547
to time was not changing so it's a zero.

00:02:11.547 --> 00:02:13.159
Then over here, negative three times

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:17.051
negative four is positive
12, times t to the,

00:02:17.051 --> 00:02:21.017
let's decrement that exponent
to the negative four power.

00:02:21.017 --> 00:02:24.360
Now to find the average
value, all we have to do now,

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.708
average value is essentially
take the definitive role

00:02:28.708 --> 00:02:30.989
of this over the interval, and divide that

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.372
by the width of the interval.

00:02:33.372 --> 00:02:34.649
Or we could say, we could take,

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:36.954
we can divide by the
width of the interval.

00:02:36.954 --> 00:02:38.274
One, over two minus one,

00:02:38.274 --> 00:02:40.026
and this also simplifies to one.

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:44.672
Times the definitive role of the interval.

00:02:44.672 --> 00:02:47.698
One to two of a of t which is,

00:02:47.698 --> 00:02:52.698
so this could be 12 t to
the negative four power d t.

00:02:54.398 --> 00:02:55.777
What is this simplified to?

00:02:55.777 --> 00:02:57.911
Once again, this is one over one.

00:02:57.911 --> 00:03:00.136
That's just going to be one.

00:03:00.136 --> 00:03:04.941
We take the antiderivative of this.

00:03:04.941 --> 00:03:07.681
Let me just, so this
is going to be equal to

00:03:07.681 --> 00:03:11.225
the antiderivative of this
is, so we go t to the negative

00:03:11.225 --> 00:03:15.188
three power but we
divide by negative three.

00:03:15.188 --> 00:03:17.563
An antiderivative of this
is going to be, if we don't

00:03:17.563 --> 00:03:22.369
take that, an antiderivative
is going to be negative four

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:25.402
t to the negative three power,
and we saw that over here.

00:03:25.402 --> 00:03:27.987
Obviously, if you were really
just taking an in-definitive

00:03:27.987 --> 00:03:29.623
role, we would have to
put some concept here.

00:03:29.623 --> 00:03:33.160
But in the definitive role,
if we put a concept here,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.334
Assuming the same concept
that we get canceled out

00:03:35.334 --> 00:03:37.627
when you actually do a
calculation, but the entire

00:03:37.627 --> 00:03:40.398
derivative of this, we
increment the exponent,

00:03:40.398 --> 00:03:42.398
and then we divide by that new exponent.

00:03:42.398 --> 00:03:45.142
Twelve divided by negative
three is negative four.

00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:50.142
We are going to evaluate
that from two and that one.

00:03:50.761 --> 00:03:55.353
This is going to be equal to,
when we evaluated it at two

00:03:55.353 --> 00:03:57.170
at the upper bound of our
intervals, it could be

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.242
negative four times two to
the negative three powers.

00:04:01.242 --> 00:04:04.526
It's negative four times, what is that?

00:04:04.526 --> 00:04:08.260
Two, that's one over to
the third of times 1/8,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.949
is one way to think about that.

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:12.693
Then we are going to have
minus this evaluated one.

00:04:12.693 --> 00:04:16.734
Minus negative four times
t to the negative three

00:04:16.734 --> 00:04:18.416
of one to the negative three is just one.

00:04:18.416 --> 00:04:21.583
This is going to be
negative four times one.

00:04:21.583 --> 00:04:22.917
This is going to be equal to,

00:04:22.917 --> 00:04:24.850
or really in the homestretch now,

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.705
this is equal to, this part right

00:04:26.705 --> 00:04:30.550
over here, is negative 1/2.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.854
This is negative 1/2, and this part

00:04:32.854 --> 00:04:35.990
right over here is positive four.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.288
Positive four minus 1/2.

00:04:38.288 --> 00:04:40.921
We could either write
that as three and a half,

00:04:40.921 --> 00:04:43.516
or if we wanted to write
that as an improper fraction,

00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:47.112
we could write this as 7/2.

00:04:47.112 --> 00:04:49.172
The average value of our acceleration

00:04:49.172 --> 00:04:52.017
over this interval is 7/2.

00:04:52.017 --> 00:04:55.856
If this position was given a
meters and time was in seconds,

00:04:55.856 --> 00:04:59.613
then this would be 7/2
meters per seconds squared,

00:04:59.613 --> 00:05:02.459
is the average acceleration between time

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:06.173
in one second and time at two seconds.
