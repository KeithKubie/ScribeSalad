00:00:07.693 --> 00:00:11.132
Welcome to our project
Google Developers Hackademy,

00:00:11.132 --> 00:00:14.891
where Latin American
Spanish-speaking experts

00:00:14.891 --> 00:00:17.363
will show you some of our tools,

00:00:17.363 --> 00:00:20.825
developer products,
APIs and new tricks.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.198
I'm glad to introduce,
in Google Developers Hackademy,

00:00:25.198 --> 00:00:28.330
the Android SDK
introduction course,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.660
created and given
by Enrique Diaz,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.858
from GDG Androidtitlan in Mexico.

00:00:32.858 --> 00:00:35.396
This course is divided
into four parts.

00:00:35.396 --> 00:00:38.627
We invite you to watch it
and learn along. Let's start.

00:00:45.693 --> 00:00:49.495
Hi. Welcome to the Android SDK
introduction course.

00:00:49.495 --> 00:00:51.099
My name is Enrique Diaz,

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:54.132
one of the co-organizers
of GDG Androidtitlan.

00:00:54.132 --> 00:00:57.066
Besides, I've been developing
Android apps professionally

00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.495
since 2009.

00:00:58.495 --> 00:01:00.660
By the end of this course,
you'll be able

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.759
to develop apps
with fundamental concepts

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.825
such as Views, Layouts,

00:01:07.363 --> 00:01:09.297
Fragments, Intents

00:01:09.297 --> 00:01:10.660
and Activities.

00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:13.495
The goal of this first lesson

00:01:13.495 --> 00:01:15.858
is to go through
3 important points.

00:01:15.858 --> 00:01:18.627
We will learn about
the history of Android,

00:01:18.627 --> 00:01:22.231
we'll check current statistics
and why it is important

00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:24.528
to start developing
for the platform,

00:01:24.528 --> 00:01:26.495
and finally, we will analyze

00:01:26.495 --> 00:01:28.759
what's coming in the future
for Android.

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.462
But first, I'd like you
to ask yourself these questions:

00:01:33.462 --> 00:01:36.825
What's the difference between
a Fragment and an Activity?

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.330
Two:

00:01:38.495 --> 00:01:40.495
What's Android Manifest?

00:01:40.495 --> 00:01:41.561
Three:

00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:43.198
What's an Intent?

00:01:43.726 --> 00:01:47.066
If you're able to answer
these questions,

00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:50.429
then you need to wait
for the advanced course.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.858
Brief history of Android.

00:01:53.858 --> 00:01:57.825
In 2003, Andy Rubin,
along with 3 other people,

00:01:58.198 --> 00:02:01.297
created a company called
"Android Inc."

00:02:02.363 --> 00:02:05.231
Back then,
their goal was to develop

00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:07.990
an operative system
for digital cameras.

00:02:08.594 --> 00:02:11.462
In 2005 it was acquired
by Google

00:02:11.462 --> 00:02:14.264
and there were
no further news until 2007,

00:02:14.264 --> 00:02:17.264
when Google,
along with other companies

00:02:17.264 --> 00:02:21.132
devoted to develop
telecommunications chipsets

00:02:21.132 --> 00:02:24.759
as well as hardware developers,
created a thing called

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:26.594
Open Handset Alliance.

00:02:26.594 --> 00:02:31.660
OHA launched Android OS
as an alternative

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.066
to innovate on the side
of the final consumer

00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:36.825
of mobile phones.

00:02:37.726 --> 00:02:39.495
In October 2008,

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:42.759
the first all-Android mobile
was launched,

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:44.528
version 1.0,

00:02:44.528 --> 00:02:47.627
and from there it started
growing immensely.

00:02:47.627 --> 00:02:50.990
In 2009 they had a 2.9%
market share,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.198
and currently, in 2013,

00:02:53.198 --> 00:02:55.627
we own a global 82%.

00:02:56.198 --> 00:03:00.066
Nowadays, Android
has nearly 1.5 million

00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:01.891
daily activations.

00:03:01.891 --> 00:03:05.891
Besides, there are nearly
900 million devices

00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:08.297
since the platform was launched.

00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:10.924
And the download history

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:14.363
reaches 48 billion apps
downloaded since 2008.

00:03:14.363 --> 00:03:18.264
Finally, there are 17 billion
push notifications every day

00:03:18.792 --> 00:03:22.198
for the users of this platform.

00:03:22.627 --> 00:03:25.891
But why should I care
about all this?

00:03:25.891 --> 00:03:27.066
Simple.

00:03:27.066 --> 00:03:29.297
If you're an Android developer,

00:03:29.297 --> 00:03:33.264
you'll be able to reach
and sell to all these people

00:03:33.264 --> 00:03:36.033
that are using
the platform today.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.891
The future of computing:
Android.

00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:42.132
Remember we talked
about OHA?

00:03:42.924 --> 00:03:47.429
They launched a totally
Open Source operative system.

00:03:47.957 --> 00:03:50.693
That means any developer

00:03:50.693 --> 00:03:53.330
of consumer electronic devices

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.066
can make use
of the operative system.

00:03:56.066 --> 00:03:58.198
Televisions, cameras,

00:03:58.198 --> 00:04:00.627
automobiles, even watches,

00:04:00.627 --> 00:04:04.594
are capable of having Android
as their operative system,

00:04:04.957 --> 00:04:08.528
so this represents
a huge chance for all of us.

00:04:08.825 --> 00:04:10.924
Picture this scenario:

00:04:10.924 --> 00:04:14.693
Currently, keys to enter
your house or your car,

00:04:15.297 --> 00:04:18.924
if you lose them,
they're no longer useful, ever,

00:04:18.924 --> 00:04:22.495
because you can't enter anymore
and you have to replace them

00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:24.330
with something physical again,

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.165
something that hasn't been
reutilized or improved

00:04:27.165 --> 00:04:28.957
in hundreds of years.

00:04:28.957 --> 00:04:31.495
What if you built a bolt

00:04:31.495 --> 00:04:34.660
that recognizes a relative
trying to enter,

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.231
who has an Android device,
and it opened automatically?

00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:40.990
Now, my question to you is:

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.990
What scenarios and devices
can you imagine

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.231
that can be replaced
by Android nowadays?

00:04:48.297 --> 00:04:49.363
RECAPITULATION

00:04:49.363 --> 00:04:50.825
Let's recapitulate.

00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:54.660
In this lesson we learned
three vary valuable things:

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.033
First, we identified
the history of Android.

00:04:58.033 --> 00:05:01.561
We learned where it comes from
and what's going on today.

00:05:02.561 --> 00:05:04.330
We knew its present,

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.594
how many activations
there are nowadays,

00:05:06.594 --> 00:05:09.825
and why it is important
to develop Android apps.

00:05:09.825 --> 00:05:12.594
And besides,
we looked into the future,

00:05:12.594 --> 00:05:15.231
which seems to be
very promising.

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:17.792
Next time we will discover

00:05:17.792 --> 00:05:21.264
the main tools to develop
applications for Android

00:05:21.264 --> 00:05:24.330
using an IDE, such as Eclipse.

00:05:24.792 --> 00:05:27.924
My name is Enrique Diaz and,
keep on programming!
