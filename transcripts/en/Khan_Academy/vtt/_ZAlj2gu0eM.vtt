00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.001
Rick: Susan Liscovicz,
thanks for that report.

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:03.421
We'll be talking to you, obviously,

00:00:03.421 --> 00:00:04.766
throughout the course of this newscast.

00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.141
I want to bring somebody in now

00:00:06.141 --> 00:00:09.012
that I'm realy excited
about having on this show.

00:00:09.012 --> 00:00:11.391
He's totally different
from most of the people

00:00:11.391 --> 00:00:12.557
that we talk to.

00:00:12.557 --> 00:00:16.011
He's gained his fame on
YouTube, of all places,

00:00:16.011 --> 00:00:19.965
where people to go to see
how he explains things

00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:22.019
that many of us frankly don't understand,

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.694
so let's start with the basics, Sal Khan,

00:00:24.694 --> 00:00:26.267
thanks so much for being with us

00:00:26.267 --> 00:00:29.168
from the Khan Academy, by the way.

00:00:29.168 --> 00:00:32.899
Basic question, explain to our viewers.

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:34.772
Explain to the million people out there

00:00:34.772 --> 00:00:38.990
what is actually broken
that we need to fix?

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.445
Sal: Right, and right
now, we have so many,

00:00:41.445 --> 00:00:43.331
you know, the stock market
goes down every day,

00:00:43.331 --> 00:00:45.239
and people are having foreclosures,

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.998
and banks are stopping lending

00:00:47.998 --> 00:00:48.695
and they're failing,

00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:49.901
so it's really hard for
people to keep track of

00:00:49.901 --> 00:00:50.858
what is the problem.

00:00:50.858 --> 00:00:52.565
Are these just causes of the problem,

00:00:52.565 --> 00:00:53.999
or are they the actual problem?

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:55.409
I think we need to take a step back,

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.201
and I've drawn a little diagram, here.

00:00:57.201 --> 00:00:58.696
Rick: Let's put it up.

00:00:58.696 --> 00:00:59.933
Sal: Drew a little diagram here,

00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:02.068
and I think there's a
basic fundamental question

00:01:02.068 --> 00:01:03.626
that we all have to ask,

00:01:03.626 --> 00:01:06.150
and what does the financial system do?

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.110
They make a lot of money.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.487
Hopefully they add some
value to our economy,

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:13.808
and this diagram essentially explains

00:01:13.808 --> 00:01:15.315
what the financial system does,

00:01:15.315 --> 00:01:17.250
so in a capitalist economy,

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.675
you have a lot of people with capital.

00:01:18.675 --> 00:01:19.736
That could be land.

00:01:19.736 --> 00:01:20.692
That could be gold.

00:01:20.692 --> 00:01:23.403
That could be, I don't know, animals.

00:01:23.403 --> 00:01:24.739
that could be cash,

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:26.820
and what you need to do

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.908
in order to make the economy grow

00:01:27.908 --> 00:01:30.296
is invest that capital into projects.

00:01:30.296 --> 00:01:32.207
Build factories,

00:01:32.715 --> 00:01:34.567
plow seeds,

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:35.649
hire people.

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.991
What the financial system does, the banks,

00:01:37.991 --> 00:01:39.151
and the markets,

00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:40.405
they take that capital

00:01:40.405 --> 00:01:43.155
and hopefully they allocate it on projects

00:01:43.155 --> 00:01:46.779
that actualy put people
to work, hire people,

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:48.083
grow our GDP.

00:01:48.083 --> 00:01:50.196
The problem right now is,

00:01:50.196 --> 00:01:51.487
as opposed to the financial system

00:01:51.487 --> 00:01:54.825
actually putting more
capital into the real world,

00:01:54.825 --> 00:01:57.217
it's, for the most part,
more concerned with

00:01:57.217 --> 00:01:58.820
self-preservation at the moment.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.321
They're kind of in survival mode,

00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:01.862
and because they're in survival mode,

00:02:01.862 --> 00:02:05.026
you don't have this flow
of capital going from

00:02:05.026 --> 00:02:07.187
whoever has it to the financial system

00:02:07.187 --> 00:02:08.163
and then to the projects.

00:02:08.163 --> 00:02:10.521
You pretty much have
everything just going back

00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:12.333
into the financial system

00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:15.570
because it's in essentially survival mode.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.192
Rick: So, I see the financial
system in the middle.

00:02:18.192 --> 00:02:21.552
Why is that piece broken?

00:02:21.552 --> 00:02:23.113
Draw that one up for us.

00:02:23.113 --> 00:02:26.561
Sal: Sure, and here I'm going to attempt

00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:29.455
to give everyone a 5-minute MBA,

00:02:29.455 --> 00:02:30.892
but essentially, what I've drawn here

00:02:30.892 --> 00:02:33.189
is our balance sheets for some banks,

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.612
and it might sound like
a complicated term,

00:02:35.612 --> 00:02:37.580
but a balance sheet is,
I think, something that

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.280
most people are fairly familiar with

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.661
when they talk about home equity.

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:41.082
Rick: Mm-hmm.

00:02:41.082 --> 00:02:42.503
Sal: So, if I were to draw a balance sheet

00:02:42.503 --> 00:02:44.146
for someone's house,

00:02:44.146 --> 00:02:45.863
it would look something like this.

00:02:45.863 --> 00:02:49.711
So the asset would be your house,

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:51.695
whatever it's worth,

00:02:51.695 --> 00:02:52.853
and then your liability,

00:02:52.853 --> 00:02:54.710
and I'll call that A for asset,

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.813
and then your liability
would be your mortgage.

00:02:57.997 --> 00:02:59.443
Your liability would be the loan.

00:02:59.443 --> 00:03:00.597
Rick: Mm-hmm.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.741
Now, if your house is worth $1 million,

00:03:03.741 --> 00:03:04.846
and your loan,

00:03:04.846 --> 00:03:07.682
let's say you owe 800,000 on your loan.

00:03:07.682 --> 00:03:08.410
Rick: Mm-hmm.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.610
Sal: Whatever's left over is your equity.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.578
Rick: Right.

00:03:11.578 --> 00:03:12.489
Sal: That's a balance sheet.

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:13.829
That's a balance sheet
that I think most people

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.827
are fairly familiar with.

00:03:15.827 --> 00:03:18.160
For corporations, they
have the exact same notion.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.741
And I think this is an
important point to realize

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:21.237
when people talk about the stock market

00:03:21.237 --> 00:03:24.289
and what does it mean
for a company's stock

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:25.637
to go to 0?

00:03:25.637 --> 00:03:27.469
When you buy a stock in a company,

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:28.159
you're essentially,

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.716
you're not buying a share
in all of its assets.

00:03:30.716 --> 00:03:32.806
You're buying a share in its equity.

00:03:32.806 --> 00:03:33.867
So, if you look at,

00:03:33.867 --> 00:03:34.944
so I drew two banks here,

00:03:34.944 --> 00:03:37.379
and we'll talk a little bit
more about what's broken,

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.996
but a bank has assets, and
a bank has liabilities.

00:03:40.996 --> 00:03:43.419
If you take the sum of the assets,

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.489
and you subtract out the liabilities ...

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:46.074
Rick: Mm-hmm.

00:03:46.074 --> 00:03:48.289
Sal: ... what's left over
is essentially the equity.

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:50.843
When you buy a stock in
a bank or any company,

00:03:50.843 --> 00:03:52.961
you're essentially taking a share of that.

00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:54.166
So what's broken here is

00:03:54.842 --> 00:03:56.993
through the housing bubble,
a lot of these banks,

00:03:56.993 --> 00:03:59.745
in order to facilitate
this whole securitization,

00:03:59.745 --> 00:04:01.488
and I can go into more
detail into what that is,

00:04:01.488 --> 00:04:04.404
they essentially accumulated these assets

00:04:04.404 --> 00:04:05.710
on their balance sheets.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.272
This has been,

00:04:07.272 --> 00:04:09.364
this has been the central focus

00:04:09.364 --> 00:04:10.579
of the entire bailout plan,

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.145
and there's been a lot
of talk about toxic CDOs

00:04:13.145 --> 00:04:13.872
and what are they worth,

00:04:13.872 --> 00:04:15.135
but I just want to show you what they do

00:04:15.135 --> 00:04:16.493
to a bank's balance sheet,

00:04:16.493 --> 00:04:18.072
and why it's so important
that we figure out

00:04:18.072 --> 00:04:19.745
what these things are worth

00:04:19.745 --> 00:04:20.570
because you see here,

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.576
I drew the,

00:04:22.822 --> 00:04:25.073
you can kind of view the
height of this left-hand side

00:04:25.073 --> 00:04:25.745
as the assets.

00:04:25.745 --> 00:04:27.530
The height on the right-hand
side is the liabilities.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.076
What's left over is the equity.

00:04:29.076 --> 00:04:31.665
If these toxic CDOs are worth nothing,

00:04:31.665 --> 00:04:33.726
if this disappeared,

00:04:34.171 --> 00:04:36.659
then all of a sudden,
your assets are worth

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:38.269
less than your liabilities.

00:04:38.269 --> 00:04:40.772
If your house is worth
less than your mortgage,

00:04:40.772 --> 00:04:42.438
then you have no equity.

00:04:42.438 --> 00:04:44.742
In that situation, your
stock would be worthless.

00:04:44.742 --> 00:04:46.998
In that situation, there's no reason why

00:04:46.998 --> 00:04:48.646
anyone should be lending to you,

00:04:48.646 --> 00:04:49.867
because you're essentially
throwing good money

00:04:49.867 --> 00:04:50.851
after bad.

00:04:50.851 --> 00:04:53.168
Rick: So, essentially, the
situation that the banks

00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:54.123
find themselves in

00:04:54.123 --> 00:04:56.284
is the same as the one that homeowners

00:04:56.284 --> 00:04:58.522
had found themselves
in as a result of this.

00:04:58.522 --> 00:04:59.245
Sal: Pretty much.

00:04:59.245 --> 00:05:01.561
Homeowners, you have an
asset that's worth less

00:05:01.561 --> 00:05:03.003
than your liabilities, what do you do?

00:05:03.003 --> 00:05:04.243
Do you try to get someone to bail you out

00:05:04.243 --> 00:05:07.133
and buy your asset for
more than it's worth

00:05:07.133 --> 00:05:09.580
or do you just declare bankruptcy?

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.467
Rick: Let's hold off right there.

00:05:10.467 --> 00:05:12.132
We're gonna come back
in just a little bit,

00:05:12.132 --> 00:05:13.970
and we're gonna continue
that conversation,

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.271
and we're also gonna be bringing you

00:05:15.271 --> 00:05:16.662
something today that's an exclusive

00:05:16.662 --> 00:05:19.448
to this particular hour on CNN.

00:05:19.448 --> 00:05:21.244
The story of Curveball.

00:05:21.244 --> 00:05:22.545
Who is Curveball?

00:05:22.545 --> 00:05:24.494
He may just be the only person

00:05:24.494 --> 00:05:25.999
that the Bush Administration used

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:28.580
as their source for going to war in Iraq,

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.667
or certainly as much as anyone else.

00:05:31.667 --> 00:05:33.239
Was he right? No.

00:05:33.239 --> 00:05:35.182
Who is he? No one's known,

00:05:35.182 --> 00:05:36.132
up to now.

00:05:36.132 --> 00:05:38.186
An exclusive interview with Curveball.

00:05:38.186 --> 00:05:40.867
Stay with us. We'll be right back.

00:05:42.157 --> 00:05:45.405
(upbeat music)

00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:53.492
twitter.com/ricksanchezcnn

00:05:53.492 --> 00:05:56.239
So many of you, 23,000, I believe

00:05:56.239 --> 00:05:57.416
when we last checked

00:05:57.416 --> 00:05:59.289
are talking to us, watching this newscast

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:01.417
as well as on MySpace and Facebook.

00:06:01.417 --> 00:06:02.869
In fact, there's somebody
on MySpace right now.

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:04.997
She's watching our show
and she just wanted us

00:06:04.997 --> 00:06:06.128
to know this.

00:06:06.128 --> 00:06:07.577
She says, "My son is 17 years old

00:06:07.577 --> 00:06:08.526
"and excited about college.

00:06:08.526 --> 00:06:10.061
"I'm worried that we won't
be able to get a loan

00:06:10.061 --> 00:06:10.789
"to send him now.

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:13.002
"My husband's hours have
been cut back from work

00:06:13.002 --> 00:06:13.814
"as well.

00:06:13.814 --> 00:06:16.560
"This absolutely affects all of America."

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.570
And that's why we're doing

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.770
what we're trying to do for you.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.988
Let's go back now and
bring in Sal, if we can.

00:06:21.988 --> 00:06:22.776
Sal Khan.

00:06:22.776 --> 00:06:24.617
He explained to us moments ago

00:06:24.617 --> 00:06:27.857
what it is that is actually the problem.

00:06:28.334 --> 00:06:30.492
What it is that is broken.

00:06:30.492 --> 00:06:31.739
Now, let's take the next step.

00:06:31.739 --> 00:06:33.681
Let's try and understand

00:06:33.681 --> 00:06:35.081
because everyone seems to be wondering.

00:06:35.081 --> 00:06:37.782
I don't understand this
bailout / rescue plan

00:06:37.782 --> 00:06:39.101
that the government's been in.

00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:39.830
What is it?

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.726
What is the government actually doing?

00:06:41.726 --> 00:06:43.861
Explain that to us so
we could understand it

00:06:43.861 --> 00:06:45.064
like a 5th grader.

00:06:45.064 --> 00:06:45.720
Sal: Right.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.129
The main problem, just
to take the big picture,

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:49.811
was that no one's lending to each other.

00:06:49.811 --> 00:06:51.363
What the government at least said

00:06:51.363 --> 00:06:53.727
that they wanted to do
is try to get the lending

00:06:53.727 --> 00:06:54.566
started again.

00:06:54.566 --> 00:06:56.462
Their bailout plan was essentially,

00:06:56.462 --> 00:06:58.553
let's buy out these toxic CDOs,

00:06:58.553 --> 00:06:59.475
because if I'm,

00:06:59.475 --> 00:07:00.368
let's say I'm a good bank

00:07:00.368 --> 00:07:01.818
that didn't get involved in this.

00:07:01.818 --> 00:07:04.828
If Bank A is holding these toxic CDOs,

00:07:04.828 --> 00:07:07.112
I'm not sure if Bank A should be bankrupt,

00:07:07.112 --> 00:07:09.206
if the toxic CDOs are worth nothing,

00:07:09.206 --> 00:07:11.399
or maybe they are good for the money.

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:14.184
There's a lot of uncertainty
on what these are worth.

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:15.740
The government, at least what they said

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.430
they would do is if they went in

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.368
and essentially did these reverse auctions

00:07:19.368 --> 00:07:20.979
and bought these assets,

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:23.145
then that, all of a sudden,
would give confidence

00:07:23.145 --> 00:07:23.934
in these banks.

00:07:23.934 --> 00:07:26.208
People wouldn't, there
wouldn't be uncertainty

00:07:26.208 --> 00:07:27.767
as to whether you can loan them money

00:07:27.767 --> 00:07:29.539
and maybe that'll free up the credit,

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:31.269
the whole system again.

00:07:31.269 --> 00:07:32.495
Rick: Will it work?

00:07:33.295 --> 00:07:34.902
Sal: Probably not.

00:07:34.902 --> 00:07:36.712
If you think about what's going to happen,

00:07:36.712 --> 00:07:37.732
psychologically,

00:07:37.732 --> 00:07:39.354
so Bank A, if you were to,

00:07:39.354 --> 00:07:40.315
let's say that, you know,

00:07:40.315 --> 00:07:42.419
if you were to just
switch these toxic CDOs,

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:44.819
and if you were to just
turn that back into cash

00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:46.047
because the government just bought it,

00:07:46.047 --> 00:07:48.902
for exactly what Bank A says it's worth.

00:07:48.902 --> 00:07:50.425
If you just turn this into cash,

00:07:50.425 --> 00:07:51.691
the question is,

00:07:51.691 --> 00:07:54.525
is Bank A all of a sudden
going to start lending?

00:07:54.525 --> 00:07:55.895
And there's a couple of
things to think about

00:07:55.895 --> 00:07:57.430
because besides that toxic CDO,

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.394
there were other things
on its balance sheet,

00:07:59.394 --> 00:08:01.487
and frankly, a lot of these
things are starting to

00:08:01.487 --> 00:08:04.035
starting to get a little bit toxic.

00:08:04.035 --> 00:08:05.773
No one's really talking
about them right now

00:08:05.773 --> 00:08:08.044
because if you have a
dead skunk in your house,

00:08:08.044 --> 00:08:10.579
you're not going to notice
the milk's gone bad,

00:08:10.579 --> 00:08:12.895
so essentially, you have a lot of assets

00:08:12.895 --> 00:08:14.084
on your balance sheet right here,

00:08:14.084 --> 00:08:15.864
that if you're a prudent bank manager,

00:08:15.864 --> 00:08:16.899
you're going to see,

00:08:16.899 --> 00:08:17.486
you're going to say,

00:08:17.486 --> 00:08:18.895
"Boy, I should just keep that cash

00:08:18.895 --> 00:08:20.881
"because if these turn toxic

00:08:20.881 --> 00:08:22.982
"because the economy
might be turning south

00:08:22.982 --> 00:08:24.019
"or for whatever reason,

00:08:24.019 --> 00:08:25.532
"I should just hold onto that cash

00:08:25.532 --> 00:08:26.733
"so that I don't go bankrupt."

00:08:26.733 --> 00:08:28.936
So everyone is in complete survival mode,

00:08:28.936 --> 00:08:29.900
even the good banks.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.037
If somehow you were to give them capital

00:08:32.037 --> 00:08:34.765
and Paulson's new version
of the plan is that

00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:37.113
essentially, they'll inject
equity, so buy stocks.

00:08:37.113 --> 00:08:38.779
If you buy stock, you'll essentially

00:08:38.779 --> 00:08:42.582
make this pie bigger
and put some cash here,

00:08:43.181 --> 00:08:45.093
but even this guy, the good bank,

00:08:45.093 --> 00:08:47.114
it's not so clear to me that
he'll actually start lending.

00:08:47.114 --> 00:08:48.615
Everyone is in survival mode.

00:08:48.615 --> 00:08:50.625
This isn't a time to make new loans

00:08:50.625 --> 00:08:51.813
and take on new risks.

00:08:51.813 --> 00:08:53.618
Rick: So it seems like
the government went in,

00:08:53.618 --> 00:08:54.476
and they had decided,

00:08:54.476 --> 00:08:55.398
"You know what we're gonna do?

00:08:55.398 --> 00:08:56.826
"We're gonna go in there
and help these guys out,

00:08:56.826 --> 00:08:57.969
"and as soon as we help them out,

00:08:57.969 --> 00:08:59.598
"everybody will realize that now they have

00:08:59.598 --> 00:09:00.765
"the government's backing,

00:09:00.765 --> 00:09:03.749
"so other people will be
interested in helping them.

00:09:03.749 --> 00:09:05.638
"More people will give them their money."

00:09:05.638 --> 00:09:07.539
That hasn't worked.

00:09:07.539 --> 00:09:09.978
The people and other investors

00:09:09.978 --> 00:09:11.228
haven't bought into that.

00:09:11.228 --> 00:09:14.517
When we come back, I
want to hear your idea

00:09:14.517 --> 00:09:16.861
of what, perhaps, the
government should have done

00:09:16.861 --> 00:09:19.914
or could still do to rescue this.

00:09:19.914 --> 00:09:21.560
It's unique. It's different.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.901
You and I had talked about it earlier,

00:09:22.901 --> 00:09:24.470
but I want you to be able to share it

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:25.590
with our viewers.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:26.903
Also, Curveball,

00:09:26.903 --> 00:09:28.425
the story that we've
been telling you about.

00:09:28.425 --> 00:09:30.979
This is gonna be a CNN
exclusive to this hour

00:09:30.979 --> 00:09:32.796
about one particular individual who

00:09:32.796 --> 00:09:34.479
no one has ever talked to before.

00:09:34.479 --> 00:09:36.527
He only speaks German and Arab.

00:09:36.527 --> 00:09:39.031
You'll hear his conversation here

00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:39.978
in the next 10 minutes.

00:09:39.978 --> 00:09:42.657
Stay with us. We'll be right back.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.248
(lively music)

00:09:54.385 --> 00:09:55.415
All right, so we understand now

00:09:55.415 --> 00:09:57.306
what actually is broken.

00:09:57.306 --> 00:09:58.985
We've got a sense of what the government

00:09:58.985 --> 00:10:00.292
tried to do to fix it,

00:10:00.292 --> 00:10:01.783
but it doesn't seem to be working

00:10:01.783 --> 00:10:05.155
because enough people /
investors and regular folk

00:10:05.616 --> 00:10:06.816
don't seem to be buying into it.

00:10:07.308 --> 00:10:09.626
Let's bring in Sal Khan once again

00:10:09.626 --> 00:10:11.125
from the Khan Academy and talk about

00:10:11.125 --> 00:10:13.072
what may be done.

00:10:13.548 --> 00:10:15.567
Either A, would have
been the original plan

00:10:15.567 --> 00:10:16.782
that would have worked a lot better,

00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:19.702
or something we could still
do now, and that is ...

00:10:20.424 --> 00:10:21.506
Sal: So the big picture, just quick,

00:10:21.506 --> 00:10:22.488
going back to the big picture

00:10:22.488 --> 00:10:23.394
is that the financial system

00:10:23.394 --> 00:10:25.184
no one's lending through, right?

00:10:25.184 --> 00:10:25.736
Rick: Right.

00:10:25.736 --> 00:10:27.231
Sal: And every bailout plan so far,

00:10:27.231 --> 00:10:28.183
the government is just,

00:10:28.183 --> 00:10:30.399
it just keeps injecting money in

00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:31.417
either through loans,

00:10:31.417 --> 00:10:32.738
either through buying assets

00:10:32.738 --> 00:10:34.192
for maybe more than they're worth

00:10:34.192 --> 00:10:35.584
or now buying stock.

00:10:35.584 --> 00:10:37.926
and the logic here is

00:10:37.926 --> 00:10:39.295
maybe that'll start up the lending,

00:10:39.295 --> 00:10:41.180
but most probably any
new money that you put

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.101
into the system, to a large degree,

00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:45.486
is just going to go into survival mode

00:10:45.486 --> 00:10:46.901
or it's gonna go to essentially make up

00:10:46.901 --> 00:10:48.443
mistakes that have already been made.

00:10:48.443 --> 00:10:49.652
So, one idea,

00:10:49.652 --> 00:10:50.991
and this actually came
from a friend of mine,

00:10:50.991 --> 00:10:52.070
Todd Plutsky,

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:53.524
and I actually think it sounded crazy

00:10:53.524 --> 00:10:54.229
when he first said it,

00:10:54.229 --> 00:10:56.448
but it actually sounds
like a really good idea is

00:10:56.448 --> 00:10:58.208
take that 700 billion,

00:10:58.208 --> 00:11:00.062
and remember, the problem isn't,

00:11:00.062 --> 00:11:02.067
you're not trying to save
the financial system.

00:11:02.067 --> 00:11:03.699
You're trying to save the pipe

00:11:03.699 --> 00:11:05.852
that goes from the capital to the project.

00:11:05.852 --> 00:11:08.021
So why not take the 700 billion

00:11:08.021 --> 00:11:10.702
and capitalize a brand
new financial system?

00:11:11.409 --> 00:11:11.985
Rick: Hmm.

00:11:11.985 --> 00:11:15.087
Sal: And one thing that
Todd had pointed out,

00:11:15.087 --> 00:11:17.640
700 billion. It's an
astronomical amount of money.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.065
That's more than the
book value of the equity,

00:11:20.065 --> 00:11:21.547
book equity is this piece right here

00:11:21.547 --> 00:11:22.487
on the balance sheet,

00:11:22.487 --> 00:11:25.447
than JP Morgan, Morgan
Stanley, Goldman Sachs,

00:11:25.447 --> 00:11:28.509
Washington Mutual, Wachovia,
and Bank of America

00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:29.067
combined.

00:11:29.067 --> 00:11:30.564
So the government could overnight

00:11:30.564 --> 00:11:32.404
create banks bigger than those banks,

00:11:32.404 --> 00:11:34.316
although I don't think they
should concentrate it all

00:11:34.316 --> 00:11:35.500
in five or six banks.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.191
They should start up ...

00:11:36.191 --> 00:11:37.797
Rick: So in other words, you're saying

00:11:37.797 --> 00:11:40.447
why try and put money
into something that is

00:11:40.447 --> 00:11:42.394
so absolutely messed up?

00:11:42.394 --> 00:11:44.760
If they're half dead, let 'em die.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.481
Create a new system all together.

00:11:46.481 --> 00:11:47.779
But wouldn't that be a problem too?

00:11:47.779 --> 00:11:49.562
Because then wouldn't those banks be owned

00:11:49.562 --> 00:11:50.395
by the government?

00:11:50.395 --> 00:11:51.984
Do we want that?

00:11:51.984 --> 00:11:54.401
Sal: No, and this is a solution.

00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:56.006
First of all, just to make a point clear,

00:11:56.006 --> 00:11:57.827
Paulson's current solution

00:11:57.827 --> 00:11:59.466
involves government ownership.

00:11:59.466 --> 00:12:00.701
This plan, what you could do is,

00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:02.563
the government could capitalize the banks,

00:12:02.563 --> 00:12:04.904
maybe 20 or 30 banks around the country

00:12:04.904 --> 00:12:07.736
with the $700 billion, and
then each of those banks

00:12:07.736 --> 00:12:09.520
could have 300 million shares,

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.200
and they could give one
share to every American.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:12.955
Rick: New banks.

00:12:12.955 --> 00:12:14.568
New, totally new banks.

00:12:14.568 --> 00:12:15.728
Interesting.

00:12:15.728 --> 00:12:17.571
Sal Khan, thanks so much.

00:12:17.571 --> 00:12:18.644
We'll keep you on.

00:12:18.644 --> 00:12:19.481
We're gonna be talking about this

00:12:19.481 --> 00:12:20.657
throughout the hour, obviously.

00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:22.048
We're trying to get people to

00:12:22.048 --> 00:12:23.818
explain some of these things for us,

00:12:23.818 --> 00:12:25.703
and what's the market doing right now?

00:12:25.703 --> 00:12:26.405
Let's put that,

00:12:26.405 --> 00:12:28.895
let's make that as big
as we can possibly can.

00:12:28.895 --> 00:12:31.157
Down 71, a lot better
than we were looking at

00:12:31.157 --> 00:12:32.040
an hour ago.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.961
Maybe you've helped, Sal,
in some ways, hopefully.

00:12:35.961 --> 00:12:36.901
All right. We're gonna come back to that

00:12:36.901 --> 00:12:37.837
in just a little bit,

00:12:37.837 --> 00:12:39.171
but obviously one of the key stories

00:12:39.171 --> 00:12:40.295
that we've been saving for you today,

00:12:40.295 --> 00:12:41.830
the story of Curveball,

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.087
the man who seemed to
have been the source,

00:12:44.087 --> 00:12:46.519
so the influence in the invasion of Iraq.

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:48.864
As we expected, Sal
Khan is a bit of a hit.

00:12:48.864 --> 00:12:50.697
Does things kind of
differently, doesn't he?

00:12:50.697 --> 00:12:52.452
and, a lot of you have a lot of comments,

00:12:52.452 --> 00:12:53.414
a lot of questions for him,

00:12:53.414 --> 00:12:55.202
including this one.

00:12:55.202 --> 00:12:56.433
Let's go ahead and take a Twitter board,

00:12:56.433 --> 00:12:57.573
if we possibly can.

00:12:57.573 --> 00:12:59.944
This one comes in from sanchfan.

00:12:59.944 --> 00:13:02.451
Yeah, he watches this show
a lot, like every day.

00:13:02.451 --> 00:13:04.268
He says, "Keep Khan talking!

00:13:04.268 --> 00:13:06.667
"Look, the market is going up!"

00:13:06.667 --> 00:13:08.568
Apparently, it had been. I
hadn't even noticed that.

00:13:08.568 --> 00:13:10.219
I was so engaged in the conversation.

00:13:10.219 --> 00:13:11.145
Let's do this real quick.

00:13:11.145 --> 00:13:13.073
I want to just step away
from this for a moment.

00:13:13.073 --> 00:13:14.230
Wolf Blitzer, thanks so much.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:15.317
Sal Khan standing by.

00:13:15.317 --> 00:13:17.221
Sal, tell us, if you could,

00:13:17.221 --> 00:13:18.648
I guess bring us back to basics.

00:13:18.648 --> 00:13:21.087
How are we being affected
by what we're seeing

00:13:21.087 --> 00:13:22.192
in the news every day,

00:13:22.192 --> 00:13:24.645
the credit crunch and the
situation with the market.

00:13:24.645 --> 00:13:25.365
Sal: Sure.

00:13:25.365 --> 00:13:27.322
If we don't unclog the credit system,

00:13:27.322 --> 00:13:29.515
we know that everyone's
gonna unlever their debt,

00:13:29.515 --> 00:13:31.169
so we're gonna have deleverage.

00:13:31.169 --> 00:13:31.701
Rick: Mm.

00:13:31.701 --> 00:13:32.602
Sal: That's essentially everyone

00:13:32.602 --> 00:13:33.817
unwinding their loans.

00:13:33.817 --> 00:13:35.764
Deleverage, and this is,
I think, a critical point

00:13:35.764 --> 00:13:37.323
because I think there's been a lot of

00:13:37.323 --> 00:13:38.619
misinformation out there.

00:13:38.619 --> 00:13:41.231
That actually contracts the money supply.

00:13:41.231 --> 00:13:42.104
So, a lot of people out there

00:13:42.104 --> 00:13:43.237
are worried about inflation,

00:13:43.237 --> 00:13:45.004
these deficits that lead to inflation,

00:13:45.004 --> 00:13:46.320
but when you have deleverage,

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.572
and this is what happened in Japan.

00:13:47.572 --> 00:13:48.745
This is what happened in the '30s,

00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:50.285
the money supply contracts.

00:13:50.285 --> 00:13:51.238
That's our printing press.

00:13:51.238 --> 00:13:52.532
Leverage is our printing press

00:13:52.532 --> 00:13:54.075
in a fractional reserve system.

00:13:54.075 --> 00:13:55.532
That's going to lead to deflation.

00:13:55.532 --> 00:13:58.792
So, i think a lot of
people are worried about

00:13:58.792 --> 00:13:59.754
are we going to see inflation,

00:13:59.754 --> 00:14:00.745
are we going to see deflation,

00:14:00.745 --> 00:14:03.168
and if we don't fix the problem,

00:14:03.168 --> 00:14:04.755
we're going to see what Japan saw,

00:14:04.755 --> 00:14:05.933
and we're going to see deflation,

00:14:05.933 --> 00:14:07.096
and so ...

00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:07.801
Rick: And deflation,

00:14:07.801 --> 00:14:09.038
deflation means what?

00:14:09.038 --> 00:14:10.337
Concretely, to me and you.

00:14:10.337 --> 00:14:12.921
Sal: Things get cheaper,
the opposite of inflation,

00:14:12.921 --> 00:14:16.287
so unfortunately, maybe
salaries will go down,

00:14:16.287 --> 00:14:18.287
but on the plus side, a lot of assets,

00:14:18.287 --> 00:14:19.525
you know, people buying a house,

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:20.953
they'll get cheaper, even.

00:14:20.953 --> 00:14:21.522
Rick: Got it.

00:14:21.522 --> 00:14:23.375
Sal: I know that probably
won't be a good thing

00:14:23.375 --> 00:14:24.397
in the short term.

00:14:24.397 --> 00:14:24.953
Rick: Yeah, exactly.

00:14:24.953 --> 00:14:26.899
Not with what the situation is right now.

00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:27.532
Thanks so much.

00:14:27.532 --> 00:14:28.732
Sal Khan, you've been a great guest.

00:14:28.732 --> 00:14:31.197
What an original way of
being able to explain things.

00:14:31.197 --> 00:14:32.828
We're gonna be right back
with the closing bell,

00:14:32.828 --> 23:59:59.999
which looks to be somewhere
in the middle of ...
