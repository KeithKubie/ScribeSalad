00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.500
If I look at the value for me as A, between cooperating and defecting

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.080
in this first column. It's minus one versus zero, right? Which number is bigger?

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.150
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH], zero.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.900
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.500
&gt;&gt; If I look at it in this column,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.810
it's minus 9 or minus 6. Which number's bigger?

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.920
&gt;&gt; Negative six.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.060
&gt;&gt; Right. In both cases, defecting is better

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.750
than cooperating. So in fact this choice, this strategy,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.300
dominates the other. In other words it is always better for me to defect than

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.020
cooperate. So I will never cooperate, ever.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.760
Because it's always better for me to defect.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.770
&gt;&gt; So fine. So I'll never cooperate ever. That'll show you.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.467
&gt;&gt; By exactly the same argument, minus

00:00:40.467 --> 00:00:43.512
one versus zero, minus nine versus minus

00:00:43.512 --> 00:00:46.420
six. Defecting is always better. B will

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.080
never cooperate. What's the only thing that's left?

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.930
&gt;&gt; Pain.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.090
&gt;&gt; Pain. This is called the Prisoner's Dilemma.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.670
&gt;&gt; Huh. You said it was simple, but it seems kind of evil.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.700
&gt;&gt; I didn't say it wasn't evil. Those

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.920
things aren't opposite of one another. It's not like

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.040
perfect versus hidden. Or pure versus mixed. It's

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.930
not easy versus evil [LAUGH]. Evil's often actually easier.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.000
&gt;&gt; It's easy and evil.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.060
&gt;&gt; So we're in a little depressing place

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.180
here, Michael. You claimed in the beginning, and

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.570
I agreed with you, that this is sort of the best option,

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.290
you want everyone to cooperate, because that's sort of what's best for the

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.830
group. But because defecting dominates cooperating both for A and B you're going

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.130
to end up here. At least if you reason about it that way.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I see that.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.360
&gt;&gt; Hence prisoner's dilemma. The only way

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.210
to break this is if somehow we could

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.120
communicate and collude with one another. So

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.370
that we could guarantee that we would both

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.780
choose to cooperate at the same time.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.700
&gt;&gt; So that wall? What about that wall? What if

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.050
you put a like a Skype connection or a Google hangout?

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.980
&gt;&gt; Well, if you were forced to say what you were going to say at the same

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.270
time, or somehow be able to punish someone

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.800
maybe for, you know not doing the right thing,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.750
then you might be able to make a

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.240
different decision. But for this very simple version where

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.390
I'm going to do it once, even if I could hear what you had to say, if one

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.820
of us, whichever one of us went first, the second

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.490
one would always be able to take advantage of that.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.790
&gt;&gt; I do find this kind of depressing.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.240
&gt;&gt; Yes, it's a dilemma. It's a true dilemma. So, this brings us to a more

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.530
general sort of strategy. This whole notion of

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.850
strict dominance, works in this case. But, you could

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.120
imagine very complicated large matrces where it may

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.360
not work. But it turns out there's a

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.880
generalization of this notion of dominance. That works

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.150
remarkably well. And that's what people tend to use

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.250
to try to solve these kinds of games, to find out what the

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.850
true value of a game is. So letme describe that for you, ok?

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:38.910
&gt;&gt; Okay.
