so the question is can distributed
 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.330
so the question is can distributed
ledger technology can blockchain

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:09.340
ledger technology can blockchain
 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.249
ledger technology can blockchain
technology be used to fight fake news

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:11.259
technology be used to fight fake news
 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:15.209

right and I you know it's funny I view

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219
right and I you know it's funny I view
 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:16.920
right and I you know it's funny I view
distributed ledger technology is the

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930
distributed ledger technology is the
 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.710
distributed ledger technology is the
closest thing we have in the technology

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720
closest thing we have in the technology
 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.810
closest thing we have in the technology
field to being able to say something is

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820
field to being able to say something is
 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.890
field to being able to say something is
a fact right

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900
a fact right
 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.900
a fact right
they've we've recorded a Bitcoin

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910
they've we've recorded a Bitcoin
 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.269
they've we've recorded a Bitcoin
transaction right essentially we have an

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279
transaction right essentially we have an
 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.009
transaction right essentially we have an
entire network witnessing that I have

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:29.019
entire network witnessing that I have
 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.259
entire network witnessing that I have
sent you you know some number of Bitcoin

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269
sent you you know some number of Bitcoin
 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.020
sent you you know some number of Bitcoin
right or some number of a digital asset

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030
right or some number of a digital asset
 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.289
right or some number of a digital asset
a huge number and now I can't deny that

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:37.299
a huge number and now I can't deny that
 

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:39.630
a huge number and now I can't deny that
I made that transaction and you can't

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640
I made that transaction and you can't
 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.549
I made that transaction and you can't
deny that I made that transaction right

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559
deny that I made that transaction right
 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.829
deny that I made that transaction right
and that there's that that is a really

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839
and that there's that that is a really
 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:45.840
and that there's that that is a really
powerful thing in a way it's it's kind

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850
powerful thing in a way it's it's kind
 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.399
powerful thing in a way it's it's kind
of like the Wikipedia when somebody puts

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:47.409
of like the Wikipedia when somebody puts
 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:49.140
of like the Wikipedia when somebody puts
something in there and everyone has seen

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150
something in there and everyone has seen
 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.579
something in there and everyone has seen
that and if it's wrong it gets removed

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589
that and if it's wrong it gets removed
 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:52.680
that and if it's wrong it gets removed
that's something as well that's coming

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690
that's something as well that's coming
 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.009
that's something as well that's coming
to be accepted as as factual right and

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019
to be accepted as as factual right and
 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:57.719
to be accepted as as factual right and
so I think the possibility of using

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:57.729
so I think the possibility of using
 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:00.840
so I think the possibility of using
distributed Ledger's to record data that

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850
distributed Ledger's to record data that
 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.289
distributed Ledger's to record data that
is of a really high quality because it's

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299
is of a really high quality because it's
 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.120
is of a really high quality because it's
being recorded when it happens is being

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130
being recorded when it happens is being
 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.680
being recorded when it happens is being
witnessed by a large number of people

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690
witnessed by a large number of people
 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.500
witnessed by a large number of people
who and and thus made undeniable

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510
who and and thus made undeniable
 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.980
who and and thus made undeniable
immutable in this ledger right we can we

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990
immutable in this ledger right we can we
 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.840
immutable in this ledger right we can we
have a chance at creating a body of data

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850
have a chance at creating a body of data
 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.540
have a chance at creating a body of data
that can come to be trusted in a way

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550
that can come to be trusted in a way
 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.550
that can come to be trusted in a way
that data normally can't think about the

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560
that data normally can't think about the
 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.070
that data normally can't think about the
debate over climate change right there's

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080
debate over climate change right there's
 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.840
debate over climate change right there's
not only been attacks on do you have the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850
not only been attacks on do you have the
 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.460
not only been attacks on do you have the
right weather model you know are you

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470
right weather model you know are you
 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.380
right weather model you know are you
really showing this but but attacks on

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390
really showing this but but attacks on
 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.910
really showing this but but attacks on
the fundamental collection of that data

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920
the fundamental collection of that data
 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.070
the fundamental collection of that data
in the first place right imagine if

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080
in the first place right imagine if
 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.520
in the first place right imagine if
instead of debating whether you know you

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530
instead of debating whether you know you
 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.810
instead of debating whether you know you
had the right data or I had the right

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820
had the right data or I had the right
 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.149
had the right data or I had the right
data or a piece of data goes missing or

an entire data set goes missing when

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290
an entire data set goes missing when
 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.110
an entire data set goes missing when
there's a change in political

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120
there's a change in political
 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.330
there's a change in political
administration let's say right instead

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340
administration let's say right instead
 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.310

of that imagine if instead you know we

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320
of that imagine if instead you know we
 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.630
