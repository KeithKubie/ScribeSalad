STEVEN ROTHSTEIN:
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.580
It's my great
pleasure to introduce

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.690
Eric, recently from
Citizen Schools.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.770
I met Eric about five
or six years ago.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.780
And there were two things
that really stood out.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.510
I was there at Citizen
Schools because we

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.244
had several volunteers
from Google who had really

00:00:27.244 --> 00:00:29.160
engaged with the program
and was very excited.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.340
And I was told
hey, why don't you

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.550
reach out and find out
what they're doing?

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.716
And there were two things
that struck me right away.

00:00:33.716 --> 00:00:37.580
One is how incredibly
analytic they are.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.010
And they talk about
measures and outcomes,

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.190
and it was like I was at Google.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.410
It was really interesting.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.750
And then the second thing
was, everybody was amazing,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.100
Eric himself included.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.130
It's just an amazing
group of people.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.590
And I felt like I was
at home, even though I

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.906
wasn't inside
Google at the time.

00:00:57.906 --> 00:01:00.030
We started to have a closer
and closer relationship

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.130
with Citizen Schools.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.790
We became one of the biggest
contributor of volunteers

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:10.590
to the program, the after school
program, extended learning.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.375
And I really felt good about
the work that we had done.

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:17.625
And then I personally got
involved in public education

00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:20.295
and wanting to change it to
introduce computer science.

00:01:20.295 --> 00:01:23.600
And I really learned
how amazingly difficult

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.180
is to change public education.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.290
And so if there are two things
that stand out now about Eric,

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.160
one is the incredible courage
it takes to have a vision

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.270
and turn it into a
program that you really

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.790
want to institute major change
in how education is done.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.330
And not just turning
around schools,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.120
but actually engaging
broadly with schools.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.690
And the second piece
is the tenacity.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.860
I think he founded Citizen
Schools in '95 I think.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.832
So that's almost 20
years of working on this.

00:02:01.832 --> 00:02:03.540
And I just think the
commitment that that

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.320
takes with such a difficult
program of introducing

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.479
something truly new into
the public school systems

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.978
is amazing.

00:02:09.978 --> 00:02:12.750
And it's not just something
that's going on in Boston.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.990
It's not something that's just
going on in Massachusetts.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.710
It's going on in several
states across the country.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.490
And scaling the
organization's what's

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.840
really the big
initiative right now.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.260
So he's written a book called
"The Opportunity Equation."

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.660
It wasn't the easiest name.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.100
It wasn't my first choice.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.070
But the book is available
to you for $10 over here,

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.500
which is a subsidized price.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.190
Obviously it's available
on Google Play.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.030
Google Books is a phenomenal
place to read digital content.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.240
So at some point, that would be
a good consideration as well.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.261
It's my great pleasure to
introduce Eric Schwarz.

00:02:47.261 --> 00:02:52.182
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:52.182 --> 00:02:53.390
ERIC SCHWARZ: That's awesome.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.990
Steven, thank you so much.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.930
I learned from
Steven many things

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.070
about data, about heart,
building a great culture.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.720
Learned that you could wear
jeans to work every day too.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.320
Now that I've moved on from the
CEO role of Citizen Schools,

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.140
I'm getting more
comfortable with.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.840
But I want to thank, before
getting into the book

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.980
and what it's
about, thank really

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.830
the people of Google,
which is what's

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.080
made this relationship amazing.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.550
And we've built a
relationship that

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.175
started in Mountain View,
grew here in Cambridge,

00:03:25.175 --> 00:03:27.050
was really the next
place where it took hold,

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.392
and now it's in New York,
and Chicago, and other parts

00:03:30.392 --> 00:03:31.350
of the country as well.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.090
And we've had probably
about 1,000 Googlers,

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.680
many in this office,
others across the country,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.810
who've gotten involved.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.440
And the heart
connection as well as

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.140
the brain connection to
the work has been awesome.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.780
I hope it is a growing
experience for the Googlers

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.610
who mentor kids in
Citizen Schools.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.520
I know it is for the students
as I saw an email this morning

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.210
with Alan Su, who is a
colleague with many of you

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.780
here in Cambridge who was one
of the early volunteers here.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.260
He's out in Seattle now
working with you guys.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.570
And he said he misses a
lot of things about Boston.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.434
He didn't mentioned
you, Steve, but he

00:04:08.434 --> 00:04:10.850
said he misses a lot of things
about Cambridge and Boston.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.690
And one of the main things
is his participation

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.145
in citizen schools.

00:04:15.145 --> 00:04:16.720
But I want to thank Steven.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.160
And Steven needs to go to have
a conversation with the head

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.770
of the state network of
superintendents as part

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.270
of the work he's
doing in education.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.689
So appreciate you being
here to do the introduction.

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:30.480
Coming a little bit
later is another person

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.580
I want to think
just in absentia,

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.670
and that's Steven Rothstein,
who is as of two days

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.050
ago, the new CEO
of Citizen Schools.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.520
And I have been laboring on
this for almost 20 years.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.480
And it's been a labor
of love, and I'm

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.800
staying involved on
the board, but going on

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.360
to start a new venture
in higher education.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.070
But it is so satisfying
and gratifying

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.560
to be able to pass the baton
to a really skilled leader who

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.170
started Citizens Energy with Joe
Kennedy some 20 plus years ago,

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.100
ran Perkins School
for the Blind,

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.390
and grew it into the largest
international organization

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.140
focused on blindness education.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.515
So at the end of this you'll
get a chance to meet Steven,

00:05:09.515 --> 00:05:12.520
and he's terrific.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.684
So a couple things
about the book

00:05:15.684 --> 00:05:17.600
"The Opportunity Equation"--
I think the title

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.220
was that difficult,
but Steven did.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.060
There's true issues,
two mega trends

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.940
that the book is responding
to and the Citizen Schools

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:30.720
is responding to.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.580
And the first mega trend
is a dramatically growing,

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.390
fast growing gap
between the achievement

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.090
of upper and lower income kids.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.900
And even over the
last 50 years as we've

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.650
been able to reduce
somewhat the achievement

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.700
gap in this country based on
race, it's still way too big.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.900
But it's half the size
it was 50 years ago.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.990
The gap in reading
skills, in math skills,

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.270
in college graduation rates
between upper and lower income

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.990
kids has gotten not a little
bit bigger, but twice as big.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.850
So there's a lot of
books about that.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.250
There's books about that, but
that's an underlying theme

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.620
that the book
ultimately addresses.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.640
The second underlying
theme that sort of

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.890
talk about in the
introduction of the book

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.820
is the greater consequence
for the country

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.650
and for individuals of
that growing inequality.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.450
And when I grew up, the benefit
of getting a college education

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.820
versus a high school
education was actually

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.390
somewhat modest in terms
of your lifelong earnings.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.905
You earned about
25% or 30% more.

00:06:39.905 --> 00:06:42.280
Someone with a high school
graduate and a good work ethic

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.040
could get a good job, and
join the middle class,

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.440
and buy a house.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.940
And that's generally
not true today.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.050
And today, a college
graduate earns twice as much

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.910
as a high school graduate.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.070
So the consequence
for individuals

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.890
is much greater for this
growing education gap.

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.910
And the fact that
for low income kids

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.560
the college graduation
rate has grown

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.940
from 6% a generation
ago to just 8%

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.960
today while it's almost
doubled for upper income kids

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.830
has huge consequences for
individuals and our country.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.450
McKinsey, the consulting
firm, estimates

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:21.640
that we have a 3% to 5%
permanent recession imposed

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.990
on our economy by the
fact that we're not

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.831
able to lift up low income kids
to where their middle income

00:07:26.831 --> 00:07:27.330
peers are.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.409
Steven, how are you?

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:29.950
Just introduced you
in absentia, this

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:34.380
is Steven Rothstein, new
CEO of Citizen Schools.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.290
So those are some of
the underlying themes

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.290
that the book addresses.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.550
But what's the book's about is
well, what's causing this gap?

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:45.054
What is causing this
dramatically larger achievement

00:07:45.054 --> 00:07:47.470
gap that I think is really
undermining the American dream,

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.590
and presents real
challenges for this country

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:53.575
in the next
generation and beyond?

00:07:53.575 --> 00:07:56.150
And there have been
two major theories

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.150
about what's causing
the growing gap.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.250
And the first is just poverty,
the growing economic gap

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.490
and poverty.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:06.450
And while it's true that
poverty is highly correlated

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.021
to lower educational
outcomes, I don't

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:10.770
think it's right to
say that that's really

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.960
the cause of the
gap because there

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.760
are so many examples of
students living in poverty who,

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.480
when provided with the right
assets and the right resources

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.340
in learning, blossom and
achieve at high levels,

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.840
and do move on to
finish high school,

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.660
finish college at the same rates
as their middle income peers.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:35.280
And Citizen Schools is
one great example of that.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.530
The other theory that's
out there as to what's

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:41.130
causing this sort
of achievement gap

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.440
is that it's teachers,
and bad teachers,

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.860
and teachers' unions
undermining our public schools.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.860
But in both these cases,
the poverty explanation

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.110
and the teacher
explanation, while they're

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.440
challenges we have
to wrestle with,

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.880
if you really
examine the issues,

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.130
it doesn't add up that would
be causing the growing gap.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.380
Poor kids are not
learning less than they

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.940
were 20, or 30, or 40 years ago.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.000
They're actually learning
a little bit more.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.780
But upper income kids
are learning much more.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.460
And unions aren't
stronger, and teachers

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.680
aren't worse or less
qualified than they

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.360
were 20, or 30, or 40 years ago.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.470
My kids are getting
a great public school

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.890
education in Brookline.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:24.837
There's many, many schools
with unionized teachers

00:09:24.837 --> 00:09:26.295
in different kinds
of districts who

00:09:26.295 --> 00:09:28.580
are delivering a
great education.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:34.120
The real difference I
think is that a whole array

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.400
of leadership and
learning opportunities

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.830
that upper income kids
are getting out of school.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.650
So that's really what
the book is about,

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:48.050
is looking at front from
birth to age four, five,

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:51.140
six, seven years old, upper
income kids increasingly

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.020
in just the last
generation getting

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:58.050
enrolled in Russian math
classes and Kumon math classes,

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.300
getting involved as they're
seven, eight, nine, twelve

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.340
years old in special enrichment
programs, robotics camps.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.910
My daughter, as an
11-year-old, went last summer

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.820
for 3 and 1/2 weeks
to Argentina and was

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.220
singing across the country.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:14.640
And she wrote back and
said dad, this is the life.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.020
I'm getting asked
for autographs,

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.770
I'm traveling around in a
bus, I'm like a rock star.

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:22.930
And that's a cool experience
as an 11-year-old girl.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:24.440
And that was
something we paid for,

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.930
and we organized, and got her
into that singing program.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.850
My son this summer went to
Germany with a basketball team

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.880
and got to tour around the
country, and visit Dachau.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.500
And that's an
incredible experience.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:40.400
So the book chronicles
this dazzling array

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.900
of extra learning opportunities
that kids like mine,

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.060
and the kids in
communities like Brookline,

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.970
and many kids in
Cambridge take for granted

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:53.320
and are driving a bigger
and bigger achievement gap.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:11:00.360
And it's academics, but it's
also participation in church.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.520
30 years ago, low income
kids were actually

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.150
more likely to go to
church or synagogue

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.710
and have the social capital
that comes with that.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.290
Today, upper income
kids are 50% more

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:14.240
likely to be on church
on any given weekend.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.280
And with that column
social capital,

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.270
with that comes
connections that help

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:23.040
move you through high
school and through college.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:23.860
It's jobs.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.550
When I grew up, my wife, and
I talk about her a little bit

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:30.220
in the book, I'd grown up as
a privileged kid in New York

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.980
with a huge number
of opportunities.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.060
She grew up a first generation
immigrant, very low income

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.340
family in Hudson, Massachusetts.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:40.420
And she started working at age
11 in different summer jobs

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.540
and lied about her age to get
other summer jobs after having

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.790
a paper route, had
about 10 jobs before she

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.080
went to Tufts where
she graduated.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.430
And that ladder of opportunity
is increasingly not

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:52.950
there for lower income kids.

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.010
It's 1/3 of kids today
who work in the summer

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.500
in their teenage years
as opposed to 2/3.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.800
Upper income kids
get internships.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.350
They find a way to
get a connection.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.660
They get an unpaid internship
at Citizen Schools, or Google,

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.790
or elsewhere, and
that helps drive them

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.280
ahead to greater places.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.420
And for lower
income kids, they're

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.360
not always getting
access to that.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.560
So the book's a lot about that.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.470
I use several vehicles to
get at that idea of what

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.500
I call an opportunity
equation, that when

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.090
you put in front of kids this
vast array of opportunities

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.610
out of school it, with almost
mathematical precision,

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.200
leads those kids to success.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.005
And first couple
chapters of the book

00:12:32.005 --> 00:12:37.710
are from my own story,
which is a story of a shock

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:42.180
and awe of persistent
opportunity overcoming

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.060
early failure, that
was quite persistent

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.580
as well in my life as
a terrible student,

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.200
but got so many
opportunities out

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.630
of school that helped
me move through that.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:54.780
Talk a little bit about my
wife, the opportunity she had.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.390
And then really, the next
part, or the first half

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.348
of the book, most of the
first half of the book

00:12:59.348 --> 00:13:01.476
is about the development
of Citizen Schools

00:13:01.476 --> 00:13:03.100
and the great work
that we've done here

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.610
in Boston and across
the country lifting up

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:10.760
opportunity, and really
providing for low income

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:15.660
kids what upper income kids take
for granted, which is as simple

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:20.610
an explanation of what Citizen
Schools does as there is.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:25.010
You guys from Google, teaming
up with AmeriCorps members,

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:27.660
teaming up with financial
advisors with Fidelity,

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.870
and grandmothers
who know how to sew,

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.886
coming together, helping
kids be successful,

00:13:32.886 --> 00:13:34.260
helping kids have
lots of chances

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:39.030
to participate in
great careers and learn

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.800
about all kinds of opportunities
that they didn't even know

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.050
were out there, much
less available to them.

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.310
So I want to share a couple
excerpts from the book,

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:51.860
and this first one is about one
of our early Citizen teachers,

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.310
a man named Joel.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.810
And we've had Citizen
teachers in rocket science,

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.690
and journalism, and
financial wizardry,

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.560
and many people doing
Android apps and other things

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.800
here at Google.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.890
Joel was a carpenter.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:07.330
Joel Bennett had a
gentle smile, and a truck

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.560
full of saws, vice grips,
files, and other tools

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.860
to use in a burgeoning carpentry
and cabinet making business.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.217
And Joel's business
was stable, and he

00:14:16.217 --> 00:14:18.050
liked the feeling of
tangible accomplishment

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:20.650
he got from working with wood.

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.270
But when he met
Stephanie Davilosa

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.690
at a community
event near his home

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:25.800
in Boston's Jamaica
Plain's section,

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.270
Joel volunteered
that he'd always

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:30.260
been curious about teaching.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.730
Sometimes after completing
yet another kitchen renovation

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:36.480
or set of built in
bookcases for a home office,

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.410
he wondered if teaching children
might be a more satisfying way

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:41.420
to spend his days.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:44.160
Citizen Schools became a way to
dip his toe into the education

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.830
world, and he signed up to
teach a carpentry apprenticeship

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:49.700
in the spring of 1996.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.860
That spring, we offered
a Saturday program

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:53.900
at Dorchester's
Woodrow Wilson School

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.820
four blocks from the
Victorian fixer upper Maureen

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.900
and I were soon to buy
in nearby Ashmont Hill.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.030
We enrolled 64 students and
offered eight apprenticeships

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:05.620
in the morning followed
by various field trips

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.150
and learning activities
in the afternoon.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.990
Joel's team of young
carpenters set out

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:12.930
to produce high quality
carpenter's tool boxes.

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.300
They measured them,
cut them, sanded them,

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.970
shellaced them, the whole thing.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:19.950
The kids learned plenty.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:23.130
Those of us observing
learned a couple things too.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.170
For starters, we learned
that a few the kids

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:27.980
didn't know how
to measure at all.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.170
In the second week, Joel
asked a seventh grader

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:33.630
named Kiehl to cut a
piece of wood in half.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.070
And Kiehl said, half?

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:38.160
What's half?

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.155
Kiehl was getting B's at the
Woodrow Wilson Middle School,

00:15:41.155 --> 00:15:43.500
and he didn't know
what half meant.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.610
I couldn't believe it.

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.750
Joel broke down the
concept of half.

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:49.930
I remember him folding
a piece of paper

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:52.800
and then measuring his
two feet compared to one

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.280
before pulling
out a tape measure

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.040
and actually addressing
the piece of wood at hand.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.470
Kiehl and Joel cut the
piece of wood together,

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:01.650
then they moved forward.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:04.540
Francisco was another young
boy in the apprenticeship.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:08.050
He was 11, and a recent
immigrant from Central America.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:11.340
His toolbox was a
beautiful piece of work.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:14.324
Around week nine, the kids were
planning their presentations

00:16:14.324 --> 00:16:15.990
and deciding what
their tool boxes would

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:18.620
be used for, gifts
to their moms,

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.955
or just additions to their
own personal work spaces.

00:16:21.955 --> 00:16:24.970
And Joel had noticed that
on the side of his toolbox,

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:30.320
Fransisco had written,
"Miguel" in big, block letters.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.680
Joel hadn't heard him
talk about a Miguel.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.640
So he asked him,
Francisco, who's Miguel?

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.310
I thought you were keeping
this or giving it to your mom.

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:41.740
Miguel's this old man who
lives in my neighborhood,

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.170
said Francisco.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.370
He's always doing
nice things for me.

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.080
He gets me ice cream.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.990
Last summer, he took me
out to a baseball game.

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.270
I've never had anything
to give to him,

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:56.460
so I'm going to give
this toolbox to Miguel.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:59.340
Francisco's story has
stuck with me ever since.

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.700
Even after telling his
story dozens of times,

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.520
I still get goosebumps
imagining Francisco

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.760
presenting his
toolbox to Miguel.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.920
Our society embraces the giving
of gifts to our children,

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.089
but kids want the chance
to give gifts too.

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:17.160
Kids who grew up with the
privilege of private classes

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.359
in ceramics, jewelry,
woodworking, or even music

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:23.160
have plenty of
chances to be givers

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.230
of presence they
created themselves.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.490
Providing kids the chance to
be makers of things, not just

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:35.120
consumers, is an important part
of the opportunity equation.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.110
So Joel actually went
to teach a number

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:38.770
of additional
apprenticeships, and then

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:43.920
actually did become a teacher
in the Boston public schools,

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.920
which is not our goal.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.750
We think it's fantastic for
folks to stay at Google,

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.590
or stay as carpenters.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:55.300
But we also think it's a cool
avenue into teaching as well.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.940
So I want to read, I have to
read at least a brief passage

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.610
about someone from
Google who's volunteered.

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:05.650
So I want to read a little
bit about Alan Sue who

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:07.370
was one of a number
of volunteers

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:11.510
who taught many, many classes
at the Edwards Middle School

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:14.730
in Charlestown, which was the
beginning of Citizen School's

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.360
effort to move from an
after school program

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.230
where we worked with 50
or 70 kids in a school.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:22.660
It made a big
difference for them,

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.700
but didn't fundamentally
change the school to what we

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:30.070
call an expanded learning
time school model.

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:34.060
Every kid in the school moves
from getting out at 1:30,

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.410
which believe it or not,
is when Boston kids get out

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:40.360
for the day, to getting
out at 4:30 or 5:00.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.520
So we're now doing that in 30
schools around the country.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.170
And that started at
the Edwards School,

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:49.110
and Google was a
big, big part of it.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:51.610
Equally, and the school went
from being literally the lowest

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:54.540
performing school in Boston
to the highest in a three year

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:59.280
period from 17 families,
choosing at 450 families,

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.934
choosing at a total
transformation.

00:19:02.934 --> 00:19:05.100
Equally important factors
in the school's turnaround

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.910
were the hundreds of
volunteer citizen teachers

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:11.850
who led apprenticeship courses,
people like David Mantis.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:14.870
Mantis taught rocket science
seven times at the Edwards,

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:16.670
forging hundreds
of relationships

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.940
with students like Adam Beriga.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.990
Tony Healey is the
retired businessman

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:23.910
who advised Principal Sabin in
the early years of the Edward's

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:28.280
turnaround, taught astronomy
at Citizen Schools 15 times,

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.470
including multiple
times at Edwards.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:33.720
And Alan Sue, a whiz kid
engineer at Google's Cambridge

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:37.050
office, taught computer
programming classes five times

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:38.950
at the Eddie.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.290
So if you know Alan, tell
him he's a whiz kid engineer

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:42.760
if he didn't know it already.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.920
Sue is such a talent that even
as a relatively young engineer,

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.320
Google tapped him to
help lead the team that

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.450
made YouTube, a Google
subsidiary, faster,

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:55.070
helping the company live stream
every event at the 2012 London

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.520
Olympics.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.150
But teaching was tougher
than Sue expected.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.500
He taught his first
apprenticeship at the Edwards

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.440
the first year of
expanded learning time.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.110
And Sue remembers
feeling a little naive

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:09.000
when he realized the web design
curriculum he had put together

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.510
was over the heads of most
of the students in his class,

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:16.590
and that many of his student's
didn't seem motivated to learn.

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.130
Despite the challenge Sue
committed to teach again,

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:22.050
his next course involved
creation of a public service

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.650
app for the Android
phone, an app that

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:26.910
would enhance the
experience for participants

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:30.680
in First Night, a popular
Boston Arts Festival.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.880
The idea said Sue, was to make
First Night more interactive,

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.820
and to drive up attendance.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.167
You could imagine a clue
on the ice sculptures,

00:20:38.167 --> 00:20:40.000
and then people would
have to take a picture

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.040
to show they were there.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.930
The students learned the
basics of putting together

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.810
a user interface and basic
computer programming.

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:49.920
And by the time
they were done, they

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.150
had the bones of
a really cool app.

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:55.390
Susan's come back to
teach three more times,

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.060
and said he's seen a
transformation at the Edwards

00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.840
and in its students.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.760
It's palpable, the difference
in the attitude of the kids,

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.340
it's night and day.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.550
There's no more too
cool for school,

00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:10.640
and now the students see that
learning can be really fun.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.970
Sue said that his personal
motivation to volunteer's

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.380
grown too.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:17.180
The thing I love is the
combination of the boots

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.250
on the ground experience,
the experience

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:21.900
of introducing kids to
something out of the ordinary,

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:24.140
and helping them realize
that the web is not

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.570
just something to consume from.

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.840
They can be creators too.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.990
I love the combination of
getting to know the kids,

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:32.180
and also seeing the
results at the Edwards

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.200
which are incontrovertible.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.210
I also love that I have
a role in addressing

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:41.220
one of the greater
inequities in our society.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:44.290
Alan and all the volunteers
who've been involved

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:46.240
have done a ton to
address the inequities.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.280
And Citizen Schools
has now created

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.090
a proof point in
about 30 schools

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:54.950
across 11, 12 districts
around the country

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:58.940
where we're delivering similar
results or better results

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:02.640
to the top charter schools and
to top private schools in terms

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.984
of growth in student
learning per year.

00:22:05.984 --> 00:22:07.400
And the question,
and the question

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.030
of the second half of the book
is, how can we scale that?

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:12.670
And what really are the
key dimensions there,

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:15.570
and how do we grow both
through citizen schools

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.800
and other similar programs,
similar experiences

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.080
so that a generation
from now it can

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:24.457
be the new normal that all
kids in urban communities

00:22:24.457 --> 00:22:26.790
have a longer learning day,
that all kids have many more

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:30.990
mentors, that all kids have
every chance to discover

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:35.894
and achieve their dreams, which
is our mission, bless you.

00:22:35.894 --> 00:22:38.310
In the second half of the book,
we talk about five themes,

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:40.639
five building blocks
for student learning.

00:22:40.639 --> 00:22:42.180
And not going to go
into all of them,

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.600
but I'll read short passages
around one or two of them.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.230
But one of them is just
supporting teachers.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:50.350
Urban teachers work
incredibly hard.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:54.896
Middle school teachers might
have five classes of 30 kids.

00:22:54.896 --> 00:22:56.020
How do you talk to parents?

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.980
How do you build individual
relationships with kids?

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.374
When you have an AmeriCorps
member helping you out,

00:23:01.374 --> 00:23:03.290
it gives you a chance
to do pull out tutoring,

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:04.873
it gives you someone
who can reach out

00:23:04.873 --> 00:23:06.420
to the parents at
night, it gives you

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.930
someone who can get the
kids more motivated to learn

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:11.790
in their regular classes
because they see how math ties

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.980
into designing an app for the
Android phone, which is pretty

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:16.760
cool, and makes the
kid more motivated.

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.405
So there's a chapter about that.

00:23:18.405 --> 00:23:21.900
There's a chapter about social
capital and social skills.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.790
And we think of that as
maybe an exotic thing

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:27.010
that Robert Putnam
studies at Harvard.

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:30.400
But the truth is that social
capital and social skills

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:36.250
are at least as important as
math skills and writing skills

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.700
to getting ahead in
the work role today.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:43.260
But we haven't organized
schools to build those skills.

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.940
And Citizen Schools brings
a whole new dimension

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:48.310
into schools where in an
expanded learning time

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:51.290
environment, kids are
building their networks.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:53.095
They're learning how
to work with adults,

00:23:53.095 --> 00:23:54.960
they're learning how
to ask questions,

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.724
learning how to work with
teammates in different ways.

00:23:57.724 --> 00:23:59.890
There's a whole chapter in
the book about creativity

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:03.070
and the massive mismatch
in our education

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:06.940
system between teaching kids how
to repeat facts, which is still

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:10.400
most of what school's about, and
teaching kids how to innovate,

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.700
and create, and design
things where there's

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:15.830
no playbook, which is what
you guys do all the time,

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:17.460
and what most jobs
in the future,

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:20.140
most good jobs are
going to require.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:23.430
So how do you build the
skill to create and innovate?

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:24.460
You practice.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:25.850
But how do you practice?

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:27.356
You create when you're a kid.

00:24:27.356 --> 00:24:29.230
So Citizen Schools
through the apprenticeship

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:30.355
gives kids lots of chances.

00:24:30.355 --> 00:24:34.940
And we talk through the
whole chapter about that.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.560
The core underpinning of
the Citizen Schools idea

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:42.070
is the notion of more time,
more time for learning.

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:44.600
And Malcolm Gladwell's
idea is that sometimes you

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:48.020
just need those 10,000 hours
to get goo at anything.

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:50.570
And one of the biggest
differences between upper

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:54.340
and lower income kids is while
their school day is the same,

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:56.680
their learning day
is very different.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.275
My kids get out of
school at not 1:30,

00:24:59.275 --> 00:25:01.640
but 2:15 in the afternoon.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.410
But then they've got a lot
of supervised homework,

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:05.910
they've got all
kinds of enrichment,

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:08.710
all kinds of activities
in the afternoon.

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:10.280
So more time, I
think it just has

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.590
to become the new normal
in America's urban schools

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:15.670
that kids have a nine
or 10 hour learning day,

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:17.840
and we bring to them
all the enrichment

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.435
of their upper income
peers take for granted.

00:25:20.435 --> 00:25:23.980
I just want to read one
story about a particular kid

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:28.500
and some of the benefits
of a longer day.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.460
Extra time's particularly
important for English language

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:34.620
learners who need more chances
to use English in real world

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.950
context and for special
education students who often

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:41.330
need expert intervention
from trained professionals,

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:44.040
as well as more personal
attention and guidance,

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.340
and extra time to
master academic content.

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.930
But the extra time
can be stressful too,

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:53.640
adding more opportunity
for conflict and challenge.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.770
Tyrique, a special
needs student enrolled

00:25:55.770 --> 00:26:00.150
in one of our Boston ELT
schools, is a case in point.

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:02.740
In many ways, Tyrique fits
my favorite description

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:06.540
of a middle schooler as having
the full emotional range

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:12.290
of an Italian aria packed into
the attention span of a knat.

00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:16.020
Tyrique has the capacity to
show that full emotional range.

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.730
But when our staff
first encountered him

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:22.644
in the fall of 2012, most
of what we saw was anger.

00:26:22.644 --> 00:26:24.810
He spent most of his first
semester in middle school

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:27.760
getting kicked out of the
classroom at all times of day

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.290
for swearing, breaking
things, and fighting

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:32.580
with other students in
a separate education

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.280
group, the therapeutic
learning community.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.150
He could often be
seen storming down

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:41.150
the hallway to the timeout
room, paraprofessionals hurrying

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:44.340
behind to help him calm down
and redirect his behavior so

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.650
that he could reenter
the classroom.

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:49.210
Tyrique lacked the patience
and emotional skills

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:52.280
to cope with his frustration
in a healthy way,

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:55.220
and he lacked the desire
to do well in his classes.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.540
He ripped up tests
and broke pencils

00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:00.530
to avoid performing
academic tasks.

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:03.985
His grades and scores
were rock bottom.

00:27:03.985 --> 00:27:06.110
I've met a lot of kids like
Tyrique over the years,

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:09.590
and typically school does
not work out well for them.

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:11.970
They have emotional issues,
or attention issues,

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:14.870
or organizational issues,
or reading issues,

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:16.990
or all of the above.

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:19.080
For medical reasons
and sometimes because

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.650
of severe daily
trauma in their lives,

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:23.670
tasks like listening
to instructions,

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:26.340
and following directions,
and working in groups,

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:30.330
and doing multi-step
problems are really hard.

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:31.940
Some days they just can't do it.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.970
They're so angry they feel like
their head's going to explode.

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:37.140
And it gets even harder
because classmates

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:40.250
in their special needs
cluster have similar problems,

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:43.852
so they reinforce and add
to each other's challenges.

00:27:43.852 --> 00:27:45.310
Further, they all
noticed that they

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:47.870
are in the therapeutic learning
community, or the learning

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:51.430
adaptive behavior cluster, or
just the special needs class.

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:53.750
And they feel ashamed.

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.490
In the cafeteria,
other students call

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:57.390
them the dumb kids,
or the weird kids,

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:00.320
or used sped as an epithet
and avert their gaze

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.040
as they walk through.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.140
When they sign up for a
sports team, which is rare,

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:08.270
they often get kicked off the
team for yelling at the coach,

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:12.370
or not following a play, or
for some other transgression.

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:14.530
Tyrique's school had
some uncommonly good

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:16.270
special education teachers.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.990
But his lack of emotional
control and intense struggles

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:21.570
with executive function
were on full display

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:23.890
when he entered his
Citizen's Schools classroom

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:25.890
at the end of each
day last fall,

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:28.640
the first year of
mandatory expanded learning

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.339
time at the McCormick
Middle School.

00:28:31.339 --> 00:28:33.380
When he was assigned to
the soccer apprenticeship

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.740
on Thursday
afternoons, he refused

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:38.000
to enter the classroom
the first week.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.860
In the second week he
entered reluctantly,

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:42.770
unleashing a torrent
of curse words.

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:45.000
It was the same story
when guests would come in

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.730
to help teach the apprenticeship
such as Pat Kirby, then

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:51.250
the executive director of
Citizen Schools, Massachusetts.

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:53.000
Kirby, a college
level soccer player,

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.820
remembers casually ignoring
Tyrique's initial stream

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:58.890
of foul language, and
encouraging him to participate,

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:00.860
to share his knowledge
of sports statistics

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:02.690
and the play in the
scrimmage at the end

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:04.430
of the lesson,
something he'd never

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:06.750
done in any previous week.

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:09.950
Kirby arrived in the fourth
week of the apprenticeship,

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:11.470
and his presence
marked the first

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:13.920
in a series of turning
points for Tyrique.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.100
According to his Citizen's
School's team leader,

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.250
Tyrique talked about
his positive experience

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:20.950
in soccer all week long.

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:24.080
In a world devoid of
positive male role models,

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.510
Tyrique came to depend
on Kirby, his new mentor.

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:30.320
He started to open up in
his soccer apprenticeship

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.400
looking forward to it
each week, and earning

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:36.640
the title of Team MVP in the
final Wild Bowl Tournament.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:39.150
He went from literally
standing on the sidelines

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:41.630
of the game, reluctant
to enter the fray,

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:43.340
to running into the
chaos and helping

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.580
to score the winning goal.

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.630
In the spring, Tyrique rejoined
the soccer apprenticeship,

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:49.980
and served as the team captain.

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.710
He took his new
role very seriously,

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:55.100
rarely swearing, and
impressing teachers

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:58.070
with his growing emotional
maturity and his kindness

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:00.440
to other students on the field.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:03.980
For someone who initially seemed
unable to display any empathy,

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:07.370
actions he now took such as
using the word "we" to refer

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:10.970
to his teammates and helping
people up when they fell

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:12.890
were big developments.

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:14.680
Tyrique's improved
behavior started

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.170
to spread to his regular
Citizen School's team

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:20.920
too and eventually, to his
performance in the classroom.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.440
He started to
improve his grades.

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:25.000
And one day, when Pat
Kirby came in to visit him,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.430
Tyrique bragged about earning a
perfect score on a recent math

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:30.350
test.

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:32.460
Tyrique's only
hesitation in playing

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:35.570
on the soccer team in the spring
was missing the opportunity

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:37.430
to be in the camping
apprenticeship which

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:39.720
was held at the same time.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.970
To build on Tyrique's
momentum however,

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:44.920
Citizen Schools staff
agreed that after the soccer

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.680
apprenticeship
ended, he could join

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.700
in the last few
weeks of camping.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.740
And if his behavior
kept improving,

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:52.210
could participate
in the camping.

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:54.780
Wow, an authentic,
overnight camping

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:57.370
experience in the
Blue Hills Reservation

00:30:57.370 --> 00:31:00.550
about 10 miles outside Boston.

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:03.330
Tyrique was initially weary
of the many deprivations

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:05.250
involved in camping.

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:06.900
But when the
camping day came, he

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.730
was eventually
laughing and running

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:10.440
around with new friends.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.600
He recruited others
to watch the sunset

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.170
over Ponkapoag Pond,
which he described

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:16.830
as peaceful and beautiful.

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:19.010
He slept through the
night in his tent,

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:22.440
and completed an eight
mile hike the next day.

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.730
Tyrique told his team
leader during a quiet moment

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:26.860
on the trip that
during the past year,

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.790
having more time to work
with people like her

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:32.460
and Mr. Kirby helped
me work on my behavior.

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:36.050
And now Mr. White, the
coordinator of the TLC program,

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:39.600
wants me to do regular
education classes next year.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.830
She asked him, are you
scared for next year?

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:43.390
And he replied, no.

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:45.531
I already have friends
that are older than me,

00:31:45.531 --> 00:31:47.280
and he named several
of the other students

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:51.150
on the camping trip and from
his sports apprenticeship teams.

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:54.070
For Tyrique and other students,
expanded learning time

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:57.740
gives them time to slow down,
to literally and figuratively

00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:00.420
watch the sunset and
soak in some extra time

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:05.900
with a mentor, a teacher, or
an interesting assignment.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:08.440
So I wanted to share
that story just

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:13.150
to give you a sense of
the impact you can have

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:18.410
as a citizen volunteer on
one kid and on the country.

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:21.280
And the book goes on
to talk, and finishes

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:27.110
with a call to action to people
who work at Google, to people

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:30.100
who work in offices, and
retirees, and college

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.820
students across the
country to get involved,

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:36.710
because we are not going to
build an opportunity society.

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:38.830
We're not going to erase
that growing achievement

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:41.550
gap by waiting
for a better test,

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:44.360
by waiting for a better
online education program,

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.450
by waiting for
some better policy

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:49.882
to come out of Beacon Hill
or out of Washington, DC.

00:32:49.882 --> 00:32:51.340
We're going to lift
up our schools,

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:53.719
and we're going to lift
up opportunity only

00:32:53.719 --> 00:32:56.010
through the one thing that's
ever really changed things

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:59.450
in a big way in this country,
which is citizen leadership.

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:05.850
And from the citizen soldiers
who put down their pitchforks

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:08.470
and picked up their muskets
to defeat the British army

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:12.540
and create this country
to the abolitionists,

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:16.420
to the suffragette leaders, to
the civil rights citizens who

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:19.180
led The Civil Rights Movement
that has done so much to make

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.240
this a better
country, this country

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:25.100
has only moved forward
in powerful ways

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.130
when average citizens like
all of us in this room

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:31.050
have gotten involved
and gotten engaged.

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:33.301
And I want to ask you,
many you are already

00:33:33.301 --> 00:33:34.550
involved with Citizen Schools.

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:38.330
But stay involved, volunteer
with other programs.

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:40.480
Volunteer as a big
brother, a big sister

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.830
at National Academies
Foundation, at Citizen Schools,

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:45.340
at US 2020.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:48.320
Get engaged, get
people to buy this book

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:52.150
and to talk about this book,
and to think differently

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:54.500
about education, not as
something to wring our hands

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.530
about with all the challenges,
but as something to be excited

00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:01.140
that we have today, thousands
of examples of success

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:03.470
which we did not
have 20 years ago.

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:06.540
Citizen Schools, and you guys
are helping to create that.

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:09.940
So my request to you is, think
about how you can build up

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:12.949
Citizen Schools, how you can get
people talking about this book,

00:34:12.949 --> 00:34:15.862
how you can get your own
family and other people you

00:34:15.862 --> 00:34:18.810
know to be more involved
as active citizens.

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:20.400
Because that is
the one thing that

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:23.000
has the power to move
this country forward

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.451
and to lift up opportunity.

00:34:24.451 --> 00:34:26.909
And that's a really important
thing for this country to do.

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:29.106
So thank you so
much for being here.

00:34:29.106 --> 00:34:31.480
We have some time I think for
some questions or dialogue,

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:33.855
and I really appreciate the
help of everyone in the room,

00:34:33.855 --> 00:34:36.980
and appreciate you coming here
before lunch on a Thursday

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:37.540
morning.

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:38.261
Thank you.

00:34:38.261 --> 00:34:41.698
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:45.626 --> 00:34:50.880
So have maybe 15 minutes for
any questions, or dialogue,

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:55.670
or discussions, or thoughts
that any of you have.

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:56.440
Yes?

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:56.940
Hi.

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.420
AUDIENCE: I have a
somewhat selfish question,

00:34:58.420 --> 00:34:59.731
but I'm going to ask it anyway.

00:34:59.731 --> 00:35:01.855
I'm a parent in the Cambridge
Public School System.

00:35:01.855 --> 00:35:02.845
ERIC SCHWARZ: OK.

00:35:02.845 --> 00:35:04.220
AUDIENCE: I believe
very strongly

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.250
in the potential of
that school system,

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:09.560
and I'm just curious if you're
talking to Jeffrey Young

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:13.080
or working with anyone there
about the Citizen Schools

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.010
Program.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:16.670
ERIC SCHWARZ: Yeah, thank you.

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:19.760
We are not talking right
now to folks in Cambridge,

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.880
and we're working in the Chelsea
School System and the Boston

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.770
School System, and really trying
to grow our efforts there.

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:28.010
But one of the things that
Steven is really, I think,

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:30.150
excited to do is
to think about what

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:34.450
are the various ways
that we can support--

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:36.720
we can bring this
model or elements of it

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.969
to many more places?

00:35:38.969 --> 00:35:40.760
One of the things that
I'm proud that we've

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.410
launched in the
last few years is

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:44.167
an initiative called US 2020.

00:35:44.167 --> 00:35:46.750
And that is an initiative that
we've worked with the Cambridge

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:48.530
Public schools on,
and it's an effort

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:53.090
to massively scale mentoring
in science, technology,

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:54.450
engineering, and math.

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:57.960
Imagine millions of STEM
professionals working

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:00.400
with kids in Cambridge
schools, in Boston schools,

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.452
and all over the country.

00:36:01.452 --> 00:36:03.910
And they might be working the
expanded learning time hours,

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:06.870
or at 9:00 in the morning
alongside a teacher,

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:08.812
or after school.

00:36:08.812 --> 00:36:11.020
But that's something that
I've had some conversations

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:13.310
with the mayor of
Cambridge and others,

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:15.120
and they have some interest.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.600
So maybe I'll help there.

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.140
And I want Citizen
Schools to be omnipresent.

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:22.220
So you should talk
to Steven afterwards,

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:26.370
get the superintendent or
others to be in touch directly

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:28.910
with him and with--
Amy Sargent is here

00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:31.401
from the Massachusetts
team, and others.

00:36:31.401 --> 00:36:33.400
Because that's the
conversation we want to have.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.830
And whether it's just
some ideas around how

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:38.050
things that are already
happening in the schools

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:42.930
could be tweaked a little bit
to bring more creative thinking,

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:45.670
longer learning day, more
chances for mentorship

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:47.450
for kids, that's great.

00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:49.300
We can advise a little bit.

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.890
But the idea of bringing the
full fledged Citizen Schools

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:55.340
Program to the Cambridge
schools that need it most

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.689
is something we certainly
wouldn't rule out as well.

00:36:57.689 --> 00:36:59.480
So thanks for your
leadership in Cambridge,

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:02.312
and thanks for the question.

00:37:02.312 --> 00:37:03.105
Yeah?

00:37:03.105 --> 00:37:05.730
AUDIENCE: I know in the book you
talk about actually the school

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:08.590
in Boston, the Eddie, where
Allen Sue was volunteering,

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:11.200
and the incredible turnaround
it had going from something that

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.766
was about to be closed to
something that actually got

00:37:13.766 --> 00:37:15.890
a lot of national praise
for how strong of a school

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:18.730
it was after a couple years of
Citizen Schools being involved.

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:21.912
What are some of your favorite
turnaround stories of not just

00:37:21.912 --> 00:37:24.120
individual students having
breakthroughs, but schools

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.460
like that having breakthroughs,
and a school level

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:29.440
change that your program
has been able to help with?

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.180
ERIC SCHWARZ: That's
great, thank you.

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:33.450
So a couple I mentioned
are homegrown right here.

00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:36.770
Edwards was the first, and I
just alluded to a little bit

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:38.610
in the talk.

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:41.050
But this was a school
that as Travis mentioned,

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:43.960
was very close to
being closed down.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:47.020
In a three year period before
they started Expanded Learning

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:52.260
Time, there were 53 assaults
of teachers by students.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:55.260
It was the lowest or second
lowest performing school

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:59.470
on all the different metrics,
test scores and parent demand,

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:01.760
across the Boston system.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.637
And they didn't get
a new principle,

00:38:03.637 --> 00:38:05.720
they had they had some
turnover in their teachers,

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:07.820
but not wholesale turnover.

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:10.630
What they got was a
9 and 1/2 hour day.

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:13.870
What they got is every kid
in middle school taking

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:15.877
four apprenticeships a year.

00:38:15.877 --> 00:38:17.960
What they got is every kid
in middle school having

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:21.590
an extra hour of math
instruction every day

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:23.570
led by Citizen School's
AmeriCorps members.

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:26.510
And that combination
of the extra academics,

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:29.490
the extra enrichment
totally changed

00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:30.865
things, the spirit
of the school.

00:38:30.865 --> 00:38:33.198
They had a football team,
they had a cheerleading squad.

00:38:33.198 --> 00:38:35.740
Spirit of the school
took off, and it

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:38.770
went to one of the most
oversubscribed schools,

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:42.480
big waiting list, erased
80% of the achievement gap

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.860
with suburban
schools in English,

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:49.340
and reverse the
achievement gap in math.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:52.260
And that was the first
school turnaround

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.030
story that convinced
us as an organization

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:58.490
we need to move from working
with some kids in the school

00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:00.100
to working with all kids.

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:03.250
And that can really then be
not only an innovative model

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:05.520
around the edges of
public education,

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:09.870
but a fundamental change to the
offering of public education

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:12.220
and really bringing
into urban schools

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:15.380
and integrating within them a
lot of what upper middle class

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:18.660
families have managed
to create in combination

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:21.850
with public schools
in their communities.

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:24.440
A couple years after
that, Orchard Gardens

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.370
replaced the Edwards as
the lowest performing

00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:27.840
school in Boston.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.900
It was in the bottom five
or six performing schools

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.060
in the whole state
of Massachusetts.

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:35.030
And that became a
turnaround school.

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:36.530
So there actually
were a fair amount

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:39.350
of new teachers in that school.

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:42.940
But also, they moved to
a 10 hour learning day.

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.270
And at the middle school
level, Citizen Schools

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:47.050
was the lead partner.

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:49.110
And while they've had
a real improvement

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:51.344
across all the grades,
K through eight school,

00:39:51.344 --> 00:39:53.010
the middle school
grades have taken off.

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:55.610
And it went from being one
of the lowest performing

00:39:55.610 --> 00:40:00.860
schools in Boston to literally
the highest growth scores

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:03.230
of any school in the
state of Massachusetts

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:05.877
three years after doing
Expanded Learning Time.

00:40:05.877 --> 00:40:07.210
So that was an incredible story.

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:10.660
We now have-- the new
principal at that school,

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:13.470
is a former Citizen
Schools campus director.

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:15.420
She worked at the
McCormick School,

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:17.410
and that's sort of
early stage turnaround.

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:19.990
But I know a lot of Googlers
have worked at the McCormick.

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:22.440
That's where we
started 20 years ago.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.060
And that school, the data
that's about to come out

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:28.630
on the MCAS in sixth, and
seventh, and eighth grade,

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:31.550
amazing growth scores-- some of
the highest in the city, some

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:33.510
of the highest in the
state for a school

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:36.770
that also was not too far
away from being closed,

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:38.410
and really struggling.

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:41.620
There've been others in
East Palo Alto, in Chicago

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:45.730
last year, our kids showed
almost two full years

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:48.700
of learning growth as
opposed to typical of one

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:51.550
year across four schools
that were in Chicago.

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:53.840
So a number of
schools, and we're

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:57.060
excited to now have a handful
of school superintendents.

00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:00.020
If Cambridge joins the list,
that'd be great, saying we

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:01.500
want to make this normal.

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.314
We want to invest in this.

00:41:03.314 --> 00:41:04.980
We know it's not going
to come for free,

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:06.720
but we want to
think differently.

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.930
We want to really think
outside of the box

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:11.947
and not tinker with
the school system.

00:41:11.947 --> 00:41:13.280
That's what generally gets done.

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.580
People just add a little
bit, subtract a little bit,

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:17.550
the budget's pretty
much next year

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:21.550
what it was last year,
but think much differently

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:24.030
and really think about a
much longer learning day, not

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:25.550
a little bit longer
learning day.

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:27.580
Much different
set of activities,

00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:29.410
whole different talent model.

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:32.460
And we now have proof positive
in the 30 plus schools

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:35.360
that when you do that, even
with some of the toughest

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.400
to reach kids in
some of the toughest

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.850
neighborhoods in
the country, you

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:41.060
can deliver outstanding results.

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:43.890
So thanks Travis,
for that question.

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:46.329
One or two more questions
or comments from anyone?

00:41:46.329 --> 00:41:48.370
AUDIENCE: So you said the
first part of your book

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:51.860
is about citizen schools, the
second part is what comes next.

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:53.610
So what comes next
for you, Eric Schwarz?

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:56.440
ERIC SCHWARZ: Oh, wow,
thank you, thank you.

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.930
So I'm going to join
the Steven Rothstein fan

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:00.900
club as the charter member.

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:05.670
It's going to be my main
job for the next year.

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:08.980
And that's partly
serious, mostly serious.

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:11.371
But the book tours
for the next month

00:42:11.371 --> 00:42:12.620
will pretty much be consuming.

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:15.930
I've got 31 events
in 30 days everywhere

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:19.900
from the Dever-McCormick
School, to the White House,

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.540
to Google events in
three different cities.

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:25.760
And that's going to be really
exciting and also exhausting.

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.410
Hoping to take a few
months off after that.

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:29.910
And then what I'm
looking to do next

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:33.580
is to innovate in the
higher education area,

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:36.870
and to really bring some of the
same themes of Citizen Schools

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:40.250
to higher education,
experiential learning.

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:44.490
So create a college where kids
are getting half or maybe even

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:47.010
more than half their
credits through internships

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:49.670
and externships that they
reflect on, and to give them

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:53.105
real world experience
in public service.

00:42:53.105 --> 00:42:54.880
Just like we have
Citizen teachers,

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.554
have Citizen professors so
that people who know a lot,

00:42:57.554 --> 00:42:59.720
have a lot of insights, but
haven't become full time

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:04.280
professors have a chance
to teach one of course

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:05.870
a year at this college.

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:08.370
And it'll start as a partnership
with the existing colleges,

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:11.670
and eventually, the goals is to
become an independent college.

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:14.239
So that's my goal
for my full time job.

00:43:14.239 --> 00:43:16.280
I'm going to stay on the
board of Citizen Schools

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.190
and be a lifelong,
deep champion.

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:22.290
And I think Citizen
Schools is frankly

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:26.252
at a really exciting
inflection point.

00:43:26.252 --> 00:43:27.710
We've got this
initial proof point.

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:28.990
We've got an amazing team.

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:31.640
Stevens an incredible
visionary leader.

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:34.850
And I think you're going to
hear so much more about Citizen

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:36.630
Schools in the years ahead.

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:39.560
And really, we have a chance
to become the new normal

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.591
in urban education
across the country,

00:43:41.591 --> 00:43:42.590
be the new kindergarten.

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:49.600
50 years ago, kindergarten
was not taken for granted.

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.461
Now, it is.

00:43:51.461 --> 00:43:52.710
That should be the same thing.

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:54.980
Maybe 20 years now,
Expanded Learning Time

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:56.540
should be taken for granted.

00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:59.380
And when we do that and we do
that in a high quality way,

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:02.576
we will lift up opportunity
for every kid in the country.

00:44:02.576 --> 00:44:03.700
So I'm going to stop there.

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:05.590
I'm here, there's book's here.

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:08.300
I'm donating all author
proceeds to Citizen Schools.

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:10.930
So when you buy a book you not
only get subsidized by Google,

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:13.410
but you help subsidize
Citizen Schools.

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:18.370
So buy one or two, and the great
folks from the Porter Square

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:19.670
Bookstore are here.

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:22.320
And this is a former Googler, I
think, who's running the store.

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.330
So thank you for being
here, and thank you

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:26.420
all for taking the
time to come today.

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:28.140
Appreciate it.
