1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.490
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.910
Is there any evidence that there was other species of human beings that existed

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.940
in the Americas?
Like we're finding in Russia and,
uh,

4
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.100
there's,
uh,
many of them that are being discovered all over the world now,

5
00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:19.560
these subspecies of human beings.

6
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.970
<v 1>Yeah.
Um,
this is,
uh,
an issue that I go into in,</v>

7
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.090
in America before.

8
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.870
And what first drew me into it was Dennis over K in Siberia.

9
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.120
I think everybody's heard of the neanderthals.
And these days,

10
00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:37.280
I think everybody's head of the dentist's as well.
A lot of people have a lot of,

11
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.180
well,
I guess a lot of people haven't,
but,
but first of all,

12
00:00:40.181 --> 00:00:42.610
let's take the neanderthals.
For a long time,

13
00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:44.710
it was held that the neanderthals were stupid,

14
00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:48.280
primitive subhumans shambling lacking symbolism.

15
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.440
Turns out that that's not true at all.

16
00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:54.280
The latest scientific evidence on the neanderthals is that they were symbolic

17
00:00:54.281 --> 00:00:57.760
creatures.
That they did do art,
that they were in every sense human,

18
00:00:57.761 --> 00:01:02.260
and they were in every sense human because anatomically modern humans interbred

19
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.380
with neanderthals,
you can't interbreed with another species.
They,

20
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.050
they clearly were,
uh,
human human beings,

21
00:01:08.051 --> 00:01:09.760
but they looked rather different from us.

22
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.760
And that's why certain populations in the world today still have three to 5% of

23
00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:19.060
Neanderthal DNA.
Then in Russia,

24
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.920
in Dennis over cave,
they find a single pinky bone from a little finger.

25
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.130
And,
uh,
they do the DNA testing on it.

26
00:01:27.131 --> 00:01:29.620
They're able to get a complete genome from it.

27
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.410
And what they discover is this isn't in the end Athol,

28
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.480
this isn't an anatomically modern human being.
This is another human species,
uh,

29
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.630
who they named the Denisovans.

30
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.610
They think they're more closely related to neanderthals than they are to

31
00:01:42.611 --> 00:01:45.910
anatomically modern humans,
but they're clearly another human species.

32
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.320
And they also interbred with anatomically modern humans.

33
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.620
And Dennis Urban DNA survives,
interestingly enough,

34
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.700
it survives a predominantly in Australasia,
uh,

35
00:01:57.701 --> 00:02:01.600
in Papua New Guinea and amongst Australian aborigines.

36
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.520
So as part of the research for this book,
I went to Dennis over cave.

37
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.720
I had an amazing,
actually just incredible trip to Russia.
I hadn't,

38
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.500
I hadn't expected it to be like that at all.
Siberia.
I mean,

39
00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:18.400
America is vast,
but my God,
crossing Siberia,

40
00:02:18.401 --> 00:02:22.810
this endless rolling plains,
you know,
this just vast area.

41
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.910
How did you cross it?
We took a car.
Uh,

42
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.740
w you can't travel independently in Russia.
It's very difficult.
You have to get,

43
00:02:29.741 --> 00:02:33.580
you have to get permission and you have to state in advance where you're going

44
00:02:33.581 --> 00:02:36.820
to be stopping off that.
So what I found,
and I just did,

45
00:02:36.821 --> 00:02:41.520
so through the Internet was a,
was a local guy called Sergei Cogan,
um,

46
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.450
who had a little tour business,
um,
in,
in,
in,
in Siberia,

47
00:02:46.451 --> 00:02:49.840
in the city of novels,
CBS.
I got in touch with him.

48
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.070
He found a translator who would translate my emails and I said,

49
00:02:54.071 --> 00:02:57.200
we want to make this journey to Dennis over cave,
uh,

50
00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.430
and can you set this up for us and get the permissions?
And,
and he did.

51
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:02.240
And so we flew into novice,
a bisque.

52
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.690
Sergey and his translator who turned out to be a,

53
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.770
a Russian student who spoke good English,
joined us.

54
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.720
And we did this immense journey across Siberia.
Oh,

55
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.000
it took us three days to get to,
to get to Dennis.
Over k three days,

56
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.120
three days of driving every day.
Some stopping off along the way.

57
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.230
Incredible hospitality of the,
of,
of the Russians that we were.

58
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.280
We're amongst very independent people.

59
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.640
People are living out there and the wilderness and who actually do,

60
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.700
do know how to survive is the first time I've ever drunk milk.

61
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:31.720
Fresh from the cow,

62
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.720
literally milked right out of the cow and poured down my throat.
I was,

63
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.330
it was delicious.
And a cream,
I mean thick,
thick cream.
Very,
very,
so.

64
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:43.720
It was a lot of things about Russia that surprised me.
Dennis over caves.

65
00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:46.480
A fascinating,
beautiful pace of visit.
It's another,

66
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:50.710
it's another example of a missing chapter in the human story that is beginning

67
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:54.040
to be pieced together.
It's obvious now that we were not alone,

68
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.210
that there were multiple other human species who are human enough to interbreed

69
00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:01.980
with us and leave leave DNA.
And there's Dennis Obon species.

70
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.930
We've only discovered in like,

71
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.790
was it 2000 so I'm very recently the 2007 it's a very,

72
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:10.810
it's a very recent discovery and,
and it's a lot behind art.
Hmm.

73
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.100
Did they leave behind art better than that?
They left behind.
Um,

74
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.420
certain physical objects which are extremely hard to explain.

75
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.120
One of them is a greenstone bracelet,
uh,

76
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.240
and that bracelet is in the form of a talk which was therefore slipped on

77
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:31.490
sideways onto the hand.
It's not a full ring.
Um,

78
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.540
and a hole has been drilled through the bracelet and from that whole it's been

79
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:40.900
possible to reconstruct that appendant was hung then the archeologists,

80
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.860
there it is.

81
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.720
Then the archaeologists started to take a look in detail at the drill marks on

82
00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:51.490
that hole and what they discovered was a huge anomaly that that was drilled with

83
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:56.491
a stable fixed drill and it was drilled at extremely high speed.

84
00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.460
It's a,
this is thought to be 40 or 50,000 years old.

85
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.510
There is not supposed to have been any such technology in that period that was

86
00:05:04.511 --> 00:05:09.140
capable of drilling with a stable,
fixed the drill.
And yet there it is and,
and,

87
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.240
and there it appears.
So there,
there are also incredible,

88
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.190
very fine needles,
bone needles that the Denisovans made very long ones,

89
00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:21.130
which suggests that they were stitching very heavy stuff together in the

90
00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:24.550
suggestion has been were they making skin boats for example,
to,

91
00:05:24.551 --> 00:05:27.700
to use to navigate that would explain how they managed to get themselves to

92
00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:32.130
Australia,
which is where the largest amount of Denisovan Dna,
uh,
so,

93
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.320
so survives today.
There's one of those,
there's one of those needles.

94
00:05:35.321 --> 00:05:40.321
So th th th there are indications of strangely out of place technology amongst

95
00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:41.890
the dentist servants,
which is 20,

96
00:05:41.891 --> 00:05:44.650
30,000 years earlier in the human story than it then.

97
00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:46.180
It should be those kinds of needles,

98
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.570
that kind of bracelet you could expect to find them in what archeologists call

99
00:05:49.571 --> 00:05:50.410
the Neolithic.

100
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.300
But to find it in the Paleolithic is very puzzling and very audinate suggests

101
00:05:55.301 --> 00:05:57.440
that the Denisovans were secondly,

102
00:05:57.441 --> 00:06:01.640
not a sat shambling sub sub humans that they,
they were refined creatures.

103
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.370
Can you find out what year the discover the Denisovans Jamie,

104
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:05.390
can you Google that real quick?

105
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.570
I want to say it's in the two thousands but I mean,

106
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.650
imagine that human beings have been around for this long.

107
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.390
Here we are in 2019 and within the last decade or so they figured this out.
Yeah.

108
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.000
We are discovering new stuff about ourselves.
We're discovering the,

109
00:06:21.001 --> 00:06:24.080
our story is much richer,
much more textured,

110
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.610
much more layered than we thought it was.
It's not a simple story.

111
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.680
It's a very complicated story.

112
00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:34.700
And we ourselves are hybrid species.
We are,

113
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:38.660
we are the result of interactions with all kinds of different looking human

114
00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:40.820
beings.
And the end,
the end result is ourselves.

115
00:06:40.821 --> 00:06:45.290
So it's not just that we carry neanderthal or Denisovan DNA in a sense.

116
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:49.400
We are neanderthals and Denisovans uh,
you know,

117
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:54.170
and have their,
they are part of the anatomically modern human human heritage.

118
00:06:54.171 --> 00:06:56.330
So you make a good point.

119
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.840
The fact that this is only being discovered now and that it's an incredibly

120
00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:04.220
important,
I mean it,
it completely rewrites the story of our ancestry.

121
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.890
The notion,
the notion of 19 seven,
1970s.
Oh,
okay.

122
00:07:07.891 --> 00:07:11.810
And where are the real work that's been done in Dennis over cave has been done

123
00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:15.840
in the two thousands from,
from 2006,
2007 Altima.

124
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.900
That's when the major papers have been 2008 there had been published,
which have,

125
00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:24.420
which have revealed the genome of the Denisovans and revealed the dentist

126
00:07:24.421 --> 00:07:27.290
servant connection to two anatomically modern humans.

127
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.870
The fact that we're only finding this out now that we,

128
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:34.220
that we told the story of our past and weren't aware of this raises the
question,

129
00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:37.700
how much else in the story of our past is there that we're not aware of?

130
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.460
Let's stop being so arrogant,
so sure of ourselves.

131
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:42.950
So confident in our findings that's be more tentative.

132
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.880
Let's keep an open mind and see and see where it takes us.
That's,

133
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:51.800
that's the main message that I have from,
from all of this.
And I think,
um,

134
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:55.910
and I hope that this will be an effect of this book.
I'm not,

135
00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:01.030
I'm not kidding myself that the archeologists are going to jump on board,

136
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.630
uh,
overnight particularly.

137
00:08:02.631 --> 00:08:07.370
So since I'm very critical of American archeology in this book,

138
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:12.400
and I'm critical of it specifically and explicitly because of the dominance of

139
00:08:12.711 --> 00:08:17.560
the Clovis first model for so long,
which prevented at the research taking place.
