   &gt;&gt;  Attention.  We're going 
to be starting in about five

00:03:41.255 --> 00:03:43.255
minutes.  Apologies.

00:03:46.582 --> 00:03:48.582
We have an author in transit.  
We'll be

00:03:51.047 --> 00:03:53.047
starting in just a minute.

00:08:17.874 --> 00:08:20.121
   &gt;&gt;  Good morning.  Any time I
have the opportunity to kick

00:08:21.954 --> 00:08:23.954
off one of these events I always
feel 

00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:29.376
like I should apologize
for interrupting the party.  

00:08:29.377 --> 00:08:31.377
Welcome to the Library of 
Congress. 

00:08:31.645 --> 00:08:33.645
I'm Leanne Potter.

00:08:37.156 --> 00:08:39.156
I direct educational outreach 
here.  I'm

00:08:44.282 --> 00:08:44.831
thrilled to welcome you here, to
the Symposium on Diversity in

00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:49.799
Children's Literature and, of 
course, 

00:08:50.804 --> 00:08:52.804

We Need Diverse Books.
   If you want to clap, feel 

00:08:56.811 --> 00:08:58.811
free.

00:09:00.025 --> 00:09:03.752
[Applause]
   This program is being live 

00:09:03.753 --> 00:09:06.013
streamed.  I want to give a 
shout-

00:09:08.056 --> 00:09:10.088
shout-out to all who are at a 
distance, especially those in 

00:09:10.089 --> 00:09:12.758
time
zones other than ours.  You 

00:09:12.759 --> 00:09:14.759
know, it's 9:00 here.  The folks
in

00:09:16.062 --> 00:09:18.062
Chicago are watching.

00:09:20.078 --> 00:09:22.078
The folks in

00:09:24.045 --> 00:09:25.874
in other places watching.  I
want to thank them for watching.

00:09:25.875 --> 00:09:31.195
   And finally, my colleagues 
making that happen.  Live 

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:33.645
streams
and lights and so forth don't 

00:09:33.646 --> 00:09:35.646
happen by themselves.  Thanks to

00:09:40.042 --> 00:09:42.042
Mike and my colleagues for 
making that.

00:09:45.798 --> 00:09:47.442
Here, we have three buildings 
named for our founding fathers. 

00:09:47.443 --> 00:09:50.302
The building we're in this 
morning is the James Madison 

00:09:50.303 --> 00:09:52.303
building
building.

00:09:53.979 --> 00:09:55.979
For those of you who came in 
downstairs on the first

00:09:57.258 --> 00:09:59.946
floor, if you looked over to 
your left you would have seen a

00:09:59.947 --> 00:10:04.263
statue of James mod son Madison.
If you walked into the rooms you

00:10:04.264 --> 00:10:06.092
could
have seen some of this quotes on

00:10:06.093 --> 00:10:12.477
the walls.  They're engraveed
down there.  There's one that 

00:10:12.478 --> 00:10:14.478
speaks to the Library of 
Congress

00:10:15.936 --> 00:10:18.610
and to culture cultureal 
institutions like the library.  

00:10:18.611 --> 00:10:20.611
I'm going to
paraphrase it.

00:10:23.966 --> 00:10:25.966
It reads learned institutions 
ought to be

00:10:26.608 --> 00:10:28.608
favorite objects with every free
people.

00:10:30.064 --> 00:10:32.064
They throw light over
the public mind.

00:10:32.501 --> 00:10:34.501
I love that.

00:10:37.212 --> 00:10:39.212
They throw light over the public
mind.

00:10:42.932 --> 00:10:44.932
Even as Kathie and Ellen and I 
were first discussing this

00:10:46.837 --> 00:10:48.837
program last summer, I had a 
lunch this 

00:10:53.638 --> 00:10:54.263
would be a light- -- I had a 
hunch this will be a light

00:10:54.264 --> 00:10:56.264
http://upload.youtube.com/closedcaption?cid=pk87-p4dr-fpke-emzp
light-throwing event.

00:10:57.328 --> 00:10:58.577
You all need to know when I 
describe the library to people

00:11:02.451 --> 00:11:04.712
who do not know much about it, I
often talk it about being a

00:11:05.745 --> 00:11:08.213
place that sparks ideas.  The 
primary sources in the 

00:11:08.214 --> 00:11:10.214
collections

00:11:12.291 --> 00:11:14.291
collections, my colleagues, the 

00:11:17.578 --> 00:11:19.614
architecture of the Thomas
Jefferson building all inspire 

00:11:22.735 --> 00:11:24.735
creativity and imagine and help
us have possibilities.

00:11:26.615 --> 00:11:29.045
A minute ago we were talking 
about throwing light.  And I

00:11:29.456 --> 00:11:31.456
just mentioned sparks.

00:11:33.778 --> 00:11:35.192
When Kathie asked me if I would
introduce our moderator, I did a

00:11:35.193 --> 00:11:37.193
little research about her. 

00:11:38.869 --> 00:11:39.883
Immediately, I thought, wow, 
serendipity.  This author is

00:11:39.884 --> 00:11:41.884
perfect.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:44.990
Her website has a fabulous URL. 
This morning's

00:11:49.863 --> 00:11:51.863
moderator is Linda Sue Parker.  
L.S. Park.

00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:59.830
If you go to her website you'll 
find the URL, L.

00:12:02.821 --> 00:12:04.821
LSPARK.  Huh? 
Magic.

00:12:06.115 --> 00:12:07.957
Linda was born in urbanna, 
Illinois.  She grew up in 

00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958
Chicago

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:16.345
and earned her bachelor's degree
at Stanford University.  She

00:12:17.652 --> 00:12:19.635
has authored numerous novels and
picture books for children. 

00:12:19.636 --> 00:12:21.636
She.

00:12:24.616 --> 00:12:25.633
Often uses innovative forms to 
expand young reader's sense

00:12:25.634 --> 00:12:27.634
of possibility.

00:12:30.129 --> 00:12:31.367
Her poetry collection, Tap 
Dancing on the Roof utilizes a

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:36.379
Korean Sylabbic verse form.

00:12:38.774 --> 00:12:40.774
Her novels for teenage readers

00:12:42.856 --> 00:12:44.917
include a Single Shard, When My 
Name Was KYOKO, and a Long Walk

00:12:44.918 --> 00:12:47.376
to Water, based on a true story.

00:12:51.089 --> 00:12:53.089
Her picture books include Fire 

00:12:59.072 --> 00:13:01.536
Keeper'S Son, and Bee BIM Bop.
   She lives with her family in 

00:13:02.351 --> 00:13:05.415
Rochester, New York.  I have a
feeling she's just who we need 

00:13:05.416 --> 00:13:11.163
to start throwing some light on
our program this morning.  

00:13:11.164 --> 00:13:12.796
Please join me in welcomeing 
Linda Sue

00:13:12.797 --> 00:13:15.645
Parker.

00:13:18.859 --> 00:13:20.859
[Applause]
   &gt;&gt; LINDA:  Good morning.

00:13:23.411 --> 00:13:25.411
I am already having so much fun.

00:13:27.915 --> 00:13:29.915
I'd like to thank the Library of

00:13:30.925 --> 00:13:32.925
Congress

00:13:36.053 --> 00:13:39.654
and, the Walter Award
Award's judging panel and 

00:13:39.655 --> 00:13:41.655
including all of you online.

00:13:46.541 --> 00:13:47.957
I serve on the adviseory board 
of We Need Diverse Books.  I'm

00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:52.084
so thrilled to be the moderator 
of today's symposium.

00:13:53.512 --> 00:13:55.512
We have the power of books.  I'm
guessing if you're in this

00:13:57.082 --> 00:13:59.082
room you have a story or two 
about the power of books.

00:14:02.011 --> 00:14:03.855
A couple of quick ones of minute
-- of mine.  My daughter is 

00:14:03.856 --> 00:14:05.856
named

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:09.422
after a character in one of 
Charlotte's books.  Several 

00:14:09.423 --> 00:14:11.423
years

00:14:13.706 --> 00:14:16.391
ago I moved to Brooklyn because 
of: A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.

00:14:16.594 --> 00:14:19.865
   [Laughter]
   Perhaps most important I 

00:14:19.866 --> 00:14:23.555
survived a childhood of being
different, in part because of 

00:14:23.556 --> 00:14:26.646
the strength books gave me.
   This morning, I am delighted 

00:14:26.647 --> 00:14:29.512
to introduce the three winners
of

00:14:33.406 --> 00:14:35.406

work turn the power of words

00:14:37.286 --> 00:14:39.286
into a juggernaut.

00:15:08.327 --> 00:15:09.343
decided I couldn't keep listing 
the rest of them.

00:16:59.408 --> 00:17:01.408
[Applause]

00:17:08.244 --> 00:17:10.244
Okay.

00:17:13.374 --> 00:17:14.590
We're going to start with the 
panelists as reader pass

00:17:14.591 --> 00:17:16.591
pass.

00:17:18.212 --> 00:17:20.212
So my first

00:17:21.398 --> 00:17:23.398
.  First, I'd like to ask you to
think back to your

00:17:25.704 --> 00:17:27.974
childhoods and where did your 
book comes from?  Were you 

00:17:27.975 --> 00:17:29.975
school
library attendees?  Your school?

00:17:32.042 --> 00:17:35.107
Your parents?  How do you have
access to books when you were 

00:17:35.108 --> 00:17:37.952
young?
   &gt;&gt;  For me, it was the public

00:17:39.779 --> 00:17:41.614
library, in north east Los
Angeles, and I would go every 

00:17:41.615 --> 00:17:43.647
Saturday and get a stack.  But I

00:17:46.712 --> 00:17:49.186
have to say that I read more 
adult books than children's 

00:17:49.187 --> 00:17:51.428
books. 
That's because I wanted 

00:17:51.429 --> 00:17:53.429
international books.  I wanted 
books

00:17:55.306 --> 00:17:57.766
about other countries.  And at 
that time, there weren't books

00:18:00.821 --> 00:18:02.821
about other countries for 
children.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.544
So I would go in in in the adult
travel section, which was 

00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:09.545
illegal.

00:18:12.225 --> 00:18:13.042
The librarians would chase
me away.

00:18:13.043 --> 00:18:15.089
[Laughter]
   They thought I was supposed 

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:17.736
to stay in the children's
section, but I would get 

00:18:17.737 --> 00:18:19.737
anything about geography and 
travel and

00:18:21.015 --> 00:18:22.222
other countries that I could 
find.

00:18:22.223 --> 00:18:27.143
&gt;&gt;  Wonderful.  Mitali?
   &gt;&gt;  Mitali: Yes, definitely 

00:18:27.144 --> 00:18:29.144
the 

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:37.167
public library in Flushing 
Queens.  Yeah, Flushing.  Yeah. 

00:18:37.168 --> 00:18:39.168
We immigrated there when I was
seven.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.277
I come from a family that's 
immigrant and refugee.  My

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:47.966
family left everything in the 
war, left Bangladesh.  When we

00:18:47.967 --> 00:18:52.063
came to the United States, we 
had very little, so we had no

00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:57.958
books in the home, but me and my
two 

00:19:00.283 --> 00:19:02.283
sisters, me all speak Ben

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:07.202
Bengali, we walked ten blocks to
the Flushing branch.  When we

00:19:11.877 --> 00:19:13.504
walked in she said, you can take
seven books home.  I thought,

00:19:13.505 --> 00:19:16.956
is this Alibabb's cave?
   [Laughter]

00:19:20.459 --> 00:19:22.459
So that's when I started 
reading.

00:19:22.709 --> 00:19:24.142
&gt;&gt;  I grew up in Mexico.  My 
mother was a single mother so we

00:19:24.143 --> 00:19:26.793
lived in my grandfather's house.

00:19:29.866 --> 00:19:35.732
There was one book in his
http://upload.youtube.com/closedcaption?cid=pk87-p4dr-fpke-emzp

00:19:29.866 --> 00:19:33.944
bedroom in this old glass thing.
I knew where the key was hid

00:19:34.144 --> 00:19:36.144
hiding.

00:19:39.841 --> 00:19:40.245
He had 20 volumes of a book of 
like treasures for youth

00:19:40.246 --> 00:19:42.246
youth.

00:19:44.118 --> 00:19:46.349
It was a compileation of fiction
and stories, science,

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.024
you could learn a language if 
you learned those stories 

00:19:50.025 --> 00:19:52.480
careful
carefully.  That's how I went 

00:19:52.481 --> 00:19:54.481
through those books.  I don't

00:19:55.753 --> 00:19:58.433
think I saw my library, a 
library, until we moved to Texas

00:19:58.434 --> 00:20:00.434
when
I was nine years old.

00:20:00.655 --> 00:20:02.078
&gt;&gt;  You think about that.  I 
think about all the places in

00:20:02.079 --> 00:20:05.813
the world, even in our own 
country where young people don't

00:20:05.814 --> 00:20:08.259
have
access to a library.  How do 

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.260
they live?  You know?

00:20:12.736 --> 00:20:14.736
I mean -- --
[laughter]

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:16.770
It's really interesting.

00:20:18.625 --> 00:20:19.242
Could you talk about the first 
teem -- the first time, it may

00:20:19.243 --> 00:20:23.532
not have been from your 
childhood, but the first time 

00:20:23.533 --> 00:20:27.117
you felt
seen or heard in a book?

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:33.678
&gt;&gt;  Francisco: I grew up with 
this identity of being Mexican

00:20:33.679 --> 00:20:35.679
for a long time.

00:20:38.156 --> 00:20:38.557
I didn't become an American 
citizen until I

00:20:38.558 --> 00:20:40.558
was 26.

00:20:43.053 --> 00:20:45.053
So it was really -- it was 
really the authors from

00:20:47.315 --> 00:20:49.967
Latin America that I just kind 
of grew up with and it was only

00:20:49.968 --> 00:20:54.918
when I was -- it was only when I
was in college and I had -- I

00:20:54.919 --> 00:20:59.025
realized now I had lived 15 
years in the United States and I

00:20:59.026 --> 00:21:01.473
had
gone through learning a a new 

00:21:01.474 --> 00:21:03.749
language and getting paddleed 
for

00:21:06.828 --> 00:21:08.463
speaking Spanish in the 
playground and getting rejected 

00:21:08.464 --> 00:21:11.346
by the
beautiful Becky because I was 

00:21:11.347 --> 00:21:13.347
Mexican.
   [Laughter]

00:21:13.598 --> 00:21:16.255
There were certain things that 
were a little bit different

00:21:18.076 --> 00:21:20.521
than Mexicans and I think it was
a little bit like where I kind

00:21:20.522 --> 00:21:23.002
of saw, you know, this 
possibility of 

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:29.347
this -- this kind of looks
a little more like me.

00:21:30.357 --> 00:21:33.028
&gt;&gt;  Mitali?
   &gt;&gt;  Mitali: Yeah, I wanted 

00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:34.447
books because I didn't like 
being

00:21:34.448 --> 00:21:37.698
seen.  I moved to California in 
7th grade and I was the only

00:21:40.761 --> 00:21:43.011
kid of color in the whole school
and the only kid not born in

00:21:45.261 --> 00:21:47.261
the USA in the whole school.

00:21:48.735 --> 00:21:51.769
Books was a way for me to see
another life.  I was doing that 

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:53.770
code switching at school.  I

00:21:56.271 --> 00:21:58.271
used the curling iron to try to 

00:21:59.337 --> 00:22:01.183
transform myself into Farrah Fac
Farrah Facett every morning.

00:22:01.184 --> 00:22:03.826
[Laughter]
   I tried to look like 

00:22:03.827 --> 00:22:06.078
everybody else and I never did. 
I feel

00:22:08.313 --> 00:22:10.962
books is a way to see and 
imagine other lives, which I 

00:22:10.963 --> 00:22:13.202
feel is a
huge advantage we get when we 

00:22:13.203 --> 00:22:15.203
have to cross borders to read.  
I

00:22:16.858 --> 00:22:17.673
was learning how to be fluent in
imagineing other lives.  I think

00:22:17.674 --> 00:22:19.923
that's how books serveed me 
well.

00:22:24.639 --> 00:22:25.871
&gt;&gt;  I was the only Cuban 
American growing up in a Mexican

00:22:25.872 --> 00:22:27.872
American neighborhood, and as 
much as I 

00:22:31.755 --> 00:22:33.755
loved the poetry of

00:22:36.575 --> 00:22:38.575
Mexico, my mother introduced me 
to Kosi 

00:22:40.611 --> 00:22:42.611
Marte and I love all the

00:22:45.809 --> 00:22:46.416
-- poets of Latin America and 
from Spain, especially those who

00:22:50.701 --> 00:22:52.949
were resisting the -- 
oppression.  So poetry was very

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:56.437
influential.  But I have to say 
as far as being seen in a book,

00:23:00.513 --> 00:23:01.780
I was 50 something when I read 
memoir under the row palms.  

00:23:01.781 --> 00:23:06.247
That
http://upload.youtube.com/closedcaption?cid=pk87-p4dr-fpke-emzp

00:23:01.781 --> 00:23:08.906
would be the first time I read 
something written specifically

00:23:08.907 --> 00:23:13.650
about Cuba.  So we're here to 
make sure no child ever has to

00:23:13.651 --> 00:23:17.717
wait that long again.  Right?
   Yeah.

00:23:20.972 --> 00:23:22.972
When I was growing up I have a 
clear memory of the first

00:23:24.869 --> 00:23:26.903
Asians I ever saw in a book 
which was that Five Chinese 

00:23:26.904 --> 00:23:27.918
Brothers
Book.

00:23:27.919 --> 00:23:31.381
Okay.  Right.  Let's move on.  
All right.

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:35.882
[Laughter]
   Okay.  Do you have either a 

00:23:35.883 --> 00:23:40.559
book or books or an author or
authors who are your greatest 

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:45.060
influence and your greatest
inspiration and why is that?  Is

00:23:45.061 --> 00:23:49.346
it because of their craft? 
Subject matter?  Theme?  Do you 

00:23:49.347 --> 00:23:53.867
have authors that you just sort
of hold up as your light?  

00:23:53.868 --> 00:23:54.070
Mitali, we'll start with you 
this

00:23:54.071 --> 00:23:56.071
time.

00:23:58.558 --> 00:24:01.218
&gt;&gt;  I just finished my annual 
reread of Little Women again. 

00:24:05.727 --> 00:24:07.727
I love Jo March so much because 
she was living in 19th

00:24:11.467 --> 00:24:13.518
certainlyiry concurred conquered
conquered Massachusetts, but I 

00:24:13.519 --> 00:24:15.519
was living very

00:24:19.445 --> 00:24:21.445
differently, but she chose to 
write not to make money, but

00:24:23.113 --> 00:24:25.212
despite all the pressures, and 
any of you from South Asian

00:24:27.647 --> 00:24:29.072
backgrounds know we basically 
have three options, engineer,

00:24:29.073 --> 00:24:32.551
doctor, and engineer.  Those are
our three options vocationally.

00:24:32.552 --> 00:24:34.990
   [Laughter]
   So she pushed those 

00:24:34.991 --> 00:24:36.991
boundaries.  She loved her 
sisters and

00:24:37.675 --> 00:24:39.675
loved her writing.

00:24:41.537 --> 00:24:42.775
For her, writing was something 
she was never

00:24:42.776 --> 00:24:45.417
going to give up on.  That's how
I felt about my writing.  A

00:24:48.422 --> 00:24:50.422
refined

00:24:52.995 --> 00:24:54.650
Bengali woman in that time did 
want -- did not write

00:24:54.651 --> 00:24:56.651
for money, we wrote for beauty.

00:24:58.522 --> 00:24:59.944
She said, no, I'm going to
write for money and I'm going to

00:24:59.945 --> 00:25:01.945
be independent.  I still love

00:25:04.816 --> 00:25:06.465
her for that.
   &gt;&gt;  I think it's more her 

00:25:06.466 --> 00:25:11.157
life.  She only wrote two novels
and two short stories, but she 

00:25:11.158 --> 00:25:13.158
was a person of faith.  And her

00:25:16.883 --> 00:25:18.517
works are infused with that 
faith, but you'd never know it 

00:25:18.518 --> 00:25:21.971
if
you read her work.  In fact, in 

00:25:21.972 --> 00:25:23.972
many cases you'd think the

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:28.117
opposite, just because they're 
so undidactic and so powerful. 

00:25:28.118 --> 00:25:30.972
So you read her books and you 
put it 

00:25:34.055 --> 00:25:36.055
down andlike -- like, what
the hell just happened?

00:25:39.792 --> 00:25:41.215
And a little while later you 
begin to

00:25:41.216 --> 00:25:42.234
notice things you didn't notice 
before.  I think the ability to

00:25:45.711 --> 00:25:48.370
see things differently is that 
power that she gave me and that 

00:25:48.371 --> 00:25:50.371
I

00:25:51.858 --> 00:25:53.858
would hope to emulate in my 
writing.

00:25:57.327 --> 00:25:59.327
&gt;&gt;  That's why I'm a

00:26:00.695 --> 00:26:02.695
Franciso Stork fan.  That's 
exactly how

00:26:06.574 --> 00:26:08.574
I would describe your work.

00:26:09.623 --> 00:26:11.623
&gt;&gt;  I would

00:26:12.916 --> 00:26:14.916
say Marilyn Carveer would 
inspire my work.  It was

00:26:16.371 --> 00:26:17.382
the first time I read a verse 
biography about someone who has

00:26:17.383 --> 00:26:22.271
been neglected by history.  
That's something I've really 

00:26:22.272 --> 00:26:25.138
striveed
to do, is to write about people 

00:26:25.139 --> 00:26:28.392
who have been forgotten and left
out of the history books.

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:34.290
And Carveer has not been left 
out as

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:40.328
much as some of the people I've 
felt inspired to write about,

00:26:40.329 --> 00:26:43.168
but it was such a beautiful 
thing she 

00:26:46.848 --> 00:26:49.763
did writing a biography in
verse instead of the kind of 

00:26:49.764 --> 00:26:51.162
formal nonfiction with footnotes
http://upload.youtube.com/closedcaption?cid=pk87-p4dr-fpke-emzp

00:26:54.636 --> 00:26:55.892
that a child might not feel 
invited and welcomed to open the

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:01.790
pages and go, "Ah, this is 
written for me." .

00:27:04.271 --> 00:27:06.271
Have you ever told Marilyn that?
   &gt;&gt;  No, I haven't.

00:27:08.911 --> 00:27:10.911
I have

00:27:13.474 --> 00:27:15.525
&gt;&gt;  I have a special -- 
affection for this book.  It's

00:27:15.526 --> 00:27:19.220
incrediblely complex and 
difficult to write.  It ends 

00:27:19.221 --> 00:27:21.687
with an
across an -- a

00:27:22.907 --> 00:27:24.907
acrostic.  It will blow your 
mind.

00:27:26.611 --> 00:27:27.844
&gt;&gt;  It comes across very simple 
to understand for a child's

00:27:27.845 --> 00:27:30.491
reading.
   &gt;&gt;  It's an amazing book.

00:27:33.144 --> 00:27:33.957
Now we're going to move on to 
our panel as writeers.  It was

00:27:33.958 --> 00:27:37.226
very interesting to receive 
these books and go through them 

00:27:37.227 --> 00:27:39.227
and

00:27:42.948 --> 00:27:44.948
read them in preparation for 
this -- symposium.

00:27:47.483 --> 00:27:49.483
All three of them chose to use 
more than one viewpoint.  We

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:52.170
have alternating chapters or 
sections in all three books.  I

00:27:52.171 --> 00:27:55.426
thought that was an interesting 
thing to have in common.  I'd

00:27:55.427 --> 00:27:58.280
like you to tell us about your 
multiple characters and why you

00:27:58.281 --> 00:28:02.367
chose them to be the ones to be 
seen and heard in your book. 

00:28:02.368 --> 00:28:05.650
Margarita?

00:28:10.133 --> 00:28:12.133
&gt;&gt;  Well, Forest World is about 

00:28:16.216 --> 00:28:18.216
wilderness and in Cuba.  It's 
set

00:28:20.806 --> 00:28:22.806
in 2015 when President Obama had
initiated the peace-making

00:28:23.456 --> 00:28:27.524
process between U.S. and Cuba.  
And the only way I felt like I

00:28:30.587 --> 00:28:32.587
could show this peace-making 
process was by two children,

00:28:34.622 --> 00:28:36.446
siblings, who had never met each
other before, and that is very

00:28:39.518 --> 00:28:41.548
common where one grows up in 
Miami and one in Cuba.  And so 

00:28:41.549 --> 00:28:43.382
even
though I have heard people say 

00:28:43.383 --> 00:28:45.383
they 

00:28:48.103 --> 00:28:50.750
don't like readings, I just
say take a minute to read one 

00:28:50.751 --> 00:28:52.751
very short poem in the sister's
voice.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.240
She's grown up in a rural area 
in Cuba.  The reason I

00:28:59.707 --> 00:29:00.730
did multiple voices was to show 
the difference between the U.S.

00:29:00.731 --> 00:29:02.731
and Cuba.

00:29:05.627 --> 00:29:07.249
Now, the American brother who 
grew up in Miami, of course,

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:10.731
lives on his phone.  Everything 
is about WiFi.  And video games.

00:29:11.958 --> 00:29:16.082
And the girl who has grown up in
Cuba, of course, doesn't have

00:29:19.345 --> 00:29:21.345
access to WiFi.

00:29:22.843 --> 00:29:24.843
In rural Cuba, the fuel shortage
is to severe

00:29:25.713 --> 00:29:27.713
that most people depend on 
horse-drawn 

00:29:28.775 --> 00:29:30.775
vehicles or hitchhiking.

00:29:32.455 --> 00:29:34.455
And nightfall, the clip clap of 
horse hooves.  Rhythmic

00:29:36.143 --> 00:29:38.143
flashes from dancing fire flies.

00:29:40.667 --> 00:29:43.512
Around each curve the rising
moon.  Of long folktales, 

00:29:43.513 --> 00:29:45.513
stories of glow in the dark 
dogs, and

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:47.550
magical horses.

00:29:48.612 --> 00:29:50.612
My brother's fingers switch as 
if he's longing

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.494
to send phone messages back to 
his real home.  What was mama

00:29:58.624 --> 00:30:00.624
thinking forcing him to spend 
time here, 

00:30:02.452 --> 00:30:04.452
sharing our quiet
isolation?

00:30:04.788 --> 00:30:07.443
&gt;&gt;  Thank you.  Who says people 
don't like readings?

00:30:07.852 --> 00:30:09.852
[Laughter]
   I love them.

00:30:11.562 --> 00:30:13.388
I love hearing the author read. 
Right?

00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:15.389
Okay.  Mitali.

00:30:18.461 --> 00:30:20.461
So

00:30:22.741 --> 00:30:24.741
&gt;&gt;  You Bring the Distant Near

00:30:28.991 --> 00:30:30.991
.  The person who comes to 

00:30:35.416 --> 00:30:37.471
Flushing Queens from Ben 
Bangladesh.  Gee, I wonder where

00:30:37.472 --> 00:30:38.300
I got that
idea?

00:30:38.301 --> 00:30:43.167
[Laughter]
http://upload.youtube.com/closedcaption?cid=pk87-p4dr-fpke-emzp

00:30:38.301 --> 00:30:43.394
   The heroic generation is the 
first thing, those who come here

00:30:46.494 --> 00:30:47.311
seeking, that bear the 
sacrifice, the loss and the 

00:30:47.312 --> 00:30:51.581
cost.  The
narrative article really does 

00:30:51.582 --> 00:30:53.421
mostly belong to that first
generation, even though she's in

00:30:53.422 --> 00:30:57.086
the first-person voice.
   Then there are two girls who 

00:30:57.087 --> 00:31:00.549
are the second generation, which
is mine, the code switches.

00:31:05.462 --> 00:31:07.709
They know about village Bengali
life and American life.

00:31:12.197 --> 00:31:14.197
And they're gaining more agency 
in this

00:31:15.481 --> 00:31:17.511
culture than their parents had.
   That's my generation.

00:31:20.579 --> 00:31:22.579
And then the third generation is
my son's.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.485
And how Bengali
are really are they?  And how 

00:31:26.486 --> 00:31:28.486
important is that?

00:31:30.228 --> 00:31:33.479
People will often identify as 
Indian, my sons.  But there are

00:31:38.971 --> 00:31:40.627
22 major cultures and languages 
in India.  So for them, their Be

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:46.150
Bengali identity really is -- 
it's getting lost.  So there's a

00:31:46.151 --> 00:31:50.648
loss on both of those 
generations.  It's that middle 

00:31:50.649 --> 00:31:52.649
generation
that straddles that.

00:31:53.292 --> 00:31:55.292
So I wanted to see all of those 
generations and how

00:31:56.363 --> 00:31:58.631
immigration affects that.
   &gt;&gt;  Disappeared has two main 

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.040
characters, shareia share -- 
Sarah is a young

00:32:08.091 --> 00:32:10.941
journalist in Mexico.  We're 
exploring so many women in a

00:32:15.262 --> 00:32:17.262
certain period of time, their 
disappearance.

00:32:18.521 --> 00:32:20.521
The brother is a real go-getter,
track star and football star

00:32:22.447 --> 00:32:24.447
star, I should say, and has this
little business of a craft

00:32:28.994 --> 00:32:30.024
business, and the reason I had 
two voices is because they were

00:32:30.025 --> 00:32:35.530
kind of like two journeys.  One 
of them is the physical journey

00:32:35.531 --> 00:32:37.861
of Sarah and trying to stay 
alive as she 

00:32:42.752 --> 00:32:44.986
begins to uncover some
of the causes for the 

00:32:44.987 --> 00:32:46.987
disappearing girls and her life 
is

00:32:48.042 --> 00:32:50.042
threatened.

00:32:51.708 --> 00:32:53.708
And the other is more a moral 
journey 

00:32:54.975 --> 00:32:57.005
and thetism the -- the
temptations that happen when 

00:32:57.006 --> 00:32:58.833
you're poor, to try to make 
money

00:32:58.834 --> 00:33:00.834
through drugs.

00:33:06.154 --> 00:33:07.582
So there was both a physical 
journey and kind of a moral

00:33:07.583 --> 00:33:11.711
journey.  I think I needed two 
voices.  And sometimes I think

00:33:11.712 --> 00:33:17.627
like the two characters are just
part my myself.  Miliana is

00:33:19.869 --> 00:33:21.700
who I am and Sarah is who I 
would like to be.  [Laughter]

00:33:21.701 --> 00:33:25.380
   &gt;&gt;  Nice.  I'm hoping for 
honesty with this next one, when

00:33:25.381 --> 00:33:27.381
I

00:33:29.247 --> 00:33:31.916
ask you to describe a typical 
writing day.  For my honesty 

00:33:31.917 --> 00:33:33.917
will

00:33:36.208 --> 00:33:38.208
be email, e bay, Tetris.  Open a
document.  Tetris.  Okay. 

00:33:38.248 --> 00:33:40.284
Right.
   [Laughter]

00:33:41.306 --> 00:33:44.359
What is your typical writing 
session for you?  Mitali, we'll

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:48.014
start with you.
   &gt;&gt;  I'm motivated by shame.

00:33:48.216 --> 00:33:50.216
   [Laughter]

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:54.774
So recently, I have a strong 
suspicion that my editor editor 

00:33:54.775 --> 00:33:56.832
and
agent have discovered that about

00:33:56.833 --> 00:34:00.901
me.  Grace is here, my editor. 
Without a deadline, I just -- I 

00:34:00.902 --> 00:34:03.177
do the same.  I have the same
schedule as you.

00:34:03.787 --> 00:34:06.034
[Laughter]
   So I work best under a 

00:34:06.035 --> 00:34:08.074
deadline.  If I don't make it, 
there's

00:34:08.075 --> 00:34:09.491
http://upload.youtube.com/closedcaption?cid=pk87-p4dr-fpke-emzp
the horror of being ashamed.  

00:34:09.492 --> 00:34:11.492
Right?  And I work in coffee 
shops

00:34:13.155 --> 00:34:15.406
because I like that buzz.  So 
there's an app that you can

00:34:18.467 --> 00:34:18.869
download now called coffee shop 
buzz that you can actually have

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:20.870
that on your phone.
   [Laughter]

00:34:21.308 --> 00:34:24.184
&gt;&gt;  You're kidding.  Oh, my God.
[Laughter]

00:34:26.434 --> 00:34:28.434
&gt;&gt;  I'm one of those annoying 
people in the Bay area.  I

00:34:30.105 --> 00:34:32.737
shift coffee shops so I don't 
get that look like, "Get an 

00:34:32.738 --> 00:34:34.738
office
office." That look.

00:34:36.827 --> 00:34:38.827
I take up that space near the 
plug.  That's me.

00:34:39.286 --> 00:34:41.319
[Laughter]
   &gt;&gt;  Francisco?

00:34:47.371 --> 00:34:49.371
&gt;&gt;  I shouldn't say this because

00:34:52.813 --> 00:34:56.697
Arturo Levine, my editor
is in the office.  I sit in 

00:34:56.698 --> 00:34:58.698
front of the computer and I say 
I'm

00:34:59.963 --> 00:35:02.233
going to do this for two hours 
and see what happens.  I don't 

00:35:02.234 --> 00:35:04.234
do
quotas.  I just show up.

00:35:07.125 --> 00:35:09.125
Sometimes I make it a sentence 
or two

00:35:09.209 --> 00:35:11.279
and sometimes it's a page and a 
half.  I work in the mornings

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:15.364
and afternoons are for naps and 
to-do lists for my wife.

00:35:15.562 --> 00:35:17.562
&gt;&gt;  Nice.

00:35:20.056 --> 00:35:22.056
&gt;&gt;  Who is the wower -- writeer 
who said I spend all morning

00:35:23.115 --> 00:35:25.374
putting a comma in?
   &gt;&gt;  Just take everything 

00:35:25.375 --> 00:35:27.811
Mitali said and reverse it.  I 
need

00:35:30.058 --> 00:35:32.058
peace, quiet, solitude.

00:35:33.731 --> 00:35:34.180
I write with a pen by hand, 
preferably

00:35:34.181 --> 00:35:36.181
outdoors.

00:35:37.628 --> 00:35:38.671
And daydreaming is the essence 
of my process.

00:35:38.672 --> 00:35:40.672
&gt;&gt;  Oh, interesting.
   &gt;&gt;  Wow.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.556
&gt;&gt;  Because I'm sort of all over
over the map, I write my novels

00:35:43.557 --> 00:35:47.435
on the computer, but I do poetry
and pictures.

00:35:48.654 --> 00:35:50.654
&gt;&gt;  I do, too.
   &gt;&gt;  Okay.

00:35:52.538 --> 00:35:54.538
Now, the third section, which is
the panelists as

00:35:54.807 --> 00:35:56.638
authors, which is different from
being writeers.  Right?

00:35:56.639 --> 00:35:58.639
Okay.

00:36:00.545 --> 00:36:02.545
I'd like you all to share a 
favorite story about one

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:04.839
of your young readers that 
illustrates our theme of the 

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.840
power of
books.

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:09.070
I'm going to start on this one. 
My favorite letter I've ever

00:36:11.564 --> 00:36:14.222
gotten from a young reader.  
Dear Ms. Park.  I was absent the

00:36:14.223 --> 00:36:17.104
day we picked our author to 
write to, and you were the only 

00:36:17.105 --> 00:36:20.174
one
left.

00:36:23.383 --> 00:36:25.942
[Laughter]

00:36:32.474 --> 00:36:34.474
So my question for you is do you
know Gary Paulson?

00:36:39.953 --> 00:36:43.290
[Laughter]
   But I was delighted that he 

00:36:43.291 --> 00:36:45.291
had a favorite author, right?  
It

00:36:45.937 --> 00:36:48.198
doesn't have to be me.  But they
have to have a favorite author.

00:36:51.684 --> 00:36:53.684
Margarita, one of your young 
readers?

00:36:55.188 --> 00:36:57.188
&gt;&gt;  I have received letters from
people asking me to pass

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:01.230
messages along to other authors,
also.  But for me the most

00:37:02.949 --> 00:37:04.949
powerful moments have been when 
I read a poem that's very

00:37:06.851 --> 00:37:08.851
personal, especially when I read
from 

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:13.401
from my memoir Enchanted here. 
Very often a student will stand 

00:37:13.402 --> 00:37:16.247
up out of the crowd and read
their own poem to me, in front 

00:37:16.248 --> 00:37:17.058
of their classmates.  This has
http://upload.youtube.com/closedcaption?cid=pk87-p4dr-fpke-emzp

00:37:17.059 --> 00:37:21.547
happened to me on Skype.  It's 
happened in person.  The most

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.730
powerful moments have been when 
was a student who the teacher

00:37:29.731 --> 00:37:33.810
said, later, told me privately, 
"I didn't know that boy could

00:37:33.811 --> 00:37:35.811
read.

00:37:37.894 --> 00:37:39.894
" And he was writing his own 
poetry.

00:37:40.134 --> 00:37:42.984
And then also a young girl who 
came up to me and recited a

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:49.724
poem about being a homesick 
refugee.  And she was from 

00:37:49.725 --> 00:37:51.725
Syria. 

00:37:54.258 --> 00:37:56.258
And had just recently come to 
the U.S.

00:37:57.916 --> 00:37:59.543
So these kids that we are 
speaking to and reading to, 

00:37:59.544 --> 00:38:02.860
they're
writing.  And we don't know that

00:38:02.861 --> 00:38:05.909
unless we open up to them and
read our own work to them.

00:38:10.046 --> 00:38:12.527
And share it very personally.
   &gt;&gt;  She felt so seen, that 

00:38:12.528 --> 00:38:14.528
girl.

00:38:15.607 --> 00:38:17.607
Right.

00:38:19.514 --> 00:38:21.356
&gt;&gt;  I just Skyped with an 
intergenerational book club in

00:38:21.357 --> 00:38:23.357
Upstate New York.

00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:26.850
So the librarian had arranged a 
visit.  The

00:38:28.124 --> 00:38:29.353
senior center had read my book 
and teenagers had read my book. 

00:38:29.354 --> 00:38:33.039
They were discussing it together
and they were going to have an

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.685
Indian dance thing and a whole 
day.  This is the first day this

00:38:35.686 --> 00:38:40.380
has happened.  I gave my best 
Skype, I thought.  And then they

00:38:40.381 --> 00:38:43.075
started talking and they forgot 
I was there.

00:38:43.691 --> 00:38:45.122
[Laughter]
   I was just this head on the 

00:38:45.123 --> 00:38:47.123
wall.  One of them started

00:38:50.273 --> 00:38:52.100
sharing, one of the Indian women
there started sharing her story

00:38:52.101 --> 00:38:57.425
of her arranged marriage.  She 
started talking and all the 

00:38:57.426 --> 00:39:01.078
teens
were just focused on her story. 

00:39:01.079 --> 00:39:03.079
That was exciting to see that
connection.

00:39:04.136 --> 00:39:06.586
The other part -- I love this 
digital age and I'm a huge

00:39:06.995 --> 00:39:10.043
social media geek.  When you go 
to schools, and do you want a

00:39:10.044 --> 00:39:12.691
spoiller about the book?  Are 
you okay?  One of the characters

00:39:12.692 --> 00:39:14.692
dies in the book.

00:39:17.976 --> 00:39:19.976
And I was -- every book, every 
father in

00:39:20.621 --> 00:39:22.259
every book I write, is based on 
my dad.  So we had just lost my

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:27.364
dad right before the book 
launch.  So I had to go on -- on

00:39:27.365 --> 00:39:29.217
tour
and visit all these schools and 

00:39:29.218 --> 00:39:33.492
I thought, oh, gosh, how am I
going to make it through?  You 

00:39:33.493 --> 00:39:35.493
try to be professional.  I went

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:44.460
to this school incal Kalamazoo 
Michigan.

00:39:45.711 --> 00:39:47.711
The electty --

00:39:49.771 --> 00:39:52.646
electricity was out so everyone 
was shivering in coats.  This

00:39:52.647 --> 00:39:55.485
was a school with lots of 
immigrants and lots of refugees.

00:39:56.098 --> 00:39:58.098
I

00:39:59.145 --> 00:40:01.198
shared my story and a 
14-year-old boy's hand goes up. 

00:40:01.199 --> 00:40:03.246
I was
really trying to hide my grief 

00:40:03.247 --> 00:40:05.247
and I 

00:40:06.255 --> 00:40:08.255
thought I'd done a great
job.

00:40:11.019 --> 00:40:12.891
He asked, in a cracky 
14-year-old voice, I have a 

00:40:12.892 --> 00:40:14.892
question
question.

00:40:16.363 --> 00:40:18.190
He said, I loved that dad.  Why 
did that dad have to

00:40:18.191 --> 00:40:22.684
die?  I thought, oh, gosh.  That
was hard.  I thought, thanks

00:40:25.129 --> 00:40:30.455
for getting me choked up.
   &gt;&gt;  Yeah, really.

00:40:32.275 --> 00:40:34.526
&gt;&gt;  We're a very crying culture.
Feel free to jump in.  I

00:40:37.808 --> 00:40:39.808
started writing -- crying in 
front of all those 14-year-olds.

00:40:39.871 --> 00:40:41.871
The best

00:40:45.806 --> 00:40:47.234
part of that, I want to share 
with you, is that every single

00:40:51.305 --> 00:40:52.728
face in that room had so much 
compassion, because I had lost 

00:40:52.729 --> 00:40:54.729
my
dad.

00:40:54.962 --> 00:40:56.962
&gt;&gt;  Why do you do this to me?
   [Laughter]

00:40:58.269 --> 00:40:59.690
&gt;&gt;  This is a gift, my immigrant
gift to Americans.

00:40:59.691 --> 00:41:01.312
http://upload.youtube.com/closedcaption?cid=pk87-p4dr-fpke-emzp
   [Laughter]

00:41:01.313 --> 00:41:03.354
&gt;&gt;  We cry.
   &gt;&gt;  Make him cry.

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:06.980
&gt;&gt;  Make him cry.

00:41:08.232 --> 00:41:09.662
&gt;&gt;  I think probably I wrote 
this book about a young girl who

00:41:09.663 --> 00:41:13.539
is recovering from depression, 
day after a suicide attempt.  I

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:16.819
really wanted to make sure that 
book -- I tried very hard

00:41:20.693 --> 00:41:22.693
through various drafts to make 
sure I got it right.

00:41:24.973 --> 00:41:27.007
Approximate  -- if it
ended up in the hands of 

00:41:27.008 --> 00:41:29.008
somebody who was wondering what 
to do

00:41:31.318 --> 00:41:32.545
about life, that it would point 
them in the right direction. 

00:41:32.546 --> 00:41:38.049
The emails I get sometimes from 
kids that thank me for the book,

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:44.349
it makes it all worthwhile.
   &gt;&gt;  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank 

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:46.350
you all.

00:41:47.395 --> 00:41:49.395
[Holding back tears.]
   [Laughter]

00:41:50.842 --> 00:41:52.842
This question has choice for 
you.  Tell us about the next

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:56.110
book that's coming up for you or
what you're working on now? 

00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.818
Francisco?
   &gt;&gt;  This is the first time 

00:41:58.819 --> 00:42:00.819
I'm trying 

00:42:03.102 --> 00:42:05.553
to do a follow-up to
the previous book in Disappeared

00:42:05.554 --> 00:42:08.633
the kids kind of get to the --
   &gt;&gt;  Yeah.  I'm so excited.

00:42:09.651 --> 00:42:13.340
   &gt;&gt;  They get to the border 
and then so the next book is 

00:42:13.341 --> 00:42:16.182
their
lives, Their undocumented lives 

00:42:16.183 --> 00:42:22.291
in the United States.
   &gt;&gt;  Oh.  Wow.  Can't wait.  

00:42:22.292 --> 00:42:24.551
How far along are you?
   [Laughter]

00:42:26.978 --> 00:42:28.978
&gt;&gt;  I'm on -- my editor is over 
there so I can't say.

00:42:29.262 --> 00:42:32.727
[Laughter]
   &gt;&gt;  It's due this summer.  I 

00:42:32.728 --> 00:42:35.786
just asked him to define "summer
"summer" for me.

00:42:38.223 --> 00:42:40.254
[Laughter]
   &gt;&gt;  Summer in the Southern 

00:42:40.255 --> 00:42:41.918
hemisphere.
   [Laughter]

00:42:41.919 --> 00:42:43.919
&gt;&gt;  Okay.  Margarita?

00:42:46.815 --> 00:42:48.847
&gt;&gt;  Margarita: My next first 
novel is Jawza, the novel of the

00:42:52.106 --> 00:42:54.106
Jutsut riots.

00:42:55.807 --> 00:42:57.807
Their misnamed.

00:42:59.264 --> 00:43:01.264
They should be called the sailor
riots.

00:43:04.296 --> 00:43:06.296
It's about the sailors attacking

00:43:08.001 --> 00:43:10.001
the Mexican youth. 

00:43:11.277 --> 00:43:13.277
They're enrageed enrageed about 

00:43:15.573 --> 00:43:15.777
interracial dancing, that 
happened in my

00:43:15.778 --> 00:43:17.778
home neighbor.  It comes out in 
May.

00:43:21.742 --> 00:43:24.617
And then next year, Soar
Soaring Earth which is a sequel 

00:43:24.618 --> 00:43:26.618
to my 

00:43:27.628 --> 00:43:30.797
childhood memoir Enchanted
Heir.

00:43:34.538 --> 00:43:36.381
It's about the protests in the 
1960s.  And it's really

00:43:36.382 --> 00:43:38.618
embarrassing.  I will go into 
hiding when it comes out.

00:43:41.058 --> 00:43:42.688
[Laughter]
   &gt;&gt;  Can't wait for that one. 

00:43:42.689 --> 00:43:44.540
Okay.
   &gt;&gt;  I have my first picture 

00:43:44.541 --> 00:43:46.541
book comes out next year.  It's

00:43:51.406 --> 00:43:55.511
called Gifts for Abuela.  It's a
California story.  It's about a

00:43:59.991 --> 00:44:01.216
wall on the border and how -- 
it's about a little girl who 

00:44:01.217 --> 00:44:03.217
wants

00:44:06.084 --> 00:44:07.107
to get a gift to her abuelita 
across that wall.  That's my 

00:44:07.108 --> 00:44:09.108
next
book.

00:44:11.609 --> 00:44:13.609
Then I'm working on Boy Wonder 
and Cat Girl which is

00:44:13.667 --> 00:44:15.667
multiple narrators.

00:44:21.053 --> 00:44:21.663
I'm trying to get into the 
Bollywood super

00:44:21.664 --> 00:44:23.896
hero vibe.  It's about two teens
from Boston who 

00:44:28.743 --> 00:44:31.714
go to Calcutta. 
They just confront some of the 

00:44:33.127 --> 00:44:39.393
trafficking that happens in the
http://upload.youtube.com/closedcaption?cid=pk87-p4dr-fpke-emzp

00:44:33.127 --> 00:44:36.833
city of my birth.
   &gt;&gt;  I'll get on this.

00:44:41.059 --> 00:44:42.622
Next spring I have a picture 
book

00:44:42.623 --> 00:44:44.623
coming up.

00:44:47.093 --> 00:44:49.093
There are dragons in Eastern 
mythology and there's

00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:53.274
dragons in Western mythology.  
There are similarities but there

00:44:53.275 --> 00:44:55.275
are also differences.

00:45:00.097 --> 00:45:02.097
This is a little girl who has a 
mother

00:45:04.383 --> 00:45:06.383
from the East and a father from 
the West.

00:45:07.448 --> 00:45:08.061
It's my little mixed-
mixed-race dragon book.

00:45:08.062 --> 00:45:10.062
[Laughter]

00:45:14.084 --> 00:45:15.687
&gt;&gt;  I want to give a shout-out 
to Linda Sue Parker's parents

00:45:15.688 --> 00:45:18.581
who are here, too.
   [Laughter]

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:21.820
&gt;&gt;  My parents are here.
   [Applause]

00:45:23.495 --> 00:45:26.757
&gt;&gt;  My father got some love a 
few months ago on twitter.  He

00:45:29.826 --> 00:45:31.826
was asking for a good book to 
read and I 

00:45:36.781 --> 00:45:41.651
gave him Angie Thomas
Thomas' the Gift You Give.  He 

00:45:41.652 --> 00:45:44.299
kept a list of things he didn't
understand and he asked me, 

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:47.598
first, "what is this hose?" 
   So that was a fun 

00:45:47.599 --> 00:45:49.599
conversation.
   [Laughter]

00:45:51.064 --> 00:45:52.891
We're going to move now to a 
lightening round.  The questions

00:45:52.892 --> 00:45:55.966
thus far I did give the 
panelists so they could think 

00:45:55.967 --> 00:45:59.213
about it a
little bit.  These they had not 

00:45:59.214 --> 00:46:01.883
seen.  They start easy and
they're going to get a little 

00:46:01.884 --> 00:46:03.884
harder.  All right?

00:46:07.395 --> 00:46:14.546
IPhone or Android.?
   &gt;&gt;  EyeIPhone.  I'm an Apple 

00:46:14.547 --> 00:46:18.678
girl.
   &gt;&gt;  A iPhone.

00:46:19.284 --> 00:46:21.284
&gt;&gt;  Twitter or Facebook?

00:46:25.621 --> 00:46:28.685
   &gt;&gt;  Twitter.
   &gt;&gt;  Twitter.

00:46:28.888 --> 00:46:30.888
&gt;&gt;  Facebook.
   &gt;&gt; PROFESSOR:  Okay.

00:46:34.214 --> 00:46:35.040
R2D2 or --
   &gt;&gt;  That's a terrible 

00:46:35.041 --> 00:46:40.571
question.  How can you choose?
   &gt;&gt;  I like living organisms.

00:46:41.997 --> 00:46:47.124
   [Laughter]
   &gt;&gt;  R2D2 I think.

00:46:47.532 --> 00:46:49.532
&gt;&gt;  Okay.

00:46:54.015 --> 00:46:57.126
Chachala or Kilmunger.
   &gt;&gt;  I have no idea.

00:46:58.135 --> 00:47:01.182
&gt;&gt;  Pass.
   &gt;&gt;  Then just pass.

00:47:01.384 --> 00:47:04.645
&gt;&gt;  Pass.
   &gt;&gt;  What is the question?

00:47:06.908 --> 00:47:08.908
[Laughter]

00:47:11.433 --> 00:47:13.670
&gt;&gt;  Go see Black Panther.
   &gt;&gt;  Oh, man.  I feel 

00:47:13.671 --> 00:47:18.198
terrible.
   &gt;&gt;  Kilmuger.  All right.

00:47:18.604 --> 00:47:20.604
[Laughter]

00:47:25.139 --> 00:47:27.577
&gt;&gt;  Your Hogwarts house?
   &gt;&gt;  I read Harry Potter, but 

00:47:27.578 --> 00:47:31.248
that was a long time ago.  I
don't remember.

00:47:35.946 --> 00:47:36.765
&gt;&gt;  Ravenclaw, I think bit.
http://upload.youtube.com/closedcaption?cid=pk87-p4dr-fpke-emzp

00:47:41.083 --> 00:47:44.350
&gt;&gt;  Is Mytherine is term?
   &gt;&gt;  Slytherine.

00:47:44.963 --> 00:47:46.963
[Laughter]

00:47:49.984 --> 00:47:51.984
&gt;&gt;  The three of us are going to
to a 

00:47:55.341 --> 00:47:57.993
matinee of Black --
Panther.

00:48:02.022 --> 00:48:04.022
&gt;&gt;  That was a joke.
   &gt;&gt;  What do you think I am?

00:48:05.925 --> 00:48:09.819
   &gt;&gt;  A raveen claw.
   &gt;&gt;  I am a raveen claw.

00:48:13.956 --> 00:48:15.956
Desert island or pop recording 
artist.

00:48:16.796 --> 00:48:17.848
&gt;&gt;  Desert island, whatever that
is.

00:48:17.849 --> 00:48:19.889
[Laughter]
   &gt;&gt;  This is a complicated 

00:48:19.890 --> 00:48:21.890
question.

00:48:24.631 --> 00:48:26.598
&gt;&gt;  In other words, what 
recording artist would you more 

00:48:26.599 --> 00:48:28.286
--
   &gt;&gt;  Oh, I see.

00:48:28.287 --> 00:48:30.331
[Laughter]
   &gt;&gt;  You got to help me out, 

00:48:30.332 --> 00:48:33.166
Jason.
   &gt;&gt;  That's my fault.  It was 

00:48:33.167 --> 00:48:35.167
unclear.  The greatest love song

00:48:41.513 --> 00:48:43.332
of all all time: Let's stay 
together by the reverend Al 

00:48:43.333 --> 00:48:44.968
Green.
   &gt;&gt;  Anybody else have one?  A

00:48:44.969 --> 00:48:48.234
song?  Recording artist, album?

00:48:54.196 --> 00:48:57.694
&gt;&gt;  Benny Moray.
   &gt;&gt;  Okay.

00:48:58.511 --> 00:49:01.756
&gt;&gt;  Let it be.
   &gt;&gt;  Oh, wow, very nice.

00:49:06.832 --> 00:49:09.075
   &gt;&gt;  Last request meal?
   &gt;&gt;  That's so easy.  I'll go 

00:49:09.076 --> 00:49:11.076
first.

00:49:13.294 --> 00:49:15.294
My mom's

00:49:18.619 --> 00:49:22.338
cauliflower and
potato kurry.

00:49:23.356 --> 00:49:25.356
&gt;&gt;  Ice cream.

00:49:29.479 --> 00:49:31.479
&gt;&gt;  Rice and beans and hot 
chocolate.

00:49:32.561 --> 00:49:34.561
&gt;&gt;  Shayshek.

00:49:35.637 --> 00:49:38.490
   [Laughter]
   Okay.  Maybe you kind of 

00:49:38.491 --> 00:49:39.712
already answered this.  I'll ask
it

00:49:39.713 --> 00:49:42.404
again.  An author or book you 
wish everyone in the room would

00:49:42.405 --> 00:49:45.867
read.
   &gt;&gt;  Hmm.

00:49:50.754 --> 00:49:52.754
I'll start with with the Book 
Thief is one of my

00:49:54.812 --> 00:49:57.864
favorite books.
   &gt;&gt;  I'm judging a national 

00:49:57.865 --> 00:49:59.865
book awards this year so I have 
to

00:49:59.902 --> 00:50:02.754
be really silent.  I can't say 
anything.  I did love both of

00:50:02.755 --> 00:50:06.033
their books, though.  I have to 
put a plug in.

00:50:09.283 --> 00:50:11.283
These are both
excellent books.

00:50:12.792 --> 00:50:15.668
&gt;&gt;  Hold on a second.

00:50:19.583 --> 00:50:21.583
[Laughter]

00:50:27.836 --> 00:50:30.012
&gt;&gt;  I have a special love for 
Brown Girl Dreaming by

00:50:31.438 --> 00:50:33.438
Jacqueline Woodson because I 
think it's one of the most

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:36.731
important books of the century, 
but also she was writing it at

00:50:40.017 --> 00:50:42.017
the same time that I was writing

00:50:43.285 --> 00:50:45.530
Enchanted heir and I didn't
know and I'm sure she didn't 

00:50:45.531 --> 00:50:50.234
know that we were doing verse
memoirs at the same time.  So I 

00:50:50.235 --> 00:50:52.878
feel like that says that at this
point in time people from 

00:50:52.879 --> 00:50:54.879
marginalizeed communities are 
writing

00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:59.170
in poetry because I can't speak 
for her 

00:51:00.837 --> 00:51:02.436
but I believe that the
http://upload.youtube.com/closedcaption?cid=pk87-p4dr-fpke-emzp

00:51:04.904 --> 00:51:06.585
harshness of history requires a 
beautiful language and a soften

00:51:06.586 --> 00:51:11.073
softening of the blow that comes
with poetry.  I think that

00:51:14.322 --> 00:51:16.156
maybe we're facing things that 
couldn't be faced in prose.

00:51:16.157 --> 00:51:20.263
&gt;&gt;  Oh.  Interesting.  Wow.  I 
guess if I were answering I

00:51:23.364 --> 00:51:24.391
would just say in honor of this 
event, anything by Walter Dean

00:51:24.392 --> 00:51:26.446
Myers.  Absolutely.
   [Applause]

00:51:31.181 --> 00:51:32.409
And this is the last lightening 
round question.  It's a good

00:51:32.410 --> 00:51:36.297
one.  What's on your head 
headstone?

00:51:37.324 --> 00:51:39.324
[Laughter]

00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:41.882
&gt;&gt;  It's easy because it's my 
twitter bio-and my Facebook

00:51:41.883 --> 00:51:43.883
bio.

00:51:44.965 --> 00:51:46.965
It's just going to say: Beloveed
like you.

00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:50.264
&gt;&gt;  Oh, that's so nice.
   &gt;&gt;  Peace.

00:51:51.690 --> 00:51:57.075
&gt;&gt;  He tried to be human.
   &gt;&gt;  Wow.  Great.  Great 

00:51:57.076 --> 00:51:59.110
words.
   &gt;&gt;  But did he succeed?

00:52:00.367 --> 00:52:02.477
&gt;&gt;  I need your help for that.
   [Laughter]

00:52:02.882 --> 00:52:06.572
&gt;&gt;  Okay.  We're almost finished
and ready to hand on to the

00:52:08.401 --> 00:52:10.228
next exciting part of our 
morning, but I'll just ask you 

00:52:10.229 --> 00:52:12.229
to

00:52:13.524 --> 00:52:14.744
finish by keeping in mind our 
theme of the power of books.  

00:52:14.745 --> 00:52:16.795
You
have an audience here of readers

00:52:16.796 --> 00:52:20.259
and especially teachers and
librarians who work with young 

00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:22.260
people.  What one thing would 
you

00:52:24.544 --> 00:52:25.796
like to tell them to take home 
to the young people about your

00:52:25.797 --> 00:52:31.403
work on your particular book?  
Margarita?

00:52:34.253 --> 00:52:36.094
&gt;&gt;  Just that verse novels are 
interactive.  The white space

00:52:40.176 --> 00:52:42.176
on the page is not empty.

00:52:44.041 --> 00:52:44.847
It contains my emotions and the 
read

00:52:44.848 --> 00:52:46.848
reader's emotions.

00:52:47.928 --> 00:52:49.928
And you can invite students to 
write their

00:52:49.963 --> 00:52:51.963
own poems in response.

00:52:53.624 --> 00:52:55.471
They can jump in at any point on
any

00:52:55.472 --> 00:52:57.472
page and write their own poems. 
They can write the missing

00:53:01.489 --> 00:53:03.927
voices, because I certainly 
can't do it all.  There's the 

00:53:03.928 --> 00:53:05.928
old

00:53:07.408 --> 00:53:09.833
addage that a poem is never 
finished; it's just abandoned.  

00:53:09.834 --> 00:53:12.920
The
same is true of a poetry book.  

00:53:12.921 --> 00:53:14.921
It's not finished.  There's room

00:53:17.193 --> 00:53:20.033
for them to come in and write.
   &gt;&gt;  Do you want to go ahead?

00:53:20.034 --> 00:53:24.763
   &gt;&gt;  No.  You should be last. 
I think it's not about my books

00:53:24.764 --> 00:53:29.076
but I think the action item I 
would say is just to try to 

00:53:29.077 --> 00:53:31.077
mentor

00:53:34.227 --> 00:53:36.227
a young person in your life, 
just listen 

00:53:37.503 --> 00:53:39.939
to their works and word
words, help them along as best 

00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:45.046
you can.  You don't have to be a
writing coach.  But just one 

00:53:45.047 --> 00:53:48.143
young person that you find.
   &gt;&gt;  Jacqueline Woodson says 

00:53:48.144 --> 00:53:50.144
she's 

00:53:53.412 --> 00:53:55.412
trying to change the world
one reader at a time.

00:53:55.956 --> 00:53:57.956
&gt;&gt;  Yeah, that's great.

00:53:59.857 --> 00:54:01.857
I say play around with 
mirrorrors. 

00:54:03.334 --> 00:54:04.555
I found unexpected mirrors in 
books and so will the kids you

00:54:04.556 --> 00:54:06.556
serve.

00:54:08.831 --> 00:54:10.831
I say let kids roam freely.  
Don't limit them to be just

00:54:13.347 --> 00:54:15.347
an ethnic mirror.  They're going
to find that.  I say play

00:54:16.801 --> 00:54:18.801
around with your collections and
displays.

00:54:20.707 --> 00:54:22.707
I read from many in

00:54:24.409 --> 00:54:26.409
my career, we just don't have an
Indian reading population,

00:54:27.272 --> 00:54:29.917
Mitali, so that's why.  I don't 
hear that anymore.  Our books

00:54:29.918 --> 00:54:33.408
http://upload.youtube.com/closedcaption?cid=pk87-p4dr-fpke-emzp
are for all readers.  Really --

00:54:33.409 --> 00:54:35.409
   [Applause]

00:54:39.874 --> 00:54:42.786
&gt;&gt;  I am so thankful to WNDB -- 
We Need Diverse Books.  We've

00:54:42.787 --> 00:54:46.448
been writing for years and years
and years.  Because I don't

00:54:47.259 --> 00:54:49.259
hear that anymore.

00:54:50.926 --> 00:54:51.940
Let your readers roam freely.  
Find the

00:54:51.941 --> 00:54:53.941
mirrors.

00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:57.030
And just offer them diversity in
books.

00:54:57.267 --> 00:54:59.297
&gt;&gt;  I'm giving you the perfect 
ending because most of us use

00:54:59.298 --> 00:55:02.756
that windows and mirrors 
metaphor, which has been so 

00:55:02.757 --> 00:55:04.995
incrediblely
useful.  And here with us today 

00:55:04.996 --> 00:55:06.996
we have the originator of that

00:55:11.274 --> 00:55:14.197
phrase, Dr. Bishop.

00:55:17.409 --> 00:55:19.409
[Applause]

00:55:31.751 --> 00:55:33.751
He was doing this work before 
most of us knew it was work.

00:55:41.523 --> 00:55:43.523
So I guess a break now before 
our actual Walter Award sir

00:55:44.392 --> 00:55:46.392
money starts.

00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:49.123
I hope you had a great time, and
I think we did,

00:55:49.124 --> 00:55:51.965
too.
   &gt;&gt;  When Linda Sue Parker 

00:55:51.966 --> 00:55:53.966
said she wasn't going to do the

00:55:57.737 --> 00:55:59.374
basic cookie cutter panel, and 
we were in for a good ride, that

00:55:59.375 --> 00:56:01.375
was true.

00:56:06.366 --> 00:56:08.366
You have taken us on a journey, 
all of you, and you

00:56:10.658 --> 00:56:12.658
made us laugh and cry, and I'm 
glad none of you became the

00:56:13.294 --> 00:56:13.903
doctor or engineer you might 
have been.

00:56:13.904 --> 00:56:15.904
[Laughter]

00:56:18.326 --> 00:56:19.029
I wanted to say speaking on 
behalf of We Need Diverse Books

00:56:23.459 --> 00:56:25.459
it's been a pleasure to 
cosponsor

00:56:28.399 --> 00:56:30.399
this symposium with the
Library of Congress.

00:56:32.722 --> 00:56:33.326
We especially appreciate Leanne 
Potter

00:56:33.327 --> 00:56:36.168
with the Library of Congress.
   We're going to take a 

00:56:36.169 --> 00:56:38.169
15-minute break.

00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:42.670
-- coffee and tea in
the back.

00:56:44.148 --> 00:56:46.148
We've also set up book sales, 
and please go ahead and

00:56:46.398 --> 00:56:48.398
purchase those.

00:56:49.661 --> 00:56:51.661
We will be -- the authors will 
very nicely be

00:56:52.115 --> 00:56:54.350
signing during the reception 
that will follow.  We want to 

00:56:54.351 --> 00:56:56.180
make
sure that they have time to -- 

00:56:56.181 --> 00:56:57.821
we're celebrating them during 
the

00:56:57.822 --> 00:57:00.287
reception.  We don't want to 
make them work the whole time.

00:57:00.288 --> 00:57:04.574
   So no personalizing.
   And also, no photos for this 

00:57:04.575 --> 00:57:06.400
signing.
   And then we're going to try 

00:57:06.401 --> 00:57:10.485
to do that efficiently and then
let them enjoy and mingle with 

00:57:10.486 --> 00:57:13.344
all of you.
   So see you back here in about

00:57:13.345 --> 00:57:18.259
15 minutes.  And thank you.
   And thank you.  Let's give 

00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:19.071
one more hand for these 
wonderful

00:57:19.072 --> 00:57:21.952
panelists.

00:57:25.156 --> 00:57:27.156
[Applause]

00:57:30.275 --> 00:57:32.275
[Break

00:57:33.369 --> 00:57:35.369
taken]

01:22:51.051 --> 01:22:53.051
&gt;&gt;  If everyone would please 
take their seats.  Thank you.

01:25:51.557 --> 01:25:53.557
   &gt;&gt;  Hello.

01:25:54.975 --> 01:25:56.975
And welcome.

01:26:00.383 --> 01:26:02.383
There's nothing like an unruly

01:26:04.256 --> 01:26:06.256
crowd of librarians, teachers, 
educators, and publishers. 

01:26:07.114 --> 01:26:08.534
Networking is really great and 
we're going to do it afterwards

01:26:08.535 --> 01:26:12.008
at the reception to thank you 
very much for your patience.

01:26:14.037 --> 01:26:16.037
I'm Kathy Weinberg and I'm the 
co 

01:26:17.950 --> 01:26:19.950
director of the We Need
Diverse Books Walter Awards.

01:26:23.257 --> 01:26:25.257
We welcome you to the third 
Walter

01:26:25.921 --> 01:26:27.921
Dean Myers award for outstanding
children's literature.

01:26:29.610 --> 01:26:31.099
It's fitting to start with an 
often heard quote from Walter

01:26:34.755 --> 01:26:36.989
Dean Myers, whose legacy we 
honor with this award: Reading 

01:26:36.990 --> 01:26:37.598
is
not optional.

01:26:37.599 --> 01:26:39.599
http://upload.youtube.com/closedcaption?cid=pk87-p4dr-fpke-emzp

01:26:40.863 --> 01:26:41.898
This award says that children 
finding and seeing themselves

01:26:45.555 --> 01:26:47.555
in books is also not optional.

01:26:51.922 --> 01:26:53.922
We need diverse books founded 
with 

01:26:55.764 --> 01:26:58.442
with the hashtag, with 21
people and now it has grown to a

01:26:58.443 --> 01:27:00.443
global presence.  We know how

01:27:03.175 --> 01:27:05.008
global it is because one of our 
founders and the head of We Need

01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:10.629
Diverse Books,

01:27:14.469 --> 01:27:16.469
Ellen Hong, is out of town at a 
book festival.  I

01:27:17.945 --> 01:27:20.586
hope she's watching on the live 
stream.  Everyone say hi to

01:27:20.791 --> 01:27:23.646
Ellen.
   So We Need Diverse Books has 

01:27:23.647 --> 01:27:26.913
brought positive change to the
publishing world and the books 

01:27:26.914 --> 01:27:28.914
being published.

01:27:30.777 --> 01:27:31.994
And We Need Diverse Books 
started the Walter Award three

01:27:31.995 --> 01:27:36.467
years ago we had for your first 
year under 40 books considered

01:27:36.468 --> 01:27:38.468
for consideration.

01:27:42.189 --> 01:27:42.998
For The Walter 2017 we had 76 
commissions

01:27:42.999 --> 01:27:44.999
for The Walter.

01:27:46.896 --> 01:27:48.927
And for Walter 2018, while we 
did add the category of younger

01:27:48.928 --> 01:27:52.192
reader, our submissions were 
over 180 books.

01:27:55.658 --> 01:27:57.658
So that's the beginning of 
progress.

01:27:58.299 --> 01:28:00.940
We have a lot of thank yous to 
hand out today.  First, to the

01:28:00.941 --> 01:28:04.599
Library of Congress for their 
hospitality, especially Dr. 

01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:06.600
Carla

01:28:12.450 --> 01:28:14.887
Hayden, Lee Ann Potter, Clay 
Penchak, Sarah and Sasha.  We

01:28:14.888 --> 01:28:18.350
could not do this without the We
Need Diverse Books staff and

01:28:19.164 --> 01:28:21.164
volunteers.

01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:25.400
A big thanks

01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:31.500
to Carolyn Richman

01:28:34.553 --> 01:28:36.553
, Judy Striker, and
Christine.

01:28:40.527 --> 01:28:42.527
We also couldn't do it without 
Karen Brown.

01:28:43.255 --> 01:28:45.038
And we want We Need Diverse 
Books volunteers to please stand

01:28:45.039 --> 01:28:50.027
up.  All We Need Diverse Books 
volunteers, please stand up so 

01:28:50.028 --> 01:28:52.853
we
can thank you.

01:28:54.282 --> 01:28:57.826
[Applause]
   Thank you.

01:28:59.754 --> 01:29:01.754
We want to take a moment to 
honor the 

01:29:03.817 --> 01:29:06.468
memory of of of of the legacy of
Walter Dean Myers and thanks his

01:29:06.469 --> 01:29:08.514
family and friends for the
continued support of the award.

01:29:08.515 --> 01:29:11.769
   Of course, the award would 
not be possible without our most

01:29:17.503 --> 01:29:19.503
talented and slight slight 
slight 

01:29:21.601 --> 01:29:23.601
slightly bleary-eyed judges who 
have read some

01:29:25.213 --> 01:29:27.213
wonderful books today.

01:29:34.730 --> 01:29:35.139
Maria Salvador is over there, 
the

01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:37.140
codirector.

01:29:38.810 --> 01:29:40.810
And other members of the judges 
are here.  Would

01:29:41.856 --> 01:29:44.702
you please stand up so we can 
thank you?

01:29:47.342 --> 01:29:49.342
[Applause]

01:29:51.043 --> 01:29:52.263
And one we're on a thank you 
role, I want to say a big thanks

01:29:56.355 --> 01:29:58.355
to the publishers, many of whom 
are in your audience today. 

01:29:59.815 --> 01:30:02.072
Thank you to listening We Need 
Diverse Books and for supporting

01:30:02.073 --> 01:30:05.124
the need of diversity in 
children's literature.

01:30:07.358 --> 01:30:10.206
One last things to our audience,
educators, and readers, and

01:30:10.404 --> 01:30:13.872
librarians.  We could not spread
the We Need Diverse Books word

01:30:16.947 --> 01:30:18.947
and put diverse authors and 
characters 

01:30:20.769 --> 01:30:24.475
in the hands of children
without your help.  Thank you.

01:30:25.499 --> 01:30:28.384
   We have a wonderfully full 
program and to start it out I

01:30:31.599 --> 01:30:36.570
would like to introduce Mark 
Sweeney.  While we miss Dr. 

01:30:36.571 --> 01:30:38.571

Library of Congress and, plus,

01:30:51.854 --> 01:30:53.854

01:30:56.777 --> 01:30:59.220
   &gt;&gt;  Well, good morning, 
everyone here.  The energy in 

01:30:59.221 --> 01:31:01.221
the

01:31:03.284 --> 01:31:05.284
room is really infectious.

01:31:06.333 --> 01:31:08.333
I'm pleased to add my voice to 
the

01:31:09.545 --> 01:31:11.545
corps

01:31:13.722 --> 01:31:15.387
chorus of choice voices 
welcomeing welcomeing you here 

01:31:15.388 --> 01:31:17.436
today.
   We are here with We Need 

01:31:17.437 --> 01:31:19.437
Diverse Books to highlight 
diversity

01:31:21.299 --> 01:31:23.571
in children's literature.  Just 
four years ago, We Need Diverse

01:31:27.819 --> 01:31:29.819
Books began as a

01:31:30.972 --> 01:31:33.840
simple hashtag on twitter.  
Today, it's a

01:31:39.554 --> 01:31:41.784
501(c)3 with writeers and people
who span the globe.  The We Need

01:31:41.785 --> 01:31:45.880
Diverse Books team seeks to 
create a world in which every 

01:31:45.881 --> 01:31:47.707
child
can see themselves in the pages 

01:31:47.708 --> 01:31:50.759
of a book.
   The Library of Congress 

01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:52.760
shares this goal.  We are proud 
to

01:31:54.636 --> 01:31:56.073
have hosted this morning's 
symposium on diversity and 

01:31:56.074 --> 01:31:58.074
children's

01:31:59.325 --> 01:32:00.942
literature and also to be 
hosting this ceremony.

01:32:00.943 --> 01:32:02.777
Both events highlight and 
promote books that broaden our

01:32:06.431 --> 01:32:07.470
notions of diversity and engages
in meaningful conversations

01:32:07.471 --> 01:32:09.471
about them.

01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:14.466
To honor exemplary diverse 
books, We Need Diverse Books

01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:20.340
published The Walter the Walter

01:32:43.342 --> 01:32:45.342
and every child a reader in 
2012.

01:32:48.277 --> 01:32:50.277
We're delighted the emcee for 
this ceremony is a current

national ambassador
National Ambassador for Young

01:33:11.634 --> 01:33:13.634
-- her platform, reading equals

01:33:15.098 --> 01:33:16.519
hope and change, what's your 
equation, encourages young 

01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:18.555
people
to think about and beyond the 

01:33:18.556 --> 01:33:21.645
moment that they're living in. 
The power they possess and the 

01:33:21.646 --> 01:33:25.514
impact reading can have in
showing them ways in which they 

01:33:25.515 --> 01:33:27.515
can create the hope and change

01:33:29.614 --> 01:33:32.472
they want to see in our world.
   Please join me in welcomeing 

01:33:34.111 --> 01:33:34.319
Jacqueline Woodson to the 
podium. 

01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:36.320
Thank you.

applause]

01:33:45.971 --> 01:33:50.873
   &gt;&gt;  Good morning.  What an 
honor.  Okay.  I would be remiss

01:33:56.789 --> 01:33:58.872
to not do this for my personal 
panelists.

01:34:02.545 --> 01:34:04.399
You'll all get it after this
afternoon's viewing.  [Laughter]

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:06.400
   Oh, man.

01:34:09.105 --> 01:34:11.105
That was the best symposium 
ever.

01:34:12.390 --> 01:34:16.908
Ever.  I didn't
space out once.

01:34:17.113 --> 01:34:19.961
[Laughter]
   It really was the best.  So 

01:34:19.962 --> 01:34:22.603
thank you.  Thank you.  What an
honor to be in the room.

01:34:25.465 --> 01:34:27.465
And what an honor to be back at 
the Library of Congress. 

01:34:27.717 --> 01:34:30.562
There's so much love in the 
room.  This is a place that as a

01:34:30.563 --> 01:34:32.563
young person I never came to.

01:34:37.671 --> 01:34:39.671
I never thought it was for me. 

01:34:42.272 --> 01:34:43.903
And to Carla Hayden's staff 
here, the energy is amazing now.

01:34:46.985 --> 01:34:48.203
And to look around this room and
to see how diverse it is, to be

01:34:48.204 --> 01:34:53.700
in this moment of We Need 
Diverse Books is everything.  It

01:34:53.701 --> 01:34:55.701
is a
dream.  And beyond.

01:34:56.967 --> 01:34:59.419
So I just want to say to the 
young people in the room, hold

01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:02.911
fast to dreams, because this is 
what they become.

01:35:06.358 --> 01:35:08.358
And yall are amazing.  Amazing.

01:35:10.662 --> 01:35:16.928
I am still high on on the march
http://upload.youtube.com/closedcaption?cid=pk87-p4dr-fpke-emzp

01:35:10.662 --> 01:35:14.545
on the national walkout and all 
the work the young people are

01:35:14.546 --> 01:35:18.022
doing to change the world.  And 
all the work my fellow writeers

01:35:18.023 --> 01:35:20.286
are doing to keep us here.

01:35:23.923 --> 01:35:25.923
So what an absolute honor.

01:35:27.813 --> 01:35:29.813
I have a speech written because 
I don't get nervous unless

01:35:35.698 --> 01:35:37.698
they tell me that it's being 
televised.

01:35:43.044 --> 01:35:45.044
Suddenly, the intimas

01:35:48.568 --> 01:35:51.613
is the the intimac
intimacy is gone.  But all the 

01:35:51.614 --> 01:35:53.642
folks out there.  I see you.
   [Applause]

01:35:55.879 --> 01:35:58.131
We present our first book 
selller of the year award.  So 

01:35:58.132 --> 01:36:00.132
this
is going a little longer.

01:36:02.227 --> 01:36:04.073
It is a true universally -- see,
this is what happens.

01:36:04.074 --> 01:36:06.074
[Laughter]

01:36:08.978 --> 01:36:10.978
And for the Newbery, for thecal 
da 

01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:15.860
the Caldecott, ask the and the 
award being

01:36:21.628 --> 01:36:23.880
given this year, Laura Engles 
Wilder you have to write a 

01:36:23.881 --> 01:36:25.881
speech

01:36:28.388 --> 01:36:30.388
a couple months beforehand so 
they can record it.  I guess

01:36:31.491 --> 01:36:33.319
you're not supposed to mess up 
on it like I'm messing up right

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:36.581
now.  Just the idea of writing 
something long before you get in

01:36:36.582 --> 01:36:39.632
the room with the people you're 
going to say it to.  You don't

01:36:39.633 --> 01:36:44.471
know how the world is going to 
change.  It's changing to 

01:36:44.472 --> 01:36:46.926
quickly
quickly.  What you write two 

01:36:46.927 --> 01:36:48.927
months before a speech could be 
not

01:36:49.993 --> 01:36:51.616
so relevant anymore.
   But this is all very 

01:36:51.617 --> 01:36:54.261
relevant.  I do digress.

01:36:58.528 --> 01:37:00.528
That was all to cover up.

01:37:02.001 --> 01:37:03.014
It's a very New York thing to 
kind

01:37:03.015 --> 01:37:03.624
of knock you off track for a 
minute.

01:37:03.625 --> 01:37:06.299
[Laughter]
   It's truly universally 

01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:08.300
acknowledged that every diverse 
book

01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:12.819
is in need of a book selller to 
sell it.  Book selllers might be

01:37:12.820 --> 01:37:16.680
one of the most important as 
people who both curate 

01:37:16.681 --> 01:37:18.954
collections
and get books into the hands of 

01:37:18.955 --> 01:37:23.033
readers who will purchase them.
   They have the power to create

01:37:23.034 --> 01:37:25.874
best selllers, but more vitally
they have the power to 

01:37:25.875 --> 01:37:27.875
represent.  Meaning that 
children can go

01:37:30.754 --> 01:37:32.174
to their stores and either 
search in vain for books that 

01:37:32.175 --> 01:37:34.175
reflect

01:37:36.269 --> 01:37:37.283
their world or smile when they 
see themselves on the shelves.

01:37:37.284 --> 01:37:42.187
   Today, the first book selller
of the year award, a prize

01:37:43.817 --> 01:37:45.817
created because our organization
wanted to recognize the role

01:37:48.897 --> 01:37:49.099
that book selllers have as 
driveers of the publishing 

01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:50.925
industry. 
No one can read or buy a book 

01:37:50.926 --> 01:37:53.157
they've never heard of.
   This is our thank you to the 

01:37:55.608 --> 01:37:57.608
independent book selllers of our

01:37:59.519 --> 01:38:01.534
country for championing and, I 
might be mispronouncing that,

01:38:01.535 --> 01:38:05.514
because that's not a word I 
wrote.  I usually write words I

01:38:05.515 --> 01:38:07.560
pronounce a lot.
   [Laughter]

01:38:09.599 --> 01:38:11.599
But it means being champions of.
   [Laughter]

01:38:13.262 --> 01:38:15.262
The cause and diverse books and 
showing that they can, in

01:38:17.018 --> 01:38:19.043
fact, sell.  We do buy books.

01:38:22.132 --> 01:38:24.132
[Laughter]

01:38:26.068 --> 01:38:27.303
The winner of the first annual 
We Need Diverse Books selller

01:38:33.244 --> 01:38:35.043
of the year award is Sarah of 
carriage books and more in 

01:38:35.044 --> 01:38:37.472
Atlanta
Atlanta.  I love this bookstore.

01:38:39.026 --> 01:38:41.470
I don't have enough time to
talk about how much I love 

01:38:41.471 --> 01:38:43.100
Carris books.  One of the early
http://upload.youtube.com/closedcaption?cid=pk87-p4dr-fpke-emzp

01:38:43.101 --> 01:38:45.951
bookstores I visited and the 
community that happens there.  

01:38:45.952 --> 01:38:47.390
I'm
very proud to present this 

01:38:47.391 --> 01:38:49.391
award.

01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:52.900
As the oldest feminist bookstore
in the country, it's an

01:38:54.151 --> 01:38:55.367
institution that's proud and 
open about its mission to 

01:38:55.368 --> 01:38:57.368
reflect

01:38:58.829 --> 01:38:59.505
the wide spectrum of 
experiences, lives, and 

01:38:59.506 --> 01:39:01.027
familyies.
   Their excellence in the 

01:39:01.028 --> 01:39:03.028
support of diverse books is 
evident

01:39:07.167 --> 01:39:09.167
in the types of events that it 
programs, 

01:39:12.212 --> 01:39:14.212
in the antiracist

01:39:15.725 --> 01:39:17.725
resistance and LGBT book list, 
in its community outreach to

01:39:20.218 --> 01:39:22.464
librarians and schools and 
teach-in's, and, of course, in 

01:39:22.465 --> 01:39:24.518
its
collection which honors all 

01:39:24.519 --> 01:39:26.519
types of diversity.

01:39:30.869 --> 01:39:32.869
We Need Diverse

01:39:34.138 --> 01:39:35.973
Books is honored to present 
Sarah and Carris books with two

01:39:35.974 --> 01:39:38.416
awards, one for them to keep, 
and one 

01:39:41.463 --> 01:39:43.698
for them to keep at Carris
books until the next book 

01:39:43.699 --> 01:39:45.699
selller is nominated and then 
you have

01:39:46.159 --> 01:39:48.159
to give it back.  Sorry.

01:39:51.487 --> 01:39:53.487
Thank you, Sarah, and Carris 
books.

01:39:54.546 --> 01:39:59.277
   [Applause]
   No speech.

01:40:00.526 --> 01:40:01.519
&gt;&gt;  I think you have to stand 
here and let me take a picture

01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:04.135
with you.
   &gt;&gt;  Sorry.  We didn't 

01:40:04.136 --> 01:40:07.025
practice that part.  Sorry.
   [Laughter]

01:40:07.419 --> 01:40:09.419
&gt;&gt;  Thank you.
   &gt;&gt;  Thank you.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
   [Applause]

01:40:16.903 --> 01:40:18.903
&gt;&gt;  You might want to check your
luggage.  I've been stopped

01:40:18.943 --> 01:40:21.994
for these.
   And now we move on to the 

01:40:21.995 --> 01:40:25.045
Walter Awards.  Right?  Am I --
okay.

01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:27.917
[Laughter]
   &gt;&gt;  Any way you like.

01:40:27.918 --> 01:40:29.918
&gt;&gt;  Thank you.
   [Laughter]

01:40:32.039 --> 01:40:34.302
So now we move on to the Walter 
Awards and we start with my

01:40:34.926 --> 01:40:36.926
brother from another mother, 
Jason Reynolds.

01:40:39.814 --> 01:40:41.814
[Enthusiastic applause].

01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:45.133
&gt;&gt;  Who is here with his 
fabulous mother.  Jason Reynolds

01:40:45.134 --> 01:40:46.765
is
a New York times bestselling 

01:40:46.766 --> 01:40:48.766
author, a Newbery honor -- a

01:40:53.506 --> 01:40:55.506
Newbery honor -- a Newbery award
honoree.  You know what, I'm

01:40:56.776 --> 01:41:01.392
just drop the honoree.  Make it 
easy.  Jason is a Newbery award

01:41:01.393 --> 01:41:03.516
winner.
   [Laughter]

01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:07.940
A prince award nominee, a 
national 

01:41:08.986 --> 01:41:10.986

two-time Walter Dean Myers award
winner, and the recipient of

01:41:20.536 --> 01:41:22.171
multiple Coretta Scott King 
honors.  I think there was one 

01:41:22.172 --> 01:41:24.441
year
you got two at the same 

01:41:24.442 --> 01:41:26.477
ceremony, right?  Yeah.  He's 
not

01:41:28.545 --> 01:41:30.954
messing around, yall.  If you're
going to half step it, don't

01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:33.360
step at all.
   [Laughter]

01:41:35.613 --> 01:41:39.244
He was the 2017 spokesperson for
Indies first.  And he's

01:41:41.882 --> 01:41:43.102
brilliant and also not so hard 
too to look at.

01:41:43.103 --> 01:41:45.103
http://upload.youtube.com/closedcaption?cid=pk87-p4dr-fpke-emzp
   [Laughter]

01:41:47.820 --> 01:41:49.820
And will serve as the national 

01:41:50.963 --> 01:41:52.963
spokesperson for the 2018

01:41:55.015 --> 01:41:57.015
celebration of school library 
month, 

01:41:59.411 --> 01:41:59.714
sponsored by the American
association of school 

01:41:59.715 --> 01:42:01.715
librarians.

01:42:03.748 --> 01:42:06.442
We see you AASL.

01:42:11.728 --> 01:42:13.978
He has a number of books, 
including: As brave as you for

01:42:13.979 --> 01:42:18.031
everyone.
   I don't know that one.

01:42:19.018 --> 01:42:22.667
&gt;&gt;  It's not out yet.
   &gt;&gt;  Oh, okay.  It's not out 

01:42:22.668 --> 01:42:24.668
yet.
      [Laughter]

01:42:26.129 --> 01:42:28.129
And also long way down, which 

01:42:33.281 --> 01:42:33.480
received both a a new a Newbery 
and a 

01:42:33.481 --> 01:42:35.481
Prince honor.

01:42:36.747 --> 01:42:37.763
So I have a 10-year-old son who 
reads differently.  He listen

01:42:37.764 --> 01:42:42.291
listens to audio books nonstop. 
And every time I ask him,

01:42:44.325 --> 01:42:45.146
what's in his ear?  Jason 
Reynolds.  Jason Reynolds.  But 

01:42:45.147 --> 01:42:48.426
you
listened to that all right." I'm

01:42:48.427 --> 01:42:50.427
listening to it again." Jason
Reynolds.

01:42:53.711 --> 01:42:55.711
But he loves this writeer, as do
so many of us.

01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:04.080
Congrats,
Jason.

01:43:07.522 --> 01:43:12.456
[Enthusiastic applause.]
   &gt;&gt;  Thank you.

01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:19.436
Hi, everybody.  It's a whole lot
of yall in

01:43:20.249 --> 01:43:22.249
here this year.
   [Laughter]

01:43:24.762 --> 01:43:27.826
So I have a few minutes to say a
few words.  Thank you to the

01:43:28.855 --> 01:43:31.495
Library of Congress and to We 
Need Diverse Books.  I'm forever

01:43:31.496 --> 01:43:34.777
grateful for the work you've 
done.  Thank you judging panel 

01:43:34.778 --> 01:43:36.778
and
committee.

01:43:39.466 --> 01:43:40.073
It is never lost on me how 
fortunate I am any time

01:43:40.074 --> 01:43:44.138
anything like this happens.  I 
am truly grateful.  Thank you to

01:43:44.139 --> 01:43:46.139
my mama.

01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:51.522
[Enthusiastic applause]
   &gt;&gt;  I like to always tell 

01:43:51.523 --> 01:43:53.523
people it's important to make 
sure

01:43:55.259 --> 01:43:56.493
everybody who knows me knows 
her.  It's important to do that,

01:43:56.494 --> 01:43:58.494
at
the end of the day.

01:44:01.774 --> 01:44:04.307
All of us are -- our lives are 
sort of

01:44:01.774 --> 01:44:04.643
fleeting.  At the end of the 
day, when she's out of here, 

01:44:04.644 --> 01:44:07.078
when
I'm out of here, I want her 

01:44:07.079 --> 01:44:09.944
legacy to be as solid and 
perpetual

01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:13.628
as my own.  It's important.  
Shout out to my mom.  Thank you 

01:44:13.629 --> 01:44:15.629
to

01:44:16.675 --> 01:44:17.292
everybody who has been up here, 
all the honorees, autopsy the

01:44:21.169 --> 01:44:23.169
winners, this is so cool to be 
around such important and

01:44:23.235 --> 01:44:25.892
interesting people.
   And of course, the great 

01:44:25.893 --> 01:44:27.893
Jacqueline Woodson, these the 
only

01:44:33.331 --> 01:44:34.378
person I know who is so deck 
decorated, everything, has all 

01:44:34.379 --> 01:44:36.379
the award

01:44:37.884 --> 01:44:39.884
awards, and yet still somehow 
seems to not take herself so

01:44:40.944 --> 01:44:43.395
seriously.  It's good to 
understand what we're doing but 

01:44:43.396 --> 01:44:45.252
the
awards don't necessarily change 

01:44:45.253 --> 01:44:49.539
our character, or shouldn't, at
least.  Who we are is who we 

01:44:49.540 --> 01:44:51.540
are.  I'm thankful to you of 
being

01:44:54.416 --> 01:44:56.416
a big sister to my in in my 
literary world.

01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:02.160
Also my agent is here and my 
editor both of whom are

01:45:04.472 --> 01:45:07.179
responsible for all the work 
that I do.  Because you goet to 

01:45:07.180 --> 01:45:09.180
go go to do
that, right?

01:45:12.459 --> 01:45:13.269
Because somebody will be like, 
"You didn't even

01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:18.936
thank the committee." 
http://upload.youtube.com/closedcaption?cid=pk87-p4dr-fpke-emzp

01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:16.140
   All that is over.
   [Laughter]

01:45:18.374 --> 01:45:19.781
So I've been working on a new 
book.  I can't talk about it.

01:45:19.782 --> 01:45:21.825
   [Laughter]
   But I have all this stuff 

01:45:21.826 --> 01:45:24.280
happening in my brain and it's
moving around and I'm trying to 

01:45:24.281 --> 01:45:28.358
figure out what to do with it. 
I've been really working on this

01:45:28.359 --> 01:45:33.454
-- we all know the adage if a
tree falls in the forest and it 

01:45:33.455 --> 01:45:35.455
doesn't 

01:45:37.536 --> 01:45:38.798
make -- and nobody is there to 
hear it,

01:45:38.799 --> 01:45:41.447
does it make a sound?  I've done
some research on it and I think

01:45:41.448 --> 01:45:44.312
it's fascinating.  I've been 
digging around to figure out 

01:45:44.313 --> 01:45:46.141
what
does that mean for my life or 

01:45:46.142 --> 01:45:48.142
work?  What exactly are they
talking about?

01:45:51.862 --> 01:45:53.862
Turns  Turns out, though it is a
philosophical

01:45:55.551 --> 01:45:56.161
statement, it's actually a 
scientific statement.  

01:45:56.162 --> 01:45:58.162
Scientists are

01:46:00.645 --> 01:46:02.878
saying if a a tree falls in in 
the forest, there's a vibration 

01:46:02.879 --> 01:46:05.149
from
that impact and that vibration 

01:46:05.150 --> 01:46:09.017
travels to -- yall need to make
an announcement?

01:46:10.239 --> 01:46:12.478
Exactly.
   The tree falls, hits the 

01:46:12.479 --> 01:46:14.479
ground, there's a vibration.  
That

01:46:16.351 --> 01:46:18.189
vibration travels to the eardrum
and when it hits the eardrum,

01:46:18.190 --> 01:46:20.190
it makes the sound.

01:46:22.421 --> 01:46:24.421
If the vibration -- does not hit
the

01:46:26.379 --> 01:46:28.379
eardrum, technically, a sound is
not made.

01:46:28.408 --> 01:46:30.408
So the scientists are saying, 
technically, then it doesn't

01:46:32.983 --> 01:46:34.983
make a sound if it doesn't hit a
eardrum.

01:46:35.448 --> 01:46:37.448
For me, it makes sense sort of, 
except somehow in that

01:46:40.369 --> 01:46:42.369
argument it sort ophidiasis 
qualifies of 

01:46:43.857 --> 01:46:45.857
-- disqualifies the idea of the 
sound being

01:46:46.039 --> 01:46:48.068
made in the first place.
   So if a tree is a growing 

01:46:48.069 --> 01:46:50.069
thing, once it hits in the 
ground,

01:46:51.039 --> 01:46:53.291
there's a vibration made.  
Whether someone heard it or not 

01:46:53.292 --> 01:46:55.120
is of
less importance than the fact 

01:46:55.121 --> 01:46:57.768
the vibration was made.  So say 
it

01:46:59.807 --> 01:47:02.455
doesn't, then it disqualifies 
the life of the said tree.  

01:47:02.456 --> 01:47:04.456
Right?
   [Applause]

01:47:06.721 --> 01:47:07.534
Now, from a philosophical 
standpoint, which is other 

01:47:07.535 --> 01:47:09.535
argument

01:47:11.441 --> 01:47:13.677
argument, which is is the 
colloquial argument most of us 

01:47:13.678 --> 01:47:15.728
make when
we say this, we look at it as a 

01:47:16.944 --> 01:47:20.608
philosophical statement.  From a
philosophical standpoint I think

01:47:20.609 --> 01:47:23.665
that perhaps we're not
necessarily asking the right 

01:47:23.666 --> 01:47:25.666
questions.  Right?  It's like 
that

01:47:27.333 --> 01:47:27.945
seems like such a limited and 
simplified question to be asking

01:47:27.946 --> 01:47:31.676
about a tree that falls in the 
forest with no one around to 

01:47:31.677 --> 01:47:33.923
hear
it.  Because there are other 

01:47:33.924 --> 01:47:35.924
questions, extenuating questions
we

01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:37.582
should be asking ourselves to 
better understand the context in

01:47:37.583 --> 01:47:41.665
which a tree is falling in the 
forest with no one around to 

01:47:41.666 --> 01:47:43.666
hear
it.

01:47:44.314 --> 01:47:46.776
For instance, is the wind 
blowing?  For instance, was the

01:47:46.777 --> 01:47:48.777
tree struck by lightning?  For 
instance, is there something

01:47:50.439 --> 01:47:51.859
eating at the base of the tree 
which makes it less strong?  For

01:47:55.890 --> 01:47:57.628
instance, are their termites 
eating the tree from the inside 

01:47:57.629 --> 01:48:00.292
out
out?  All of this would help us 

01:48:00.293 --> 01:48:02.293
better understand whether or not

01:48:03.962 --> 01:48:06.038
it matters if a sound is made or
not if a tree falls in a forest

01:48:06.039 --> 01:48:08.039
with no one there to hear it.

01:48:10.927 --> 01:48:11.331
Now, let's transpose tree for 
child.  Right?

01:48:11.332 --> 01:48:13.332
http://upload.youtube.com/closedcaption?cid=pk87-p4dr-fpke-emzp
   &gt;&gt;  Bring it home.

01:48:15.197 --> 01:48:17.197
&gt;&gt;  From a scientific standpoint
if a child falls, and no one

01:48:19.707 --> 01:48:21.533
is there to hear it, does it 
make a sound?  According to the

01:48:21.534 --> 01:48:24.617
scientist, the child does not.  
According to what I'm arguing,

01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:29.126
though, if we say a child does 
not make a sound or the child's

01:48:29.127 --> 01:48:33.637
impact on that ground does not 
create a vibration, then we

01:48:35.466 --> 01:48:37.466
disqualify the life of said 
child.

01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:40.200
Now, from a philosophical 
standpoint, if a child falls, 

01:48:40.201 --> 01:48:43.005
does
it make a sound, again, I think 

01:48:43.006 --> 01:48:45.768
we need to ask more questions. 
Number one, was there wind 

01:48:45.769 --> 01:48:47.769
blowing?  Was there something 
there

01:48:48.022 --> 01:48:50.022
pushing the child?

01:48:51.693 --> 01:48:52.905
Was there something, a force, an
unseen

01:48:52.906 --> 01:48:54.757
force forcing the child down?  
Was there something eating at 

01:48:54.758 --> 01:48:58.006
the
child's base?  Something there 

01:48:58.007 --> 01:49:01.455
that maybe we don't know eating
at the child?  Were there 

01:49:01.456 --> 01:49:02.678
termites involved eating from 
the

01:49:02.679 --> 01:49:04.679
child inside out?

01:49:06.764 --> 01:49:06.967
Was lightening striking anywhere
in the

01:49:06.968 --> 01:49:09.803
vicinity?  Was anything on fire?
Was the ground weakened by

01:49:10.017 --> 01:49:12.017
anything?

01:49:15.907 --> 01:49:17.907
And lastly, lastly, why aren't 
anyone 

01:49:18.971 --> 01:49:22.021
-- like, where are the
people?  Right?  If a tree falls

01:49:22.022 --> 01:49:26.526
in the forest and no one is
around, does it make a sound?  

01:49:26.527 --> 01:49:29.383
The question is why is no one
around?  Where are the people?  

01:49:29.384 --> 01:49:31.648
Where is everyone?  Right?
   Because that's the question 

01:49:31.649 --> 01:49:33.649
that we should be asking.  That

01:49:35.964 --> 01:49:37.964
is what Long Way Down is 
actually about.

01:49:39.224 --> 01:49:41.896
Everyone is saying, oh
oh, it's about a kid in Ghana --

01:49:41.897 --> 01:49:43.897
no, no, no.  This is about the

01:49:50.845 --> 01:49:52.908
kid that we judge every single 
day, it's best we ask about 

01:49:52.909 --> 01:49:55.345
them. 
This book is not about any 

01:49:55.346 --> 01:49:57.166
child; this book is about you.  
You

01:49:57.167 --> 01:49:59.647
read the book.  Whatever you 
think happens to this kid at the

01:49:59.648 --> 01:50:04.353
end of this book has more to say
about you than that child.  Do

01:50:07.875 --> 01:50:10.525
your work to make sure our 
babies have a fair shot.  That's

01:50:10.526 --> 01:50:12.526
all
I ask for.

01:50:15.207 --> 01:50:17.207
I also want to say quickly to 

01:50:18.267 --> 01:50:20.706
Margarita, am I friend, at the
end of the day she could 

01:50:20.707 --> 01:50:22.707
probably explain the power of 
verse and

01:50:23.969 --> 01:50:25.969
novels far better than I could. 
I think the job she holds is

01:50:27.238 --> 01:50:28.256
very important and I think she 
understands the power of poetry

01:50:28.257 --> 01:50:32.932
and the power of verse and the 
force in the way that I hope to

01:50:32.933 --> 01:50:34.933
mature to some day.  It's 
important that she know that, as

01:50:34.980 --> 01:50:38.436
well. 
I appreciate you all.  Thank you

01:50:38.437 --> 01:50:40.437
all, very, very much.  Have a
good day.

01:50:43.124 --> 01:50:45.124
   [Applause]

01:50:47.148 --> 01:50:49.148
note Ghana

01:51:09.632 --> 01:51:14.726
   &gt;&gt;  I know.  You can't just 
drop mics that are attached to a

01:51:14.727 --> 01:51:18.586
podium.
   [Laughter]

01:51:20.431 --> 01:51:22.431
&gt;&gt;  Thank you, Jason.

01:51:25.144 --> 01:51:27.377
I think it's a good moment to 
just bring the the ancestors 

01:51:27.378 --> 01:51:29.378
into
the room.

01:51:32.981 --> 01:51:34.981
I do this as often as I can.  
When you hear the

01:51:37.695 --> 01:51:38.710
powerful words spoken by our 
writeers, I think it's important

01:51:38.711 --> 01:51:40.337
for
us all to remember the people 

01:51:40.338 --> 01:51:44.603
who came before us and how
important they were to who we 

01:51:44.604 --> 01:51:47.885
are now, to being able to stand
here.  And the people who have 

01:51:47.886 --> 01:51:49.326
left this world but still walk
http://upload.youtube.com/closedcaption?cid=pk87-p4dr-fpke-emzp

01:51:49.327 --> 01:51:54.649
with us.  So if we could just 
take two minutes and just shout

01:51:54.650 --> 01:51:57.511
out a name of someone who you 
want to bring back into the room

01:51:57.512 --> 01:52:00.768
or who is already in the room 
with us, I think that would be

01:52:05.053 --> 01:52:05.668
fitting in this moment of 
remembering Walter Dean Myers.  

01:52:05.669 --> 01:52:07.669
That's

01:52:09.283 --> 01:52:11.404
the name I'll say.

01:52:14.630 --> 01:52:16.630
&gt;&gt;  Virginia Hamilton

   &gt;&gt;  I just appreciate your 
power in the room.  So I just 

01:53:09.213 --> 01:53:11.213
have

01:53:12.324 --> 01:53:13.745

[Applause]

01:54:17.374 --> 01:54:19.374
   &gt;&gt;  Thank you, Jacqueline.

01:54:22.692 --> 01:54:24.692
Why'd you make me follow the
philosopher?

01:54:27.368 --> 01:54:28.584
After I heard Jason's speech, I 
asked Eric, you

01:54:28.585 --> 01:54:31.230
want to go next?
   [Laughter]

01:54:35.249 --> 01:54:37.249
&gt;&gt;  I'm going to start with an

01:54:38.754 --> 01:54:40.754
epithet.

01:54:42.819 --> 01:54:45.700
epitaph.  1938.  If this

01:54:48.752 --> 01:54:50.752
proverb, a book is a gardeen 
carried in 

01:54:54.035 --> 01:54:56.687
a pocket is true, then
Schomburg had a green thumb and 

01:54:56.688 --> 01:55:00.980
a harvest of pride.  There was
no field of human endeavor he 

01:55:00.981 --> 01:55:02.981
did not till with his determined

01:55:08.127 --> 01:55:09.996
hand, that he did not sew with 
seeds of curiosity.  Or that he

01:55:13.066 --> 01:55:14.290
did not water with a growing 
sense of African awareness and

01:55:14.291 --> 01:55:16.291
heritage.

01:55:19.579 --> 01:55:21.579
If a book is a garden carried in
a pocket, then

01:55:25.922 --> 01:55:27.922
Schomburg yielded a bumper crop,

01:55:28.981 --> 01:55:30.981
blanketed mount kill la minute

01:55:32.184 --> 01:55:34.184
jaro with African

01:55:36.073 --> 01:55:38.073
violated violets.

01:55:40.681 --> 01:55:43.129
If I had African violets I would
certainly give them to We Need 

01:55:43.130 --> 01:55:45.130
Diverse 

01:55:48.245 --> 01:55:50.245
Books, to my agent and

01:55:51.509 --> 01:55:52.520
publisher and my family and 
friends and to librarians who 

01:55:52.521 --> 01:55:54.521
have

01:55:55.778 --> 01:55:57.778
used my books and teachers who 
have used my books.

01:56:00.854 --> 01:56:02.854
And also my

01:56:04.937 --> 01:56:06.937
collaborator Eric Velasquez, who
pitched this book to me. 

01:56:10.402 --> 01:56:13.164
Schomburg brings my work full 
circle, just as does this 

01:56:16.175 --> 01:56:18.175
award
ceremony.

01:56:21.533 --> 01:56:24.177
His teacher in fifth grade told 
him his African American

01:56:27.664 --> 01:56:30.019
ancestors had no history worth 
noting.  I was told something

01:56:33.115 --> 01:56:35.115
similar by an 8th grade teacher.

01:56:36.775 --> 01:56:39.525
I went to an exclusive quake
quaker school in Baltimore and I

01:56:39.526 --> 01:56:46.031
was the only one who had
transferred from public school. 

01:56:46.032 --> 01:56:48.032
I got my paper back and the

01:56:49.523 --> 01:56:51.763
teacher gave me a B, and offered
only one comment: Did you write

01:56:51.764 --> 01:56:52.191
this?
http://upload.youtube.com/closedcaption?cid=pk87-p4dr-fpke-emzp

01:56:52.192 --> 01:56:56.261
   Obviously, he had expected 
less of me.  Ever since, I have

01:56:56.262 --> 01:56:59.500
striveed to use my pen to affirm
my heritage and culture.  When I

01:56:59.501 --> 01:57:03.379
was an inspiring children's book
writeer, before I had anything

01:57:06.439 --> 01:57:06.843
published by adult poetry, I 
studied the work of Walter Dean

01:57:06.844 --> 01:57:10.104
Myers.  Among the mentor texts I
turned to 

01:57:13.374 --> 01:57:15.374
were Brown Baby --
I'm sorry.

01:57:22.626 --> 01:57:24.626
Brown Angels, Harlem to Harlem, 
and 

01:57:25.891 --> 01:57:27.891
One More Rivet
Across.

01:57:29.150 --> 01:57:31.150
Many years later, 20 years to be

01:57:33.994 --> 01:57:38.341
exact, I did research at
Howard University.  And to the 

01:57:38.342 --> 01:57:40.573
Library of Congress prints and
photographs department, in this 

01:57:40.574 --> 01:57:42.824
very building.
   I was looking for images to 

01:57:42.825 --> 01:57:47.348
accompany my poems.  Instead, I
found pictures that begged for 

01:57:47.349 --> 01:57:54.095
words.  Some were of historic
figures.  Others were of 

01:57:54.096 --> 01:57:54.727
everyday people whose names had 
been

01:57:54.728 --> 01:57:58.826
lost.  I wrote poems to give 
them voices.  I began right then

01:57:58.827 --> 01:58:00.865
and there collecting images and 
stories.

01:58:03.106 --> 01:58:05.131
I'm going to close with a poem 
from that book.  That first

01:58:07.381 --> 01:58:12.089
led me to the Schomburg center.
   Remember the bridge.  

01:58:12.090 --> 01:58:13.715
Remember the bridge that your 
ancestors

01:58:13.716 --> 01:58:15.381
crossed, the sweat that was 
spillled and the lives that were

01:58:15.382 --> 01:58:18.020
lost
lost.  Remember the slaves who 

01:58:18.021 --> 01:58:20.021
raised corn and cotton.  Keep

01:58:22.344 --> 01:58:24.171
singing their songs so they 
won't be forgotten.  The under

01:58:24.172 --> 01:58:26.818
ground railroad that passed 
through at night.  The signs and

01:58:30.634 --> 01:58:32.299
conductors that guided slaves' 
flight.  Remember the soldiers

01:58:32.300 --> 01:58:36.587
who fought though they knew they
might not be free when the

01:58:36.588 --> 01:58:38.588
battle was through.

01:58:39.859 --> 01:58:41.859
Remember the old souls who 
handed down tale

01:58:42.707 --> 01:58:43.515
tales, the bold men and women 
who blazed their own trails from

01:58:43.516 --> 01:58:46.173
the south to the north, from 
farm to big 

01:58:49.831 --> 01:58:51.831
city, with satchels of
dreams and new use for pity.

01:58:56.764 --> 01:58:58.764
Remember the boot blocks blacks,
the

01:59:00.641 --> 01:59:01.453
industryious laborers, remember 
the housemaids who scrubbed 

01:59:01.454 --> 01:59:03.703
dirty
floors, the readers who spoke 

01:59:03.704 --> 01:59:05.704
out.

01:59:08.613 --> 01:59:11.053
Remember the hard way the
answer cess stores came, 

01:59:11.054 --> 01:59:13.087
snatched from the mother land, 
bound in

01:59:13.291 --> 01:59:15.291
chains.

01:59:16.367 --> 01:59:19.013
Remember the voyage, the 
capture, the chase, young

01:59:22.475 --> 01:59:24.135
warriors who vanished without 
even a trace.  Long shadows on

01:59:28.405 --> 01:59:30.405
shorelines and foot prints in 
sand.

01:59:33.319 --> 01:59:35.319
Forget not to temples of

01:59:37.131 --> 01:59:39.131
Africa's past

01:59:42.744 --> 01:59:44.744
.  Ebony statues and -- hands 
reach across water. 

01:59:45.387 --> 01:59:48.689
Hearts sing a new song.  Thank 
you.

01:59:51.902 --> 01:59:53.902
[Applause]

02:00:07.265 --> 02:00:11.780
   &gt;&gt;  Posing for the picture 
thing is the most awkward part. 

02:00:11.781 --> 02:00:15.870
Right?  Thank you so much for 
that, Carol.  That poem was 

02:00:15.871 --> 02:00:17.871
lovely
lovely.

02:00:19.491 --> 02:00:21.491
Oh, man.

02:00:24.879 --> 02:00:26.879
Eric Velasquez.

02:00:28.349 --> 02:00:30.349
One cool thing is the children's
book writing community is small.

02:00:31.625 --> 02:00:35.294
So we all know each other.  A
lot of us know each other.  A 

02:00:35.295 --> 02:00:37.326
lot of us go way way back.  And
when we get together we have a 

02:00:37.327 --> 02:00:39.327
lot of catching up to do.  So it

02:00:43.509 --> 02:00:45.339
was so great to be reunited last
night and to be able to gossip

02:00:45.340 --> 02:00:47.603
about all that stuff we didn't 
get a chance to talk about, and

02:00:47.604 --> 02:00:49.604
to catch up.

02:00:51.275 --> 02:00:52.699
And I want to make a point about
the importance of picture

02:00:52.700 --> 02:00:56.158
books.  I feel like when I read 
Schomburg I learned so much that

02:00:56.159 --> 02:01:01.257
I didn't know.  And I think 
sometimes we think picture books

02:01:01.258 --> 02:01:05.658
are
http://upload.youtube.com/closedcaption?cid=pk87-p4dr-fpke-emzp

02:01:01.258 --> 02:01:03.258
for young people.

02:01:05.146 --> 02:01:08.014
They really are for everyone.

02:01:11.229 --> 02:01:13.229
[Applause]

02:01:14.328 --> 02:01:16.576
And they're a great way to teach
about the narrative arc. 

02:01:18.624 --> 02:01:20.264
There's a great way to teach 
poetry.  So many of the forms 

02:01:20.265 --> 02:01:22.265
are

02:01:24.965 --> 02:01:26.594
so poetic poetic, so get these 
books into the hands of writeers

02:01:26.595 --> 02:01:30.303
of all
ages.  They're ground breaking 

02:01:30.304 --> 02:01:32.557
and important and world 
changing.

02:01:37.053 --> 02:01:37.460
Eric Velasquez is the 
illustrateor of numerous books 

02:01:37.461 --> 02:01:39.461
for

02:01:40.719 --> 02:01:41.325
children, including several 
previous collections with Carole

02:01:41.326 --> 02:01:43.326
Boston Weatherford.

02:01:44.802 --> 02:01:46.802
He won the illustrator award for
his

02:01:50.106 --> 02:01:51.741
illustrations of the Piano Man 
if you haven't seen and read it,

02:01:51.742 --> 02:01:53.742
you must.

02:02:00.290 --> 02:02:02.523
Written by Debbie Chocolate.  He
also is the

02:02:07.676 --> 02:02:09.742
illustrateor of the award 
winning Grandma'S Gift people 

02:02:09.743 --> 02:02:11.743
born in

02:02:12.809 --> 02:02:15.667
Harlem are so the real thing to 
me.  I was always so jealous of

02:02:15.668 --> 02:02:17.698
black people born in Harlem.

02:02:20.746 --> 02:02:22.746
[Laughter]

02:02:26.268 --> 02:02:28.294
His work is mind blowing and he 
is mind blowing and I'm so

02:02:31.144 --> 02:02:32.372
glad to share this stage with 
him and present him with his 

02:02:32.373 --> 02:02:34.373
award
award.

02:02:38.415 --> 02:02:40.415
[Applause]

02:02:44.392 --> 02:02:47.229
   &gt;&gt;  Wow.  There is a lot of 
you in here.

02:02:47.636 --> 02:02:49.636
[Laughter]
   &gt;&gt;  Okay.

02:02:52.387 --> 02:02:54.387
Well, I have my speech.  Okay.

02:02:56.670 --> 02:02:58.293
So I wanted to
start with those that didn't see

02:02:58.294 --> 02:03:00.294
the video that I recorded for

02:03:04.610 --> 02:03:05.831
the We Need Diverse Books 
organization, that my wish and 

02:03:05.832 --> 02:03:07.832
my wish

02:03:09.282 --> 02:03:11.734
is that in my lifetime we'll 
replace this word "diversity,"

02:03:11.735 --> 02:03:17.438
especially in books, with the 
word" normal." That's a simple

02:03:17.439 --> 02:03:20.084
concept.
   [Laughter]

02:03:22.553 --> 02:03:25.400
Diversity in my house didn't 
really exist.  I grew up in a

02:03:25.401 --> 02:03:29.059
Spanish speaking household but 
we went to the movies to see

02:03:31.514 --> 02:03:33.747
American films that spoke 
English.  Watched Spanish 

02:03:33.748 --> 02:03:35.748
speaking
television.

02:03:36.997 --> 02:03:38.228
Listened to salsa music but also
listened to the 

02:03:38.229 --> 02:03:41.967
Temptations.  It's like, wow, 
wait, diversity is like 

02:03:41.968 --> 02:03:43.968
everything
everything?  But that's my life.

02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:48.880
But that's my wish for all of
you, that lots of normal.

02:03:49.552 --> 02:03:54.032
Okay.  So now to my thank yous. 
So I want to thank the We

02:03:56.318 --> 02:03:58.318
Need Diverse Books organization.

02:03:59.581 --> 02:04:02.220
As well as the Walter Dean
Myers judging committee.

02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:06.371
Which is named after my friend 
Walter

02:04:06.372 --> 02:04:08.372
Dean Myers.

02:04:10.268 --> 02:04:12.103
Thank you to Reuben my agent for
helping this project find

02:04:12.104 --> 02:04:14.104
a home.

02:04:16.590 --> 02:04:18.590
I would also like to thank our 
editor, 

02:04:19.836 --> 02:04:22.076
art directors
for their hard work and 

02:04:22.077 --> 02:04:24.077
dedication to this project.

02:04:27.002 --> 02:04:29.002
And to the public relations team
for 

02:04:30.082 --> 02:04:32.082
their tireless efforts.

02:04:35.619 --> 02:04:37.619
To master author Carole Boston 
Weatherford, thank you for

02:04:40.554 --> 02:04:42.584
writing a glorious manuscript.  
You truly outdid yourself with

02:04:42.585 --> 02:04:45.664
this one, our fifth 
collaboration.

02:04:48.948 --> 02:04:50.948
I want to thank the love of my 
life, 

02:04:52.795 --> 02:04:54.795
Elizabeth Rosario, not

02:04:57.430 --> 02:04:59.430
only for posing as Elizabeth and

02:05:00.764 --> 02:05:02.764
Philis Whitley, but also for

02:05:04.632 --> 02:05:06.894
the love, support, reassurance, 
and strength.  You are my rock.

02:05:08.337 --> 02:05:08.527
   [Applause]
http://upload.youtube.com/closedcaption?cid=pk87-p4dr-fpke-emzp

02:05:08.528 --> 02:05:10.771
   Okay.

02:05:16.065 --> 02:05:18.065
I first became aware of Arturo 
Schomburg in the third

02:05:18.092 --> 02:05:20.092
grade.

02:05:21.564 --> 02:05:23.564
My teacher, Ms.

02:05:27.270 --> 02:05:29.270
Holmes, kept a poster of him on 
her

02:05:29.532 --> 02:05:31.988
classroom room, along with 
Martin Luther King junior and 

02:05:31.989 --> 02:05:33.989
Malcolm

02:05:37.127 --> 02:05:39.127
X and Marcus Garvey, where he 
has the uniform.  Yeah.

02:05:42.255 --> 02:05:44.255
But what a gift the day she said
to me that Arturo Schomburg

02:05:45.745 --> 02:05:47.745
and I shared something in 
common.

02:05:49.039 --> 02:05:51.039
That we both had roots in
Puerto Rico.

02:05:54.133 --> 02:05:56.133
Has she continued with a brief 
talk on Arturo

02:05:57.192 --> 02:05:59.192
Schomburg for the first time in 
my life I found a hero that

02:06:00.261 --> 02:06:02.261
looked like me and that I can 
identify with.

02:06:03.321 --> 02:06:05.321
I could not wait to get home and
ask my grandma if she knew

02:06:07.383 --> 02:06:10.233
this great man responsible for 
the library on 135th street in

02:06:10.234 --> 02:06:14.946
Harlem.

02:06:18.404 --> 02:06:20.404
I asked her, thinking I would 
throw 

02:06:21.505 --> 02:06:24.587
her off with the name.  [
[Speaking Spanish]

02:06:30.668 --> 02:06:32.668
Of course, that man was a 
genius, she said.

02:06:33.611 --> 02:06:35.611
[Spanish]

02:06:36.652 --> 02:06:39.314
The name place we come from.
   However, aside from 

02:06:39.315 --> 02:06:41.315
Schomburg's collection of books 
and

02:06:42.600 --> 02:06:45.073
artifacts, she didn't know much 
more about the man.

02:06:49.356 --> 02:06:51.607
37 years later, while at the 
Schomburg Center attending a

02:06:53.433 --> 02:06:55.478
performance of the last poets 
with Elizabeth and her good 

02:06:55.479 --> 02:06:57.479
friend

02:06:59.358 --> 02:07:01.358
Sheena, Sheena turns to me and 
says, you know, there are no

02:07:02.815 --> 02:07:04.641
children's books on Arturo 
Schomburg.  You know, you ought 

02:07:04.642 --> 02:07:06.642
to
think about doing that book.

02:07:06.879 --> 02:07:08.879
[Laughter]

02:07:10.162 --> 02:07:12.162
Suddenly, I realized that this 
was 

02:07:13.413 --> 02:07:15.413
the hand handsome man in that

02:07:16.906 --> 02:07:17.921
poster that I would stare at day
after day in the third grade. 

02:07:23.501 --> 02:07:25.501
That genius that my grandmother 
talked about.

02:07:26.988 --> 02:07:28.988
I contacted Carol immediately 
and 

02:07:33.523 --> 02:07:36.780
asked her to write me a
manuscript on Schomburg.  That 

02:07:36.781 --> 02:07:40.030
was 2006.  We submitted the
project to several publishing 

02:07:40.031 --> 02:07:42.688
houses and we were rejected
everywhere.

02:07:45.539 --> 02:07:47.972
This is just the story about a 
man who collected books?  So

02:07:49.398 --> 02:07:52.646
boring.  Can't you jazz him up a
little bit?  You know?

02:07:55.695 --> 02:07:57.695
Well, it didn't happen then.

02:08:03.079 --> 02:08:05.079
In 2014, our now agent Ruben 
Sepher 

02:08:06.143 --> 02:08:08.143
decided to give it a
another try.

02:08:10.232 --> 02:08:12.232
After a lot of work, a new 
manuscript and sketches,

02:08:13.921 --> 02:08:15.921
Schomburg: The Man Who Built a 
Library 

02:08:19.422 --> 02:08:20.849
found a home at Candle
Candlewick Press.

02:08:20.850 --> 02:08:22.850
What a journey.

02:08:27.004 --> 02:08:29.004
However, through Carol's word I 
truly

02:08:30.463 --> 02:08:32.516
discovered Schomburg's genius 
and a true gift to all of us.

02:08:32.517 --> 02:08:35.990
   This project changed my life 
in so many ways.  I even ended

02:08:35.991 --> 02:08:37.991
up in the hospital, didn't I?

02:08:41.686 --> 02:08:43.686
I even met Dean Schomburg, 
Arturo

02:08:44.530 --> 02:08:47.178
Schomburg's grandson, who is now
a man in his 70s.  I met his

02:08:49.204 --> 02:08:51.861
daughter and her son Miles.  So 
that's Schomburg's great great

02:08:51.862 --> 02:08:53.862
grandson.

02:08:56.749 --> 02:08:58.749
So I conclude with Arturo 
Schomburg, 

02:09:01.505 --> 02:09:03.505
I say, gracias...[
gracias...

02:09:04.964 --> 02:09:07.962
[Spanish].

02:09:11.061 --> 02:09:13.061
[Applause]

02:09:27.035 --> 02:09:27.233

cid=pk87-p4dr-fpke-emzp

02:09:27.234 --> 02:09:29.234
&gt;&gt;  Oh.

02:09:30.505 --> 02:09:33.151
Okay.  Awesome.

02:09:39.278 --> 02:09:41.278
na-na-na-na-na to the
publishers who said no.

02:09:44.039 --> 02:09:46.293
   [Laughter]

02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:51.960
I bet you you'll look quite hard

first Latino -- why does it say 
Latino?

02:10:49.846 --> 02:10:55.151
Isn't it Latina and Lat
Lati in-X?  We're only talking 

02:10:55.152 --> 02:10:57.152
about a woman?

02:10:59.833 --> 02:11:00.444
&gt;&gt;  In Spanish, it includes 
both.

02:11:00.445 --> 02:11:02.445

02:11:09.064 --> 02:11:11.064

how fabulous you all were on the

02:11:49.044 --> 02:11:51.044
panel.

02:11:52.298 --> 02:11:54.298
And how eye-opening it was.  For
those of you who missed

02:12:00.386 --> 02:12:03.499
it, that revolution is going to 
be televised, right?  Hopefully

02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:05.500

know where she lives.  We got 

02:12:17.385 --> 02:12:22.263

was doing the panel.  I was 

02:12:22.264 --> 02:12:25.158
beyond honored to present Mitali
with this award.

02:13:02.419 --> 02:13:05.106
I didn't know about this 
particular book until my 

02:13:05.107 --> 02:13:06.551
16-year-old
daughter came to me and said, 

02:13:06.552 --> 02:13:09.198
you need to read this book.  I 
was

02:13:10.016 --> 02:13:12.016
mad she knew something I didn't.
So lovely and world changing

02:13:14.076 --> 02:13:15.110

02:14:16.563 --> 02:14:18.390
http://upload.youtube.com/closedcaption?cid=pk87-p4dr-fpke-emzp
   But fortunately, we're ready 

02:14:18.391 --> 02:14:20.391
to start the reception.  We'll
start.

02:14:23.893 --> 02:14:24.711
We'll have more time for 
mingleing and getting able to

02:14:24.712 --> 02:14:27.555
talk to the authors.  They're 
going to go over to the book

02:14:29.603 --> 02:14:30.818
signing table, after they go 
over with the judges and have a

02:14:30.819 --> 02:14:32.819
photo with the judges.

02:14:36.512 --> 02:14:38.512
So Walter honor or award winner 

02:14:39.579 --> 02:14:41.215
being,, if you go over there and
get

02:14:41.216 --> 02:14:42.028
a picture with the judges, that 
would be nice.  We'll do that

02:14:42.029 --> 02:14:46.936
first.  Then they'll go over and
they'll be signing.  Strict

02:14:49.803 --> 02:14:50.623
orders, they'll just be signing,
and no photos.  I'm sorry about

02:14:50.624 --> 02:14:54.113
that, but we want them to have 
time to enjoy themselves because

02:14:54.114 --> 02:14:59.812
they certainly earned it.
   So thank you, all.  You've 

02:14:59.813 --> 02:15:01.438
been a wonderful audience.  And
thank you very much to the 

02:15:01.439 --> 02:15:03.439
Library of Congress.  Thank you.

[Applause]
