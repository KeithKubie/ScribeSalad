00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.660
How Does Anti-Fog Spray Work?

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.049
The “fog” you may sometimes experience
on your glasses or goggles occurs when atmospheric

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.550
humidity near the lens condenses; this happens
due to a relatively significant discrepancy

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.880
between the temperature of the lens and the
surrounding air.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.940
As the surface attempts to reach an equilibrium
between the two temperatures, heat energy

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.110
is given up; and, as the energy within the
gaseous water molecules decreases, they form

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.290
into tiny water droplets on your lens, otherwise
known as “fog.”

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.379
So how do we stop the fog from forming on
your glasses?

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:48.440
There are two primary types of substances
used here- surfactants and hydrophilic ingredients.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.210
Surfactants (or surface acting agents) are
a broad group of compounds that include everything

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.620
from saliva to baby shampoo to emulsifiers.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.340
(Incidentally, it is a surfactant that is
the reason certain things taste disgusting

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.619
after using toothpaste, see: Why Does Orange
Juice Taste Awful After Brushing Your Teeth.

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.070
Surfactants also play a key role in why dropping
a mentos in something like Diet Coke produces

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.690
such a strong geiser-like reaction.)

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.050
These work by lowering the surface tension
of water.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.260
In the case of lens fog, which is essentially
just a bunch of tiny water droplets, the surfactant’s

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.350
ability to lower surface tension helps prevent
tiny droplet formation.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.410
So instead of numerous tiny droplets forming
all over your glasses, you get a very thin

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.410
film of water that isn’t likely to interfere
with your vision.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.990
If you don’t have an anti-fog spray handy,
in addition to human saliva and shampoo, other

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.730
soaps, glycerin and even, as previously mentioned,
certain substances in toothpaste, are surfactants

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.890
and thus will effectively prevent fog from
accumulating on a lens.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.040
The other primary method for preventing fog
is to cover the lens with a hydrophilic coating,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.270
which may include a polyvinyl alcohol, polymers,
hydrogels and colloids.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.909
Meaning “water loving,” hydrophilic ingredients
absorb water and thus ultimately spread it

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:18.620
throughout the coating, similar to surfactants,
preventing the numerous tiny droplets 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:44.860
of 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.620
visible “fog.”
