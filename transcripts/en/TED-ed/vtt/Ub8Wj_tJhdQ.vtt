00:00:06.908 --> 00:00:08.776
Imagine this:

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.408
You're fast asleep

00:00:10.432 --> 00:00:12.738
when all of a sudden you're awoken!

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:14.456
And not by your alarm clock.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.699
Your eyes open,

00:00:15.723 --> 00:00:17.764
and there's a demon sitting on your chest,

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:19.349
pinning you down.

00:00:19.373 --> 00:00:21.183
You try to open your mouth and scream,

00:00:21.207 --> 00:00:22.655
but no sound comes out.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:24.274
You try to get up and run away,

00:00:24.298 --> 00:00:27.343
but you realize that you
are completely immobilized.

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:29.537
The demon is trying to suffocate you,

00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:31.496
but you can't fight back.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.645
You've awoken into your dream,

00:00:33.669 --> 00:00:35.806
and it's a nightmare.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.129
It sounds like a Stephen King movie,

00:00:38.153 --> 00:00:39.915
but it's actually a medical condition

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:41.673
called sleep paralysis,

00:00:41.697 --> 00:00:43.221
and about half of the population

00:00:43.245 --> 00:00:45.103
has experienced this strange phenomenon

00:00:45.127 --> 00:00:46.772
at least once in their life.

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:48.841
This panic-inducing episode

00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:50.818
of coming face-to-face with the creatures

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:52.101
from your nightmares

00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:54.353
can last anywhere from seconds to minutes

00:00:54.377 --> 00:00:57.405
and may involve visual
or auditory hallucinations

00:00:57.429 --> 00:00:59.003
of an evil spirit

00:00:59.027 --> 00:01:01.784
or an out-of-body feeling
like you're floating.

00:01:01.808 --> 00:01:03.666
Some have even mistaken sleep paralysis

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.533
for an encounter with a ghost

00:01:05.557 --> 00:01:08.041
or an alien abduction.

00:01:08.065 --> 00:01:11.767
In 1867, Dr. Silas Weir Mitchell

00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:13.461
was the first medical professional

00:01:13.485 --> 00:01:15.950
to study sleep paralysis.

00:01:15.974 --> 00:01:17.990
"The subject awakes to consciousness

00:01:18.014 --> 00:01:19.258
of his environment

00:01:19.282 --> 00:01:21.777
but is incapable of moving a muscle.

00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:24.596
Lying to all appearance, still asleep.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.541
He's really engaged
for a struggle for movement,

00:01:27.565 --> 00:01:30.140
fraught with acute mental distress.

00:01:30.164 --> 00:01:32.056
Could he but manage to stir,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.563
the spell would vanish instantly."

00:01:34.587 --> 00:01:36.397
Even though Dr. Mitchell was the first

00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:38.853
to observe patients in a state
of sleep paralysis,

00:01:38.877 --> 00:01:40.997
it's so common that nearly every culture

00:01:41.021 --> 00:01:42.593
throughout time has had some kind

00:01:42.617 --> 00:01:45.251
of paranormal explanation for it.

00:01:45.275 --> 00:01:48.476
In medieval Europe, you might
think that an incubus,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.705
a sex-hungry demon in male form,

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.364
visited you in the night.

00:01:52.388 --> 00:01:54.968
In Scandinavia, the mare,

00:01:54.992 --> 00:01:56.097
a damned woman,

00:01:56.121 --> 00:01:57.963
is responsible for visiting sleepers

00:01:57.987 --> 00:02:00.468
and sitting on their rib cages.

00:02:00.492 --> 00:02:02.813
In Turkey, a jinn holds you down

00:02:02.837 --> 00:02:04.950
and tries to strangle you.

00:02:04.974 --> 00:02:08.342
In Thailand, Phi Am bruises
you while you sleep.

00:02:08.366 --> 00:02:09.850
In the southern United States,

00:02:09.874 --> 00:02:12.033
the hag comes for you.

00:02:12.057 --> 00:02:13.334
In Mexico, you could blame

00:02:13.358 --> 00:02:16.666
subirse el muerto,
the dead person, on you.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.677
In Greece, Mora sits upon your chest

00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:20.844
and tries to asphyxiate you.

00:02:20.868 --> 00:02:22.694
In Nepal, Khyaak the ghost

00:02:22.718 --> 00:02:24.800
resides under the staircase.

00:02:25.483 --> 00:02:26.674
It may be easier to blame

00:02:26.698 --> 00:02:28.545
sleep paralysis on evil spirits

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.808
because what's actually
happening in your brain

00:02:30.832 --> 00:02:32.806
is much harder to explain.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.021
Modern scientists believe
that sleep paralysis

00:02:35.045 --> 00:02:36.753
is caused by an abnormal overlap

00:02:36.777 --> 00:02:38.835
of the REM, rapid eye movement,

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.749
and waking stages of sleep.

00:02:40.773 --> 00:02:42.989
During a normal REM cycle,

00:02:43.013 --> 00:02:45.546
you're experiencing
a number of sensory stimuli

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.976
in the form of a dream,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.889
and your brain is unconscious
and fully asleep.

00:02:49.913 --> 00:02:51.315
During your dream,

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:53.521
special neurotransmitters are released,

00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:56.103
which paralyze almost all of your muscles.

00:02:56.127 --> 00:02:58.140
That's called REM atonia.

00:02:58.164 --> 00:03:00.260
It's what keeps you
from running in your bed

00:03:00.284 --> 00:03:02.336
when you're being chased in your dreams.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.829
During an episode of sleep paralysis,

00:03:04.853 --> 00:03:07.738
you're experiencing
normal components of REM.

00:03:07.762 --> 00:03:09.967
You're dreaming and your muscles
are paralyzed,

00:03:09.991 --> 00:03:12.720
only your brain is conscious
and wide awake.

00:03:12.744 --> 00:03:14.010
This is what causes you to imagine

00:03:14.034 --> 00:03:15.511
that you're having an encounter

00:03:15.535 --> 00:03:17.066
with a menacing presence.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.825
So this explains the hallucinations,

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.647
but what about the feelings of panic,

00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:22.562
strangling,

00:03:22.586 --> 00:03:23.380
choking,

00:03:23.404 --> 00:03:24.138
chest pressure

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:26.212
that so many people describe?

00:03:26.935 --> 00:03:28.090
Well during REM,

00:03:28.114 --> 00:03:28.949
the function that keeps you

00:03:28.973 --> 00:03:30.630
from acting out your dreams,

00:03:30.654 --> 00:03:32.048
REM atonia,

00:03:32.072 --> 00:03:33.848
also removes voluntary control

00:03:33.872 --> 00:03:35.017
of your breathing.

00:03:35.041 --> 00:03:36.893
Your breath becomes more shallow

00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:37.841
and rapid.

00:03:37.865 --> 00:03:39.342
You take in more carbon dioxide

00:03:39.366 --> 00:03:42.195
and experience a small
blockage of your airway.

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:44.575
During a sleep paralysis episode,

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.748
a combination of your body's fear response

00:03:46.772 --> 00:03:48.907
to a perceived attack by an evil creature

00:03:48.931 --> 00:03:50.716
and your brain being wide awake

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.189
while your body is in an REM sleep state

00:03:53.213 --> 00:03:56.204
triggers a response for you
to take in more oxygen.

00:03:56.228 --> 00:03:57.758
That makes you gasp

00:03:57.782 --> 00:03:58.794
for air,

00:03:58.818 --> 00:03:59.830
but you can't

00:03:59.854 --> 00:04:00.867
because REM atonia

00:04:00.891 --> 00:04:03.517
has removed control of your breath.

00:04:03.541 --> 00:04:05.637
This struggle for air
while your body sleeps

00:04:05.661 --> 00:04:07.064
creates a perceived sensation

00:04:07.088 --> 00:04:08.761
of pressure on the chest

00:04:08.785 --> 00:04:10.957
or suffocation.

00:04:10.981 --> 00:04:12.362
While a few people experience

00:04:12.386 --> 00:04:13.973
sleep paralysis regularly

00:04:13.997 --> 00:04:15.855
and it may be linked to sleep disorders

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.063
such as narcolepsy,

00:04:17.087 --> 00:04:19.551
many who experience
an episode of sleep paralysis

00:04:19.575 --> 00:04:21.218
do so infrequently,

00:04:21.242 --> 00:04:23.590
perhaps only once in a lifetime.

00:04:23.614 --> 00:04:24.860
So you can rest easy,

00:04:24.884 --> 00:04:27.354
knowing that an evil entity is not trying

00:04:27.378 --> 00:04:27.783
to haunt,

00:04:27.807 --> 00:04:28.248
possess,

00:04:28.272 --> 00:04:28.735
strangle,

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.444
or suffocate you.

00:04:30.468 --> 00:04:32.558
Save that for the horror films!
