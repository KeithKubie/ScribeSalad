00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.870
(mellow music)

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.580
- [Narrator] Sea turtles
are ancient mariners.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.520
Present in all but Earth's coldest oceans,

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.620
these marine reptiles are well-adapted

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.973
to a life on the move.

00:00:14.096 --> 00:00:16.760
(dramatic music)

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.330
Sea turtles have existed since
the time of the dinosaurs.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.260
The earliest known marine turtle

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.540
lived about 120 million years ago.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.200
Named Desmatochelys padillai,
it was six feet long

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.620
and had the characteristic
features of modern sea turtles

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.120
including a carapace, or a top
shell, and paddle-like limbs.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.070
Today, there are seven
species of sea turtles

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.100
with the largest being the leatherback.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.010
Growing as long as eight feet

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.400
and weighing up to 2,000 pounds,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.400
it is larger than known fossils

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.203
of its prehistoric ancestor, the padillai.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.363
Sea turtles can lay more
than 150 eggs at a time.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.360
Called the clutch,
these large egg deposits

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.543
help ensure the survival
of sea turtle hatchlings.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.990
Once a female lays her eggs,
she returns to the sea,

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.663
leaving her hatchlings
to fend for themselves.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.070
Fewer than .1% of hatchlings
survive to adulthood

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.260
in part due to numerous
predators on the beach.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.950
Emerging in large numbers
increases the chance

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.723
that some will survive.

00:01:25.723 --> 00:01:29.170
(waves crashing)

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.353
A sea turtle's sex is
determined by temperature.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.220
Unlike most vertebrates,
a sea turtle's sex

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.780
is not determined by sex chromosomes.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.010
Instead, the temperature of the nest

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.710
determines the sex of the hatchlings.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.590
When temperatures are warm, at
about 88 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.990
most of the hatchlings will be female,

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.680
but when temperatures are cooler,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.220
less than around 82 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.589
most of the hatchlings will be male.

00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:57.760
(mellow music)

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.090
Sea turtles use Earth's
magnetic fields to navigate.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.820
Sea turtles have geomagnetic abilities

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.030
which serve as an internal GPS.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.280
The turtles have particles of magnetite,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.650
a magnetic mineral, in their brains.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.580
The magnetite likely plays a role

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.840
in orienting sea turtles
to Earth's magnetic poles,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.170
similar to a compass.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.760
Baby sea turtles imprint on
the unique magnetic signature

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.453
of the beaches where they hatch.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.250
This magnetic map can guide them

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.120
back to the same beaches
several years later

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.090
to lay their own eggs.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.673
(mellow music)

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.090
All seven sea turtle species
are threatened with extinction.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.760
Once abundant, sea turtle populations

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.963
have dramatically declined
in the past two centuries.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.500
Fishing is a major threat to sea turtles

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.470
as they become caught in fishing nets

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.520
as bycatch, or accidental catch.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.550
Illegal harvesting of turtle eggs,

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.330
trafficking in turtle products,

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.740
and ocean pollution are also concerns.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.170
However, policies have been enacted

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.410
to reduce bycatch,
protect turtle habitats,

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.020
and prohibit the killing of
sea turtles and their eggs.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.390
By continuing this kind of intervention,

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.820
humans can help stop the
decline of sea turtles,

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.342
helping keep these ancient
mariners in the world's oceans.

00:03:21.342 --> 00:03:24.175
