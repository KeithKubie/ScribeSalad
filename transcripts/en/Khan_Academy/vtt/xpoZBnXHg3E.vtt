00:00:00.235 --> 00:00:01.698
- [Voiceover] Hello
grammarians, David here

00:00:01.698 --> 00:00:04.708
along with my cousin Beth who
also happens to be a teacher.

00:00:04.708 --> 00:00:05.999
Say hello to the people Beth.

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:06.954
- [Voiceover] Hi people.

00:00:06.954 --> 00:00:08.487
- [Voiceover] So today we
are going to talk about

00:00:08.487 --> 00:00:10.841
sentence fragments, and
Beth you cover these

00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:12.623
in classes that you teach.

00:00:12.623 --> 00:00:15.122
Could you tell me please,
what is a sentence fragment?

00:00:15.122 --> 00:00:16.080
- [Voiceover] Great.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.935
A sentence fragment is when
a student writes a sentence

00:00:20.935 --> 00:00:22.487
and they think it's a sentence,

00:00:22.487 --> 00:00:25.893
but it's one that tells
maybe what happens,

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:28.981
but doesn't include who,
or it might include who

00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:31.484
but doesn't tell what happens.

00:00:31.484 --> 00:00:32.591
- [Voiceover] So sentence fragments

00:00:32.591 --> 00:00:34.949
don't tell the whole story.

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:36.999
The way I would put it, is that a fragment

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:40.312
is a piece of a sentence
that cannot stand on its own,

00:00:40.312 --> 00:00:44.354
but nevertheless, incorrectly
ends with a period.

00:00:44.354 --> 00:00:48.377
So the whole story, for
instance, would be a fragment.

00:00:48.377 --> 00:00:49.882
This is a fragment.

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:53.152
It could be a sentence but
it's missing something.

00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:57.141
Beth, what is it missing, what
is the whole story missing?

00:00:57.141 --> 00:00:58.468
- [Voiceover] Well we've got a subject

00:00:58.468 --> 00:01:00.261
but we don't have what we
would call a predicate,

00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:03.094
in other words, so we're giving a subject,

00:01:03.094 --> 00:01:05.178
but we're not telling what
happens to that subject.

00:01:05.178 --> 00:01:07.201
- [Voiceover] All right, so,

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:10.118
the whole story began 10 years ago.

00:01:13.023 --> 00:01:15.755
And now we've got our subject
here, the whole story,

00:01:15.755 --> 00:01:18.884
and now we've given it a predicate.

00:01:18.884 --> 00:01:22.301
Similarly, if we just had this predicate,

00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:26.482
and we just said it began ten years ago,

00:01:26.482 --> 00:01:29.508
oh, that's not enough
to be a sentence either,

00:01:29.508 --> 00:01:31.425
that's also a fragment.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.805
Because now we've got a
predicate but no subject.

00:01:35.805 --> 00:01:38.322
- [Voiceover] Right, we're telling about

00:01:38.322 --> 00:01:40.315
something but we don't know what.

00:01:40.315 --> 00:01:42.307
- [Voiceover] So in
order to be a sentence,

00:01:42.307 --> 00:01:45.862
you need to have both a
subject and a predicate.

00:01:45.862 --> 00:01:48.523
So you need to have a thing, like a noun,

00:01:48.523 --> 00:01:51.938
or a pronoun, and then you
have to have something happen

00:01:51.938 --> 00:01:56.130
to that noun or pronoun,
or something performed

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.854
by that noun our pronoun.

00:01:58.854 --> 00:02:03.021
Right so, like the pancakes,
period, is not a sentence.

00:02:05.628 --> 00:02:08.628
But the pancakes were delicious, is.

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:13.085
- [Voiceover] So you've
got a part that names,

00:02:13.085 --> 00:02:15.920
that's your subject, and
then you've got the part

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.417
that finishes the thought,
that's your predicate.

00:02:20.417 --> 00:02:23.203
- [Voiceover] Let's
look at another example.

00:02:23.203 --> 00:02:26.472
All right, what about
because of the snowstorm?

00:02:26.472 --> 00:02:27.887
Is that a sentence, Beth?

00:02:27.887 --> 00:02:28.720
- [Voiceover] Nope.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.102
- [Voiceover] Why not?

00:02:30.102 --> 00:02:31.716
- [Voiceover] Well you
don't tell what happened

00:02:31.716 --> 00:02:33.176
because of that snowstorm.

00:02:33.176 --> 00:02:36.665
- [Voiceover] So this is
what we call, not even a,

00:02:36.665 --> 00:02:38.715
I mean it's not even a
dependent clause, right?

00:02:38.715 --> 00:02:42.435
It, this thing doesn't
have, doesn't really have

00:02:42.435 --> 00:02:44.102
a subject or a verb.

00:02:45.137 --> 00:02:47.899
It's really just a prepositional phrase.

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:50.316
So because of the snowstorm
something could happen,

00:02:50.316 --> 00:02:53.801
but we don't know what that is, so,

00:02:53.801 --> 00:02:56.462
because of the snowstorm,
we stayed home from school.

00:02:56.462 --> 00:02:58.140
So we've got this sentence here,

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.784
this independent clause, right.

00:02:59.784 --> 00:03:01.521
We stayed home from school.

00:03:01.521 --> 00:03:04.274
And that's a subject and a predicate.

00:03:04.274 --> 00:03:06.885
And if it were just stayed
home from school, period,

00:03:06.885 --> 00:03:07.982
that wouldn't be a sentence.

00:03:07.982 --> 00:03:09.913
And if it were just we, period,

00:03:09.913 --> 00:03:11.863
that also wouldn't be a sentence.

00:03:11.863 --> 00:03:14.748
And if it were just because
of the snowstorm, period,

00:03:14.748 --> 00:03:16.455
that wouldn't be a sentence.

00:03:16.455 --> 00:03:19.453
It doesn't have enough
support to stand on its own.

00:03:19.453 --> 00:03:21.798
But all together, because
of the snowstorm, comma,

00:03:21.798 --> 00:03:24.582
we stayed home from school, period.

00:03:24.582 --> 00:03:26.165
That is a sentence.

00:03:27.121 --> 00:03:29.612
So in order to make sure that
you're building sentences

00:03:29.612 --> 00:03:31.673
you have to make sure that what you've got

00:03:31.673 --> 00:03:33.623
is a subject and a predicate.

00:03:33.623 --> 00:03:36.610
You gotta have a subject and
a verb, put 'em together,

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.039
slap on a period, you've got a sentence.

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:40.917
- [Voiceover] You've got some
good sentences there David.

00:03:40.917 --> 00:03:42.116
- [Voiceover] You can learn anything.

00:03:42.116 --> 00:03:43.019
David out.

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.269
- [Voiceover] And Beth out.
