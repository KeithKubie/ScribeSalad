depression is a very serious clinical
problem the work has been going on for

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:06.799
problem the work has been going on for
 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:09.190
problem the work has been going on for
many years to discover better treatments

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200
many years to discover better treatments
 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.500
many years to discover better treatments
for depression most depression

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.510

treatments medicine I'm talking about

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390
treatments medicine I'm talking about
 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.050
treatments medicine I'm talking about
take weeks to months to work like Prozac

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060
take weeks to months to work like Prozac
 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.900
take weeks to months to work like Prozac
and paxil and so that's been a problem

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910
and paxil and so that's been a problem
 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.870
and paxil and so that's been a problem
in that day there's a delay and they

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880
in that day there's a delay and they
 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.320
in that day there's a delay and they
also don't work in everybody so my

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330
also don't work in everybody so my
 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.270
also don't work in everybody so my
research team has been working for many

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:31.280

better medicine treatments for

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720
better medicine treatments for
 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.700
better medicine treatments for
depression and we have recently found

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710
depression and we have recently found
 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.540
depression and we have recently found
that ketamine is a rapidly acting

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550
that ketamine is a rapidly acting
 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.180
that ketamine is a rapidly acting
antidepressant now some people know

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190
antidepressant now some people know
 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.850
antidepressant now some people know
ketamine as a recreational drug of abuse

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860
ketamine as a recreational drug of abuse
 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.660
ketamine as a recreational drug of abuse
called Special K but we have found that

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670
called Special K but we have found that
 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.660
called Special K but we have found that
it has potential for the treatment of

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670
it has potential for the treatment of
 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.530
it has potential for the treatment of
depression that has not responded to

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540
depression that has not responded to
 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.479
depression that has not responded to
traditional antidepressant treatments

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489
traditional antidepressant treatments
 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.149
traditional antidepressant treatments
and that it works faster that it can

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159
and that it works faster that it can
 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.199
and that it works faster that it can
work within several hours so we're

00:01:08.199 --> 00:01:08.209
work within several hours so we're
 

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:11.559
work within several hours so we're
working on it it's not yet approved so

00:01:11.559 --> 00:01:11.569
working on it it's not yet approved so
 

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:14.139
working on it it's not yet approved so
it's now at the level of research but

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149
it's now at the level of research but
 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:16.359
it's now at the level of research but
it's now been found at by research

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369
it's now been found at by research
 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.870
it's now been found at by research
groups all over the world that ketamine

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880
groups all over the world that ketamine
 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.629
groups all over the world that ketamine
works quickly and that the response can

00:01:22.629 --> 00:01:22.639
works quickly and that the response can
 

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:25.739
works quickly and that the response can
at least be maintained for several weeks

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:25.749
at least be maintained for several weeks
 

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:28.149
at least be maintained for several weeks
so now we're working on how to maintain

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159
so now we're working on how to maintain
 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.879
so now we're working on how to maintain
the response for much longer than that

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:30.889
the response for much longer than that
 

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:35.469
the response for much longer than that
and to test out its safety for long-term

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479
and to test out its safety for long-term
 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.929
and to test out its safety for long-term
treatment but at a minimum it's broken

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939
treatment but at a minimum it's broken
 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.359
treatment but at a minimum it's broken
new ground because ketamine works

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369
new ground because ketamine works
 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.099
new ground because ketamine works
differently than other antidepressants

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:42.109
differently than other antidepressants
 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:44.589
differently than other antidepressants
and we now know that there are methods

00:01:44.589 --> 00:01:44.599
and we now know that there are methods
 

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:47.499
and we now know that there are methods
that get people better from serious

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509
that get people better from serious
 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.830
that get people better from serious
forms of depression very quickly one

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840
forms of depression very quickly one
 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.870
forms of depression very quickly one
reason that scientists say that the

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880
reason that scientists say that the
 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.319
reason that scientists say that the
ketamine findings are a major advance in

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329
ketamine findings are a major advance in
 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.969
ketamine findings are a major advance in
the treatment of depression is that

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979
the treatment of depression is that
 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.510
the treatment of depression is that
ketamine works very differently than

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520
ketamine works very differently than
 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.109
ketamine works very differently than
other antidepressants the

other antidepressants the
 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.069
other antidepressants the
antidepressants that are now generally

neurotransmitters like serotonin

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530
neurotransmitters like serotonin
 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.220
neurotransmitters like serotonin
and norepinephrine that's how Prozac and

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230
and norepinephrine that's how Prozac and
 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.820

paxil and zola for example work they

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830
paxil and zola for example work they
 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.370
paxil and zola for example work they
they block the reuptake of the

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380
they block the reuptake of the
 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.640
they block the reuptake of the
neurotransmitter serotonin ketamine does

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650
neurotransmitter serotonin ketamine does
 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.460
neurotransmitter serotonin ketamine does
not work through that mechanism ketamine

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470
not work through that mechanism ketamine
 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.070
not work through that mechanism ketamine
works through another neurotransmitter

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080
works through another neurotransmitter
 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.730
works through another neurotransmitter
system called the glutamate system and

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740
system called the glutamate system and
 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.770
system called the glutamate system and
initially its effects are modulated by

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780
initially its effects are modulated by
 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.449
initially its effects are modulated by
blocking the NMDA glutamate receptor so

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459
blocking the NMDA glutamate receptor so
 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.070
blocking the NMDA glutamate receptor so
we know that's part of the way that

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080
we know that's part of the way that
 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.229
we know that's part of the way that
ketamine works but researchers now in

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239
ketamine works but researchers now in
 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.080
ketamine works but researchers now in
labs around the world are probing more

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090
labs around the world are probing more
 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.470
labs around the world are probing more
deeply about how ketamine can start by

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480
deeply about how ketamine can start by
 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.240
deeply about how ketamine can start by
working through the glutamate system and

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250
working through the glutamate system and
 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.250
working through the glutamate system and
then cause other changes in brain

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260
then cause other changes in brain
 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.080
then cause other changes in brain
function that result in that

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090
function that result in that
 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.810
function that result in that
antidepressant response so that that is

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820
antidepressant response so that that is
 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.790
antidepressant response so that that is
work that is now occurring but we do

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800
work that is now occurring but we do
 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.830
work that is now occurring but we do
know it as a minimum that it works very

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840
know it as a minimum that it works very
 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.560
know it as a minimum that it works very
differently than the available

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570
differently than the available
 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.080
differently than the available
antidepressants as I mentioned ketamine

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090
antidepressants as I mentioned ketamine
 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.770
antidepressants as I mentioned ketamine
is a recreational drug of abuse and we

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780
is a recreational drug of abuse and we
 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.050
is a recreational drug of abuse and we
have to be concerned about that in any

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060
have to be concerned about that in any
 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.259
have to be concerned about that in any
development of ketamine that leads to

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269
development of ketamine that leads to
 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.620
development of ketamine that leads to
formal approval by the FDA and

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630
formal approval by the FDA and
 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.090
formal approval by the FDA and
ultimately becomes generally available

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100
ultimately becomes generally available
 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.270
ultimately becomes generally available
for the treatment of depression so the

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280
for the treatment of depression so the
 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.250

intranasal forms of ketamine and they
 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.350
intranasal forms of ketamine and they
will watch for any signs of abuse by

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360
will watch for any signs of abuse by
 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.920
will watch for any signs of abuse by
patients probably the way ketamine will

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930
patients probably the way ketamine will
 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.000
patients probably the way ketamine will
be distributed will be on a dose by dose

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010
be distributed will be on a dose by dose
 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.930

the appropriate drug you know to use but

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880
the appropriate drug you know to use but
 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.850
the appropriate drug you know to use but
I personally feel that ketamine is well

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860
I personally feel that ketamine is well
 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.830
I personally feel that ketamine is well
tolerated in the dose that we use for

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840
tolerated in the dose that we use for
 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.990
tolerated in the dose that we use for
the treatment of depression and that if

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000
the treatment of depression and that if
 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.599
the treatment of depression and that if
longer-term studies show that it's safe

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609
longer-term studies show that it's safe
 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.310
longer-term studies show that it's safe
and that it's not abused it could really

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320
and that it's not abused it could really
 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.640
and that it's not abused it could really
revolutionize the treatment of

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650
revolutionize the treatment of
 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.900
revolutionize the treatment of
depression for

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910
depression for
 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.090
depression for
patients who have serious depression

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100
patients who have serious depression
 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.880
patients who have serious depression
that is treatment resistant to the

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890
that is treatment resistant to the
 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.100
that is treatment resistant to the
available treatments so it will be used

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110
available treatments so it will be used
 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.260
available treatments so it will be used
for a very certain group of people who

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270
for a very certain group of people who
 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.960
for a very certain group of people who
are really suffering
