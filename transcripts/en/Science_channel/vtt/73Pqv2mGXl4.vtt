00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:42.434
WHEN THESE WHISKERS
BRUSH THE SIDES OF THE LANE,

00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:44.868
THEY'LL SEND A SIGNAL
TO THE COMPUTER,

00:00:44.868 --> 00:00:48.601
WHICH WILL THEN DIRECT THE ROBOT

JUST ABOVE THE BATTERY.

00:01:16.434 --> 00:01:19.100
HE THEN RUNS THE HOSE
FROM THE CONDITIONING TANK

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.734
OVER TO THE APPLICATOR
AND CONNECTS IT.

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:25.300

00:01:35.234 --> 00:01:39.534

HE THEN PLUGS THE WIRING HARNESS

00:01:48.334 --> 00:01:51.501
INTO THE COMPUTER AT THE BACK
OF THE CONTROL PANEL.

00:01:54.067 --> 00:01:56.267
IT'S TIME FOR A DRY RUN.

00:01:56.267 --> 00:01:58.934
WITH NO CLEANER OR CONDITIONER
IN THE SYSTEM YET,

00:01:58.934 --> 00:02:01.267
THE TECHNICIAN POWERS
UP THE ROBOT

00:02:01.267 --> 00:02:03.467
AND PUTS IT THROUGH ITS PACES.

00:02:03.467 --> 00:02:07.667

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.067
IN BIG BLENDERS.

00:02:19.067 --> 00:02:20.734
THERE ARE NINE DIFFERENT
RECIPES,

00:02:20.734 --> 00:02:23.634
WITH UP TO 16 INGREDIENTS
IN EACH ONE.

00:02:25.234 --> 00:02:28.968
WITH THE CONDITIONERS APPROVED,
IT'S TIME TO TEST THE ROBOT

00:02:28.968 --> 00:02:31.501
IN SPECIAL QUALITY
CONTROL LANES.

00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:33.834
DURING 50 TRIPS
DOWN THE LANES,

00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:36.968
A TECHNICIAN EVALUATES
THE ROBOT'S PERFORMANCE.

00:02:39.067 --> 00:02:40.901
HE INSPECTS ITS TURNING RADIUS

00:02:40.901 --> 00:02:44.133
AND THE EFFECTIVENESS
OF THE SENSORS.

00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:49.000
HE ALSO SCRUTINIZES THE CLEANING

00:02:50.968 --> 00:02:56.133
WORKS WELL ON ITS OWN,
HE APPROVES IT FOR SHIPPING.

00:02:56.133 --> 00:02:59.834
THIS BOWLING LANE CONDITIONER
SHOULD BE A REAL GAME CHANGER

00:02:59.834 --> 00:03:02.801
AND ENSURE THAT THE PATH
TO VICTORY IS A WELL-OILED ONE.
