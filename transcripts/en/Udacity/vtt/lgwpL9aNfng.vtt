00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.540
So, my name is Kelly Chen. I consider myself a Bay

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.850
Area native. I grew up in Fremont, and I'm a genetic

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.980
counselor. And technically, I guess, my title is perinatal genetic counselor,

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.980
so I focus on patients who are pregnant or thinking about pregnancy.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.480
&gt;&gt; And as a genetic counselor, are there subdisciplines? Like, are, I mean,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.140
are there, like, genetic counselors who

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.430
focus on, sort of, the non-perinatal aspect?

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.550
&gt;&gt; Certainly. So,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.240
this profession's still pretty new. I think, in

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.510
the beginning, there weren't that many specialties. It was

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.790
either pediatrics, children and, and prenatal was the second,

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.560
I think, as, as soon as pregnancy tests started.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.710
And since then, there are several different specialties. The

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.550
big ones are pediatrics, prenatal, cancer has become the

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.790
hot new thing. counselors who work in a laboratory,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.740
and then specialty counselors who work in certain disciplines

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.910
like cardiology or neurology or.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.790
&gt;&gt; Nice. What kind of training was involved? So, once you figured out

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.890
that's something you wanted what do you

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.620
do to become a genetic counselor, officially?

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.550
&gt;&gt; So, it's very specific. So, it's usually a two or three year

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.730
master's program specifically in genetic counseling.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.810
So, all the courses are geared towards

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.810
the science of genetics and counseling theory. And so right now, I just

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.340
did this test. I think there are about 30 programs nationwide. So there

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.570
are three in California and then in other states. And

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.760
so you still have to apply. Take standard testing like GRE's.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.128
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:23.128 --> 00:01:27.840
&gt;&gt; If they're still around. And do some training, like volunteering, in

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.820
a healthcare setting, so I volunteered at Planned Parenthood for a year.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:31.280
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.440
&gt;&gt; Doing the pregnancy tests.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.960
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.180
&gt;&gt; And then applied.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.860
&gt;&gt; What are the various backgrounds? Do all genetic counselors have

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.970
the same academic training, or, or do they have diverse academic training?

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.050
&gt;&gt; So,

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.910
yeah, So, counselors come from a wide variety

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.950
of backgrounds. they do have in common that they

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.350
have to have a master's degree, and the

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.750
master's degree programs require an undergraduate, usually four year

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.962
college, but, and some prerequisite science courses; Biology,

00:01:57.962 --> 00:02:00.410
Chemistry. but other than that, you can be any

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.380
major. So, my classmate was a psychology major, I

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.160
was a genetics major. Some people were completely not

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.240
really seeing either of their specialties as long as they finish their courses.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.920
&gt;&gt; What do you think about the profession itself overall? Is it a

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.000
profession that is growing in number, and how is it growing if it is?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.960
&gt;&gt; So, yeah. The profession itself definitely is growing in number. I

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.920
don't have year by year, but I think in the very beginning, I

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.630
think the first national society started in the late 70s, and then there

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.860
were probably ten to 30 members, maybe. And now I think we're up

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.990
to, past 2000 nationwide. in the state I'm organizing this conference

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.890
coming up so I just did some stats. In this state,

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.330
there's probably about 400 licensed genetic counselors. So just to give

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.350
a prospective of, we're still a small specialty, but definitely growing.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.540
&gt;&gt; Is, I guess this is sort of more of the personal side, but do you

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.310
like being a genetic counselor? Do you feel

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.960
like you're helping people? What aspect of doing this

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.210
job is probably the best and most fulfilling for you?

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.940
&gt;&gt; I think it's a combination of things. Like, this job definitely,

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.000
I really enjoy being a genetic counselor, it really fills my niche.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.900
That it combines my interest and my love of science, and specifically

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.860
genetics and genetic conditions, with seeing

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.400
patients, helping people in a healthcare setting.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.840
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.900
&gt;&gt; So I've been thinking about some of these answers that,

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.300
you know, the traditional role for healthcare professional is a doctor.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.380
But doctors have a lot of stress, a lot of

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.260
schooling doing treatments and procedures.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.990
And I wasn't necessarily interested in

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.280
that part. I was really more interested in communicating to patients,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.610
and feeling like I could help them just using my words.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.670
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.360
&gt;&gt; Or just being there for them and listening

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.730
to them. So I really feel that this profession

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.420
has been a really good fit for, for, for

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.380
me and my personality. So a lot of what I

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.790
do is, I think of it as a consultation,

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.820
but also just providing information. I see us as a

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.570
link between physicians and patients, that traditionally doctors order

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.770
tests that are fairly straightforward like a blood count, or

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.850
a blood type or something like that. And they

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.400
can easily tell a patient what that means in a

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.950
sentence. With this genetic testing, it's much more complicated

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.110
than that. it's not always a straightforward yes or no,

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.070
and doctors don't have time to spend with patients

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.670
explaining that. And so I see us as a bridge

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.740
between that, being able to help patients decipher and

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.026
interpret this information. And then also helping them making decisions

00:04:25.026 --> 00:04:27.896
based on those results. because a lot of decisions

00:04:27.896 --> 00:04:31.046
to be made, especially in pregnancy are not always medical

00:04:31.046 --> 00:04:34.574
decisions, there are person decisions about what patients want to

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:38.507
do about information about their future offspring. so, so prenatal

00:04:38.507 --> 00:04:41.313
specifically is an interesting ethical realm because

00:04:41.313 --> 00:04:44.477
we're also dealing with pregnancy and, and termination.

00:04:44.477 --> 00:04:48.350
&gt;&gt; You do pedigrees, don't you?

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.970
&gt;&gt; Yes we do, we always do pedigrees it's kind of our shorthand.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:52.570
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.960
&gt;&gt; For gathering medical information.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.610
&gt;&gt; Are you fast, are you good? How fast can you like draw a pedigree?

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.230
&gt;&gt; I'm pretty, people my colleagues would say I'm too fast at a

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.530
lot of things so I'm pretty fast at drawing pedigree. We have colleagues

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.330
that don't have the template. That, they used to

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.170
have a template, that you could trace a pedigree.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.290
And so I had colleagues who could flip out

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.740
that template and do the rotational things. But most

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.510
of us can draw freehand pretty well. But now

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.410
there are programs that also draw pedigrees because mine

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.180
are fairly basic. I take maybe three generations of

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.170
pedigrees. So a patient's, their children and their parents.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.030
some pedigrees, like for cancer, where you're really trying to pinpoint

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.190
all the individuals with cancer, those pedigrees can get huge, and

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.540
then I think the counselors definitely need help with a program

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.960
that can kind of line things up and sort things out.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.700
&gt;&gt; Have you ever had to look at a trait?

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.630
Or, I don't know, I'm just curious. Have you ever looked

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.310
at a trait where no one knows what the inheritance pattern

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.493
is yet. Like, have you ever discovered a new inheritance pattern?

00:05:51.493 --> 00:05:51.688
[LAUGH]

00:05:51.688 --> 00:05:53.326
Like does that happen as a genetic counselor, you

00:05:53.326 --> 00:05:55.780
ever looking at traits that no one's ever described before?

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.990
&gt;&gt; So that's kind of has two separate questions

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.470
so that looking at a pedigree, sometimes we don't

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.610
know the inheritance, like it doesn't fit a

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.440
traditional dominant or it doesn't fit a traditional recessive.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.120
So that's kind of the fun part of

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.540
our job where it's a rare occurrence of something

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.950
happening. So it's not, I, I don't think we've

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.400
like discovered a new inheritance but we've discovered New

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.050
instances of a rare, rare instances of things that

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.180
can happen with traditional inheritance patterns. So that's, that's one

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.030
way, like, something happens on top of something else,

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.250
and that's what gives that pattern. and then we can

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.320
also be fooled when people are related to each

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.780
other. Because then that throws things, because it could be

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.190
a dominant trait, but if there's relatives that are

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.430
related to each other, it could be recessive as well.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.870
And then your other question, just about, we certainly have

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.770
conditions that nobody's described before. And we see it in

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.960
prenatal, but we see more in pediatrics, where a child

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.110
comes to us with a unique set of sympoms. And

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.900
that's not been described. And so that, that's a cool

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.610
part of a pediatric genetics, counseler or doctors job is

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.490
they might actually identify a new syndrome. So I haven't

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.960
personally been part of that, but my colleges actually have.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.130
And we know physicians who have discovered new conditions.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.110
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. And have had them named after them.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.860
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:13.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.050
&gt;&gt; That's crazy. That's pretty cool.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.120
There's somebody watching right now, who's really

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.050
interested and wants to know about being a genetic counselor. What would you, do

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.110
you have any particular good resource you'd tell them to go visit or

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.362
do you have any special message that

00:07:26.362 --> 00:07:28.240
you would tell them about genetic counseling?

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.780
&gt;&gt; So, yeah, I would highly recommend

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.930
the profession if anyone's thinking about genetic counseling.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:39.420
It's a very good combination and medicine and health care, and interacting with

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.650
patients. So we call that a clinical kind of job. If you like patients,

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:46.960
and if you like the specific field of genetics, because that's pretty much what

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.390
we're talking about. So if you don't

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.300
like genetics, I wouldn't recommend this profession.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:50.650
[LAUGH]

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.280
But if you want to work with people but still

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.810
be in, tune with the science, it's a really good profession.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.470
There are a lot of counselors who work part time. And

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.740
we don't take call like physicians or nurses. And so for

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.660
those again who want to go into medicine but don't

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.950
want the extra stress of those kinds of things, it's a

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:11.270
really nice profession. lot of, lots of counselors work part time

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.360
again because we're seeing patients and they can be scheduled appointments.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.780
the salaries I think, especially with our certification

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.110
and licensure, hopefully are starting to increase and

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.640
there's certainly a lot of job opportunity. So

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.270
I would highly recommend checking out the websites and

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:29.560
talking to a direct counselor if you can.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.520
Even shadowing a counselor and doing some volunteer work

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.750
in health care, just to make sure that's the area that they like to be in, yeah.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.460
&gt;&gt; Great, it sounds like great advice. Thank you so much.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.566
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for the opportunity.

00:08:42.566 --> 00:08:52.566
