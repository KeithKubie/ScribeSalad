00:00:01.637 --> 00:00:03.470
MALE SPEAKER: We're in
for real treat today,

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.960
we're here with Dr. Bernard
Roth who also goes by Bernie.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.300
So a little bit
about Dr. Roth, he's

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.650
the Rodney H. Adams
professor of engineering,

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.220
and the academic director
of the Hasso Plattner

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.410
Institute of Design, also
known as the d.school

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.290
at Stanford University.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.070
He graduated from the
City College of New York

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.110
with a degree in
mechanical engineering.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.040
He's a native New Yorker, and
he earned a master's degree

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.690
and a PhD In
mechanical engineering

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.780
from Columbia University.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.400
In 2012, the Columbia University
Engineering School Alumni

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.410
Association awarded him the
prestigious Egleston Medal

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.600
for Distinguished
Engineering Achievement.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.690
And he lives in
Stanford, California.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.690
We have a pretty interactive
presentation today,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.120
he's got a mic for Q&amp;A.
So it'll be good hour.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.102
Without further ado, Dr. Roth.

00:00:53.102 --> 00:00:55.512
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:00.600
BERNARD ROTH: Thank you
for coming out here,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.444
I have Google stock so
I won't waste your time.

00:01:03.444 --> 00:01:06.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.710
This book that I wrote
is an expression of stuff

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.390
that's been my life for
a very, very long time.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.210
When I first came out
to the valley in 1962,

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.160
it was a very different place.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.420
Not only was there no Google,
there were no start ups,

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.030
essentially.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.600
Hewlett Packard was
the big place in town.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.262
A lot of people would
always-- my students

00:01:30.262 --> 00:01:31.720
all would say that
some day they're

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.370
going to start a
company and all that,

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.620
and there wasn't venture money.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.540
Most of them never
did, and it reminded me

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.230
of this story in
"The Iceman Cometh"

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.420
where these guys are
sitting in the bar all day,

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.730
and they never leave
the bar, and they just

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.940
talk about going out
and crossing the street.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.780
So I felt, really, that
there was something

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.650
missing in people's education.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.850
So I started a class,
which eventually is called,

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.559
"The Designer in Society."

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:56.850
The name doesn't mean anything.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.070
It's just a name.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.240
And the idea was, everyone got
to do a term project which they

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.130
chose, which was either get
rid of a problem in your life

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.740
or do something you've always
want to do and you've never

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.720
before.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.540
And it could be things
like jumping out

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.630
of airplanes or whatever.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.820
It doesn't have to be anything
academic, or engineering,

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.060
or stuff like that.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.990
And to fill the 10
weeks between that,

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.700
I had to do a lot of stuff.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.070
So I developed a lot of
exercises and readings

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.270
and things like that.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.210
And it's been going on since
1970, so that's a long time.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.000
Eventually, various
circumstances of my life

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.360
led to, "Well, I'm stuck
here on my sabbatical,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.250
I might as well do
something useful."

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.120
So I decided I write a book.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.759
Now the last time
I had that feeling

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:47.425
was when I was young
assistant professor

00:02:47.425 --> 00:02:49.540
on my first
sabbatical in Holland,

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.000
and I started to write a book.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.420
And it turned out to be
525 pages of all equations.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.520
It took me nine years.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.240
One reviewer said it was the
best book of the century.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.040
Another said it's the best
kinematics book ever written.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.680
And it sold 2,000 copies.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.750
This book took less
than a year to write.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.540
It's been in process
for three years.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.650
It's been out two days.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.680
Amazon has run out of copies.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.900
It went to the number one
list in business and advice

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.690
kind of things.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.000
It's in the top hundred.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.590
The staff has chosen to read it.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.050
So this is amazing.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.685
No equations.

00:03:26.685 --> 00:03:28.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.780
So it's like bracketing my
life from serious scientist

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.900
to fuzzy guy.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.030
But the fuzzy guy
stuff is useful.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.240
It's amazing-- the
story-- they make me cry,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.840
a lot of these stories
because it's changed

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.260
a lot of people's lives.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.080
And the funny thing
is, I thought it was me

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.490
and my magic in the classroom,
my insightfulness and all that.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.290
But people have
been having galleys

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.220
for a couple of
months around, and I

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.950
keep getting the same stories.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.680
"Bernie, I picked up
your book and I did this,

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.140
and I did that" and
all that, including

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.215
the woman who used to work
for the Washington Post,

00:04:06.215 --> 00:04:08.250
and now she works
at the d.school.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.940
And she does our blog
page and all that stuff.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.690
And she was close to me from
the beginning with the book.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.709
And when she got to read
the final copy, she said,

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.417
"You know, I'm going to
stop trying to do something,

00:04:21.417 --> 00:04:22.750
I'm going to write my own book."

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.630
And she's getting up
at 3:00 in the morning

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.090
every morning writing a book.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.040
So I want warn you,
this can ruin your life.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.820
And the other insight
I had coming in here,

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.317
if these two guys called Larry
and Serge had taken my course,

00:04:37.317 --> 00:04:39.650
this company would be three
times bigger than it already

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.015
is.

00:04:41.015 --> 00:04:44.800
But somehow they escaped
without seeing me there.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.710
Anyhow, I want to talk
to you, basically,

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.390
about life, and problem
solving, and things like that.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:59.030
And if you read one of
the reviews on Amazon,

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.200
you can read his reviews.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.590
My buddy, Bob Sutton, who wrote
a book, "Don't Hire Assholes,"

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.350
or something like
that, he put up,

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.600
"Well, Bernie thinks about the
world different than everyone

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.330
else, but it seems to
be very successful.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.670
So maybe you ought to
try some of his ideas."

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.850
So I'm going to give you some
ideas, which up until Tuesday

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.700
were just Bernie's bullshit,
but now it's written.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.910
So, this is real.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.470
This is real, folks.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.670
I've been getting away with
it for all these years,

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.970
but now I can give you
book where it's real.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.890
I started this stuff--
there's a company

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.900
IDEO, you may or may not know
them, which are my students.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.692
For years I would do
my stuff and people

00:05:38.692 --> 00:05:39.900
would say, "Well how's that?"

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.900
I would say, "Well, that's
what they do at IDEO,

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.040
so it's got to be OK."

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.270
So I had someone to point to.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.130
Now I don't need to
hide behind IDEO.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.960
I can just point to by book.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.120
OK, so what do we
want to talk about?

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.100
Well, what I want to talk about
first is solving problems.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.580
So the issue is,
you're all smart.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.620
Like Larry Page said, you all
deserve to be here, right?

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.730
So you got past that hurdle,
whoever reads that stuff.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.290
And I deal at Stanford
with a lot of smart people,

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.070
and have a lot of smart friends,
and I'm pretty smart myself.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.810
So how come we all mess up,
and we can't solve problems?

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.380
In our lives we have problems.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.770
In our work we have problems.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:21.270
How come we can't just do what
we want to do and it flows?

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.040
Well, you know, it's illogical.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.499
Even if we grasp for something
new, if you're really smart

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:29.790
you should be able to solve it.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.660
So what is it that happens?

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.980
So I've noticed-- I have a life.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.350
I've lived a long time.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.950
And I've had a lot of problems.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.930
I notice my family
has a lot of problems.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.590
My friends have problems.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.640
We do a lot of work
at the d.school, a lot

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.030
of problems around the world.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.160
Before that, in the
design group in ME

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.520
we would do a lot of
projects for companies.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.990
How come people get stuck?

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.200
And I said, this is very
scientific, in my view

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.770
99.999% of the time,
it's because you're

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.270
working on the wrong problem.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.590
It's as simple as that.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.050
And what you've done is
you've taken an answer,

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.160
and you assume
that's the question.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.780
I'll explain that more later.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.890
And it's not a good answer
to what you want to work on.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.070
So even if you solved it, it
really would kind of a crummy

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.440
kludge.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.220
But once you find the
right problem to work on,

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.190
it's generally easy
sailing and sometimes it's

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.290
right in front of you.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.550
So I'll give you a simple
example in my own life,

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.740
and there's two points to this.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.070
The first point is, whatever
I tell you right now is not

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.430
like an inoculation for life.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.840
You have to keep looking at this
stuff, and it's a little hard.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.880
That's the tricky
part about it, just

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.660
knowing about it is not enough.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.300
You have to kind of check
yourself all the time.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.665
So go back some years, and
I'm doing my guru number

00:07:54.665 --> 00:08:00.390
at KTH, which is the MIT
of Sweden in Stockholm.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:03.800
And things are going
great, but at night, I'm

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.320
losing sleep all
night long because I'm

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.960
near the retirement age.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.560
In those days, there was a
thing called, "retirement age."

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.870
And I'm deciding, should I
retire or shouldn't I retire?

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.740
And I'm really losing
sleep over that.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.870
In the middle of one
of my lectures I go,

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.430
"hey, maybe I should apply
some of the stuff to myself."

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:26.610
So that night I go home
and I say-- the trick is,

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.760
the starkness is to
ask yourself what

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.380
it would for you if
you solve your problem.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.720
So I said to myself,
"Well, what's my problem?"

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.380
My problem is deciding whether
I should retire or not.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.000
And I said, "Well, what would do
for me if I solve the problem?"

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.039
I could stop worrying about
whether to retire or not.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:45.200
Simple as that.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.280
So, the problem is
not the decision,

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.950
the problem is to stop worrying.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:53.570
So how do you stop worrying
about whether to retire or not?

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:54.617
It's a no brainer.

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:55.950
You just stop worrying about it.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.000
So I stopped.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.940
And it's been many,
many years, and I never

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.410
worried about again.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.020
So it's a kind of
crummy example,

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.560
but that's the essence
of it, that you

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.980
have the wrong problem.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.699
And often it's a little
subtle change in the thing,

00:09:08.699 --> 00:09:10.490
and you think you're
dealing with something

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.910
which is life and death, and
it's not the right thing.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.290
So that's the model.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:19.406
So let's-- can we
write on this board?

00:09:19.406 --> 00:09:20.340
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.600
BERNARD ROTH: Good.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.950
Oh, and it has
markers, fantastic.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:29.220
OK, so let's take an example so
this becomes really concrete.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.680
And then we'll
apply to your life.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:37.530
So what I do with Stanford
students is this one.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.190
We'll do it with you guys too.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.100
So let's say, oh,
you're having trouble

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.250
deciding getting married.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:49.840
So let's say your problem
is how to get married.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.280
And you've tried everything.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.260
Most people it's not an issue.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.070
They get married or
don't get married,

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.390
but they don't worry about it.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:05.780
But let's say in
your case you're

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.392
really concerned about this.

00:10:07.392 --> 00:10:08.350
You've done everything.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:11.510
You've joined many
computer dating services.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.840
In the old days you would go
to every bar on the Camino, all

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.090
of that kind of stuff.

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:19.030
And your friends are fixing
you up, and nothing works.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.520
Your parents are on your case.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.600
And your older brother
is waiting for you

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.550
to get out of the way
so he could get married

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.300
to his true love, but
he can't get married

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.470
because you haven't
gotten married, whatever

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.060
it is, that whole drama.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.880
So let's say it just
doesn't work for you.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:36.080
So, you're stuck.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.810
And my method says,
probably you're

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.950
stuck because this is
the wrong question.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.340
And the way you find what
the right question is,

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.930
you say what would it do
for me if I solve this.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:49.030
What would it do for
me if I got married?

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.810
So somebody give me an
answer, what would it

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.190
do for you if you got married.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:54.023
Someone.

00:10:54.023 --> 00:10:55.230
AUDIENCE: Your parents
will stop bugging you.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:55.820
BERNARD ROTH: Say it again.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.170
AUDIENCE: Your parents
will stop bugging you.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:58.128
BERNARD ROTH: OK great.

00:10:58.128 --> 00:11:00.510
All right, great.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:10.180
So how to get parents
to stop bugging you.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.232
OK, so that's the problem.

00:11:12.232 --> 00:11:14.190
So the question is, how
do you get your parents

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:15.320
to stop bugging you?

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.417
Well, even if you got
married they might not

00:11:18.417 --> 00:11:20.000
stop bugging you,
because then they're

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.900
going to want grandchildren,
blah, blah, blah.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.040
So if they're going
to bug you, they're

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.123
going to keep bugging you.

00:11:24.123 --> 00:11:26.300
So it wouldn't even solve
that problem, often.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.680
And that's the problem
with this thing.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.060
If it's hard, it's often
because it won't even

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.430
solve the problem.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:35.210
Because you'll marry
the wrong person,

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:36.336
they'll bug you about that.

00:11:36.336 --> 00:11:38.585
Well you know, there's a lot
of ways they can bug you.

00:11:38.585 --> 00:11:40.680
But the question is now,
once you've got this,

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.496
this is a bigger solution
space because there

00:11:43.496 --> 00:11:46.300
are lots of ways to get your
parents to stop bugging you

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.960
including this, let's
say, or maybe not this.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.400
Either way, it doesn't matter.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.650
So how could you get your
parents to stop bugging you?

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:55.560
You could move to the other
end of the earth, right?

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.210
You could do the send them
on a trip around the world.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.800
You could tell them
how much you love them.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:06.100
You could get your brother or
sister to call them every day,

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.529
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:12:08.529 --> 00:12:10.070
If they're divorced,
you can get them

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:11.970
each romantic
relationships so they

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:13.980
don't worry about you so much.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.190
There's a million
ways to do that, OK.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:18.140
So that's the idea, basically.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:21.610
And if that didn't work, why
would you want your parents

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:22.830
to stop bugging you?

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.020
Play with me some more.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:24.870
AUDIENCE: Why?

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:27.453
BERNARD ROTH: What would it do
for you if your parents stopped

00:12:27.453 --> 00:12:28.420
bugging you?

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.920
AUDIENCE: I wouldn't
be as stressed.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:30.450
BERNARD ROTH: Say that again.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:31.150
AUDIENCE: I wouldn't
be as stressed.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.510
BERNARD ROTH: OK, all
right, so that's great.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:39.140
So how to be less stressed.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.100
OK, so now that's
really interesting

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.020
because, again, there
will be lots of ways

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.985
and they may have nothing
to do with your parents.

00:12:50.985 --> 00:12:52.610
They could bug you,
it wouldn't matter.

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:55.510
If I was enlightened-- if I
was an enlightened being it

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:56.900
doesn't matter what you say.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.170
There's no way you could bug me.

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:02.400
It has nothing to
do with that, OK.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.850
And certainly getting
married might not

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.100
make you less stressed at all.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.630
It might make you more stressed.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:11.910
So if your real problem was
how to get less stressed,

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:14.470
none of this will help you.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.012
So that's what the
idea gets at-- the idea

00:13:17.012 --> 00:13:18.970
is to find a problem
which is the real problem.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.560
So this is hypothetical
and may or may not

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.610
ring a bell with you.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.770
The test for all this stuff is
whether works in your own life.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:30.890
So I want you to take a moment
now and think of a real problem

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:31.390
your life.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:36.470
Now I don't want like,
"Peace in the world forever,"

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:37.560
stuff like that.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.340
I want something that's
part of your life.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.470
It could be a work problem.

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.300
It could be a social problem.

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.530
But something, really,
that you lose sleep over.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.497
And just think of that, and
just make a simple sentence.

00:13:48.497 --> 00:13:50.080
If you have something
to write on it's

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.690
good to do that, if you don't,
you can do it in your head.

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.840
I know you're brilliant
enough to hang onto it.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.730
But I want to
start at this level

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:59.030
here with something
that bugs you

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:04.600
in your life that doesn't work
and you'd like to be rid of it.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.390
OK, now this stuff really works.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:10.070
I guarantee you it works,
money back guarantee.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:11.340
If you do it, it works.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:16.080
If you don't do it, it
doesn't work by definition.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.910
So please give it
a shot, no matter

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:20.371
how reluctant you may
think, or how happy you

00:14:20.371 --> 00:14:21.120
may think you are.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.770
Think of something in your
life that doesn't work.

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.960
Just think of it as a
simple sentence like how to,

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.120
or some simple problem issue.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:35.189
OK, so let's play my game
and that game would be,

00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:37.730
what would it do for you if that
were gone in from your life?

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.280
If you solve that issue,
what would it do for you?

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.560
Again, make it a simple sentence
and make it into a problem.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.600
So that's the thing
you really want

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.630
to be going after, not the
thing you started with.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:53.080
So you're converting it.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.370
You're re-framing the
problem into something

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.810
that, if you solve this problem,
it would take care of it

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.060
for you, and you are going
to deal with that directly.

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:02.470
Yes?

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.720
AUDIENCE: Isn't that way of
thinking a little selfish,

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.520
though?

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.686
BERNARD ROTH: One more time.

00:15:06.686 --> 00:15:09.424
AUDIENCE: Isn't that way of
thinking a little selfish?

00:15:09.424 --> 00:15:10.340
BERNARD ROTH: Selfish?

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:10.923
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:15:10.923 --> 00:15:13.604
If your problem includes
not only yourself,

00:15:13.604 --> 00:15:14.770
but people surrounding you--

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:16.150
BERNARD ROTH: Yes.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:19.490
AUDIENCE: --answering what would
it do for you and answering,

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.504
for example, how you can be less
stressed about it doesn't mean

00:15:22.504 --> 00:15:24.920
that it makes a difference in
the people who you want to--

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.960
BERNARD ROTH: Sure,
OK I understand

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.080
what you're saying
hypothetically,

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.705
do you have a specific
problem in mind?

00:15:28.705 --> 00:15:30.130
AUDIENCE: Yes, I'm Greek.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.120
BERNARD ROTH: Greek, I
know about Greeks, yes.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.970
Some of my best
friends are Greek.

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:36.150
AUDIENCE: Yes, so
my problem right now

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.800
would be, for example, how
to make sure that my family

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.330
and friends back home are good.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.510
BERNARD ROTH: Good, OK, OK good.

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:45.050
Stop, stop, OK.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:49.630
So my friend, Panos, just had
his daughter marry a Greek guy

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.310
which makes him very nervous.

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:55.200
And he said, in Greece
what happened a week ago,

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.076
he was the only bank
in Greece operating.

00:15:59.076 --> 00:16:00.700
I understand what
you're talking about,

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:05.150
but the point simply
is you're holding

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.920
what I'm saying incorrect.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.970
If you're really losing sleep
about your parents and all

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.170
that that's fine.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.270
What we do for you what
are you losing sleep over

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.790
it's like how could your
parents be-- frame it.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.270
What's the problem?

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:20.600
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
how can I make sure

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.170
that the situation is solved?

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:26.010
Like, is there anything
I can do as a person

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:27.290
to help the situation?

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:29.340
BERNARD ROTH:
Yeah, I understand.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.080
So your question
is, "what can I do

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.800
to help the
situation in Greece?"

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:33.600
Is that the idea?

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.183
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:16:34.183 --> 00:16:35.960
BERNARD ROTH: OK,
now the game is,

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.610
what would it do
for you if you could

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:40.637
help the situation in Greece?

00:16:40.637 --> 00:16:42.470
AUDIENCE: Well, I guess
everything goes back

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:43.460
to stress, right?

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.360
BERNARD ROTH: Now, look,
the thing to understand

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.290
is if you could help
the situation in Greece,

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.080
you would do it.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.640
You are frustrated,
you are-- you

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.150
know there's a story
I love is this one.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:00.360
A drunk is working along
and he hits a lamppost.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.560
He walks along and
he hits a lamppost.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.380
He walks along and
he hits a lamppost.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:08.426
And finally says, "I give up,
they've got me surrounded."

00:17:08.426 --> 00:17:10.300
But if you're not drunk,
you see the lamppost

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.010
and you walk around it.

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.690
And that's the problem,
you're hitting a lamppost

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:17.619
because the situation
in Greece is terrible,

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:19.970
and your relatives
are in distress,

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:21.800
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:22.420
Right?

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:25.012
OK, so now, what
are you going to do?

00:17:25.012 --> 00:17:26.970
AUDIENCE: Is there nothing
you can do about it?

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:28.170
BERNARD ROTH: I
don't know, so what

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:29.485
are you going to do about it?

00:17:29.485 --> 00:17:30.760
AUDIENCE: That's
what I'm thinking.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:31.600
BERNARD ROTH: OK, good.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.840
How long have you been
thinking about it?

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:33.548
AUDIENCE: Months.

00:17:33.548 --> 00:17:35.870
BERNARD ROTH: Months,
and so the indication

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:40.550
is, you can't do much
about it right now.

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:42.950
I'm not in any way
trivializing it.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.724
I'm not in any way
trivializing your feelings.

00:17:45.724 --> 00:17:47.640
And you could do that,
but I'm saying for you,

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:52.620
what is it doing for you to
think about that Greek thing?

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.590
AUDIENCE: I guess if I made
a the situation a little bit

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.420
different, even for
one person that I know,

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.850
even for one person
that I don't know,

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:03.246
that would make me
happier with my life.

00:18:03.246 --> 00:18:04.620
BERNARD ROTH:
Good, that's great.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:08.290
So why don't you do one
thing to make someone happy?

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:09.402
Who's stopping you?

00:18:09.402 --> 00:18:10.860
AUDIENCE: I'm doing
for one person.

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.770
But then I'm thinking, how
can I make people around me

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.915
more considerate
of the situation?

00:18:17.915 --> 00:18:21.656
If everybody around me
donated a small amount--

00:18:21.656 --> 00:18:23.280
BERNARD ROTH: OK, so
who's stopping you

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.065
from getting people to do that?

00:18:25.065 --> 00:18:25.940
AUDIENCE: I'm trying.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.080
Facebook is helping.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.310
BERNARD ROTH: OK, well am I
stopping you from doing that?

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:34.800
AUDIENCE: No but I'm asking,
if I was wondering like,

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.380
OK, the situation in
Greece makes me stressed,

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.040
how am I going to
deal with my stress

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.411
instead of dealing
with the situation?

00:18:41.411 --> 00:18:43.160
BERNARD ROTH: You know
what's interesting,

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.380
you think you're helping the
situation by being stressed.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:50.780
You actually might help
it by not being stressed.

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.250
I had a woman once in my
workshop with a similar idea,

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:55.970
her problem was
she wanted to get

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.090
her daughter into a good college
and she was very stressed.

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:03.100
And her realization was that
the issue was really her stress,

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.726
not the daughter
going to college.

00:19:04.726 --> 00:19:06.850
Because once her daughter
went into a good college,

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:09.216
she'd find something else
to be stressed about.

00:19:09.216 --> 00:19:10.840
And her stress didn't
help the daughter

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.210
get into a good college or not.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:15.200
So she's dealing with
the wrong problem.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.710
I'm not saying it's an
issue that doesn't exist.

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:19.632
I'm not saying
getting married is

00:19:19.632 --> 00:19:20.840
an issue that does not exist.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.381
I'm just saying it's the wrong
problem for you at the moment,

00:19:23.381 --> 00:19:25.990
and you're not handling it well
because you're a smart person.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:27.950
You have Facebook, you
have all these things,

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:30.340
and somehow it's not working
for you, what you're doing,

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.430
or it is.

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:33.020
If it is, great,
I'm not against it.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.070
I'm happy for you.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:36.960
I'm saying, you having
something, hypothetically,

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.320
that you're losing sleep over,
and you've been working on it,

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.470
it doesn't work.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:45.100
And how come such a smart
person like you can't solve it?

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.750
Well, it's the wrong
problem for you to work on.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.295
It's simply that
it's a hard problem,

00:19:49.295 --> 00:19:51.086
there's a lot of people
in the world trying

00:19:51.086 --> 00:19:52.080
to solve that problem.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.620
So you've put yourself
in a situation which

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:57.340
is the wrong thing
to be working on

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.680
and you could make
yourself over the issue,

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.800
and it's still not going to
change it, do you understand?

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.010
So you have to be
honest with yourself,

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.880
and this is all hard to
say, but you you're lying

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.457
to yourself in some way,
and you're lying to yourself

00:20:10.457 --> 00:20:12.290
because you have a
certain self image either

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:14.650
as a daughter, or the
family member who's

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.210
concerned with these things.

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:18.440
But if you look at what
you're really doing,

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.760
and what's going on, it's
a thing for yourself.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.884
Now it sounds selfish,
but it's not selfish.

00:20:24.884 --> 00:20:26.550
So let's just hang
out for a few minutes

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:28.570
because we'll get
to it in a minute

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.960
and we'll get to what I
call "reasons are bullshit,"

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.970
we'll get to that
in a second, OK.

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:37.720
Anyone else have any problems
understanding this idea?

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.110
Now believe me, it really works.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.013
I do this every
year in a class, I

00:20:42.013 --> 00:20:44.880
have this colleague who every
year says, "this is amazing,

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.220
Bernie."

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.790
It works every year
I come and do it.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.705
So why does he say every
year this is amazing

00:20:50.705 --> 00:20:53.530
and he needs me to come
into the room to do it?

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:56.450
Because he just knows it
intellectually and he hasn't

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:58.860
put into his life,
and as I told you

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:03.660
in my first anecdote
of myself, who

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:07.060
does this stuff all the time,
still got caught not doing it.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.660
So the thing about
it, it's not only

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.915
good to know it intellectually,
you have to apply it,

00:21:10.915 --> 00:21:13.040
and you have to realize
that every time-- if you're

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.320
stuck it's a tool.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.120
Believe me, it works,
I guarantee it works.

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.840
I've done it with thousands of
the people around the world.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.310
It's a simple idea,
if you're stuck,

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:26.430
what would it do for you if
you solved the problem, that

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:28.270
re-frames the problem for you.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.560
If you're stuck again,
go one more level.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.120
Never go more than
two levels above,

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.840
because there you get to the
ultimate question mark of life,

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.650
and the guys in India who
are blind from looking

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:40.910
at the sun and all
that kind of stuff.

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:42.600
You don't want to
be working at Google

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.070
to go more than two levels.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.260
And the trouble is,
you lie to yourself,

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.632
and it's sort of in
the realm of what

00:21:48.632 --> 00:21:51.090
she's doing because she has a
certain self image of herself

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:52.660
as this is good person.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:56.130
And a good person, of course,
wants to do something in Greece

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.270
and she's not doing it
so she's frustrated.

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:01.120
But the thing is, she wants
to make herself feel better,

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.800
clearly, and that sounds
selfish, but it's not selfish.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.550
And she could do
better for the people

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:09.800
there if she were more
forthright with the thing.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.940
So that's one or hurdles
with solving problems,

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:16.780
once you get the right problem
it works out fine, in general.

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.450
Sometimes, you
sabotage yourself.

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:22.650
And you sabotage
yourself with reasons.

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:26.825
And the problem is you don't
say, "I have an excuse."

00:22:26.825 --> 00:22:28.850
You don't say, "I have
an excuse, Bernie."

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:32.130
You say, "the reason is this--"
and the thing to understand

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:35.660
is, in terms of
personal behavior,

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:37.420
all reasons are bullshit.

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.990
You have no idea why
you're doing stuff,

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:43.570
you just do it and you
make up a reason for it.

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:45.671
And that's called being
a reasonable person.

00:22:45.671 --> 00:22:46.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:49.070
If you don't have a reason,
you're not a reasonable person,

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:50.110
right?

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:52.970
If you say, "Why did you
come here to talk at Google?"

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:56.360
If I say, "I don't
know," this guy's crazy.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.525
But if I say I came
because I was invited

00:22:58.525 --> 00:23:01.100
or I came because I want
to spread my wisdom,

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.670
it's all reasonable, right?

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:05.250
If I take this guy, he's
looking at his thing,

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:08.169
I punch him in the nose, he
says, "Why did you do that?"

00:23:08.169 --> 00:23:09.210
If I say, "I don't know."

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:10.279
I'm not reasonable.

00:23:10.279 --> 00:23:11.820
If you punch him in
the nose and say,

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.430
"You look like the guy
who raped my neighbor."

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:15.780
Then it's a good reason, right?

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:20.610
So, it's on that absurd
level that we do our reasons,

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:22.200
and there have been
a lot of studies

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.130
that show that
people's brains are

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:27.300
such-- the part of the brain
that determines what you do

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.910
usually fires before the
part that figures out

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:31.830
the reason for doing it.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:34.360
So usually you do stuff
and then you say, why?

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.600
And my favorite
example is, right now

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.880
my mouth is a little dry.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.190
Now if you say to me, "Why's
your mouth dry, Bernie?"

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:42.780
I'd say, "well, I'm
speaking a lot."

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:44.830
That's logical, right?

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:48.540
But I don't tell you that I
was out last night drinking,

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:52.130
I don't tell you I'm
always dehydrated.

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:54.240
I don't tell you a
lot of things which

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.600
don't make me look as good
as, "I'm speaking now."

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.750
So, in anything you do there's
a million reasons for it,

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.110
and it's a matter of the
one that you pick out.

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:07.330
To say something is a reason
for your behavior this a lie,

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:09.230
and you need it
to be reasonable.

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:11.230
So what I do is, if
you ask me reason,

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:14.410
I'll tell you something, I'm
not going to be a jerk about it.

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:18.060
But if I know when I say it
that that reason is bullshit,

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.490
then I'm going to say I'm
not going to do that again,

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:24.470
and I'll do it again, but
eventually I'll stop doing it.

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:31.200
So you have to realize that, in
fact, anything you call reason

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.824
is not the reason for anything.

00:24:33.824 --> 00:24:35.615
So I don't want you to
take my word for it,

00:24:35.615 --> 00:24:37.280
I want you to do a
little experiment.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:41.020
I want you to turn to
a person next to you

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:45.380
and so I want you to do a little
exercise which goes like this.

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:49.344
So you're going to work
with me, you're lucky.

00:24:49.344 --> 00:24:50.760
And the way it
goes is like this--

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.850
I've done this workshop
a million times

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:54.710
with the people I
work with at Stanford,

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:58.360
my whole group in the design
group before the d.school.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.880
So, in our meeting
if some guy gets up--

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.410
we have one professor who's
always crabbing about stuff.

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:06.430
So he gets up and he
says, "Well the reason

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:08.350
I can't do this is
the Dean said--"

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:11.740
Everyone goes "That's
a good reason."

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:16.050
With the emphasis on the O's,
which means it's bullshit.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:18.075
So in my parlance,
"It's a good reason"

00:25:18.075 --> 00:25:19.670
means it's not a reason at all.

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:22.490
So if she's my
partner here, I say,

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.000
"the reason why
my mouth is dry is

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.250
because I'm talking too much."

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:27.456
She says, "That's
a good reason."

00:25:27.456 --> 00:25:27.956
Go ahead.

00:25:27.956 --> 00:25:29.255
AUDIENCE: That's a good reason.

00:25:29.255 --> 00:25:31.380
BERNARD ROTH: OK, now I
say, the reason I came here

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.120
is because I was invited.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.710
AUDIENCE: That's a good reason.

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:38.270
BERNARD ROTH: OK, so everything
I said is true, OK, it's true,

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:41.780
but it's not the reason.

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.900
Because I could have been
invited and not come,

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:45.552
I could have come
uninvited also.

00:25:45.552 --> 00:25:47.010
There's a lot of
different things--

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:47.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:49.426
--so it's kind of funny,
you know what I mean?

00:25:49.426 --> 00:25:50.279
And why did I come?

00:25:50.279 --> 00:25:52.570
Did I come because I want
you to think I'm a great man?

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.740
Did I come because I
want to sell books?

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.871
There's a million
reasons in there,

00:25:56.871 --> 00:25:58.370
and I'm going to
pick the one that's

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:02.140
going to make me look the
coolest, that's my self image.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.510
I want you to experience
that for yourself.

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:06.980
So what I'm going to ask you
to do is turn to your partner

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.640
and I'm going to first tell
her a whole bunch of reasons,

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.810
she's going to tell me
each one is a good reason,

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:14.120
and then at some point
I'll say switch roles.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.800
And then she'll
tell me her reasons,

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.870
and I'll say "That's a good
reason." for each of them.

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:20.960
OK, you get the idea?

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.100
And if you do that, you're
gonna get a reward from me.

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:28.317
All right, so please
turn to a partner.

00:26:28.317 --> 00:26:29.150
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:35.030
And if you don't have a
partner, raise your hand.

00:26:36.594 --> 00:26:37.760
AUDIENCE: A reason for what?

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:38.190
BERNARD ROTH: What's that?

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:39.295
AUDIENCE: A reason for what?

00:26:39.295 --> 00:26:40.130
For why we're here?

BERNARD ROTH: For anything--

one minute, one minute, one
minute, one minute, one minute,

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.250
one minute.

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:49.810
He asked me a very [INAUDIBLE]
question, a reason for what?

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:54.090
Reasons for anything, but take
real things in your life, OK.

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:57.660
Like whatever happens in your
life, the reason I'm here,

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.820
or the reason I'm going
home tonight, or the reason

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.700
I went to the movies yesterday.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.120
Just real stuff in
your life and just

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.340
put a reason for your behavior.

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:09.460
So the reason is for your
behavior, real things

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.474
in your life, the behavior, OK?

00:27:11.474 --> 00:27:13.307
AUDIENCE: And can you
say it's a good reason

00:27:13.307 --> 00:27:14.420
or it's a bad reason?

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.020
BERNARD ROTH: No, always,
"It's a good reason."

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:17.960
They're all bad.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.370
What you don't understand,
she asked, can you

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:24.110
say any reason-- there is no
good reason, this is a joke,

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:25.450
always it's a bad reason.

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:28.160
They're bad in the sense
that they're not uniquely

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.030
the reason for anything.

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:32.730
They're a reason and the
fact that you're singling

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:35.849
that out is the problem, OK.

00:27:35.849 --> 00:27:36.682
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:47.340
OK, thank you, thank
you, thank you.

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.620
You get the idea.

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.870
So one of the ones she does
did triggered something

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:52.230
in me which I love very much.

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:55.790
I was at a PhD exam up at
Stanford in the ed school

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:59.020
and we're about to start but
there was a professor who

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:02.450
was coming late, she happened
to be a person from Berkeley.

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:06.080
And they said, "Oh she's
coming from Berkeley."

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.850
Like that's OK to be late.

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:10.680
And she just triggered that,
she said, "The reason I was late

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.510
is I came from the
other building."

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:15.584
That's the bullshit I'm trying
to get you to understand.

00:28:15.584 --> 00:28:17.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:22.130
We do that to ourselves all
the time, it's just an excuse,

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:25.530
she didn't leave in time,
she didn't leave in time,

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:27.210
among other reasons.

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:31.470
And that's what we do, so it's
so obvious when you see it.

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:33.430
And the problem
is that I've just

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:37.960
ruined your life because you're
always using bullshit reasons

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.150
and all the people in your life
are using bullshit reasons.

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:43.020
So the first thing
I've got to do in order

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.220
to make, at least, that
you won't get killed

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:49.730
and lose your relationship, do
not try this at home, please

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:50.750
do not try this.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:54.420
It's OK to say, "hey we had this
crazy professor today at work,

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:55.870
and he said reasons
are bullshit."

00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:57.750
That's OK, but
what you can't say

00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:59.110
is your reasons are bullshit.

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:01.020
I have never said
that to my wife,

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.910
I have never said
that to my friends,

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:04.930
I've never said it
to my family, I never

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:06.385
say it to the guys
I bike with who

00:29:06.385 --> 00:29:09.850
are full of bullshit
reasons for everything.

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:13.010
Do not do that, give
them a copy of my book,

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:14.350
that's the way out of that.

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:15.600
That will do it, really.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.740
Do not-- just fix yourself.

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:20.090
But it's so simple
when you see that, when

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:22.680
you see how we use
reasons all the time,

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.360
they're just excuses, and once
you get past that you'll change

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.910
your behavior if you want to.

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:30.210
Now it doesn't happen,
necessarily, the next time,

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:31.460
but it will change.

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.480
And I've lived through
that many times.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.780
So the idea is, it's a
really good framework

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:38.990
to have in the back of your mind
that all reasons are bullshit.

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:41.967
And we need them socially,
we have to be reasonable.

00:29:41.967 --> 00:29:44.050
But we don't need to keep
repeating the same thing

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:46.520
if we realize what
I just is bullshit

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.230
and I don't want
to do it again, I

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:49.920
don't want to come late again.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.740
And then you will
come late again,

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:54.330
but eventually you'll learn
to leave 10 minutes earlier,

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:55.250
If you want to.

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:57.690
And if you don't you'll
have a good life without it,

00:29:57.690 --> 00:29:58.660
but that's the point.

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:03.430
Yes, Let me get-- I've been
remiss in giving people

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.930
the mic.

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:04.992
I'm sorry.

00:30:04.992 --> 00:30:06.800

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:09.460
So I totally agree--

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:10.350
BERNARD ROTH: OK.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:11.850
AUDIENCE: --but I
wonder whether you

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:15.550
think that for everything we
do there's a lot of reasons

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:17.550
and there isn't one
predominant one,

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:19.330
and just arbitrarily
do something.

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:20.990
Or there's some deep
reason that we're

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:23.520
not aware of that's
somehow subconscious

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.260
and is driving our behavior.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:28.810
BERNARD ROTH: Well, my belief
is that there are many reasons

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:30.810
and there's a veil--
so the ultimate reason

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:34.020
is some great ancestor had
sex, if they didn't, you

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:34.801
wouldn't be here.

00:30:34.801 --> 00:30:36.300
So that's the reason
for everything,

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:37.750
but that seems absurd.

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:39.910
But it goes that way,
you know, there's

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:41.210
a whole hierarchy of reasons.

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:43.050
Some seem more
relevant because they

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:45.560
are more recent and all that.

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:49.380
However, what you
choose to do is not

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.490
necessarily related to what
seems like the obvious reason

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:53.110
right now.

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:57.169
So, our friend from Greece
left, but there may be deep--

00:30:57.169 --> 00:30:58.710
I don't know her
well and stuff like,

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:00.510
and I understand what
she's talking about,

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:01.980
of course, it's
not unreasonable,

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.890
but that reason
for that behavior

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:05.120
may go back to her childhood.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.930
It may go back to
what her mother did,

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:08.750
or how her parents rated her.

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:11.250
It's not as simple
as you think is,

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:13.240
we're all very
complex beings, we're

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.150
formed by heredity
and environment,

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:19.260
and the things we do,
we just do and then

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:23.160
we make things that make
our self image seem OK.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:28.710
But if we remove the things, you
still have that behavior often,

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:31.910
or not, I don't know.

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:32.800
And who cares?

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.700
I mean I don't care.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.620
It's not my research, I
don't care about that.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:38.490
What I care about is functioning
and making myself a better

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:41.310
functioning person and having
a better life for myself

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:42.580
and the people around you.

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:45.060
And I'm telling you if
you get rid of reasons

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.360
it will work much better.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.870
A simple example in my life,
I get from China, and India,

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:53.380
and all over the world maybe
three or four emails a week,

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:57.010
"Professor, I'd like to
come and do a PhD with you."

00:31:57.010 --> 00:31:59.320
And I used to give
all-- I'm sorry,

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.610
I don't have enough money in my
group, I'm going on sabbatical,

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:05.629
and it's all bullshit because
if I want to take anybody

00:32:05.629 --> 00:32:07.920
there's nothing that would
stop me from taking someone.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:11.260
So the bottom line is, I just
don't want to take that person,

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:14.020
and I just say, "I'm
sorry I can't help you."

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:17.850
I get most back a, "thank
you for answering my email,

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:18.654
professor."

00:32:18.654 --> 00:32:20.070
When I used to
give reasons they'd

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:24.050
go-- if I say I don't have
enough money in my research

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:26.280
group, "I have a rich
uncle, he'll do this--"

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:29.120
and it goes on, and on, and on,
and it's totally dysfunctional.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.900
I'm not going to take
the person anyway.

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:33.560
So just trying to make them
feel nice with the reasons

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:35.440
actually makes it worse.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:39.410
Often we give reasons to make
it feel nicer for someone else,

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:41.660
we're really trying to make
it easier for ourselves.

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:44.370
If you just say what you
do without the excuses

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:46.270
and the reasons, is fine.

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:49.060
"I came late, sorry."

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.980
Without why you-- I don't care
why, you came late, that's all.

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:53.270
It's as simple as that.

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:55.350
I don't need the
bullshit reasons.

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:57.210
So really it's a
very simple thing,

00:32:57.210 --> 00:32:59.990
I have a chapter titled
"reasons are bullshit."

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:01.740
Believe me, try it
out, believe me,

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.290
just try not to give reasons.

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:05.690
But again, don't tell anyone
else their reasons are

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:07.090
bullshit.

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:09.290
And people are
great teachers, you

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:11.270
should learn from everyone
in your environment.

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:13.790
If you see what they do,
just don't do the same thing

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:14.420
yourself.

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:17.300
OK, so that's kind of the
next point I want to make,

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.300
we're getting close to time.

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:23.600
I'm going to do one more shtick,
unless you have questions,

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.410
we could do that first.

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:28.590
Anyone have some questions, or
I'll rant on a little bit more.

00:33:31.536 --> 00:33:35.470
OK, so last thing that's really
important, so what we first

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:37.580
talked about is
essentially re-framing,

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.900
to make sure you working
on a problem that's

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.220
the right problem.

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:45.050
The next thing is not to let
yourself off with excuses,

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:50.660
to actually have the right thing
that-- just take responsibility

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.100
for your behavior.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.945
And if it's not what
you want, change it,

00:33:53.945 --> 00:33:55.550
it's as simple as that.

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:59.050
And the next thing
is, people confuse

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:01.630
two states, which are
very different states,

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:03.350
as the same thing.

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:07.420
And that is this whole
idea of trying and doing.

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:10.190
And there's this big
line that people always

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:11.880
get from Star
Wars, which I hate,

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:15.830
"There's no try, just do."

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:20.280
I hate to contradict, but
there is try, and there is do.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.409
And I understand the
context they use it in,

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:24.739
but they're two different
states and the problem

00:34:24.739 --> 00:34:27.469
is we confuse the idea
between trying and doing.

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:29.570
And if you try and do
something, it might happen,

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:31.350
it might not happen.

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:33.650
It's just that way and if
there's some obstacles,

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:35.230
you're just going to not do it.

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:36.679
If you're doing
something, then it

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:38.570
doesn't matter if there
are obstacles or not,

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:40.199
you're gonna do it.

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:43.290
Whatever it takes, you're gonna
do it, it's as simple as that.

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:47.270
My great story on that happened
a few months ago, my wife and I

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:50.179
were driving in San Fransisco
and there's a theater called

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:51.090
the Roxy theater.

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:53.006
You probably all live
in San Fransisco, right?

00:34:53.006 --> 00:34:55.110
So you all know the Roxy
in the mission district.

00:34:55.110 --> 00:35:00.210
And they had a huge
line, bigger than ever,

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:01.960
and I noticed on
the marquee that it

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:05.200
was a movie about a band and
the band was going to be there.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.270
I said, "That's going
to be great, let's go."

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:09.640
And my wife said, "No, no,
I'm tired, let's go home."

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:10.830
I said, "Come on,
come on, let's go."

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:12.000
She said, "OK, we'll go."

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.120
I said, "Get out of the
car, buy the tickets,

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.870
I'll go find a parking space."

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:19.060
So 10 minutes later, I come
back and she's standing in front

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:21.170
the box office, not on line.

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:23.470
I say, "Well, why
aren't you on line?"

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:25.590
and she said,
"They're sold out."

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:28.100
I said, "Well, so what, why
didn't you get some tickets."

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:29.460
She said, "They're sold out."

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.410
I said, "Come on."

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:32.430
So I go, and of course
five minutes later, I

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:35.220
have two tickets and we
go in, and she was right,

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.220
it was a crummy show and
we shouldn't have gone.

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:41.080
But the point simply
is, the she was trying,

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.420
she really do want to
go, but she was trying,

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:47.470
and being sold out is the best
excuse or reason in the world.

00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:49.620
They're sold out, what can I do?

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:51.570
Now, give me a break,
just because they're

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:54.700
sold out, if you really want
to go to something you can go.

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:58.160
It's just a matter of price,
or whatever it takes, or luck.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.771
But there's certainly
someone in this long line

00:36:00.771 --> 00:36:03.020
in San Francisco who is going
to have an extra ticket,

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:06.430
or sell me their ticket if I
give them enough money, right?

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:09.440
It's not a problem to get
into the Roxy theater which

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:13.810
is crummy and smelly and
all that stuff if you want,

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:15.520
but it's a great example.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:21.160
She was trying, she really was,
she was honestly willing to go.

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.910
She was giving it a
try, but the minute

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:26.464
she got an obstacle
it was, "whew, OK,

00:36:26.464 --> 00:36:27.380
we're done with that."

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:30.320
I was going to go no matter
what, no matter what it took.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.930
It turned out it
was pretty easy,

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:34.540
but I would have gone
to a much higher level

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:37.670
of doing if I wanted to because
I was determined to do it.

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:40.100
Well that's an example of
what happens in our lives

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:41.270
all the time.

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:44.430
If we get obstacles and we're
here, we're like the drunk,

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:46.590
they've got us surrounded,
I can't do anything.

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:49.770
And if you're not drunk, it's
just simple walking around it

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:50.509
and you do it.

00:36:50.509 --> 00:36:52.800
I cannot tell you, there's
so many people who 've taken

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:55.250
our workshop, there was some
guys from digital TV took

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:58.490
an exec ed workshop
I was running.

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:00.000
There's a thing I
do, an exercise,

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.480
where you try and take
a cup away from me,

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.810
and if you try you don't
succeed and stuff like that.

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:10.602
So, they went back to
digital TV and they

00:37:10.602 --> 00:37:12.810
had a project they wanted
to do and the managers said

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:15.422
no, we have no room,
you guys can't do it.

00:37:15.422 --> 00:37:17.005
And they tell me
they said, we huddled

00:37:17.005 --> 00:37:20.226
and we said, "Let's take
the cup away from Bernie."

00:37:20.226 --> 00:37:21.600
And what they did
is, they set up

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.590
an office right in the hallway,
and they started working,

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:26.750
and eventually they got
space and moved ahead

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:27.530
with the project.

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:30.830
But it's an example, a lot of
people say no all the time.

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:32.210
I don't know how
it is at Google,

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:35.220
here they probably say yes 10
times or something like that.

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:39.270
But whatever it is,
you do the hurdles,

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:44.570
and it's a question of trying
or doing, and they're both OK.

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:47.720
That's what I don't like about
"There's no try, just do."

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.800
I think, if you were in the
doing state, that's true,

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.680
but if you're trying
state, it's OK.

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.907
And you could try and do
stuff and if it works,

00:37:54.907 --> 00:37:56.490
it works if it doesn't
work, you don't

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:58.730
have to live your life
at this great intensity

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:01.870
that some people do.

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:06.270
So to summarise,
if you get stuck,

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:08.360
it's important to
realize if you're

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.620
working on the right problem.

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:14.810
And I gave you a very easy
way re-frame the problem.

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:16.920
Then, if you're
going to execute,

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.370
you've got to make sure
you don't let yourself off

00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:23.230
with bullshit reasons
called excuses.

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:28.150
And just remembering all
reasons are bullshit is true,

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:30.690
and you don't need a reason,
you just do what you do.

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:33.680
And then the other
thing is to make sure

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:34.836
which state you're in.

00:38:34.836 --> 00:38:36.460
If you're trying to
do it, that's fine,

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.360
and if you're doing
it, it's fine.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.990
But they're not the same state.

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:41.880
And you could switch
one to the other.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.950
If I have to kill you
in order to do it,

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:45.660
I might decide I
don't want to do it,

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:47.570
I ought to decide I
don't want to do it.

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:49.510
It's fine to switch,
it's just not

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:52.279
fine to think you're one
when you're in the other one,

00:38:52.279 --> 00:38:53.695
and the one that
we mainly confuse

00:38:53.695 --> 00:38:56.110
is we think we're doing
when we we're actually

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:58.260
in the trying state.

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:02.150
So that's kind of getting
toward the end of my time,

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:03.870
but we do have some
time for questions,

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:06.660
and rewards for
people with questions.

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:08.750
So in my class I
actually ask people,

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:11.440
I not only ask, I force
people to ask questions.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.760
So as a shareholder
in Google, I demand

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.651
that you ask me a question.

00:39:15.651 --> 00:39:17.650
AUDIENCE: You think you're
doing but you're just

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:18.870
trying, how do you--

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:19.740
BERNARD ROTH: How do
you know the difference?

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:21.210
AUDIENCE: Is there a clear
way to tell the difference?

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:23.250
BERNARD ROTH: Well, I
mean, usually the results

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:24.220
will tell you.

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:28.310
So if you think you're
doing and suddenly you

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:31.870
realize nothing's
happening, as an example,

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:34.770
that woman if she's been
helping the people in Greece

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:41.260
for six months and nothing's
happening, she's trying.

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:44.899
So she has to stop Facebooking,
or whatever, take her money

00:39:44.899 --> 00:39:46.190
and go there or whatever it is.

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:46.970
I don't know.

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:49.330
But I'm just saying it's
clearly not working.

00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:51.590
So that's the
easiest thing you do.

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:54.780
It's just like my wife, we were
not getting into the theater

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:58.330
when the moment came,
so she was trying.

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:00.620
And doing is you do
it, you accomplish it,

00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:03.380
so if it's just not
working, you'll know.

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:08.790
And actually, the interesting
thing is, to try takes force,

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:12.980
to do is power, and it's much
better to be powerful in life

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:14.680
than forceful in life.

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:17.850
And it actually takes
less force to, often,

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:20.920
than it does to try
because it goes,

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.680
it's like there's no
question about it.

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:27.740
When someone tries to take
this thing away from me,

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:30.922
we struggle, we fight,
but if they do it,

00:40:30.922 --> 00:40:32.130
it's like an Aikido exercise.

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:35.670
I don't have a chance, I'm just
overwhelmed by the intention

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:36.920
to do it.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.760
So it takes an intention
to do something

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:42.020
and you have to give
it some attention,

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:44.950
and if you do that, you're
doing it, it's as clear as that.

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:46.600
Otherwise just stay
home, "Oh, I wish,

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:51.050
I wish there was some way
I could--" that's trying.

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:53.940
Someone, yes, OK, let's see
if we can get to you next, OK.

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:55.630
But wait, I've got
to give her a reward,

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:57.463
I forgot my rewards,
one minute, one minute.

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:08.180
So, people who ask
questions-- you

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:12.855
sort of did before, so you get
a reward, and you get a reward.

00:41:12.855 --> 00:41:14.480
And this, you can
put on your computer,

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.190
it will spread such
stuff and bullshit.

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:18.652
Here we go, there you go, you
get this and then you ask.

00:41:18.652 --> 00:41:20.985
Go ahead, and you'll get one
anyway, because you already

00:41:20.985 --> 00:41:22.034
earned one, go ahead.

00:41:22.034 --> 00:41:24.450
AUDIENCE: So I think these
three concepts are pretty deep,

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:26.990
but the one where you
talked about asking yourself

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:29.490
the bullshit
questions, do you do it

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:31.737
only for the most
important ones, or the ones

00:41:31.737 --> 00:41:34.070
that you are [INAUDIBLE] to,
or you just make it a habit

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.050
and paralyze yourself.

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:35.630
I'm just--

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:36.900
BERNARD ROTH: I'm
not understanding

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:37.810
what you are asking.

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:41.586
AUDIENCE: So if I'm going to
ask myself the questions of why

00:41:41.586 --> 00:41:42.960
am I doing it,
why am I doing it,

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.096
for every small
thing which I do--

00:41:45.096 --> 00:41:46.470
BERNARD ROTH: No,
no, no, no, no.

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:48.820
You're not asking
why you're doing it,

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:54.420
you're asking yourself--
if you're in Google,

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:59.284
here, you've done a lot of
good things in your life.

00:41:59.284 --> 00:42:01.450
You didn't worry about
getting dressed this morning,

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:03.240
you got here, you didn't worry
about getting in the room,

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:03.830
you got here.

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:05.960
We do a million things we
never even think about.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:08.270
But there are very
few things that people

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:12.170
like you and me lose sleep over,
that's what I'm talking about,

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:14.550
not everything.

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:17.090
If it works, leave it
alone, don't mess with it.

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:20.430
Do not mess with anything
that works in your life.

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:21.999
Please, OK?

00:42:21.999 --> 00:42:24.290
I don't want everyone to say
I ruined-- leave it alone,

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:25.620
you're doing fine.

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:27.340
You're doing fine in
most of your life.

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:29.839
But we all have these little
things, that's what I'm saying,

00:42:29.839 --> 00:42:31.690
those little things
are the ones if you

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:34.920
do that and say "What will it do
for me?" you'll get an insight,

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.710
it'll open up the
solution space,

00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:39.760
and often it will solve itself
like my question about when

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.420
I should retire or not.

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:42.770
It takes care of itself.

00:42:45.747 --> 00:42:47.580
You earned this from
before, but if you have

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:48.770
another question you could--

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:50.620
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:53.770
I had a question that is
sort of about this, which

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:56.750
was the implication of
recognizing that everything's

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.440
a bullshit reason.

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:00.215
So I think I wasn't
sure whether you

00:43:00.215 --> 00:43:02.190
were trying to say that
if somebody gives you

00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:05.390
no and some reasons you
should realize that those

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:06.290
are bullshit reasons.

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:08.899
Or whether when
you're trying to get

00:43:08.899 --> 00:43:10.940
somewhere, that your
reasons are bullshit reasons

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:15.640
and that rephrasing the
question will help you, or both.

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:19.010
BERNARD ROTH: What I'm saying
is that, the way you're built,

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:22.830
the way all of us are built
is we don't actually know.

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:26.720
This whole idea of there being
a reason for a specific behavior

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:27.910
is faulty.

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:30.700
There is not a reason
for specific behavior

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:34.850
since he and I could
have the same behavior

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:39.430
and have different reasons for
exactly doing the same thing.

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:41.680
And in fact, there is a
million reasons we've done it,

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:44.744
we have a different
history, and we can't figure

00:43:44.744 --> 00:43:46.035
that all out, it's complicated.

00:43:46.035 --> 00:43:48.050
It goes way back
to your childhood

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:50.850
and maybe when you
were in your cells,

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:53.210
and maybe back to
something some cells

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:55.280
that came out of
the Big Bang, who

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.770
knows why, I don't know why.

00:43:56.770 --> 00:43:59.610
But it's so complicated
for your behavior,

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:02.580
it's not a simple thing
of cause and effect.

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:05.795
And when you make the simple
cause effect model, it's great,

00:44:05.795 --> 00:44:08.960
it's functional, it makes
you a reasonable person,

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:11.820
and it's fine, keep it all
the time, don't mess with it.

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:14.730
However, there are times
when it gets in your way,

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:17.810
and you're letting
yourself off the hook.

00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:20.840
You know, like she
got here because she's

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:23.130
in a distant building.

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:25.000
I don't care, it's not
that life and death,

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.470
but it's a good
example of this thing.

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:30.080
She got here because
she came late,

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.870
and she's late, that's all.

00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:34.690
She doesn't know why she's late.

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:37.910
It could be, whatever
it is, I don't know.

00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:40.170
It could be her parents
were always late,

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:42.010
it could be she
grew up in a culture

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:43.620
where the lateness didn't count.

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:47.184
I don't know, I don't know what
it is, and it doesn't matter.

00:44:47.184 --> 00:44:48.725
All I'm saying is
take responsibility

00:44:48.725 --> 00:44:51.090
for your behavior,
and don't let yourself

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:54.760
off the hook with reasons
because they're just excuses.

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:57.420
And if you label them as
excuses, you wouldn't do it.

00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:04.630
And you're sugar coating it by
saying it's a reason, it's not,

00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:07.540
and you don't know the reason,
that's what I'm saying.

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:11.230
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering
if you'd thought, maybe,

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:16.500
about the role of the poor and
thinking trying versus doing?

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:20.030
Is there any kind of
differences in say, maybe

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:22.240
a socioeconomically
disadvantaged person

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:26.950
couldn't buy movie tickets
to a sold out show?

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:29.390
Is it just limited
doing opportunities,

00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:31.420
or how do you do that?

00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:33.670
BERNARD ROTH: Well, everyone
has different strategies.

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:35.140
So if I'm a rich
guy I could buy,

00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:37.340
if I'm a poor guy i could
steal, I don't know,

00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:40.300
it's whatever-- I could
beg or I could to give you

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.560
a heart rendering story.

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:44.620
You know, "My brother's in
the theater and he's sick

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:46.620
and I have to, could I
please have your ticket?"

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:49.690
I don't know, whatever it
takes, that's the whole point.

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:52.219
There's no right answer
to it, it's just,

00:45:52.219 --> 00:45:53.760
whatever it takes
I'm going to do it,

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:54.850
I'm going to get it done.

00:45:54.850 --> 00:45:56.800
And often you feel
really proud of yourself,

00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:59.140
I feel really proud that
I got those two tickets

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:01.100
and I'm telling the
whole world about it.

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:03.400
My wife hates when
I tell the story,

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:06.280
but it's so clearly that thing.

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.490
And there's no one
answer, and money may not

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:11.850
work in some cases, although
it often does work pretty well.

00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:13.560
But it doesn't matter
what the answer

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.120
is, if you have a
technical problem to solve,

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.430
ammonium may not
work with that thing.

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:20.890
But some different way
of approaching it will,

00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:24.020
and whatever it is.

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:27.660
I once had this experience, I
couldn't solve a math problem,

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:31.650
a very tough problem, and I
was going to give a talk on it

00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:33.910
and I had given the
inflated title where

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:37.130
I could solve the general case.

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:39.860
I was, in my mind, getting
ready for the talk the next day

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:43.290
and I said, "the reason I can't
solve the general case is--"

00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:44.790
And as I started
to give the reason,

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:47.550
it was clear I could
solve the general case.

00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:50.430
But I had never let
go of the reason,

00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:52.550
I realized it was
a bullshit reason,

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:55.330
so it even works
and technical stuff.

00:46:55.330 --> 00:46:57.210
You don't know the
reasons for stuff,

00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:59.726
you know what happens,
that's all you know.

00:46:59.726 --> 00:47:01.710
And you don't need
to know the reasons,

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:04.370
the reasons are
nonsense, they're not

00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:08.730
taking responsibility for
what the situation is.

00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:10.320
Just use it a little
bit, you'll see,

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.760
it doesn't matter if you
believe me and it makes sense

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.590
or doesn't, just test it out.

00:47:14.590 --> 00:47:16.840
The next time you're
about to give a reason,

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.400
if you don't have to, just stop.

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:22.780
Just say what's going on
and what you're going to do.

00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:23.660
Anyone else?

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:26.120
Yes, how are you, the
stickers are going.

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:29.590
So here's this and here's this.

00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:31.980
AUDIENCE: I was just thinking
that, potentially, reasons

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:34.190
also show for great companies.

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:37.520
Like companies without bullshit
reasons get things done,

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:40.950
and do you think that's
true, or have you

00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:42.946
seen any examples of that?

00:47:42.946 --> 00:47:44.440
BERNARD ROTH: Of what?

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:46.890
AUDIENCE: Good companies that
don't-- that have given up

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:47.390
reasons--

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:48.723
BERNARD ROTH: The whole company?

00:47:48.723 --> 00:47:50.370
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:55.580
BERNARD ROTH: It's too general
a question for me, I don't know.

00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:57.930
You know, you get
it, actually, when

00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:00.330
people get caught with their
fingers in the cookie jars.

00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:04.220
Like, so when good
companies do something bad,

00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:06.772
they'll generally admit
it and when bad companies

00:48:06.772 --> 00:48:08.480
do something bad, they
generally give you

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.690
all sorts of reasons for it.

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:15.250
I don't know if that's true,
but that's sort of my idea.

00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:18.050
In fact, you get that all
the time, even in politics.

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:24.070
Like Clinton and Nixon got into
more trouble by saying they

00:48:24.070 --> 00:48:26.540
didn't do it than if
they said they did it.

00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:28.950
You know, "I did it.

00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:32.450
Something happened in the
Oval Office, I did it."

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:38.000
Or, Nixon, "Yes, we
had the burglars."

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.870
Just by not doing
it and they give you

00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:44.630
all these reasons and stuff like
that, it just becomes messy.

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:46.880
But maybe people are getting
away with it all the time

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.880
and we just don't know about it.

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.074
OK, other questions?

00:48:51.074 --> 00:48:52.740
AUDIENCE: It seems
like you could end up

00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:55.840
being in a doing state, but
end up working on something

00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:58.420
that is genuinely impossible.

00:48:58.420 --> 00:48:59.550
You've never run into that?

00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:02.104
BERNARD ROTH: You mean
something impossible?

00:49:02.104 --> 00:49:02.770
AUDIENCE: Yeah--

00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:03.620
BERNARD ROTH: Yeah, sure, sure.

00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:04.860
AUDIENCE: Like I'm gonna
go to the sun [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:06.401
BERNARD ROTH: Well,
if you're working

00:49:06.401 --> 00:49:10.150
on something that's
impossible, then you're never

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:12.220
going to solve it, right?

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.650
Is that your definition
of impossible?

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:15.650
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I guess.

00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:17.650
BERNARD ROTH: So the
question is, "What would it

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:19.249
do for you if you solved it?"

00:49:19.249 --> 00:49:21.040
AUDIENCE: Oh, so you're
back to the first--

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:21.970
BERNARD ROTH: Well,
the idea is, let's

00:49:21.970 --> 00:49:24.511
say you're working on something
you don't know is impossible.

00:49:24.511 --> 00:49:25.632
Let's say a simple case.

00:49:25.632 --> 00:49:27.840
Let's say it's impossible
for you to ever get married

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.890
because you have bad breath,
no one ever wants to marry you.

00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:33.450
So no matter what you do, you're
never going to get married.

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:35.860
So the question is,
"What's it going

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:37.810
to do for you if
you go married?"

00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:40.442
So if it's, "I'm going
to get companionship,"

00:49:40.442 --> 00:49:42.150
well you can get a
dog, the dog might not

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:44.000
care about the bad breath.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.450
Or if you hire
someone, enough money,

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:48.080
they don't care about
it, we know that.

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:51.290
So you're working
your way around it,

00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:56.300
that constraint is gone
because somehow you

00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:58.650
thought you were going to get
it out of getting married,

00:49:58.650 --> 00:50:01.380
but you can get companionship
a lot of other ways.

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:03.340
So that's the idea.

00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:06.470
AUDIENCE: I love that you
talked about the delineation,

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:09.830
the difference between
trying and doing,

00:50:09.830 --> 00:50:12.252
and there are two real
stages that exist.

00:50:12.252 --> 00:50:14.210
And you also mentioned
that most of the time we

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:16.460
don't know the reasons behind
why we're doing things.

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:18.010
So let's say you've been
on the journey for a while,

00:50:18.010 --> 00:50:19.430
you've been trying,
and you've started

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:21.679
to identify some of those
reasons that are keeping you

00:50:21.679 --> 00:50:24.670
from your-- like the four
things we worry about doing.

00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:26.305
And you're starting
to feel kind of bad

00:50:26.305 --> 00:50:28.180
about yourself, because
you know the reasons,

00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:29.804
but you're not
making the changes

00:50:29.804 --> 00:50:31.220
to get where you
want to go and be

00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:34.060
an achiever or a
doer in these areas.

00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:35.875
Can you comment
at all on-- what's

00:50:35.875 --> 00:50:37.750
the breaking point,
what's the turning point,

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:39.320
is it different for everybody?

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:41.452
What's the transition
from trying to doing?

00:50:41.452 --> 00:50:42.410
What does it look like?

00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:43.760
BERNARD ROTH: So if
you're doing, no matter

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:45.880
what comes at you, you're
going to handle it.

00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:55.160
If you're trying it may
work, but if something comes

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:57.230
at you to block you, you're
going to be deterred,

00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:58.313
you're not going to do it.

00:50:58.313 --> 00:51:00.150
So that's the difference
in the two states.

00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:01.540
And you can see
what's happening,

00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:03.980
and it's clearly you're
getting the result

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:05.430
or you're not getting results.

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:06.480
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:07.880
BERNARD ROTH: If you're
not getting the result

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.470
and you want to move
to the doing state,

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:11.630
you have to say "There's
this chair in front of me,

00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:13.290
I have to walk around it."

00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:16.350
And the chair may
be a person or maybe

00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:18.970
the way you hold the world.

00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:22.040
But the point simply
is, that the reasons are

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:24.430
just irrelevant,
they're not necessary,

00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:27.036
they're not functional
at all, and mainly

00:51:27.036 --> 00:51:29.160
they're just a way of
letting yourself off the hook

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:32.380
and blinding you as to
what the possibilities are.

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:33.820
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:35.320
I don't know if you
agree with this,

00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.903
but what you are
saying at some level,

00:51:36.903 --> 00:51:39.527
it's empowering that at
some level it's within us.

00:51:39.527 --> 00:51:41.610
And doesn't mean we need
to blame ourselves, or be

00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:43.677
hard on ourselves
overly, but you

00:51:43.677 --> 00:51:45.760
talk about this frame of
mind where at some point,

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:46.600
"You know what, no.

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:49.310
It isn't my boss's fault, or
it isn't the universe's fault,

00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:52.580
or this person's fault.
I just haven't gotten

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:56.514
to the point where I've made the
connections and the decision."

00:51:56.514 --> 00:51:57.930
BERNARD ROTH: Well
what I call it,

00:51:57.930 --> 00:52:00.530
you have to have the
intention to do it and give it

00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:01.760
the attention.

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.140
So it's as simple as that.

00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:05.290
A good example, I
was supposed to go

00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:07.120
to a meeting, which I
didn't want to go to,

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:09.650
in Texas, in Dallas.

00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:11.390
I got to the airport
in San Fransisco

00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:14.070
and the guards were good to
me, the airports in Texas

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:16.020
were closed because
there was a snow storm.

00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:19.556
So I called up and I say,
"Really, I'm sorry I can't go."

00:52:19.556 --> 00:52:22.290
That's good, I went
home, I had a happy life.

00:52:22.290 --> 00:52:24.330
If I really wanted
to go to Texas,

00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:25.830
the fact that the
airport was closed

00:52:25.830 --> 00:52:26.780
wouldn't have stopped me.

00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:27.330
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:52:27.330 --> 00:52:29.020
BERNARD ROTH: It's as simple
as if my life depended

00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:31.440
upon getting to Texas, I
would've gotten to Texas even

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:33.000
though the airport was closed.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.230
But they gave me a gift,
they gave me an obstacle

00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:37.750
and I could just say
"I had a good reason."

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:40.460
and they didn't say it.

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:42.477
They didn't get this
whole idea that, "Yeah,

00:52:42.477 --> 00:52:44.060
so the airport's
closed, man, but when

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:45.060
are you going to come here?"

00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:45.935
You know what I mean?

00:52:45.935 --> 00:52:49.360
If we were playing the
game at a high level,

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:51.930
"Yeah, well you were committed
to going to the meeting,

00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:52.970
get here."

00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:55.820
But they didn't
do that, so, whew.

00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:57.697
MALE SPEAKER: Well, good stuff.

00:52:57.697 --> 00:53:00.280
Thanks for being here, we've got
a few books left in the back,

00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:02.234
the book is "The
Achievement Habit."

00:53:02.234 --> 00:53:03.900
Dr. Roth, thanks so
much for being here.

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:05.450
[APPLAUSE]
