00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.484
For this account, the pattern that emerged for all the expressions for the

00:00:03.484 --> 00:00:08.534
balances after a certain number of years, was like this. We take the principle,

00:00:08.534 --> 00:00:13.220
the amount initially invested, multiply by 1 plus the interest rate written as

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.692
a decimal. And then, take that quantity, that I've written in parentheses to a

00:00:18.692 --> 00:00:22.350
power that's equal to the number of times interest has been added to the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.708
account. In this case, since interest is compounded yearly, that would just

00:00:27.708 --> 00:00:31.566
equal to the number of years that had passed. Let's try doing something

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:37.694
similar, but with a different situation. Remember Athena? Well, she has $300 to

00:00:37.694 --> 00:00:41.908
invest. The interest rate on the account she's going to put it in is 5% per

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:47.080
year, compounded annually. How much money will she have in the account after

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.079
four years have passed? Remember that pattern that we were using before.
