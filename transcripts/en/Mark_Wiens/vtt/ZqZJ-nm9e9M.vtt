00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:07.559
Behind the walls of a sign less abandoned looking warehouse in Tel Av-iv is one of the most thrilling fine-dining restaurants you'll ever find

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:09.910
the fresh high-quality ingredients

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:17.609
The amusing energetic atmosphere and the open kitchen where you can watch every dish carefully prepared from start to finish our

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.169
Reasons why this restaurant is known to be the best high-end dining experience in Israel

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.859
Get ready, I'm taking you with me to eat an unforgettable meal at Tel Aviv's ha salon

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.460
We made it to the restaurant look at our seats right in front of a big pile of meat and vegetables

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.750
See all of them cooking I love how they just set out all of the fresh produce

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.090
There's even some figs and some cherries

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.870
Just whole stalks of green onions and just a pile hunks of meat just sitting on the counter top before us

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.279
This is a fine dining restaurant, but at the same time it feels like you're eating in the middle of a market

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.449
and it's owned by Al Shani who has he's a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.009
Legend in the food scene in tel-aviv. He's a food scientist

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.429
He owns a number of restaurants around tel-aviv, but this is his flagship restaurant

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:28.779
It's only open two days a week and it almost has like a laboratory feel to it. They slice things with expertise

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.420
Everything is down to a science and the ingredients are the top of the notch

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.979
There's there's no better quality ingredients for the first bite. They've sort of served us some

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.739
Pepper bread like a focaccia type of bread their tomatoes on and there's some sage

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.940
It's like perfectly gooey, but then that cream is so silky smooth

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.660
Next up we have FIGS carpaccio

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.320
And he very very thinly and very delicately sliced up big figs laid them onto a plate

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.490
And then I think all he topped it was with is some salt some pepper some

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.579
And he he actually pounded the pepper so it's fresh

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.200
He cracked that pepper open, and then there's olive oil on there, and then some peas

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.940
some Parmesan

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.930
Wow, this is just a beautiful beautiful dish

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.740
It's just absolutely pretty

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.130
Well and the figs are just incredibly soft and tender

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:02.110
Just that light sprinkle of probably sea salt that cracked black pepper the olive oil kind of brings it together and

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.329
Then just just only enough cheese to barely taste it and give it a little bit of saltiness

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.100
There's just so much going on in the kitchen here. It feels like you're in a food movie fantasy

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.249
The next dish that has come is a crab and they just

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.370
Meticulously de L bet crab. It's mixed with just some very light

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.210
Ingredients I think some very light herbs. There are some sprouts on there, and then there's some raspberries to accompany it well

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.629
I'm gonna try to get a bite with some of the crab, and I want that raspberry as well

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.869
That crab is just melt-in-your-mouth and then

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.910
There's almost like I think use some of those green onions that are sitting right in front of us

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:57.020
but they're so mild and then that raspberry are just like the purest raspberry I've ever tasted next dish is a

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.489
Shrimp bagel, but it's like a superior shrimp bagel

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.660
They use crystal shrimp

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:09.799
And he peeled the shrimp he he just like so delicately so carefully the chef he layered on tomatoes

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.640
Thank you

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.230
He leered on pickles, and then he layered on that shrimp, and then there's it's saucy and it's their own version of a bagel so

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.609
You're gonna grab this

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.239
All man Paul you can feel they're like juiciness in your hands boozing with good flavors

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.359
Oh, you can feel how soft and supple that is

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.270
Okay, I can't wait any longer

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.699
Well that's ridiculous the shrimp

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.329
Is amazing and it's like a like a creamy sauce and then but I can also taste, and there's the refreshing dill

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:57.119
So I'm just dripping all over the place, but it's so good

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:06.259
Introduction is the gumbo surface of my lemon okay?

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.270
This kitchen is just so entertaining

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.560
I'm just actually standing

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.130
I'm standing

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.870
I'm not even sitting and I mean I'm just at the edge of my toes watching the chefs work

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:40.470
Though one of the main dishes has come leave it up to duty to reorder the entire rack

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.889
It's lamb right yeah, because I know this way

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.530
maybe

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.289
If we had them order it in the first place

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.550
It's already sold out so they only have my curiosity the whole restaurant for a nice

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.520
so you pre-ordered it definitely sold out now, so

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.159
before you

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:05.579
If I came right out of the wood oven and you could see it that the ribs were actually alive still they were

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:13.139
Pulsating it was like there was it was Bert. It was it was beating and you can see those juices just oozing okay?

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.099
I can't talk any longer

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:20.009
It's just it's just utterly tender. It just slides. It just slips oh

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:23.159
Look at that

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.329
It's just dripping with juices and just fall apart tender while that's hot too

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:39.149
Thank you sir, thank you

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:49.219
All right, I'm going in for this he's and look at just look at that the prettiness of that carmelization

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.460
That is caramelized beauty

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.540
That's in your mouth

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.220
Nobody knows

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.930
How to handle lamb

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.370
The ocean is closed so much research for Lam

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.700
Just perfect

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.080
I'm gonna use that bone. Just to kind of scoop up some of that meat below there and look Paul

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.029
Oh, it's so so lamb oily perfectly specific on the back

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.210
Vegetables you see oh yeah

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.900
I

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.970
Wow

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:47.270
That is ridiculous that is unbelievably delicious you're gonna want to lick your fingers after every single bite

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.449
Okay on second thought I will use my spoon because it's so sloppily

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.589
Tender down there that I think is a must

00:07:58.289 --> 00:08:01.639
Just pretend its own juices. It's in its own juices

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:56.340
We're having one final dish it's beef carpaccio, and then he brought it over to our bar counter table

00:08:57.259 --> 00:09:03.969
What he did was truly amazing he he took a metal mallet and just pounded it into a paper fit

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:07.240
It just spread out until like at least four times its size

00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:11.439
And you can just see that me like squishing out of the bottom of the mallet

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.549
Oh, and by the way, it's Robbie hey, I think that's some some basil on there

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.039
I have a soft place in my heart for Rafi

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:44.679
Just got back to the apartment after dinner that was

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.710
the most fun and unique

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:54.489
High-end fine-dining restaurant experience that I've ever had in my entire life. I just sat there in awe watching them cook

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.070
It was like if it was like an amusement of culinary

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:58.730
like

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:04.149
experimentation it was it really was like a culinary lab a couple things quick things that you should know is that number one the

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.679
Restaurant, it's quite a lively restaurant, so they have two sittings

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.410
They're only open for two nights per week

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:15.999
and they have two sittings the first setting is more calm you can sit and you can converse the

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.149
Second setting you got to know is very lively

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:23.739
It's kind of almost like a nightclub experience they turn the music loud people start to dance

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:29.470
So just keep that in mind number two is that it's very expensive

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:33.850
Our total bill came to 1,000 around one thousand three hundred shekels for

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:39.670
The dishes that we had and that's just Dave Annette and I eating so huge. Thank you to David Khalifa

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.280
