00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's say we're in the middle of parsing--I've written

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
new grammar for us, here on the left.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This one has a new nonterminal F--

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
just to make things interesting.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
That is how we roll here, in programming languages.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So here's our grammar; it has 4 rewrite rules.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The input is: (int - int)

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but we've only seen 2 of those tokens so far:

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the (int) and the (minus).

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
One of the elements of chart[2] is:

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
(E --&gt; E -), and Here We Are,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and we're looking for an (E) in the future--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and we started this in chart state[0].

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I have written out, down here at the bottom,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
five possible parse states.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Why don't you tell me which of these parse states

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
are going to be brought in by chart state[2],

00:00:43.000 --> 09:59:59.000
by computing the closure?
