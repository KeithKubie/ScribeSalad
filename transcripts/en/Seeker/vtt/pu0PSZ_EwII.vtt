00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.110
In an age where your phone can scan your face
and buttons are becoming obsolete, who thinks

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.310
of writing anything by hand anymore?

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.839
I know it feels archaic to pick up a pencil
and use, ugh, lead, but writing down your

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.749
notes could help you pass your classes.

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:16.240
Note-taking is very difficult.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.440
You have to listen, understand, and transcribe
concepts all at the same time.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.030
As technology integrates more and more into
classrooms, computers have become the new

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.030
notebooks.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.810
So we’re not writing things down or summarizing,
we’ve completely changed how we encode information.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.530
Somewhere down the line the emphasis for perfect
cursive faded, and kids were taught to type;

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.680
as fast, and as accurately as they could.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.060
A lot of college students now note-take on laptops.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.580
However, typing leads to copying a lecture
verbatim, and one study found that when students

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.190
do that they perform worse on tests that involve
conceptual thinking.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.380
So, to understand the best way to take notes,
you have to get what note-taking is all about in the brain.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.129
There are two ways researchers think note-taking
affects your learning: “the encoding hypothesis”

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.610
and the “external storage hypothesis.”

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.870
Encoding: is when, during the note-taking
process, you listen and understand what’s

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.180
being said, then write down what you can in
the time allotted before the speaker moves

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.180
on.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.320
It’s tough.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.670
External storage is your brain storing information
outside of itself, so it can retrieve it later.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.920
Ok, ok, I know we all thought typing verbatim
could help us study better.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.630
It’s better “external storage” than
my slow scribbles!

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.630
Right?

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.022
You may not be paying super close attention
DURING the lecture, but you can totally review

00:01:32.022 --> 00:01:35.240
it later and it's word for word and that’s great? Right?

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.240
Sort of.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.420
When you’re writing out notes, although
you’re writing fewer words than typing verbatim,

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.240
your brain is actively summarizing lecture
material.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.159
You’re encoding messages onto paper.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.939
Then when you re-read the handwritten material
“enhanced encoding,” meaning you’re

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.060
both encoding and storing the knowledge externally.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.930
This is considered a “superior” method for concepts.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:57.930
Why?

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.510
We don’t really know.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.840
What we do know is, reviewing typed notes
within 24 hours does helps you retain information.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.140
Because 19th-century memory theories from
Hermann Ebbinghaus showed, over time, if we

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.750
don’t make an effort to RETAIN information,
we LOSE the data on an exponential basis;

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.520
this is called Ebbinghaus’ Forgetting Curve.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.980
Unless you constantly review that material,
your ability to remember new material will

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.750
continue to decline over time.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.250
It’s like a muscle, to learn requires practice!

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.440
In the end, physical handwriting works well
for concepts because your brain is forced

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.450
to summarize your lesson before you jot it
down.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.230
However, laptop note-taking for straight factual
information has equal retention according

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.400
to this study.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.050
So it’s sort of up to you, to know what
you need to remember and when, and THEN you

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.629
do have to actually go back and read it to
secure that information.

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.099
The thing is, handwriting isn’t GONE.

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.280
Now technology has gotten good enough that
tablets have handwriting recognition, and

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.050
styluses to work with them… so maybe we’ll
see a resurgence of writing!

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.050
Maybe…

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.090
Or maybe we’ll see voice recording take
over everything…

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.560
More research is needed to see what will be
better for future students.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.569
What do you think?

Crystal explains it in this video here. Having the internet at your fingertips

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.959
in class can cause distraction, but did you
know that you’re not only distracting yourself,

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.090
but everyone around you is taking peek and
getting distracted too!. It's evolutionary theory.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.169
Stay focused you guys and thanks for watching
Seeker!
