00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.040
What we're going to
prove in this video

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.300
is a couple of fairly
straightforward

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.837
parallelogram-related proofs.

00:00:06.837 --> 00:00:08.670
And this first one,
we're going to say, hey,

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.720
if we have this
parallelogram ABCD,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.920
let's prove that the opposite
sides have the same length.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.820
So prove that AB is equal to
DC and that AD is equal to BC.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.630
So let me draw a diagonal here.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.850
And this diagonal, depending
on how you view it,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.900
is intersecting two
sets of parallel lines.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.150
So you could also consider
it to be a transversal.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.441
Actually, let me draw it a
little bit neater than that.

00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:35.790
I can do a better job.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.290
Nope.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.550
That's not any better.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.530
That is about as
good as I can do.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.000
So if we view DB,
this diagonal DB--

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.780
we can view it as a transversal
for the parallel lines AB

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.110
and DC.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.800
And if you view it that
way, you can pick out

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.484
that angle ABD is going to
be congruent-- so angle ABD.

00:00:56.484 --> 00:00:57.900
That's that angle
right there-- is

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.960
going to be congruent
to angle BDC,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.430
because they are
alternate interior angles.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.300
You have a transversal--
parallel lines.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.810
So we know that
angle ABD is going

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.007
to be congruent to angle BDC.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.360
Now, you could also
view this diagonal,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.490
DB-- you could view it as
a transversal of these two

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.030
parallel lines, of the other
pair of parallel lines, AD

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.600
and BC.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.990
And if you look at it that
way, then you immediately

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:38.130
see that angle DBC
right over here

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.490
is going to be
congruent to angle

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.690
ADB for the exact same reason.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.630
They are alternate
interior angles

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.170
of a transversal intersecting
these two parallel lines.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.360
So I could write this.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.810
This is alternate
interior angles

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.730
are congruent when you have
a transversal intersecting

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.880
two parallel lines.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.520
And we also see that
both of these triangles,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.910
triangle ADB and triangle CDB,
both share this side over here.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.440
It's obviously equal to itself.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.425
Now, why is this useful?

00:02:20.425 --> 00:02:22.050
Well, you might
realize that we've just

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.820
shown that both of
these triangles,

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.340
they have this pink angle.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.532
Then they have this
side in common.

00:02:27.532 --> 00:02:28.990
And then they have
the green angle.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.580
Pink angle, side in common,
and then the green angle.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.470
So we've just shown
by angle-side-angle

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.040
that these two
triangles are congruent.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.440
So let me write this down.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.320
We have shown that
triangle-- I'll

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.650
go from non-labeled
to pink to green-- ADB

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.105
is congruent to triangle--
non-labeled to pink to green--

00:02:53.105 --> 00:02:53.605
CBD.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.440
And this comes out of
angle-side-angle congruency.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.190
Well, what does that do for us?

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.360
Well, if two triangles
are congruent, then

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.350
all of the corresponding
features of the two triangles

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.010
are going to be congruent.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:26.360
In particular, side DC
on this bottom triangle

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.110
corresponds to side BA
on that top triangle.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.620
So they need to be congruent.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.230
So we get DC is going
to be equal to BA.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.370
And that's because they
are corresponding sides

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.200
of congruent triangles.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.560
So this is going to
be equal to that.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.190
And by that exact same
logic, AD corresponds to CB.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.770
AD is equal to CB.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.680
And for the exact same
reason-- corresponding sides

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.240
of congruent triangles.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.740
And then we're done.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.896
We've proven that opposite
sides are congruent.

00:04:09.896 --> 00:04:11.020
Now let's go the other way.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.269
Let's say that we have some
type of a quadrilateral,

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.829
and we know that the
opposite sides are congruent.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.460
Can we prove to ourselves
that this is a parallelogram?

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.900
Well, it's kind of the
same proof in reverse.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.080
So let's draw a
diagonal here, since we

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.250
know a lot about triangles.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.760
So let me draw.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.200
There we go.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.336
That's the hardest part.

00:04:35.336 --> 00:04:36.410
Draw it.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.930
That's pretty good.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:38.430
All right.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.710
So we obviously know that CB
is going to be equal to itself.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.600
So I'll draw it like that.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.695
Obviously, because
it's the same line.

00:04:46.695 --> 00:04:48.320
And then we have
something interesting.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.500
We've split this quadrilateral
into two triangles, triangle

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.500
ACB and triangle DBC.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.430
And notice, all three sides
of these two triangles

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.650
are equal to each other.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.110
So we know by side-side-side
that they are congruent.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:11.125
So we know that triangle
A-- and we're starting at A,

00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:13.380
and then I'm going
to the one-hash side.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:20.263
So ACB is congruent
to triangle DBC.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:30.670
And this is by
side-side-side congruency.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.300
Well, what does that do for us?

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.550
Well, it tells us that all
of the corresponding angles

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.430
are going to be congruent.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:42.200
So for example, angle ABC
is going to be-- so let

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.830
me mark that.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.780
You can say ABC is going
to be congruent to DCB.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:04.300
And you could say, by
corresponding angles congruent

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.560
of congruent triangles.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.200
I'm just using some shorthand
here to save some time.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.080
So ABC is going to
be congruent to DCB,

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.540
so these two angles are
going to be congruent.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.360
Well, this is interesting,
because here you have a line.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.460
And it's intersecting AB and CD.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.970
And we clearly see
that these things that

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.720
could be alternate interior
angles are congruent.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.360
And because we have these
congruent alternate interior

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.200
angles, we know that AB
must be parallel to CD.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.710
So this must be
parallel to that.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.630
So we know that AB
is parallel to CD

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:50.350
by alternate interior angles
of a transversal intersecting

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:51.730
parallel lines.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.840
Now, we can use that
exact same logic.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.720
We also know that angle--
let me get this right.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:03.785
Angle ACB is congruent
to angle DBC.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:16.170
And we know that by
corresponding angles congruent

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.790
of congruent triangles.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.580
So we're just saying this
angle is equal to that angle.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.052
Well, once again, these could
be alternate interior angles.

00:07:25.052 --> 00:07:26.260
They look like they could be.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.280
This is a transversal.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.980
And here's two lines
here, which we're not sure

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.100
whether they're parallel.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.030
But because the alternate
interior angles are congruent,

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.990
we know that they are parallel.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.860
So this is parallel to that.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:41.500
So we know that AC
is parallel to BD

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.960
by alternate interior angles.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:49.610
And we're done.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.390
So what we've done
is-- it's interesting.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:55.680
We've shown if you
have a parallelogram,

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.640
opposite sides have
the same length.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.670
And if opposite sides
have the same length,

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:01.030
then you have a parallelogram.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.340
And so we've actually proven
it in both directions.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.080
And so we can actually make what
you call an "if and only if"

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:06.580
statement.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:16.020
You could say opposite sides of
a quadrilateral are parallel if

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.520
and only if their
lengths are equal.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.075
And you say if and only if.

00:08:20.075 --> 00:08:21.624
So if they are
parallel, then you

00:08:21.624 --> 00:08:23.040
could say their
lengths are equal.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.410
And only if their lengths
are equal are they parallel.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.875
We've proven it in
both directions.
