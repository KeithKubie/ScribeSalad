00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.270
(cheerful piano music)

00:00:10.174 --> 00:00:13.059
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.392
Bipedal, naked, large brain,

00:00:16.936 --> 00:00:20.686
long the master of fire,
tools, and language.

00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:25.318
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:26.503 --> 00:00:29.916
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.916 --> 00:00:31.999
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:33.236 --> 00:00:37.180
We grow up slowly, we hand down knowledge,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.263
we empathize and deceive.

00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:44.194
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:44.194 --> 00:00:45.194
of the past.

00:00:47.028 --> 00:00:50.347
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.347 --> 00:00:54.514
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:57.013 --> 00:00:59.475
An exploration made
possible by the generosity

00:00:59.475 --> 00:01:01.058
of humans like you.

00:01:21.502 --> 00:01:24.085
(upbeat music)

00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:39.446
- So let me talk about what we can learn

00:01:39.446 --> 00:01:41.363
from congenital amusia.

00:01:42.516 --> 00:01:45.786
First of all I'd like to
mention that we are all born

00:01:45.786 --> 00:01:48.525
to be musical, and we all are.

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:51.061
That is musical engagement is ubiquitous,

00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:53.228
and emerges early in life.

00:01:54.238 --> 00:01:56.634
And that best evidence
is really that newborns

00:01:56.634 --> 00:01:59.206
respond to abstract
properties of musical pitch

00:01:59.206 --> 00:02:02.462
and time structure, like
changes in tonal key,

00:02:02.462 --> 00:02:06.629
and disruptions of musical
beat, before the age of one.

00:02:08.262 --> 00:02:11.142
They also move spontaneously to music,

00:02:11.142 --> 00:02:13.793
and when moved in synchrony with music,

00:02:13.793 --> 00:02:17.367
they show enhanced pro-social behavior.

00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:20.709
So musical engagement is not only rooted

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.896
in social interactions,

00:02:22.896 --> 00:02:26.932
but it is also a highly
pleasurable experience.

00:02:26.932 --> 00:02:29.479
And I will illustrate it now with dance.

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:31.928
This is not the prototypical
musical situation,

00:02:31.928 --> 00:02:35.156
but think of it, it's
really a musical activity.

00:02:35.156 --> 00:02:38.221
And I'd like you to pay
attention to the first row

00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:39.638
and the last one.

00:02:40.705 --> 00:02:44.872
And these are the two extremes
I am really interested in.

00:02:46.394 --> 00:02:48.894
(dance music)

00:03:00.256 --> 00:03:02.184
And I'm sorry, but I will turn first

00:03:02.184 --> 00:03:04.390
to the ones who don't have it.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.557
That is, they represent
1.5% of the population,

00:03:09.428 --> 00:03:14.069
and that's what I'm referring
to as congenital amusia.

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.509
I call it congenital
for the idea that it is

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:19.274
present from birth.

00:03:19.274 --> 00:03:23.441
It defines a likely time
period, not the etiology.

00:03:24.381 --> 00:03:27.935
Although, we have made a lot
of progress regarding this.

00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:32.527
What's characterizing them,
it's the inability to detect

00:03:32.527 --> 00:03:36.456
when someone sings out of
tune, including themselves,

00:03:36.456 --> 00:03:40.623
to recognize and sing a
familiar tune without the aid

00:03:42.028 --> 00:03:46.557
of the lyrics, and then to
maintain tunes in memory.

00:03:46.557 --> 00:03:50.898
And what is really
fascinating is that it emerges

00:03:50.898 --> 00:03:55.655
in isolation from other
disturbances, such as speech delay,

00:03:55.655 --> 00:03:58.560
intellectual deficiency,
acquired brain damage

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.390
or even music deprivation,
they are exposed to music

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.723
like we all are.

00:04:04.065 --> 00:04:06.453
And they have normal understanding
of speech and prosody

00:04:06.453 --> 00:04:08.221
in everyday life.

00:04:08.221 --> 00:04:11.844
It is also very similar to
other learning disorders

00:04:11.844 --> 00:04:13.744
that you are familiar with,
like dyslexia, for example,

00:04:13.744 --> 00:04:17.661
speech disorders like
the one we heard earlier,

00:04:18.993 --> 00:04:21.243
dyscalculia, prosopagnosia.

00:04:22.313 --> 00:04:26.425
And why are we so interested
by this condition?

00:04:26.425 --> 00:04:29.859
It's because, it is a natural experiment

00:04:29.859 --> 00:04:33.192
of the neurobiological origins of music.

00:04:34.112 --> 00:04:37.455
Because it is an accident of nature,

00:04:37.455 --> 00:04:40.451
we didn't create it, it
is a rare chance to link

00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:42.618
brain, behavior and genes.

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:48.133
And also breakdown patterns
reveal how the brain works,

00:04:48.133 --> 00:04:50.503
and I will try to illustrate
each of these points

00:04:50.503 --> 00:04:51.503
in a moment.

00:04:52.821 --> 00:04:55.988
But I have to tell you how we do that.

00:04:57.957 --> 00:05:02.124
So we go from the behavior
to, and I will illustrate it,

00:05:03.088 --> 00:05:05.273
so that you have an idea what it is,

00:05:05.273 --> 00:05:09.440
from a functional explanation
to the brain correlates,

00:05:10.516 --> 00:05:13.651
what are the anomalies in the brain,

00:05:13.651 --> 00:05:17.818
to the etiology from the genes,
or the environmental factor.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.921
And I will illustrate it with
someone who just wrote a book

00:05:21.921 --> 00:05:24.754
about his condition, Tim Falconer.

00:05:26.471 --> 00:05:29.259
He was 54 when he came to visit my lab,

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:32.856
and that's where he
discovered that he was amusic,

00:05:32.856 --> 00:05:36.666
because he only had one
complaint, to sing out of tune.

00:05:36.666 --> 00:05:39.262
And I really invite you to read his book,

00:05:39.262 --> 00:05:41.867
which is a fascinating description,

00:05:41.867 --> 00:05:44.577
because he writes so beautifully as well,

00:05:44.577 --> 00:05:46.993
and has a very good sense of humor.

00:05:46.993 --> 00:05:49.104
It just appeared last year.

00:05:49.104 --> 00:05:51.821
But let me illustrate
it with his condition,

00:05:51.821 --> 00:05:53.888
because we filmed him several times.

00:05:53.888 --> 00:05:57.888
So typically they fail
to detect pitch deviancy.

00:05:58.737 --> 00:06:02.131
Like here, there are two
melodies, and we ask them

00:06:02.131 --> 00:06:04.663
if it is the same or different.

00:06:04.663 --> 00:06:08.163
(melody playing on piano)

00:06:14.996 --> 00:06:17.746
(melody repeats)

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:27.994
- I'm gonna say that was different,

00:06:27.994 --> 00:06:31.494
I think there was an extra pause in there.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.370
(melody playing on piano)

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:47.770
(different melody playing on piano)

00:06:49.361 --> 00:06:50.194
- Same.

00:06:51.401 --> 00:06:54.911
- And you could see on the
face that he couldn't tell,

00:06:54.911 --> 00:06:56.978
he couldn't detect them.

00:06:56.978 --> 00:06:58.904
Now the best part.

00:06:58.904 --> 00:07:00.874
So we play with the
melody, so that the melody

00:07:00.874 --> 00:07:03.407
is one semitone apart
from the accompaniment.

00:07:03.407 --> 00:07:07.055
This is really a disorder
related to pitch structure,

00:07:07.055 --> 00:07:11.328
and they are insensitive
to this kind of change,

00:07:11.328 --> 00:07:14.531
while newborns are sensitive to this,

00:07:14.531 --> 00:07:16.292
they do perceive this change.

00:07:16.292 --> 00:07:19.524
So let me play to you the first example.

00:07:19.524 --> 00:07:22.311
And of course we don't ask non-musicians

00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:24.586
if it's dissonant or consonant,

00:07:24.586 --> 00:07:28.557
we just ask if it's
pleasant or unpleasant.

00:07:28.557 --> 00:07:31.890
(classical piano piece)

00:07:39.076 --> 00:07:42.326
- So like 10 is really pleasant? Uh ...

00:07:43.905 --> 00:07:48.072
(dissonant classical piano piece)

00:07:54.793 --> 00:07:57.626
(audience laughs)

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.754
- And typically we see everybody laughs,

00:08:04.754 --> 00:08:06.671
I don't understand why.

00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:10.028
(audience laughs)

00:08:10.028 --> 00:08:12.998
And this is really the
problem with this condition,

00:08:12.998 --> 00:08:14.765
they are unaware of what's happening,

00:08:14.765 --> 00:08:17.593
they have no idea what is
wrong and what is correct.

00:08:17.593 --> 00:08:20.567
And most of them sing out of tune,

00:08:20.567 --> 00:08:22.308
and they are unaware of it.

00:08:22.308 --> 00:08:24.935
Just because other people
tell them that they are,

00:08:24.935 --> 00:08:26.746
you know a little bit off.

00:08:26.746 --> 00:08:30.663
Like Tim, he's not really
off, as you will see.

00:08:31.595 --> 00:08:34.525
- (Tim singing poorly but
with recognizable melody)

00:08:34.525 --> 00:08:35.523
Happy birthday to you,

00:08:35.523 --> 00:08:37.961
happy birthday to you,

00:08:37.961 --> 00:08:42.128
happy birthday dear Mahela,
happy birthday to you.

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:48.294
- But what is really nice
is when we ask him to sing

00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:49.294
on la la la.

00:08:50.869 --> 00:08:54.355
- (Tim singing, melody
unrecognizable) La la la la la.

00:08:54.355 --> 00:08:56.533
La la la la la la.

00:08:56.533 --> 00:08:58.033
La la la la la la.

00:08:58.948 --> 00:09:00.448
La la la la la la.

00:09:02.658 --> 00:09:05.287
That wasn't even close. (laughs)

00:09:05.287 --> 00:09:08.231
- He knows that he doesn't
know what the tune is,

00:09:08.231 --> 00:09:10.721
but he's improvising.

00:09:10.721 --> 00:09:14.152
As well as the whole family,
I'll give you an example later.

00:09:14.152 --> 00:09:17.499
But what is really
interesting is this fact.

00:09:17.499 --> 00:09:21.499
That, in terms, I mean
Tim must be average here.

00:09:22.633 --> 00:09:26.800
Here are the amusics, we have
a large pool of 38 amusics,

00:09:28.391 --> 00:09:29.877
and here are the control.

00:09:29.877 --> 00:09:33.186
So each dot represents the
average of one subject.

00:09:33.186 --> 00:09:37.978
Each syllable is really
analyzed syllable by syllable.

00:09:37.978 --> 00:09:41.719
And as you can see they
do sing less in tune

00:09:41.719 --> 00:09:43.828
than the controls.

00:09:43.828 --> 00:09:48.453
100 cents means one semitone,
and this is the building block

00:09:48.453 --> 00:09:50.786
of the tonal Western system,

00:09:51.763 --> 00:09:54.978
it is two adjacent keys on a keyboard.

00:09:54.978 --> 00:09:59.145
And as you can see, they are
indeed deviant in those terms.

00:10:00.551 --> 00:10:04.751
But what is very fascinating
is that maybe they are

00:10:04.751 --> 00:10:07.888
out of tune relative to
what they should sing,

00:10:07.888 --> 00:10:09.607
but they are in key.

00:10:09.607 --> 00:10:12.712
That is the intervals they are singing

00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:16.943
are really in the key, or
at least as well as control,

00:10:16.943 --> 00:10:20.006
they don't make so many
errors in those terms.

00:10:20.006 --> 00:10:23.655
And what is very interesting,
that when they improvise,

00:10:23.655 --> 00:10:26.988
like Tim, they really made fewer errors.

00:10:29.827 --> 00:10:32.014
So the idea is that
really we should improvise

00:10:32.014 --> 00:10:33.181
a little more.

00:10:34.331 --> 00:10:36.356
And it is hereditary.

00:10:36.356 --> 00:10:38.606
And I'll play just the mother,

00:10:38.606 --> 00:10:41.464
but this is really a
signature of the whole family.

00:10:41.464 --> 00:10:45.297
I just don't want this
to be later on YouTube.

00:10:46.294 --> 00:10:48.211
- [Man] Elsie Falconer.

00:10:49.172 --> 00:10:53.190
- [Elsie] (singing very
poorly) Happy birthday to you,

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:57.357
happy birthday to you,
happy birthday dear friend,

00:10:59.529 --> 00:11:01.362
happy birthday to you.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.680
- Not everybody does,
I mean that's fantastic

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.628
about this family, because
most of them are affected.

00:11:09.628 --> 00:11:12.881
I mean these are the black shapes.

00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:14.924
I mean most of them are.

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:17.640
Of course a few are spared, so we can say

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.807
it's not really in the
environment, it is in their genes.

00:11:22.726 --> 00:11:25.071
And we knew it is really hereditary.

00:11:25.071 --> 00:11:28.920
So if you have one
relative in your family,

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.686
or close relative, then
there are 30% chance,

00:11:33.686 --> 00:11:37.749
or 10 times at least more
chance that you have a risk

00:11:37.749 --> 00:11:40.332
for amusia, so it is heritable.

00:11:41.813 --> 00:11:44.966
So we tried to identify what
are the genetic variants

00:11:44.966 --> 00:11:47.802
of this condition, because
it had been so successful

00:11:47.802 --> 00:11:50.063
for speech disorders.

00:11:50.063 --> 00:11:54.536
And for the moment, it
has been without success.

00:11:54.536 --> 00:11:56.348
The only thing I can say,

00:11:56.348 --> 00:11:58.180
and still it is a negative finding,

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.763
that we have no evidence
of FOXP2 mutation.

00:12:04.406 --> 00:12:07.425
(audience laughs)

00:12:07.425 --> 00:12:09.579
So it's like finding a
needle in a haystack,

00:12:09.579 --> 00:12:13.764
but we will continue,
because I really think that

00:12:13.764 --> 00:12:16.991
this is worthwhile,
because it has been found

00:12:16.991 --> 00:12:19.844
for speech disorders,
and likewise I believe

00:12:19.844 --> 00:12:24.114
that it may provide new entry
points to the neurobiology

00:12:24.114 --> 00:12:28.281
of learning disorders in
general, not just amusia.

00:12:29.576 --> 00:12:33.059
And to do so, what is
very important is to know

00:12:33.059 --> 00:12:35.566
what's happening in the brain.

00:12:35.566 --> 00:12:39.631
And we do know a lot about
the neural correlates

00:12:39.631 --> 00:12:41.048
of this disorder.

00:12:42.018 --> 00:12:44.135
Because it is a cortical disorder.

00:12:44.135 --> 00:12:48.302
Here, back to Tim, we measured
the arcuate fasciculus,

00:12:50.192 --> 00:12:52.238
this is a major fiber tract,

00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:54.583
I should illustrate on the
right side of my brain,

00:12:54.583 --> 00:12:56.524
that relates the auditory cortex

00:12:56.524 --> 00:12:58.346
to the inferior frontal cortex

00:12:58.346 --> 00:13:01.223
on the right side of the brain.

00:13:01.223 --> 00:13:05.167
And as you can see, Tim here is in red,

00:13:05.167 --> 00:13:08.214
and it's much smaller than a control

00:13:08.214 --> 00:13:10.489
illustrated here in blue.

00:13:10.489 --> 00:13:14.159
But of course you can do
that across many different

00:13:14.159 --> 00:13:16.963
amusic cases and you
compare that to controls,

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:20.912
and it has been found in
many different studies,

00:13:20.912 --> 00:13:23.979
that they do have a connectivity issue.

00:13:23.979 --> 00:13:26.953
So the main problem with their brain

00:13:26.953 --> 00:13:31.012
is a reduced connectivity
between these two regions,

00:13:31.012 --> 00:13:35.173
the auditory cortex and the
inferior frontal cortex.

00:13:35.173 --> 00:13:39.045
And it is really in terms
of functional anomalies

00:13:39.045 --> 00:13:41.415
as well as structural anomalies.

00:13:41.415 --> 00:13:44.109
We do find structural anomalies
in the auditory cortex

00:13:44.109 --> 00:13:47.942
and the inferior frontal cortex
by having more gray matter,

00:13:47.942 --> 00:13:52.109
but it doesn't seem to lead
to deficits in functioning.

00:13:53.981 --> 00:13:58.148
And so a working hypothesis
explanation of the disorder now,

00:14:00.042 --> 00:14:04.209
at least it's mine, it is in
terms of recurrent processing

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:09.260
between the auditory cortex and
the inferior frontal cortex.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.905
And the idea that they do
have an intact representation

00:14:12.905 --> 00:14:16.017
of musical pitch in the auditory cortex,

00:14:16.017 --> 00:14:20.521
so the bottom-up information
is reaching their brain,

00:14:20.521 --> 00:14:23.865
but they have poor
feedback control between

00:14:23.865 --> 00:14:27.743
the right inferior frontal
cortex and the auditory cortex,

00:14:27.743 --> 00:14:29.851
so the top-down aspect.

00:14:29.851 --> 00:14:31.621
This is illustrated here.

00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:35.449
So the information is
reaching the auditory cortex

00:14:35.449 --> 00:14:38.256
correctly, but it is really this loop

00:14:38.256 --> 00:14:41.209
that is malfunctioning in their case,

00:14:41.209 --> 00:14:44.089
so that the auditory cortex
is really encapsulated,

00:14:44.089 --> 00:14:48.896
it's not influenced by the
way they are processing,

00:14:48.896 --> 00:14:51.218
or wanting to process.

00:14:51.218 --> 00:14:54.816
So let me just illustrate
that with EEG recordings.

00:14:54.816 --> 00:14:58.066
We did use different
neural imaging techniques,

00:14:58.066 --> 00:15:02.233
but this one is really the
most revealing in this aspect.

00:15:03.427 --> 00:15:05.754
So we presented melodies like these ones,

00:15:05.754 --> 00:15:07.908
and asked them is there an incongruity?

00:15:07.908 --> 00:15:09.325
So the first one.

00:15:10.348 --> 00:15:14.098
(melody playing on clarinet)

00:15:15.548 --> 00:15:17.085
Usually say that's fine.

00:15:17.085 --> 00:15:21.567
(melody playing on clarinet)

00:15:21.567 --> 00:15:23.842
That there is an incongruity,
if you are not amusic,

00:15:23.842 --> 00:15:28.370
otherwise there is no
overlap in distribution.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:31.455
So these are the amusics,
and these are the controls.

00:15:31.455 --> 00:15:34.198
Each bar represents one subject.

00:15:34.198 --> 00:15:35.775
But what was really fascinating,

00:15:35.775 --> 00:15:38.050
and it has been replicated later on,

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:41.836
is that we found a negative,
early negative response,

00:15:41.836 --> 00:15:45.901
in the brain of amusics
as well as controls here.

00:15:45.901 --> 00:15:48.484
And while we only found a P600,

00:15:50.517 --> 00:15:54.684
that means that they are
consciously detecting the deviance,

00:15:56.907 --> 00:16:00.900
the pitch deviance, accompanied by a P600,

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.756
only in controls and never in amusics.

00:16:03.756 --> 00:16:07.235
So we have a clear signature
here of what's going on

00:16:07.235 --> 00:16:08.866
in their brain.

00:16:08.866 --> 00:16:11.791
The auditory cortex, which
is really responsible

00:16:11.791 --> 00:16:15.458
for the N200, is
responding to the deviance,

00:16:17.199 --> 00:16:20.615
but it's not integrated consciously.

00:16:20.615 --> 00:16:22.445
And it's not a problem of attention

00:16:22.445 --> 00:16:25.070
because we have designed a situation where

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:26.977
we controlled for attention.

00:16:26.977 --> 00:16:30.734
In this case, it was a
click they had to detect.

00:16:30.734 --> 00:16:32.894
We replicated the same findings.

00:16:32.894 --> 00:16:36.894
So this explains why, I
believe it is a question

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.629
of intact bottom-up information,

00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:44.796
because the N200, also called
ERAN, or mismatch negativity,

00:16:46.314 --> 00:16:50.481
seems to be replicated and
reflect this bottom-up processing

00:16:53.214 --> 00:16:57.131
while the feedback revealed
by the P300 or P600

00:16:58.391 --> 00:17:02.197
reflects poor control
between the right inferior

00:17:02.197 --> 00:17:05.773
frontal gyrus and the auditory cortex.

00:17:05.773 --> 00:17:08.239
And it is really a pitch
awareness disorder,

00:17:08.239 --> 00:17:11.072
because it's really so high level.

00:17:11.954 --> 00:17:14.921
Pitch regularities of
tonal music are registered

00:17:14.921 --> 00:17:18.015
and predicted by the
auditory cortex of amusics,

00:17:18.015 --> 00:17:20.940
without leading to conscious report.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.772
And what is really missing
is a normal feedback loop

00:17:24.772 --> 00:17:26.535
to learn from errors.

00:17:26.535 --> 00:17:30.619
And it seems that really
error correction requires

00:17:30.619 --> 00:17:33.786
intention and/or awareness.

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:37.873
So to summarize, what have we learned

00:17:37.873 --> 00:17:40.306
from congenital amusia?

00:17:40.306 --> 00:17:42.673
Here are only the things,
currently that I think

00:17:42.673 --> 00:17:45.089
are the most important.

00:17:45.089 --> 00:17:48.075
First of all, conscious
error correction is a really

00:17:48.075 --> 00:17:51.585
fundamental principle of
how the human brain learns,

00:17:51.585 --> 00:17:53.905
and we are not always conscious of the way

00:17:53.905 --> 00:17:57.503
we correct ourselves, of
course, during learning

00:17:57.503 --> 00:17:59.969
and when we are very young.

00:17:59.969 --> 00:18:03.441
Also, functional specialization can emerge

00:18:03.441 --> 00:18:06.563
from distributed brain networks.

00:18:06.563 --> 00:18:08.766
It's no longer the case that
you can think of the brain

00:18:08.766 --> 00:18:11.671
like really focal brain regions,

00:18:11.671 --> 00:18:16.060
it is a distributed neural
network, as I have illustrated.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.379
And a developmental anomaly
can disconnect the nodes

00:18:18.379 --> 00:18:21.583
of a network and give rise
to severe yet specific

00:18:21.583 --> 00:18:23.166
learning disorders.

00:18:24.582 --> 00:18:27.598
And finally, the right
fronto-temporal connectivity

00:18:27.598 --> 00:18:30.294
seems to be essential to develop

00:18:30.294 --> 00:18:33.101
a normal cognitive system for music.

00:18:33.101 --> 00:18:37.005
But I'd like to finish,
to end on a positive note.

00:18:37.005 --> 00:18:40.836
Because I'm interested in those ones too,

00:18:40.836 --> 00:18:43.753
that is the ones who dance so well.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.468
And this is really
something we are starting,

00:18:49.468 --> 00:18:52.934
studying what I believe
is the other extreme,

00:18:52.934 --> 00:18:55.255
the high end of the spectrum,

00:18:55.255 --> 00:18:57.181
those of the musical prodigies.

00:18:57.181 --> 00:19:01.267
And I'd like just for
you to listen to a young

00:19:01.267 --> 00:19:05.914
Indian prodigy, like this
one, at the age of nine,

00:19:05.914 --> 00:19:07.581
and now we decrease.

00:19:08.863 --> 00:19:11.446
(boy drumming)

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.142
And it goes on for five hours.

00:19:23.142 --> 00:19:24.810
(audience laughs) It does, it does.

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:27.143
And here at the age of four.

00:19:28.832 --> 00:19:32.665
(boy drumming, woman singing)

00:19:34.149 --> 00:19:38.213
And at one year, I mean before speaking.

00:19:38.213 --> 00:19:40.796
(boy drumming)

00:19:47.617 --> 00:19:49.473
He has support for sure,
but I'd like to understand,

00:19:49.473 --> 00:19:54.043
how is it possible to have
this kind of performance.

00:19:54.043 --> 00:19:57.991
So I do consider them
as congenital anomalies,

00:19:57.991 --> 00:19:59.824
happy ones, of course.

00:20:01.386 --> 00:20:05.403
And because there are
recent findings showing

00:20:05.403 --> 00:20:08.859
that really genetic
endowment is more predictive

00:20:08.859 --> 00:20:12.156
of musical achievement than the
number of hours of practice,

00:20:12.156 --> 00:20:15.823
that even the propensity
to practice appears

00:20:16.897 --> 00:20:19.471
to be under a genetic influence.

00:20:19.471 --> 00:20:20.655
(audience laughs)

00:20:20.655 --> 00:20:24.072
You laugh, but this is a
result of a large sample

00:20:24.072 --> 00:20:25.322
of twins study.

00:20:26.925 --> 00:20:29.826
And the learning outcomes can be predicted

00:20:29.826 --> 00:20:33.993
by the preexisting structural
and functional brain features.

00:20:34.981 --> 00:20:38.349
So I'm afraid if you're not a
prodigy, you may not have it.

00:20:38.349 --> 00:20:42.462
So musical prodigies provide
really an ideal paradigm

00:20:42.462 --> 00:20:46.619
for investigating the
neurobiology of musicality,

00:20:46.619 --> 00:20:50.218
and that's to which I'm
now turning for the future.

00:20:50.218 --> 00:20:54.385
So I hope in maybe 10 years
from now to give you a key,

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.712
or the code of something
of access, of entry points,

00:20:58.712 --> 00:21:00.629
to this special talent.

00:21:02.478 --> 00:21:04.266
So thank you for your attention.

00:21:04.266 --> 00:21:06.516
(applause)

00:21:10.716 --> 00:21:13.383
(upbeat music)
