00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900
BRADY HARAN: You got another
number for us?

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.640
TONY PADILLA: I have, yeah.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.160
Yeah.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.160
It's the--

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.060
well, I'll just write
it down, shall I?

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.900
That's probably the
best thing to do.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:16.830
So it is 10 to the 10 to the
10 to the 10 to the 10--

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.510
and then this is the strange
bit-- to the 1.1.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.680
OK?

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.210
This has been claimed to be the
largest finite time that

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.615
has ever been calculated
by a physicist

00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:30.070
in a published paper.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.760
This is the paper.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.290
It's a bit of a weird paper.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.570
It's not had a huge impact
or anything.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.650
It's about black hole
information loss

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.630
and conscious beings.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.100
We won't go down that route.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.090
He actually calculates something
called the Poincare

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.790
recurrence time for a certain
type of universe within a

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.570
certain cosmological model.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.180
And this is the number
that he gets out.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.030
So this is the one
on I'm on about.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.840
Let me just check I got the
number of 10's right.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.330
Yeah.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.550
I did.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.910
Here it is, equation 16.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.380
So he's put Planck times,
millennia, or whatever,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.480
because basically, it don't
really make any difference

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.840
whether you use seconds, Planck
times, millennia, years

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.170
when the number is this big.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.320
But there's other interesting
numbers in here,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.850
which is this one here.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.820
You got three 10's
to the 2.08.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.290
That's the Poincare recurrence
time for our universe.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.650
BRADY HARAN: What's all
this about, dude?

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.580
TONY PADILLA: OK.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.730
So Poincare recurrence time.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.380
This is something that's arisen

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.110
from statistical mechanics.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.900
Very simply, if we had a pack of
cards, and we've only got a

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.270
finite number of cards
in that pack.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.470
And let's say we keep
dealing each other

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.060
hands of five cards.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.920
Eventually, if we do it for long
enough, you're going to

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.070
get a royal flush, Brady.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.500
That's guaranteed to happen.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.020
And if you wait long enough
again you'll get another one.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.920
And so on, and so on, And that's
true because there's a

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.170
finite number of cards.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.390
Now what Poincare realized is
that if you take a gas, the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.900
particles, you can put
the gas in a box.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.220
Now you can put all the
particles in one corner of the

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.800
box, and then they'll disperse
and then they'll move around.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.730
But Poincare recurrence tells us
is that after a very, very,

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.810
very, very long time, those
particles will eventually

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.500
return to the corner
of the box.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.039
You always get a repetition.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.610
And it's basically because the
thing that controls the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.400
evolution of that system only
has a finite region of what we

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.570
call [INAUDIBLE] space, of
solution space, that's

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.410
accessible to it.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.660
And so eventually, you always
come back to it arbitrarily

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.240
close to where you started.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.990
The time scales are truly
enormous before you start

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.885
expecting it to happen.

00:02:29.885 --> 00:02:32.140
So you can apply this quantum
mechanically as well.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.920
So what you're doing in quantum
mechanics, what you're

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.100
really talking about is the
evolution of microstates

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.690
within the quantums, so these
sort of quantum building

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.140
blocks of your system.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.170
And they will eventually
return--

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.040
they will evolve, but eventually
return to their

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.540
initial states.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.270
And what Don Page in this paper
has tried to do is he's

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.690
actually applied that to various
types of universe,

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.460
models of various types
of universe.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.140
It's a bit of a cheat, because
a universe is what we call a

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.270
macroscopic object.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.580
It's a large object.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.620
It's not really a quantum micro
state, in some sense.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.560
What it is, is it an ensemble,
an average, of all the

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.630
microstates.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.370
So what he's tried to do is
he's tried to say, OK, I'm

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.900
going to treat the universe
as this average

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.800
of all these states.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.475
But then I'm going to count up
all the possible averages and

00:03:22.475 --> 00:03:24.680
treat them as a sort of
microstate in itself.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.310
So it's a bit of a cheat, but
he gets an extra exponential

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.720
out from that.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.230
BRADY HARAN: Are we talking
about, Jupiter's over there,

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.510
the Andromeda Galaxy's over
there, I'm in this room

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.182
filming you.

00:03:33.182 --> 00:03:33.520
TONY PADILLA: Yeah.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.760
Yeah.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.630
All that.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.320
OK?

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.090
Now there's a very large number
of possibilities that

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.070
you can have, but it's finite.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.500
And so as the system evolves,
it's only got to--

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.720
and it can only evolve, the
system can only evolve through

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.350
a finite number of
possibilities.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.080
And eventually, it evolves
back to where it started.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.850
So actually, it's--

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.320
I've often heard it said that
the universe, for example,

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.930
will evolve, will expand.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.335
Eventually, everything will be
spread out very far because of

00:04:01.335 --> 00:04:02.750
the expansion of the universe.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.460
That all objects will have
collapsed to form black holes.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.360
That then those black holes will
evaporate from Hawking

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.140
radiation, and all you will
have is this very sort of

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.380
bleak landscape of just
radiation that's come out

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.770
these evaporated black holes,
that's uniformly distributed,

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.660
and it'll be very boring.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.800
OK?

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.580
But that isn't the end state
of the universe.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.530
The end state of the universe is
that after these truly epic

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.100
time scales, you will eventually
have a Poincare

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.600
recurrence, and you'll wind up
back where you started from.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.570
And it's quite easy to see
how it might happen.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.346
Imagine you have this sort
of bleak universe, right?

00:04:42.346 --> 00:04:43.830
Just have a little
fluctuation.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.290
That little fluctuation sort of
gathers together, builds up

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.890
other things.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.670
Eventually, it sort of forms
a sort of galaxy, even.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.880
From that galaxy, you
get planets, stars.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.230
And you keep going,
you keep going.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.060
Eventually, you'll get back to
the situation where it looks

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.260
like it is today.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.170
Now, what I think is fair--

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.220
I think it's a fair point--

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.050
is that there's no way of ever
being aware of these

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.280
repetitions over these
large times.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.290
And the reason is, you could
never build a device.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.730
You could never be an observer
that could measure this.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.810
And that's because over these
huge time scales, such a

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.220
device or such an observer would
definitely thermalize,

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.560
would definitely become part
of this recurrence itself.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.020
And so there's never anybody
or anything that

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.780
could measure it.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.850
It's this sort of idea, this
sort of notion within physics,

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.500
is that if you can't
measure it, it's

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.366
irrelevant in some sense.

00:05:39.366 --> 00:05:40.120
So.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.240
BRADY HARAN: But according to
this, in this number of--

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.640
in this time, in this number of
years, you and I are going

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.940
to make this video again?

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.670
You and I are going to make
this video again?

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:51.920
TONY PADILLA: Oh,
I know this is--

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.810
less than that.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.250
This is for a special type
of universe that's

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.290
particularly large.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.940
The number for us is at least
less than this other number

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.670
that he's written down here,
which is 10 to the 10 to the

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.390
10 to the 10 to the 2.08.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.570
I'll just say years.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.110
So this one is the one that
applies to us in our physical

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.300
universe, what we call
our causal patch.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.410
This one applies to seeing
what is the Poincare

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.605
recurrence time for a truly vast
domain of universe that

00:06:25.605 --> 00:06:29.860
you can get out of certain
models of cosmology.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.790
So they're all based, of course,
on the same idea.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.080
We can work through where
these numbers come from.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.180
So the Poincare recurrence time
of any system is roughly

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.270
proportional to the number
of states in that system.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.730
Because we're applying this to
the universe, this is really

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.870
the number of macrostates, the
number of these averages of

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.510
microstates that you
could talk about.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.420
So let's call this Nmacro.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.375
This, then, where we'd expect it
to be about the exponential

00:06:59.375 --> 00:07:01.045
of the number of microstates.

00:07:01.045 --> 00:07:02.420
Now why is that?

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.510
Well, this doesn't really
have to be an e.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:05.830
It could be a 2 or whatever.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.270
Basically, any microstate is
either in or out of the

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.010
averaging with some weighting.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.560
And so this is the number
that you get out.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.900
The number of microstates when
you relate to the entropy is e

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.580
to the entropy.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.960
Let's look at some volume
of the universe,

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.290
of some radius r.

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:24.110
Then the entropy--

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.290
we've done this before.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.050
This is the same arguments
you have before--

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.950
the entropy that you could
possibly have in this region

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.430
of space, basically it's
proportional to--

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.530
I'll just be a bit sloppy
with factors--

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.250
r squared over the Planck
length squared.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:43.560
So the next step is e
to the e to the--

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.590
So now let's apply it.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.790
So let's apply it to
the really big

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.860
number that he does.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.230
The question is, what's r?

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:54.400
Well, the radius of the universe
is about 10 to the 26

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.100
meters, our visible universe,
so far as we can see.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.650
What we call our causal patch.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.510
The Planck length is about 10
to the minus 34 meters.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:09.150
So r over n l Planck squared is
about 10 to the 120, which

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.560
is a number you often see
in physics, actually.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.300
This is sort of the number
that's associated with

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.500
cosmological constant
problems.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.410
But anyway.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:20.113
Well, 120 is about
10 to the 2.08.

00:08:20.113 --> 00:08:22.470
That's where that
is coming from.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.390
I don't know why he's so precise
about this 2.08,

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.280
because what he's going
to do next is--

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:33.470
the number we have is e
to the e to the 10 to

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:36.340
the 10 to the 2.08.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.250
But what he does here is
he just approximates

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.850
these e's as 10's.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:44.590
Which is fine, really, in the
broader scheme of things.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.260
e, 10.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.970
For the sake of cosmology,
they're more or

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:48.970
less the same thing.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.682
All the e's become 10's, and
you're got 10 to the 10 to the

00:08:51.682 --> 00:08:54.450
10 to the 2.08.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:57.550
Which hopefully is what he's
got there, and it is.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:00.310
So that's where that
number comes from.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.320
So this is basically the
Poincare recurrence time for

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.800
our visible universe,
for our patch.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.900
BRADY HARAN: Why is the
other number bigger?

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.380
TONY PADILLA: Well, because
the other number--

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.640
there, he's looking at--

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.510
he's trying to get a
big number is what

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:12.090
I guess he's doing.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.390
He's trying to get
a bigger number.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.290
What he's looking out there
is a model of inflation.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.070
Now, inflation is a model of the
very early universe, where

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.430
the universe grew really quickly
out of a very small

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.620
patch of the universe.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.550
The amount by which it blows
up depends on various

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:28.880
parameters in the model.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.950
But basically, the thing that
you get is you get to the size

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:32.860
of the universe.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:37.390
So r, for that case,
is of order e to

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:41.200
the 4 pi over M squared.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.280
So this is actually
r over l Planck.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.330
He's done everything
in Planck units.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.710
But M here is the mass of some
of this influx, what we call

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:50.370
the inflaton field.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:51.760
It's just some field
in the model

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.430
that causes the expansion.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.880
1 over M squared is
10 to the 12.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.130
I think this might
be 13, actually.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:58.630
10 to the 12.

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.310
So this is about 10
to the 13 overall,

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.920
because 13 is about 10.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.000
Bear with me.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.350
So this is e to the 10
to the 13, roughly.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:11.860
The 13, well, is about
10 to the 1.1.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.950
That's where the
1.1 comes from.

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.270
He's very precise about this
1.1, and yet he's very sloppy

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.300
with some of the
other factors.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.880
You get e to the e to another
e to the 10 to

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.660
the 10 to the 1.1.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.940
And then we do the same thing.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.000
We turn all the e's into 10's.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.623
BRADY HARAN: Help me understand,
because obviously,

00:10:28.623 --> 00:10:30.040
you have bit numbers there.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.040
How long a time is this?

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:32.470
TONY PADILLA: OK.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.320
So this is truly vast.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.290
Like I said, there's no device,
there's no observer,

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:38.780
anything that could survive
this kind of

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:39.950
length of time scale.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:43.300
In fact, you would probably say
that the universe is more

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:47.410
likely to tunnel out of the
current state before this

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:48.740
could happen, in some sense.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.020
This is such a long time scale
that one might say that

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.170
actually the probability of
tunneling to a new phase of

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:55.510
the universe, completely
different, is actually going

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:56.570
to dominate over this.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.220
That that would occur first.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.730
So maybe this is kind of
an irrelevant point.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:02.220
Yeah.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.770
It's truly vast.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:08.200
It's bigger than a
googol, clearly.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.390
Way bigger.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.490
Is it bigger than
a googolplex?

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:11.456
I think so.

00:11:11.456 --> 00:11:13.350
So you know, let's
just check that.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:14.410
Yeah, clearly it is.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:15.140
It's enormous.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.270
It won't be as big as Graham's
number, but you know, Graham's

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.270
number's the daddy, right?

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:19.690
So.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:21.530
Well, I didn't actually
know about this paper.

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:22.280
But yeah, I was just--

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.060
I just thought, oh,
big numbers.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.750
Let's see what's interesting
about big numbers.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.150
And then I stumbled
across this paper.

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.990
What he claims-- in
fact, he says it--

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:34.480
he claims, "So far as I know,
these are the longest finite

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.120
times that have been explicitly
calculated by any

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.055
physicist." So whether somebody
has calculated a

00:11:41.055 --> 00:11:41.930
longer one--

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.830
and I'm sure some of the viewers
will try to calculate

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.120
a longer one and then
claim that they've--

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.090
but this is in a published
paper.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:49.930
So you've got to get the
paper published.

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:52.500
But the challenge is on, I
guess, to find a longer one.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.970
There probably has been, too,
but he was the one that

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:56.220
pointed it out.
