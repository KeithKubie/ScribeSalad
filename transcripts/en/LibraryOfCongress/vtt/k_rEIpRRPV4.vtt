00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.820
&gt;&gt; Well, good afternoon, everyone,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.670
and welcome to the
Library of Congress.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.410
A special welcome to friends
of Marlene's who are here.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.070
We're pleased to have you here.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.770
Welcome to the Center
for the Book's Books

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.740
and Beyond Author Lecture Program.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:42.120
The Center for the Book itself was
created in 1977 by Daniel Boorstin

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.520
when he was Librarian
of the Congress,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.630
and his idea was the Library of
Congress should be doing more

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.050
to reach out to the general public
to promote books and reading,

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.110 position:56%
to which menu we have added literacy
promotion, library promotion,

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.860
and basic public outreach on behalf
of books and reading and learning.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.700
And through the years, we
have developed state networks.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.830
Each state has an official
affiliate,

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.460
which works with the state itself
to promote, what turns out to be,

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.500
in many ways, really
working with author promotion

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.500
in that particular state.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.230
And each state plus
the Virgin Islands,

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.040
and we hope someday the other
territories that participate

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.750
in the Pavilion of the States
of the National Book Festival,

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.480
which is another major
area of our interest.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.790
But each state is here, and
a number of those states back

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.350
in their own areas sponsor book
festivals and have author events

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.130
and get the writers of that --

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.980
give the writers of the
state great support.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.810
In Maryland, it started with
the Howard County Library,

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.130
but also now is one of 10 state
centers anchored and supported

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.360
by the Humanities Council, so it's
the Maryland Humanities Council's.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.820
Initially when we started this,
and I was the founding director

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.410
and had the pleasure of going
to all of the states trying

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.150
to develop this wonderful idea, I
did approach Pratt Public Library.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.790
It was before the present librarian
was there, and it was a period

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.460
of transition, and I
learned a lot about Maryland.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.070
I learned about each state,
that there's only going

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.210
to be one official Library
of Congress affiliate

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.640
in reading and promotion.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.140
It becomes sort of
competitive in one sense,

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.890
and that is you learn quickly that
in some states such as Maryland,

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.180
while Enoch Pratt would've
been a natural,

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.520
and there's no particular state
government agency called a State

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.060
Library, a lot of people felt
it really was one more thing

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.640
in Baltimore, and it really
should find a way to reach out,

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.000
as each state needed to do.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.060
So it was natural that in the way
that we started in Howard County,

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.380
and we ended up in Baltimore,

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.520
but it was with the
Statewide Humanities Council.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.550
So that's kind of our story there.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.190
We also have literacy
and reading promotion,

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.430
non-profit organizational partners,
and I mentioned the book festival,

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.320
but we, here at the
Library of Congress,

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.970
sponsor this particular
series, which is aimed

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.210
at celebrating new books.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.860 position:56%
I don't quite have the final edition
yet to show up for the camera.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.630 position:56%
We are now -- we film all of these
for the Library of Congress website.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.470
But books that have been published
by authors who have made good use

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.450
of the Library of Congress'
collections or other collections,

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.690
and it's fun for us to be able
to show the result of research,

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.320
and the result of libraries,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.670
and to do so through promoting
books and the sales of books.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.960
And today's program, after
our speaker finishes a talk

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.820
of around 40 minutes or so,
we'll have a chance for question

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.690
and answers, and then a book sales
and book signing at the Library

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.260
of Congress discount
of 10% in the foyer.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.700
We are filming this, as I
mentioned, for our website,

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.950
for the Library's website,
and for the Books

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.010
and Beyond portion of that.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:38.370
And this series actually started
in 1996, and we now are reaching

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.290
around the 350 mark in
terms of presentations.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.500
So through those websites, and also
through the website presentations

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.370
for the National Book
Festival, which started,

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.310 position:56%
thanks to Laura Bush asking as First
Lady, asking the Library of Congress

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.920
to form the partnership,

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:05.690
has resulted in several hundred
more web author presentations

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.890
on the Library of Congress website,
so I urge you to take a look

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.970
at that website to get a sense
of what's happening in literature

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.940
and writing today, especially,
maybe, in some ways, in biography

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.670
and non-fiction, which is kind
of the specialty in some ways

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.760 position:56%
of the Books and Beyond series, only
because another part of the Center

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.650
for the Book is the poetry
and literature program,

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.760
which has a very active
program in poetry and fiction.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:41.050
And finally, a new section
-- new center, a mini-center,

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.090
which we opened in
2009, was the Library

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.940
of Congress' first
Young Readers' Center.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.080
So we have the first place at the
Library of Congress really aimed

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.960
at the reading interests of kids
16 and under, who are welcome

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.090
to this beautiful suite of
rooms in the Jefferson Building,

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.140
as long as they are
accompanied by an adult,

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.960
which is an interesting
way of getting

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.920
to the subject of family literacy.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.570
So for us, the Books and Beyond

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.450
and the Young Readers Program
are extremely important.

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.650
Today, as you know, we
have a special presentation

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.820
by a Maryland resident,
and this is --

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:27.020
and I'm going to let Marilyn
-- Marlene, excuse me.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.320
I called you Marilyn.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.540
Marlene talk about her book, but it
does have this wonderful subtitle

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.340
that lays it all out for us.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.670
So Marlene's book is "Fair Labor
Lawyer, the Remarkable Life

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:46.130
of New Deal Attorney and Supreme
Court Advocate, Bessie Margolin,"

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.950
and it's published by Louisiana
State University Press,

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.560
which is a press we have actually
worked with before Marlene

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.390
on a couple of occasions.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:59.250 position:56%
And as we said in our publicity, but
you will learn in greater detail,

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:04.160
during her life, Bessie shaped
modern American labor policy

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.750
as a Supreme Court advocate, while
creating a place for female lawyers

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.690
in the nation's highest courts.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.730
And you will learn about
some of the obstacles

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:18.140
that she overcame during the
talk, and as I said earlier,

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.030
we'll have a chance to
ask questions of Marlene,

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.870
and to have a book
signing afterwards.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.800
Marlene Trestman is a
former Special Assistant

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.660
to the Maryland Attorney General,

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.980
where she started her
30-year legal career in 1982.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.110
She has taught law
at Loyola Maryland --

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:42.670
Loyola University at Maryland,
Sellinger School of Business

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.690
and Management, where
she earned her MBA.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:49.770 position:56%
A former trustee of Goucher College,
she currently serves on the board

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.540
of Goucher's Prison
Education Partnership.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:57.550
A New Orleans native, Marlene
has had a personal relationship

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:02.760
with Bessie Margolin that grew
from common childhood experiences,

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.100
and I have a feeling we are going

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.980
to learn something
about that immediately.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.510
Let's join me in welcoming
Marlene Trestman.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:17.050
[ Applause ]

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.350
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.270
Thank you, John, for
that nice introduction,

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.440
and it's really an honor to be
here at the Library of Congress.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.880
I want to thank each of
you for taking time to come

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.480
and learn something
about Bessie Margolin.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:38.720 position:56%
Through a life that spanned the 20th
century, Bessie Margolin contributed

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.570
to three major episodes of
modern American history.

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.990
She defended the constitutionality

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:49.280
of the New Deal's Tennessee Valley
Authority, she drafted rules

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.960
for the Nazi war crimes trials,
and for more than three decades,

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.730
she championed the Fair
Labor Standards Act,

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.170
ultimately including
the Equal Pay Act.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:03.490
Entrusted with the Labor
Department's litigation,

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:07.900
Margolin presented 24
arguments at the Supreme Court,

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.760
one of only three women to
do so in the 20th century,

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.430
and prevailed in 21 of them.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:19.040
For 20 years, Solicitors General
assigned those Supreme Court

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.830
arguments to her, and she was
the last Labor Department lawyer

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.330
to receive that distinction.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.890
She began her legal career in 1930,

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:33.830
when only 2% of America's
lawyers were women.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:37.590
She served in the Federal
Government under six presidents,

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:42.130
from FDR to Nixon, and
nine labor secretaries,

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.500
beginning with Frances Perkins.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:50.250
She received every award the Labor
Department offered, and by 1963,

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.120 position:56%
was promoted to Associate Solicitor,

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.490
the Department's top
non-political legal position.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:01.260
In short, before there
was an audacious --

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.550
before there was a notorious RBG,

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.650
there was an audacious
Bessie Margolin.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:12.000
After retiring in 1972,
however, Margolin seemed

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.410
to fade from the public record.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:18.120
It's not hard to understand
why she deserves to be rescued

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.730
from obscurity, but I'd

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:23.650
like to explain how I
came to take on that task.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:30.110
In the fall of 1974, I was a
freshman at Goucher College,

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.750
far from my home in New Orleans.

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:36.530
My high school guidance
counselor had written Margolin,

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:40.490
a distinguished alumnae
from our Class of 1925

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:45.880
of the Isidore Newman School, the
letter of introduction shown here.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:50.010
Through college, law school,
and into my legal career,

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.510
I got to know Bessie Margolin.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:57.300
She was the first female lawyer
I ever met, and we were connected

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.370
by common childhood experiences.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.340
Bessie and I were both wards

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:06.460
of the same Southern Jewish
Children's Welfare Agency,

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:12.110
which educated us at Isidore
Newman School a half-century apart.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.810
Bessie Margolin personified
excellence in the law

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:20.770 position:56%
and in public service at a time when
women attorneys were discouraged,

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:22.420
if not outright prevented

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:26.230
from pursuing opportunities
available to men.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:30.350
While protecting the rights of
millions of American workers,

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:34.500
she also advanced the careers
of countless government lawyers

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.580
and employees, many of whom sought

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:41.650
out her prestigious
and demanding tutelage.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:46.970 position:56%
The late Simon Sobeloff, who was
Chief Judge of both Maryland's Court

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.990
of Appeals, and the
Federal Fourth Circuit,

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:54.740
and a former Solicitor General,
offered only two suggestions

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:58.610
for lawyers who sought a
Federal Appellate practice.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.790
They should work in either the
office of the Solicitor General,

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:06.300
naturally, or in the
office of Bessie Margolin.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.970
I'd like to share her journey
from beneficiary of social justice

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:14.560
to its powerful advocate,
and along the way,

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.860
I'll offer just a few examples
of the wonderful resources here

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.570
at the Library of Congress
that enabled me

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:26.930
to understand her journey,
resources that preserve the needles

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:32.790
of her otherwise undocumented
life amid the archival haystacks

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:36.060
of far more celebrated individuals.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:41.040
Bessie was born in 1909
in Brooklyn, New York,

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.810
the first American born child
of Russian Jewish Immigrants.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:50.500
From there, to escape New York's
tough and crowded conditions,

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.200
Bessie's family made its
way to Memphis, Tennessee.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:59.270 position:56%
About a year after giving birth to
a third child, Bessie's mother died,

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:04.600
leaving Bessie's father alone to
care for three very young children.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.240
The Margolin's plight attracted
the attention of a Memphis rabbi,

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.400
who petitioned the Jewish
Orphan's Home in New Orleans

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.350
to accept the children as
so-called half-orphans.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:23.100
In 1913, the orphanage admitted
Bessie, age 4, and her siblings.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:28.240
Proclaimed a magnificent monument
to Hebrew benevolence, The Home,

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:33.000
as it was known, sat prominently
on gracious St. Charles Avenue,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.730
near the stately mansions of New
Orleans' most prosperous citizens.

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:41.590
It was both a stunning
contrast to the humble origins

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:45.260
of its young residents,
and an inspiring symbol

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:50.380
of what each child could and
many of them did achieve.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:55.740
In The Home, Bessie grew up
with more than 150 other orphans

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.000
and half-orphans from
throughout the Deep South.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.590
Its trustees, however,
were not content

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:05.150
to provide mere subsistence
to its charges.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:10.570
Instead, The Home groomed Bessie as
an all-American girl who shed honor

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:15.160
on the local Jewish community, and
reflected the values and culture

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.550
of her prosperous benefactors.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:23.010
In addition to a religious
education in reformed Judaism,

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.600
that preached social justice,

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.570
The Home provided Bessie
a robust secular education

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:33.070
at the Isidore Newman
Manual Training School,

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:37.470
where the cutting edge
curriculum emphasized manual skills

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:42.690
and home economics and woodworking,
as well as rigorous academics.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:47.390
The Home built this unique
school to educate its wards,

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:51.390
first and foremost, but also
admitted New Orleans children

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:55.150
of all religions, whose
parents paid tuition.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:58.480
Newman quickly became
what it remains today,

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:04.800
one of the South's finest colleges
and -- finest college prep schools.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.870
Bessie excelled in every subject.

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:13.830
She graduated from Newman in
1925 as a 16-year-old leader,

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:17.750
who was comfortable in a
co-ed setting competing,

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:21.800
succeeding, and winning respect.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.710
Besides leading the Debate Club,
and the Girls' Student Council,

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:29.230
Bessie was valedictorian,
and won a coveted scholarship

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:31.040
to Newcomb College,

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.800
Tulane University's
Coordinate College for Women.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:40.200
Bessie spent two years at Newcomb,
ranking among top 10 in her class,

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.500
but the audacious Bessie
wanted more.

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:50.200
She decided to attend law
school, something no other girl

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.500
from The Home had ever done.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.030
As Tulane Law School's
only woman at the time,

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:59.380
Bessie felt isolated
and self-conscious.

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:03.840
But she and her male classmates
soon adjusted to each other.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.890
When a professor assigned a
torts case involving an accident

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:12.330
in a men's bathroom, no one wanted
to recite the facts of the case

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:16.720 position:56%
because they were embarrassed to use
the word "toilet" in mixed company.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:21.020
When one poor fellow in the class
finally blurted out "wash room,"

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.430
they all sighed with relief.

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:28.740
In June 1930, at age 21, Bessie
completed her liberal arts

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:33.130
and her law studies with
honors in only five years.

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:36.230
She graduated second in
her law school class,

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:40.090
and was Civil Law Editor
of the Law Review.

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:43.380
Tulane Law School's
Dean, Rufus Harris,

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:48.640
urged Yale Law School's Dean,
Charles Clark, to hire Bessie

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.160
or award her a fellowship
for graduate studies.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:57.010
Clark found Bessie worthy of a
job, but refused to consider her

00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:01.110
for a fellowship, because he
did not want to encourage her

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:06.770 position:56%
to pursue a career teaching law that
simply did not exist for a woman.

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:10.740
Harris assured Clark that
Bessie was, in his words,

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:15.560
a level-headed girl who knew some
things in this world must be taken

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.090
as they are, or so he thought.

00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:21.180
With her fate determined
by the two Deans,

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.590
Bessie accepted a research position

00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:27.100
with Yale Law School
Professor Ernest Lorenzen,

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:30.960
an expert in comparative
law and conflicts.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.800
In New Haven, Bessie
impressed both Lorenzen

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.230
and a wildly popular young
faculty member by the name

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:42.600
of William O. Douglas, the
future Supreme Court Justice.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:47.500
With their help, Bessie overcame
Dean Clark's earlier opposition,

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:52.020
and became the first woman ever
awarded Yale's Sterling Fellowship

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.320
for Graduate Studies.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.010
With her Yale doctorate,

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:01.640
Bessie moved to Washington
for a new opportunity.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.150
She applied for a job at the
Tennessee Valley Authority,

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:10.330
which Congress had just created
to realize FDR's New Deal vision

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:15.160
of supplying electricity to the
valley's impoverished residents.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:19.710
Bessie had strong ammunition
to aid her hiring at TVA.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:22.960
As I uncovered here at the
Library of Congress, as you can see

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:27.440
on the slide, William O. Douglas
lauded her brilliant academic

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:32.450
record, and recommended her to
TVA as "imminently qualified

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.960
for a position of responsibility."

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.020
But it may have been
Professor Lorenzen,

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:42.080
who wrote what TVA
apparently needed to hear

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.920
to hire its first woman
attorney -- first woman attorney.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:51.070
That Bessie was intent on a legal
career, "as a primary objective

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:53.320
from which she would
not be deflected

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.760
by consideration of marriage."

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.680
Bessie thus began her federal
government career with a pledge

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:06.070
that she would be married
to her job instead of a man.

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:11.670
Fearing TVA's competition, private
utility companies hurled charges

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:15.520
of socialism that quickly
turned into law suits.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:21.200 position:56%
To defend this New Deal cornerstone,
TVA hired James Lawrence Fly,

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.540
a Harvard Law graduate and
experienced trial lawyer

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.710
from the Justice Department.

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:31.370
Fly made Bessie a key member
of his brilliant legal team.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:35.070
Two landmark cases that
established, later,

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:39.420
the legality of TVA's
power program, Ashwander

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.800
and later the Tennessee Electric
Power Company, overshadowed all

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.540
of TVA's work while
Bessie was there.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:49.800
And Bessie researched,
prepared witnesses,

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.550
and materially shaped
the briefs in both cases.

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:57.220
In her other TVA work,
she negotiated contracts

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:01.060
and got courtroom experience
in condemnation cases,

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:05.930
despite fierce resistance to a
woman lawyer from local attorneys,

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:09.280
judges, and even witnesses.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.400
How did she feel about
her chosen profession?

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:17.220
In 1938, Bessie shared her
thoughts in the magazine published

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:20.410
by her Alpha Epsilon Phi sorority.

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:23.740
"Law is still too greatly
restricted for women,

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.900
with considerable prejudice
against them," she wrote,

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:30.200 position:56%
and offered this no-nonsense advice.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:34.970 position:56%
"A woman attorney must manage to be
accepted and treated as another man,

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:38.380
and must be willing to take
responsibility, criticism,

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:42.560
and hard work in the same
spirit as do the men attorneys.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:46.790
She must aim to become one
of the men without, however,

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:51.330
becoming masculine or overly
aggressive in her approach."

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:54.780
Bessie practiced what she
preached throughout her career.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:21:00.220
In March 1939, Bessie
joined the Labor Department,

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.720
where another New Deal
program awaited enforcement.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:09.700 position:56%
The Fair Labor Standards Act of
1938 invoked federal commerce powers

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.780
to prohibit child labor,

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:15.760
and to guarantee minimum
wages and overtime.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:20.520
Bessie was there as every aspect
of the new law was being tested.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.330
Her first week, she
traveled home to New Orleans,

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:26.270
where she won a motion
to quash a subpoena.

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:29.960
By year's end, she returned
home to New Orleans more times

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:35.500 position:56%
on FLSA matters, including to deal
with the Fifth Circuit's disposition

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:40.180
of a Supreme Court-bound lawsuit
that challenged the minimum wage

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:45.080
for textile workers, then
32 1/2 cents an hour.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:50.450 position:56%
The New Orleans Press loved Bessie's
"local girl makes good" story.

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:54.280
One full-length photo,
shown here, captured Bessie

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.220
in a pose more cheesecake
than lawyerly.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.490
Why wasn't she married,
the press inquired.

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:04.660
The reporter recounted
Bessie's coy response this way.

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.950
"I haven't had time for love."

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:09.800
Then she smiled, "But
I'm not immune.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.210
I'm just uncontaminated."

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:16.120
Dr. Margolin brushed back
a lock of soft black hair.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.440
"So far," she added.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.290
Now Bessie's remark
merits several notes.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:25.090
First, it was witty, like a line
from a Katharine Hepburn movie,

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:28.440
revealing Bessie's
passion for wordsmithery.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:31.820
Second, she seemed neither
defensive nor self-conscious

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.450
about being single.

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:36.190
And third, it just wasn't true.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:40.770
I'm going to digress to discuss a
topic I'm invariably asked about,

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:42.850
and that's Bessie's personal life.

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:45.620
That it doesn't fit
neatly within the contours

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:49.950
of her career exemplifies
the obstacles

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:55.030
that an ambitious career
woman faced at her time.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:57.450
During law school,
Bessie was engaged

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:00.610
to her classmate, the
dashing Bob Butler.

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:03.250
She broke it off in late 1933,

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:06.930
surprising no one,
except perhaps Bob.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:09.520
Little did Bob realize
that his dream

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.860
of marrying Bessie was
doomed from the start.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:16.930
When he gave her a book inscribed
"to my sweetheart, Bess,"

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:20.850
she inscribed the margins and
blank pages of the same book,

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:24.540
as you can see here,
with extensive passages

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:28.860
from Virginia Woolf's
just-published feminist essay,

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:33.930 position:56%
"A Room of One's Own," extolling the
importance of women having space,

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:36.630
literally and figuratively.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.830
And then, perhaps you might have
guessed, there was Larry Fly,

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:45.920
Bessie's TVA boss, who was
married with two children.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.990
Their love affair was
a widespread secret.

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:54.290 position:56%
That's what colleagues, Fly's wife,
and even Bessie told Fly's daughter,

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:57.920
who was writing her father's
never-finished biography.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.210
Remarkably, the romance did
not impair Fly's supervision

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:06.920
of TVA's lawyers, who consistently
praised Fly for running one

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.890
of the best law departments
inside or out of government.

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:15.330
Nor did any colleagues ever claim
that Fly favored Margolin at TVA

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:20.770
with assignments or
promotions she didn't merit.

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:27.140
The romance, however, had other
consequences for Margolin and Fly,

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:31.050
who was appointed Chair of the
Federal Communications Commission.

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:37.260
In 1943, Georgia Congressman Eugene
Cox commandeered a congressional

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:42.840
committee to investigate the
FCC, accusing Fly and the agency

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:47.430
of "Gestapo tactics
to control the media

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:50.180
and other un-American activities."

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:55.310
Cox's investigators, including one
improbably named here as "Bugeye,"

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:59.990
as you can see on the
screen, scrutinized Fly's

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:04.910
and Bessie's TVA travel vouchers
to uncover honeymoon trips

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:07.810
that they took together
at government expense,

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:10.310
and they interrogated
Bessie's housekeepers,

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:13.750
landlords, neighbors and coworkers.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:18.290
But before Congressman Cox
ever questioned Fly publically

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:22.330
about the affair, Congressman
Sam Rayburn

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:25.030
and Lynden Johnson interceded.

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:29.450
Rayburn reportedly told
Cox, "There ain't going

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:32.300
to be no sex in this investigation.

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:36.660
There's too damn many of us
vulnerable on that score."

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:43.480
Although Cox obliged, Bessie's
romance with Fly kept resurfacing.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.890
In 1947, Bessie's membership
in the National Lawyers' Guild

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:52.220
and some other liberal groups
raised a red flag, so to speak,

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.430
for the Government's Loyalty Board,

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:57.200
which referred the
matter to the FBI.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:02.830
Although it uncovered no evidence
of disloyalty, FBI's agents learned

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:05.280 position:56%
that Bessie had been Fly's mistress,

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.370
which they dutifully
recorded in her file.

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:12.470
When Bessie's loyalty was
again challenged in the 1950s,

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:14.690
the charges were again dismissed,

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:20.440 position:56%
but only after the FBI revisited her
file and her "elicit love affair."

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:25.430
The affair resurfaced one
more time in the 1960s

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:28.950
when now-President Johnson
was considering Bessie

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:30.820
for a federal judgeship.

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:34.700
Responding to a name check
request, the FBI sent a memo

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.150
to the White House summarizing all

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:40.240
of its prior investigations
including Bessie's

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:45.890
"elicit love affair"
from two decades earlier.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:50.270
There are at least three lessons
Bessie should have learned

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:52.590
from her romance with Fly.

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:56.960
Don't get involved with a
direct report, be very discreet,

00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:00.050
and don't get involved
with a married man.

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:03.930
Well, Bessie heeded two of these
three lessons when she fell in love

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:07.770
with Bob Ginnane, the
well-respected General Council

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:10.440
to the Interstate Commerce
Commission.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.610
He was not her direct report,

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:14.740
although he was a professional
colleague

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:18.810
who argued a dozen more times at
the Supreme Court than she did,

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:21.080
and she was very discreet.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:27.310
Friends and family were stunned
when Bessie announced in 1981,

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:31.360
after Bob's wife died,
that they planned to marry.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:35.460
Stunned not only because Bessie
and Bob were both in their 70s,

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.180
and everyone figured
Bessie would never marry,

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:42.850
but mostly because no one knew
anything about the relationship,

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:45.510
which had started two
decades earlier.

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:49.060
Sadly, Bob died in 1984, before he

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:52.930
and Bessie ever realized
their public life together.

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:59.230
The drama of Bessie's personal
life never impeded her work.

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:01.620
In her early years at
the Labor Department,

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:06.070
she paid her dues reviewing
time sheets in damp warehouses,

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:07.720
and traveling back roads

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.910
to interview vegetable
packers and log cutters.

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:14.280
She organized the labor
solicitor's regional offices

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.590
and trained the regional attorneys.

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.800
She began arguing and
winning appeals

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.730
in the Federal Circuit
Courts, and started working

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:24.730
with the Solicitor General's office

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:27.710
on cases headed for
the Supreme Court.

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:31.550
Bessie's high quality work
earned her recognition.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:34.930
Solicitor General Charles
Fahy was delighted

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:38.330
with the Supreme Court
brief she principally wrote,

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:43.190
and her help preparing him for his
successful Supreme Court argument.

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:45.500
When he learned that
Bessie had already argued

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.420
in every federal circuit,

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:51.300
he promised she could argue the
next Fair Labor Standards Act case

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:53.370
to go to the Supreme Court.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:58.210
In March 1945, as only the
25th woman ever to argue

00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:02.560
with the Supreme Court, Margolin
argued Phillips v. Walling,

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:05.590
seeking to affirm the
First Circuit's decision

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:11.290
that the Act's Retail Establishment
Exemption did not operate

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:16.330
to remove warehouse employees of
an interstate grocery store chain

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:19.860
from the FLSA's protections.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:23.630
After what must have
been a lively argument,

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:28.070
Justice Robert Jackson marked the
occasion with a thoughtful note,

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:31.900
the first of several he wrote
to Bessie over the years.

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:35.580
"I hope you were satisfied with
the way The Court argued your

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:36.880
first case.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.060
In any event, you have every
reason to feel satisfied

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:43.120
with the way you took care
of yourself under fire.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.410
I'm sure there would be no
dissent from the opinion

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.930
that you should argue here often."

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:51.490
Bessie won the case, establishing

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.850
that Fair Labor Standards
Act exemptions must be

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:56.690
narrowly construed.

00:29:56.690 --> 00:30:00.510
In 1945 alone, Bessie
argued four more cases

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:04.040
at the Supreme Court,
and prevailed in three.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.270
These, and the rest that followed,

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:11.920
advanced the Act's humanitarian
purposes by extending coverage

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:16.150
and restricting exemptions
to protect wage earners

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:19.120
to the full extent
Congress intended,

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.560
and by securing the
Department's enforcement tools,

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:27.480
such as injunctions by
which to obtain back pay.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:31.790
When Bessie presented her fourth
and fifth Supreme Court arguments,

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:34.290
Justice Jackson was
not on the bench.

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:36.290
He was in Nuremburg, serving

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:40.460
as the US Chief Prosecutor
for Nazi war crimes.

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:47.250
This new and exciting legal pursuit
attracted Bessie, who, in May 1946,

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:52.000
went to Nuremburg to help organize
the American military tribunals

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.120
for the subsequent proceedings.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:56.700
For her six-month tour of duty,

00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:01.510
the Army's Commanding Officer
acknowledged Bessie's primary role

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:04.400
in drafting the rules
that govern the remainder

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:09.420
of the war crimes trials of
nearly 200 second-tier Nazis,

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:13.270
including the judges, the
doctors, and the industrialists.

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:18.340
One of the great examples
of the wonderful needles

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:24.280
about Bessie's life that I found
here in the archival haystacks

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:28.400 position:56%
at the Library of Congress are
pictured here, including photographs

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:32.480
in which, on the left, we can
see Bessie wearing glasses

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:37.660 position:56%
in the gallery, listening to Justice
Jackson's historic closing argument

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:41.400
to the International Military
Tribunal at Nuremburg,

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.140
and on the right, a few days later,

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:48.770
attending Jackson's
celebratory dinner.

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:54.980
In December 1946, Bessie
returned to the Labor Department

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.970
to resume her work as
Assistant Solicitor.

00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:02.400
She epitomized a new
post-war ideal of glamour,

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:07.930
of a glamorous career girl
succeeding in a man's world of law,

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:13.200
as depicted here when she was
featured in the January 1948 issue

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.980
of Glamour, then known as the
magazine for a girl with a job.

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:22.630
But Glamour did not
interfere with grit.

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:25.930
By the time she retired in 1972,

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:29.260
Margolin had directed the
preparation and review

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:34.710
of approximately 600 Supreme
Court briefs and appellate briefs

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:41.450
on the merits, with an additional
150 or so petitions and oppositions

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:44.660
to petitions for Supreme
Court review.

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:48.810
But most impressively,
Margolin principally briefed

00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:54.900
and personally argued 177
cases in both the Supreme Court

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.010
and the Appellate Courts.

00:32:57.010 --> 00:33:01.300
Of the 150 Circuit
Court cases she argued,

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:08.230
she obtained favorable
rulings in 114, 114 out of 150,

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:13.000
only one of which the Supreme Court
later reversed, and it was argued

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.630
by someone other than
Bessie Margolin.

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:19.410
Of the 36 cases she lost
in the Circuit Courts,

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:24.990
the Supreme Court later reversed
seven, six of which she argued.

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:30.100 position:56%
Bessie Margolin was no great
orator, but she engaged the justices

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:33.160
who respected her meticulous
preparation

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:37.580
and her encyclopedic knowledge
of the Fair Labor Standards Act,

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:41.910
and she was able to employ
humor, something not often done

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:44.300
with success at the Supreme Court.

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:48.660
In this 1955 audio clip,
you'll hear Bessie spar

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:52.410
with Justice Felix Frankfurter
in Steiner v. Mitchell,

00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:54.860
where Bessie successfully argued

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:58.550
that battery plant workers
whose jobs required them to come

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:02.800
into contact with toxic
chemicals had a right to wages

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:06.470
for the time they spent changing
their clothes and showering,

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:09.950
an issue that has been
revived recently at the Court.

00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:13.360
Although you may not be able
to make out what he's saying,

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:18.040 position:56%
you'll hear Justice Frankfurter's
annoyance with Congress for imposing

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:23.150
on the Courts what he considered to
be undue burdens of interpretation,

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:27.600
an annoyance he frequently
redirected at Bessie.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:32.810
&gt;&gt; Well, I grant you that that
is not something that may be seen

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:36.550
as a simple decision to make, but
it's no different than many --

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:40.740 position:56%
many questions of statutory
interpretation as to the application

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:42.040
of the legal [inaudible]
of the statute.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.700
&gt;&gt; I would not [inaudible] statute.

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:45.850
&gt;&gt; What, word for word [inaudible]?

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:50.990
&gt;&gt; No, no, just what you've said.

00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:52.290
&gt;&gt; Well, it --

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:54.560
&gt;&gt; That's what you said.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.130
&gt;&gt; When you're trying to get
[inaudible], many times said to me

00:34:57.130 --> 00:35:00.790
that the Court should leave
the questions for Congress

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:02.700
to -- and not for the Court.

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:06.680
But, after all, Congress has 400
or 500 people that they have to get

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:16.580
into agreement on language,
and the Court has just nine.

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:18.460
&gt;&gt; That's enough.

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:19.760
&gt;&gt; Which is enough!

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.060
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] don't do
[inaudible] Congress.

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.250
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm sure Mr.
Justice Frankfurter,

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:26.470
I don't need to tell you that
language is not something

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:29.360
that is easy to make clear.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:35.240
&gt;&gt; And in this next 1960 clip,
you'll hear how comfortable she was

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:38.230
with the Justices who
were probing her positions

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:40.290
and dissecting her arguments.

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:44.330
Here you'll have her -- hear her,
she was just plain having fun

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:47.430
with the way Justice
Charles Whittaker worded one

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:49.110
of his questions.

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:52.260
&gt;&gt; This offers an opportunity
to straighten out the Court,

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:56.560
and I would like to go on to
show the other clear basic areas.

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:57.860
This is --

00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.160
&gt;&gt; Just a minute, please.

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.460
May I ask just this question?

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:03.190
I -- do you stand or
fall in this case

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:06.140 position:56%
on your answer to the Chief Justice?

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:07.440
&gt;&gt; What do you mean do I stand?

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.740
As I see it --

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:10.040
&gt;&gt; You said --

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.510
&gt;&gt; I stand, I stand, I
don't fall on either.

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:17.810
[ Laughter ]

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:21.570
&gt;&gt; Bessie won that case
eight to one with, guess who,

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:25.230
Justice Whittaker providing
the one dissent.

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:28.610
As for Justice Frankfurter,
despite the banter you heard

00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:30.540
in the previous clip, Bessie

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:34.590
and he enjoyed a cordial
relationship outside the courtroom.

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:38.150
Frankfurter inscribed a
copy of his book, "Of Law

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:40.510
and Men," to her this way.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:44.440
"For Bessie Margolin, who
pleases me more often than I,

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:47.780
through no fault of
mine, please her."

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.700
She certainly got his attention,

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:53.140
as evidenced by Frankfurter's
notes from the bench.

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:56.730
In one, Frankfurter referred
to Bessie's "deft use

00:36:56.730 --> 00:37:00.990
of her feminine charms,"
and in other to her

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:04.060
"exploitation of her
female talents."

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:05.900
I guess you could say
she was accused

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:10.000
of playing the woman's
card quite a few years ago.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.330
In the early 1960s, the
audacious Bessie Margolin decided

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:17.800
to pursue a federal judgeship,

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:21.210
a campaign she waged
for much of the decade.

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:23.200
And not just any judgeship.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:27.810
She wanted a seat on either
the D.C. Federal Circuit Court,

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:29.890
or the Court of Claims.

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:33.950
With enthusiastic supporters
from Congress, the Supreme Court

00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:39.500 position:56%
and the Labor Department, Bessie's
name was considered by LBJ, himself.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:43.900
It's not clear what, if any,
role her affair with Fly played

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:47.210
in the decision, but
she faced other hurdles.

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:51.240
One male White House staffer
criticized her fashion-forward

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:58.510
appearance as "flamboyant," and
another opined "that her age, 58,

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:01.550
would tend to preclude
her from consideration."

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:08.790 position:56%
By 1968, Bessie had been passed over
for seven federal judicial vacancies

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:13.600
on those two courts alone, all
filled by men, four older than she.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:18.480
The silver lining from Bessie
not getting the judgeship,

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:22.420
at least for us, is that she
remained at the Labor Department.

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:28.120
Promoted in 1963 to
Associate Solicitor,

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:33.200
Bessie developed the strategies and
personally argued the first appeals

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:37.590
under the Equal Pay Act
and, with some ironic humor,

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:40.610
the Age Discrimination
and Employment Act.

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:45.800
By the time she retired in
1972, Bessie oversaw the filing

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:50.410
of 300 Equal Pay Act
lawsuits in 40 states,

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:55.910
ultimately recovering $4 million
for nearly 18,000 employees,

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:57.500
and earning the title

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:01.990
of the nation's number one
fighter for equal pay for women.

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:07.080 position:56%
Bessie understood that equal pay was
only one part of a bigger blueprint

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.930
for equal employment opportunities.

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:14.610 position:56%
In more than a dozen speeches to
labor lawyers and corporate counsel,

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:19.690
almost always men, she used her
authoritative voice as a veteran

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:22.470
of Fair Labor Standards
Act courtroom battles

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:24.620
to explain the Equal Pay Act,

00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:28.640
and the related Sex Discrimination
Provision in Title VII

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:32.940
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:36.820
One such battle was Shultz
v. Wheaton Glass Company,

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:40.490
perhaps Margolin's most
significant appellate victory

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:45.180 position:56%
that was never heard by the Supreme
Court, which one commentator likened

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:48.560
to a second Brown v.
Board of Education.

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:54.000 position:56%
The New Jersey Trial Court had ruled
that so-called male selector packers

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.490
in the glass factory were
entitled to 10% higher pay

00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:03.050
than the female selector packers,
largely because the men possessed

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:08.280
"greater flexibility to
perform additional duties."

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:12.900
A decision, despite its merits,
that was feared reversal-proof,

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:18.040
because of the judge's extensive
factual recitations informed

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:22.460
by his two visits to the
factory, when even a single visit

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:27.450
from a judge to a place
during a lawsuit is rare.

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:31.360
Yet Margolin convinced the
Third Circuit Court of Appeals

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:35.130
to reverse the trial court's
decision, and to establish

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:39.750 position:56%
that jobs need only be substantially
equal and not identical

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:42.600
to merit equal pay under the Act.

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:45.740
The company petitioned the
Supreme Court for review,

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:49.850
also known as Cert,
shorthand for certiorari.

00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:54.110
At Bessie's gala retirement
dinner in 1972,

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:57.420
former Labor Solicitor
Lawrence Silverman,

00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:02.160
today a Senior Federal Circuit
Court Judge for the D.C. Circuit,

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:07.110
described what happened next.

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:10.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; As I told you, the Third Circuit,
after argument, was terrorized

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:15.820
into a decision, which was, to
say the least, sweeping in scope.

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:19.960
I distinctly saw a footnote
between the lines saying,

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.550
"We'll give you anything you want.

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:23.510
Please don't send her down again."

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:28.640
[ Laughter ]

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:34.390
And Counsel for the other side
petitioned for certiorari.

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:37.120
And Bessie and I discussed it.

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:40.940
Now, you can see the
light in Bessie's eyes.

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.350
She had a sweeping decision
in the Third Circuit,

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:45.530
but here was an opportunity
to take an Equal Pay case

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:48.900
to the Supreme Court,
and Bessie suggested

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:52.390
that maybe we should
not oppose Cert,

00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:53.690
because it would be appropriate

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:56.510
to have the Supreme
Court see this issue.

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:58.290
Well, I didn't think there was
any way in the world we were going

00:41:58.290 --> 00:42:00.850
to get a decision that was better
than that Third Circuit decision.

00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:03.670
Now I was by no means sure that
the Supreme Court was going to be

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:09.220 position:56%
as terrorized as the Third Circuit,
although there are other speakers --

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:12.510 position:56%
there's another speaker this
evening that can address that point.

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:16.040
[ Laughter ]

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:18.510
But I figured a way to
deal with the problem.

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:21.190 position:56%
I just sort of leaned back in my
chair and I said, "Bessie, you know,

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:23.240
I've never argued a case
in the Supreme Court."

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.040
She said, "We'll oppose Cert."

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:30.090
[ Laughter ]

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:33.760
&gt;&gt; That was just one of the
stories that Judge Silverman shared

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.880
with Margolin's more
than 200 guests.

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.910
Chief Justice Earl
Warren, then retired,

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:42.490
before whom Bessie had
argued more than half

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:45.780
of her Supreme Court
cases, was guest speaker.

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:49.590
And among his papers here, I
found a folder with correspondence

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:52.390
and his hand-written
notes about the dinner.

00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:55.050
Here's an excerpt, an audio excerpt

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:59.080
of Chief Justice Warren's
stirring tribute to Margolin.

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:05.720 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And in the 33 years of litigation
representing the Tennessee Valley

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:09.440
Authority, the Labor Department,

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.640
and implementing the
Fair Labor Standards Act,

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:16.050
she didn't always have
a bed of roses.

00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:21.250
I am sure the hundreds of briefs
that she wrote on the scores

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:28.040
of cases that she argued summoned
every one of the 11 Circuits and 27

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:33.230
in the Supreme Court, must
have raised enough hackles

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:36.350
in some quarters to have
made her look forward

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:39.820
to the serenity of retirement.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:43.010
The 27 cases alone that she argued

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:47.250
in the Supreme Court was
a prodigious undertaking.

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:53.330
The Fair Labor Standards Act was
not always popular in all quarters,

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:55.590
and the flesh and sinews
that were developed

00:43:55.590 --> 00:44:00.860
around its bare bones were her
great contribution to millions

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:03.640
of American working people.

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:09.370
Many of these people do not
know who Bessie Margolin is,

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:15.180 position:56%
or what a great service she rendered
to them, but if they did know,

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:17.690
they would praise her tonight.

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:22.400 position:56%
In their name, I would like to thank
her tonight, because the bare bones

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.920
of that Act would have
been wholly inadequate

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:30.060
without the implementation that
she gave in the courtroom --

00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:33.510
she forged in the courtroom
in our land.

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:39.150
[ Applause ]

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:41.750
&gt;&gt; It's hard to top the
Chief Justice's remarks

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:46.430
about Bessie Margolin, so I'll
offer only one concluding comment.

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:50.180
Fair Labor Lawyer, the title
of Margolin's biography,

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:54.010
refers literally to the New Deal
legislation that she shepherded

00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:55.740
through the Federal Courts.

00:44:55.740 --> 00:45:00.260
But it also refers to the
fairness of Margolin's own career,

00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:03.840
the obstacles she faced as
a woman, the opportunities

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:08.850 position:56%
that influential supporters afforded
her, her use of her feminine charms,

00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:11.610
and her non-conformist
personal life.

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:15.790
For me, the title also represents
the challenges I've imposed

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:19.480
on myself to restore Bessie
Margolin's rightful place

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:24.040
in history, and to do justice
in telling her remarkable story.

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:25.750
I hope I've succeeded.

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:27.070
Thank you for your attention,

00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:30.210
and I'm happy to answer any
questions you have about Bessie

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:32.700
or my research here at
the Library of Congress.

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:34.500
Thank you.

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:39.130
[ Applause ]

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:41.450
We have about 10 minutes
or so for questions.

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:43.110
&gt;&gt; If you could, repeat
your questions.

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:44.470
&gt;&gt; I will do that.

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:45.770
Yes?

00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:48.100
&gt;&gt; That was absolutely fascinating.

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:50.230
I do have a personal connection.

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:52.830
&gt;&gt; The audience said this
was absolutely fascinating.

00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:54.880
I want to get that on -- thank you.

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.650
&gt;&gt; I worked for some utilities
[inaudible] Tennessee Valley

00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:59.640
Authority and won.

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:01.390
[inaudible] You didn't say anything

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:03.950
about your own personal
relationship with her.

00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:05.250
What was it?

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:06.550
How did you get to know her?

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:07.850
What do you know about her?

00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:09.260
[inaudible] friendship with her.

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:12.770
&gt;&gt; Our connection, which
I only briefly alluded to,

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:16.390
really was through the
Southern Jewish Welfare Agency.

00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:19.180
Margolin lived, as you
saw, in the orphanage

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:23.230
that stood and operated until 1946.

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:27.520
I was orphaned at age 11, and
although the orphanage was closed,

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:31.260
the agency continued on
and continues to this day

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:36.100
as a social service agency,
and oversaw my foster care.

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:39.860
The wonderful legacy
of the orphanage,

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:42.090
the Isidore Newman School, now --

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:46.900 position:56%
then and now a prestigious prep
school, honored its founding charter

00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:49.600
to admit me as a modern orphan,

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:51.610
who otherwise would've
gone there as [inaudible].

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:54.970
When I came to Goucher,
the letter you saw

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:58.080
from my guidance counselor
really was that she thought

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:00.870
that Bessie Margolin and I
would enjoy meeting each other,

00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:04.400
certainly more so on
my part, and we did.

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:07.950
And it was in those meetings,
me as a terribly timid

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:12.820
and know-nothing college freshman
and this worldly, dignified,

00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:17.040
wonderful, brilliant woman,
would just in conversation talk

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.140
about her career and
people she knew.

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:21.620
And I only wish I had
a tape recorder

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:23.680
for everything that she said.

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.980
So over those years, it really --

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:30.320
friendship, mentorship,
just sort of a kinship.

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:35.150
And she was very generous and very
kind to me, less in terms of --

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:39.150
she did, in fact, write
my bar reference letters

00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:43.140 position:56%
when I first applied to the Maryland
and D.C. Bars, and I was thrilled

00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:46.400
to find little bits of
myself in her papers

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.710
when they came into my possession.

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:50.490
So that was our relationship.

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:54.490
And everything I knew about
her, I sort of held back

00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:58.530
to review the evidence I
gathered from her papers,

00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:03.730
from the needles I found in
archival haystacks of other people,

00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:08.090
but used it to fill in or to
confirm or to second guess,

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:12.810 position:56%
but I had to make sure this would
not be hagiography, or simply my own

00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:15.710
and perhaps innocent or
naïve understanding

00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:19.720 position:56%
of a woman whose life was far bigger
than anything I could have known.

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:22.970
The only postscript is I
needed, as part of my work

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:26.150
in the Attorney General's
office in 1993,

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:29.040
to file papers with
the Supreme Court.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:32.880
We know how rare it is for cases
to actually be taken for review,

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:36.380
but these were oppositions
to petitions for review.

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:38.180
And since I wanted to sign my name,

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:41.760
I needed to be officially
admitted to the Supreme Court.

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:45.510
Bessie Margolin and I had fallen
out of touch probably for eight

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:49.070
or so years by then, but I
reached out to her to learn only

00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:53.000
that she was infirm and in
a nursing home at that time.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.790
I was admitted on someone
else's motion.

00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:58.340
But just sort of the
link and great history,

00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:01.830
that by the day I was admitted
to the Supreme Court Bar

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:07.100
in October 1993, was Ruth Bader
Ginsburg's first day on the bench.

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:09.640
And there was just some
wonderful symmetry,

00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:12.520 position:56%
although it was bittersweet,
because to have Bessie Margolin move

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:15.710
that admission would
have been extraordinary.

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.340
Yes?

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:20.640
&gt;&gt; Let me ask you something.

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:25.420
I, obviously, never
[inaudible] the lady before.

00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:26.720
&gt;&gt; You are not alone.

00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:28.980
&gt;&gt; So it's quite interesting
to hear her story.

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:31.050
I was a lawyer.

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:35.550
I didn't study in America, but I
studied in The Netherlands, right?

00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:42.280
A few questions that
[inaudible] forces me to ask.

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:45.690
Obviously she faced
the tremendous backlash

00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:49.450
against the New Deal Act
Legislations Act, you know,

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:54.230
that was recognized by corporate
America that basically continues

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:55.530
at this point in time

00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:56.830
with tremendous success
at this point in time.

00:49:56.830 --> 00:50:05.820
But did she ever comment about
the fact that even the labor law

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:10.030
at its most developed
was very limited.

00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:12.220
Blacks were excluded, obviously.

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:13.520
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:17.150
&gt;&gt; People working in agriculture,
I believe, were excluded.

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:20.470
You know there were tremendous
exclusions to this Act.

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:25.560
Did she ever consider the
need to update this law,

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:27.250
the need to push this
law much further,

00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:29.600
the need to radicalize this law?

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:33.580 position:56%
&gt;&gt; The question I was asked was
whether -- I'm going to repeat this,

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:35.120
and we'll take them one at a time.

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:36.420
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:39.490
&gt;&gt; The question asked was whether
Bessie Margolin ever instigated

00:50:39.490 --> 00:50:42.940
change in the Fair Labor Standards
Act to make it more inclusive

00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:45.620
to fill in the exceptions
in the coverage.

00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:50.850
To the dealing with any
new law, getting it passed

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:54.020
in the first place is an
extraordinary accomplishment,

00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:58.700 position:56%
and it was well-received, of course,
by those most directly affected.

00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:03.380
What I do recall Bessie saying,
and it was in a newspaper report,

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:06.600
she was asked something
about her personal feelings

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:08.790
about the Fair Labor Standards Act.

00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:11.360
And mind you, she was
coming from the TVA,

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:17.730
where people who were employees,
who were liberally minded,

00:51:17.730 --> 00:51:21.550
were accused of communism
and declared as radicals,

00:51:21.550 --> 00:51:24.680
and so her response has
to be taken in the context

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:28.240
of a very young attorney who
wanted to move forward in that.

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:33.370
Her response was, I'm right with
this, the Fair Labor Standards Act,

00:51:33.370 --> 00:51:40.150
I'm a New Dealer, you know, and I'm
no radical, but I'm right with it.

00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:41.450
I'm a New Dealer.

00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:44.810
And throughout her life, the
values of social justice,

00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:47.350
which I only touched on
briefly, which were part

00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:50.390
of the way she was reared
in this Jewish orphanage,

00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:55.100
come through in terms of why
she sought out opportunities.

00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:59.260
Obviously she would not have had
a place in a Wall Street law firm,

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:03.210
but she particularly endeared
herself to the mission.

00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:05.780
She did not handle legislation,

00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:09.490
she might have been consulted,
but it was not her role.

00:52:09.490 --> 00:52:13.470
There are many lawyers who
work in the enforcement of laws

00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:17.550
who are not particularly involved
in its enhancement or amendment.

00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:18.930
And I'll take one more.

00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:23.460
&gt;&gt; My next question would be
obviously during her lifetime,

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:26.610
especially at the end
of her lifetime, I mean,

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:31.330 position:56%
even during my time in law school in
The Netherlands, and University back

00:52:31.330 --> 00:52:36.120 position:56%
in the 1980s, right, when
[inaudible] type of feminist notions

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:39.470
that [inaudible] law, right?

00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:43.760
Did she ever -- you talk
about Justice Ginsburg, right?

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:46.970
Her role in that process.

00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:51.050
Did she ever later on in her life,
right, obviously she retired,

00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:54.220
you said, in 1972, right?

00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:56.180
So she's a little bit
before that time,

00:52:56.180 --> 00:53:00.540 position:56%
but certainly the 1960s were pushing
directly into that direction, right?

00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:03.820
Did she ever, later on,
comment on, or have anything

00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:07.020
to say given her experiences,
obviously, the discriminatory

00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:10.740
and the sexist problems that she
had to deal with in her career.

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:16.630 position:56%
Did she ever, later on, write about,
talk about, discuss the notions

00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:21.170
of -- the feminist notions that
were starting to be developed --

00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:23.620
&gt;&gt; Yes, well, she was
at the center of it.

00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:27.100
She was responsible for the
Labor Department's enforcement

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:29.600
of the brand new Equal Pay Act.

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:33.960
The first time since suffrage,
had a federal law been passed

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:35.260
for the equality of women.

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:38.060 position:56%
And it was at that time, when asked,

00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:42.610
she revealed what she would
claim was her reluctant feminism.

00:53:42.610 --> 00:53:45.700
She told a reporter, "I've
never been a feminist,"

00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:47.000
which was not true.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.320
She fought all her life
for equal status of women,

00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:53.030
but just not in a global way.

00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:54.950
She said, "But now that I'm seeing

00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:58.370
in my work enforcing the Equal
Pay Act the discrimination

00:53:58.370 --> 00:54:02.190
and suffering faced by so
many women, I'm becoming one."

00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:05.080
And I also didn't mention
Bessie was a founding member

00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:07.600
of the National Organization
for Women,

00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:11.830
and was at the founding
meeting in October 1966.

00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:15.880
When I listened to the tapes,
the audio tapes that are archived

00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:20.910
at the Schlesinger Archives at
Harvard, when she entered the room,

00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:25.090 position:56%
she was met by applause from the
women who were gathered that morning

00:54:25.090 --> 00:54:29.410
in the basement of the Washington
Post for this historic assemblage.

00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:34.550
So yes, she was very much all her
life a feminist, even though taking

00:54:34.550 --> 00:54:38.480
on that term was something that
was very difficult for many women.

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:43.110
And was very proud of it, and
became part of her public personae,

00:54:43.110 --> 00:54:47.800
when she went around the country
in addition to litigation trying

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:52.450
to change corporate cultures'
ideas, she was met with ridicule.

00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:57.340 position:56%
She was often asked to speak at Bar
meetings where jokes were being told

00:54:57.340 --> 00:54:59.580
about women in the workplace.

00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:03.460
And Bessie, rather than taking
offense and not showing up,

00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:06.980
would maintain her cool and
she would talk about the fact

00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:11.830
that the law and status of
equality had not yet reached a time

00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:13.710
where humor could be taken lightly,

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:17.660
certainly not by a representative
of the Labor Department.

00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:22.460
But she went on to tell people, and
it was said of her that her coming

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:25.690
to many of these events
was met with --

00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:29.660
it was, you know, the force
of God having her come

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:33.680 position:56%
so that people would listen, knowing
she prevailed in so many cases

00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:36.240
under the Fair Labor Standards
Act, did they really want

00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:38.820
to take their chances now
with the Equal Pay Act.

00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:40.120
Thank you.

00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:41.420
Other questions?

00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:42.720
Yes.

00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:45.410
&gt;&gt; In looking at the credits,
I see Millville Public Library.

00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:48.730
I understand all of the
others, why Millville,

00:55:48.730 --> 00:55:51.550
and is there an [inaudible]
collection of Bessie Margolin?

00:55:51.550 --> 00:55:52.850
&gt;&gt; No, not at all.

00:55:52.850 --> 00:55:55.360
There's no extensive collection
on Bessie Margolin anywhere,

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:59.320
except now at Tulane, where I have
personally created a finding aid

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.870
for the papers that
her family donated.

00:56:01.870 --> 00:56:05.970
Millville, New Jersey is the site
of the Wheaton Glass Company,

00:56:05.970 --> 00:56:09.290
and I went there because
they have on microfilm,

00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:12.840
newspapers that are not even
available in the Library

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:14.600
of Congress, the Millville Daily.

00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:18.750
And I wanted local color about
what it was like for the women

00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:21.760
in the Millville plant
who were taking

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:27.050
on what was a family run
dynasty in Millville, New Jersey.

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:31.450
I found very little except, and
this, I guess, is my last anecdote,

00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:36.060
a gentleman -- and this is
the wonders of librarians,

00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:40.000
who can show you things
you can't ever find.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.790
When I explained what I was
doing there, the librarian came

00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:45.380
and relieved me from looking
at reels of microfilm.

00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:47.720
And she said, you know,
there's a gentleman here today,

00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:49.730
he volunteers as a tutor.

00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:54.240
He tells me he worked as a summer
intern at the Wheaton Glass Factory

00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:55.750 position:56%
and would be happy to talk with you.

00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:57.990
I went down and talked with him.

00:56:57.990 --> 00:57:00.750
He was a college student who
worked there over the summer,

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:04.390
and you never know what
you expect to hear.

00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:08.080
He immediately confirmed that
the women did precisely what the

00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.380
men did.

00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:12.710
And, in fact, he always tried
to stand next to the women

00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:17.090
on the conveyor belts, because
he found that they protected him,

00:57:17.090 --> 00:57:19.690
that is, it was like
an "I Love Lucy" show.

00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:22.790
The bottles came out of
the oven, they cooled,

00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:26.380
and they had to be inspected
and packed into cartons

00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:28.370
to the immediate side of the belt.

00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:30.160
And the belt did not stop.

00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:33.830
And this young man was so pleased,
because the women always watched

00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:38.800
out for him, his words, and pulled
him from having bottles broken.

00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:42.300
He also said that the
occasional things that the men did

00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:45.010
that the judge claimed
was the flexibility,

00:57:45.010 --> 00:57:48.320
was that they would occasionally
bend down and lift boxes

00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:52.650
and move them, but he said what
the women did in varying degrees

00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:56.520
of work, far equaled --
equaled, if not exceeded,

00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:58.590
the value of what was happening.

00:57:58.590 --> 00:57:59.890
So, you know.

00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:01.940
Always a librarian to the rescue.

00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:03.740
Thank you very much.

00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:11.670
[ Applause ]

00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:12.970
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Marlene.

00:58:12.970 --> 00:58:15.310
That was a wonderful
talk, and you --

00:58:15.310 --> 00:58:19.180
the work you are doing is very
much in Bessie's tradition,

00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:22.560
in what you've chosen to do, I
think it's not only worthwhile,

00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:26.550
but important, and your
demonstration of the spirit

00:58:26.550 --> 00:58:28.510
of Bessie in that it still lives.

00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:32.720 position:56%
So we really appreciate you being
here, and appreciate the little plug

00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:35.740
or two for the Library of
Congress, and other libraries,

00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:38.040
including small public libraries.

00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:40.860 position:56%
That's a wonderful story at the end.

00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:44.140
We're now going to have a book
signing, and you'll have a chance

00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:49.610
to speak more with Marlene about
her book, and her own experiences,

00:58:49.610 --> 00:58:54.000
and please buy a copy
outside and take advantage

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.850
of having the author signing.

00:58:55.850 --> 00:58:58.350
One more time, a round
of applause for Marlene.

00:58:58.350 --> 00:59:01.210
Thank you very much.

00:59:01.210 --> 00:59:04.870
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
