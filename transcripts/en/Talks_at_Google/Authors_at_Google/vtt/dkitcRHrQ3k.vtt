ZOE CORMIER: Thank you
for taking time out

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.170
of your schedule for this.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.930
As he mentioned, my book
covers sex, drugs, and music.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.740
I spent three
years on this book.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.555
It covers an enormous
range of topics.

00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:17.710
A radio interviewer
asked me, tell me

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.591
about the sexy, druggie
research you did

00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:20.840
when you were working on this.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.400
And I was like, dude,
I've never done less drugs

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.230
or had less sex.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.890
I stayed home every
night until 2:00

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.650
in the morning reading
scientific papers.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.347
It covers a lot of stuff.

00:00:32.347 --> 00:00:34.680
I'm only going to touch on a
few things in this lecture.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.040
But I can probably
sum up all of it

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.170
in a quip that comes
from my mother.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.880
I grew up in the music industry.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.800
And my mother, who also produced
this fantastic image of me

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.480
at six months old-- some
people put their children

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.270
in teddy bear
costumes, other people

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.090
do this-- my mom is
a brilliant woman,

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.830
and she summed up three
years of academic research

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.890
with one simple point.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.940
Most fun things in
life are bad for you

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.170
but nothing will kill you faster
than having no fun at all.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.959
This book is not just about
the science of having fun.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.680
It's about why these things
are important components

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.840
of the human condition.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.140
These are not a
trivial pursuits.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.930
And the more I
researched these topics,

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.860
the more I was
forced to question,

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.730
what does it mean to be human?

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.360
What do sex, drugs,
and rock and roll

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.430
teach us about what
it means to be human?

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.040
Usually when we
think about what it

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.310
is that demarcates our
species from other animals

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.330
we think about our so-called
higher cognitive capacities,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.980
the capacity to do mathematics,
the ability to remember things,

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.870
the capacity to think about
the past, present, and future.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.430
And we can tell a lot
about that from our name,

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.020
homo sapiens, the
Latin for wise man.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.010
We think that we're
the thinky monkey.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.920
But if you think about
scenes like this,

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.080
Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.980
I can't find any photograph
that sums it up better.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.550
We've got Jimi, sex on legs.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.050
We've got him on drugs.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.294
You know he used to put
little slits in his forehead

00:01:57.294 --> 00:01:58.710
so he could put
tabs of acid there

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.900
so he could be high the entire
time along with his audience.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.180
And we've got 400,000
kids, OK, 400,000 people

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.770
sat in a field in upstate
New York for this gig.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.210
We think Glastonbury
is hardcore, 150,000.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.320
They were there for one stage.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.140
And they didn't have
boutique camping.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.170
They didn't have
cell phone chargers.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.000
There was nothing
but music and drugs,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.947
and probably a lot of sex.

00:02:22.947 --> 00:02:25.280
So as I'm going through this,
I want you to think about,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.680
what has science taught us
about our supposedly baser

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.130
primitive pursuits?

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.940
But what have they
done for science?

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.190
What do these teach
us about science?

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.660
So let's dive
straight in with sex.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.610
Who here knows
the name Vesalius?

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.110
Amazing, I'm amazed how many
people don't know his name.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.910
He's known as the
father of anatomy.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.490
He was a Dutch anatomist
in the Renaissance era.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.830
And he invented this.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.240
He invented the art of
tracing the human form

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.190
in a scientific
manner and turning it

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.850
into these incredible creations.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.110
He could elucidate the
valves of the heart.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.790
He could trace the
circulatory system.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.780
And he couldn't
find the clitoris.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.810
He did not believe
that it existed.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.230
The father of anatomy could
not find the clitoris.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.090
When a rival of his, an
Italian named Realdo Colombo,

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.200
claimed to have
discovered it, he

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.610
believed he was the very
first man to ever find it.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.880
He wrote a letter, and he
described it as "so pretty

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.870
and useful a thing." --so
pretty and useful a thing.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.490
And Vesalius shot
back in a letter

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.770
to Falloppio,
Gabriele Falloppio who

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.260
also claimed to
have discovered it,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.780
Vesalius shot back with
this, you can hardly

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.410
ascribe this new
and useless part

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.530
as if it were an organ,
to healthy women.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.640
--key words, new and useless.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.430
However, modern
studies have shown

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.370
that there are 8,000 nerve
endings in the clitoris,

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.600
a higher density than
you can find anywhere

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.090
outside the human body.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.500
And it is the only
part of the human body,

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.870
and any animal as
far as we know,

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.870
that is made for only one thing.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.350
And that is pleasure.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.280
Moreover, recent studies have
found that, in fact, it's

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.150
a wishbone shaped structure.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.510
It isn't just a visible nub
on the exterior of the body.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.900
It goes down around
the mouth of the vulva.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.850
And it appears to increase in
size and density as you age

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.451
and the more you use it.

00:04:17.451 --> 00:04:19.950
And whenever I give lectures
to the silver-haired set, which

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.340
I often do at literary
festivals, old women, 50

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.950
or over, 70 or over, 80 or
over, look at me and go, yep.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.860
Now let's get to your friend
and mine, the famous charmer

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.180
Sigmund Freud.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.680
Sigmund Freud did believe in
the existence of the clitoris,

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.170
but he thought it was childish.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.750
He thought women
would only use it

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.240
to climax if they were
immature, and they

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.050
required masturbation or some
kind of manual stimulation.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.925
He believed that if you
were married to a man

00:04:46.925 --> 00:04:49.370
and engaged in
penetrative sex, this

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.546
would fulfill your
biological imperative.

00:04:51.546 --> 00:04:53.920
And you would develop into a
fully formed woman who would

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.590
come from penetration alone.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.630
And he called this the
clitoral-vaginal transfer.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.755
Sigmund Freud,
always the charmer.

00:05:02.755 --> 00:05:04.380
I'm going to skip
over this next story.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.140
But if I have time I'll
come back to it at the end

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.460
because it's a bit grim.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.480
But it's pretty spectacular.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.600
Now, Masters and
Johnson, most of you

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.440
probably have heard of
them because that TV show,

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.480
blah, blah, blah.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.100
They were very famous
sex scientists.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.490
And they did legitimize
the study of sex

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.210
in the lab, which is important.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.360
They put people into a lab
and observed them having sex.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.190
That is important.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.660
However, I consider them to
be reprehensible shysters

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.920
for a number of reasons.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.450
I'll get to a couple more.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.140
But they said that women who
don't come from penetration

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.330
alone suffered from
sexual dysfunction.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.672
And they used the word diseased.

00:05:41.672 --> 00:05:43.880
The great game changer in
the history of the clitoris

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.450
is this woman, Shere Hite.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.690
Sherry Hite was a rebel,
and she was a babe.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:49.990
And she was a smart babe.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.770
And she was a
student at Columbia.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.920
And she, like a lot
of American students

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.600
because the tuition
is extortionate,

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.400
could not pay her tuition.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.730
So, if I could do
it, I would do it.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.290
She decided to
pose for "Playboy"

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.520
to make a quick buck just
so she could go to school.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.570
She didn't know
what the picture was

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.680
going to appear like
when it was in print.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.350
And what it was was
a photograph of her

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.780
in front of a typewriter.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.970
And it said, the
typewriter is smart

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.640
so she doesn't have to be.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.550
Oooh.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.240
So what did she do?

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.230
She staged a protest in front
of "Playboy" headquarters,

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.100
demanding that the very ad she
had appeared in be removed.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.760
How cool can you get?

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.580
She then went on to become
a verifiable scientist

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.510
in her own right.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.260
And she conducted something
called the Hite report, 1976.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.020
She interviewed
over 100,000 women

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.170
between the ages of 14 and 78.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.960
And she concluded 70%, the
vast majority of women,

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.390
require direct clitoral
stimulation in order to orgasm.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.120
It is indeed pretty and useful.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.180
Now other people have criticized
her statistical methods,

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.100
but study after study after
study has upheld this figure.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.590
Now when she put this
out, she received

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.180
a barrage of criticism.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.950
"Playboy" called
it the Hate Report.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.500
And she could do no right.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.220
So what did she do?

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.930
She moved to Berlin, and
she's been there ever since.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.820
Now let's get on to
the lads, the penis.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.600
Did you know that almost every
mammal has a bone in the penis?

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.290
The boner is, in fact,
boneless in humans though.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.140
Weirdly, we don't have a penis,
even though chimpanzees do.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.840
Dogs and cats do.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.380
This is the penis
bone of a walrus.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.110
It's called an oosik, and it's
used as a weapon of warfare

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.970
by the Inuit.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.890
So what does it mean if all
other primates have a penis

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.280
bone but we don't?

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.520
That means that other
factors are required

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.470
to insert it and keep it up.

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.090
Which other animals don't need.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.610
They can just use the
bone for quickie mating.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.450
So what is it that you need
to get it up and keep it up?

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.140
What's inside your ears?

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.120
If you look at the
penis inside the brain

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.550
it's quite interesting.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.180
So modern studies
have looked at what's

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.825
called the somatosensory cortex.

00:07:58.825 --> 00:08:00.510
So everyone in this
room has a strip

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.120
of tissue on either
side of your head.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.190
It's a map of feeling, and it's
got different sizes apportioned

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:09.210
to how many nerve endings you
have in each part of your body.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.540
So, for example, you
have a lot of room

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.510
apportioned to your
hands, a lot of room

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.060
apportioned to your feet.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.000
If we look at where those
bits are-- you can see,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.730
for example, the
face is quite huge

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.100
because it's very sensitive.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.480
Weirdly, the penis is
not next to the torso.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.480
It's next to the feet.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.920
And some people think that
this explains the foot fetish.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.002
That's just a theory.

00:08:31.002 --> 00:08:32.960
But what's also true is
that, when they finally

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.370
mapped the same structures
in women-- 50 years later,

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:35.950
by the way.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:36.830
This was in the 50s.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.760
They didn't map women
until the early 2000s--

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.299
they found that the genitals
are next to the nipples.

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:45.360
And they think this is
why some women can come

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.240
from nipple stimulation alone.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.580
Just a theory.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.610
Now, when you turn
this into a 3-D model

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.542
it looks like this, which
is very sexy indeed.

00:08:53.542 --> 00:08:55.000
But, of course,
when the scientists

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.290
mapped this and produced
this image, Wilder Penfield,

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.220
a Canadian, in the 1950s,
they omitted one fact.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.460
What did they omit?

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.110
The true size of
the male member.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:07.820
If you accurately represent
how big it should be,

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:08.820
it would look like this.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.830
Now what happens when
you put them together?

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.760
This is the most
famous illustration

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.320
probably ever
created of human sex,

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.660
"The Copulation" by da Vinci.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.720
"I expose to men the origin
of their first, and perhaps

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.140
second, reason for existing."

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.460
Interestingly, he
has the female just

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.210
a spurious little
scribbling right there.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.470
The breasts connect
to the uterus,

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:38.770
reflecting the ancient
idea that menstrual blood

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.170
derives from breast milk.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:45.680
And the semen ducts
are connected directly

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.200
to the brain, reflecting
the ancient idea that semen

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.420
derives from brain tissue.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.340
Make of that what you will.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.130
Now that idea held sway
for a long time though.

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.590
That when people
have sex, the penis

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.882
drives into a woman like
a sword into a sheath.

00:10:00.882 --> 00:10:02.340
Most of us would
assume that that's

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.090
what it feels like, right.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:06.850
So this is an image that
was made in the 1930s

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:11.380
by a Dutch anatomist, using a
glass dildo and some x-rays.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:14.770
Now they updated this in 1999.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:17.210
Another Dutch anatomist
got two people

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.640
to have sex inside
of an MRI scanner.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.560
Has anyone here had an MRI?

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.640
Unbelievably claustrophobic,
can you imagine getting into one

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.360
and having sex with
somebody else in there?

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.780
How could you possibly do this?

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.530
Well, one of his
research assistants,

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.200
who was a scientist,
had previously

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.880
been a street acrobat.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.180
And so had her boyfriend.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.610
And so they were both very thin,
very flexible, and not prone

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:42.360
to stage fright.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.360
This was pre-Viagra.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.180
So they got in, and
they did the act of love

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.250
in the name of science.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.610
And so what you can see
is that the penis does not

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:56.370
dive into a woman like
a sword into a sheath.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:59.440
It bends at a 90 degree
angle like a boomerang.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.260
And they didn't know
this until 1999.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.547
But they didn't publish
this when they first made it

00:11:04.547 --> 00:11:06.130
because they thought
it was too saucy.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.137
They didn't publish it
until eight years later.

00:11:08.137 --> 00:11:09.720
You've probably seen
this because when

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.410
these scientists put up the
video, it got millions of hits.

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:15.950
And it's still the most
viewed thing on the website

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:20.400
So let's go back to Masters and
Johnson, who I said were jerks.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.850
No discussion of sex would
be complete without a mention

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.160
of homosexuality.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.900
And this is the biggest reason
I think that they are jerks.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.860
They made a lot of money
practicing something

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:33.810
called Conversion Therapy,
charging gay men money

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:36.750
to cure them of their disease.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.740
Reprehensible.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:42.130
You most know that
homosexuality was designated

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:45.740
as a pathology, as an
illness, until 1973

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.420
because it was put into the
"Diagnostics and Statistics

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.590
Manual" as a form
of mental illness.

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.330
This isn't just
an academic idea.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.210
If something is in
the DSM, it means

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:58.085
that your doctor can diagnose
you and treat you accordingly.

00:11:58.085 --> 00:11:59.460
And a lot of people
said, well we

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.800
don't think homosexuality
is a form of mental illness.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.466
But as long as it
remained in that book,

00:12:03.466 --> 00:12:06.380
it technically was--
until this guy came along,

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.310
Doctor E. Fryer.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.340
I'm amazed how many people
don't know his name.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.970
I didn't know his name until
I researched for this book.

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.270
I've spoken to experts
on homosexual culture

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.240
in this day and age
who've never heard of him.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.850
Doctor E. Fryer was a
psychiatrist, and he was gay.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.520
And he didn't
think he was crazy.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.857
And he had gay patients who
he didn't think were crazy.

00:12:24.857 --> 00:12:26.440
But he couldn't come
out of the closet

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.560
because, not only would
it ruin his personal life,

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.740
it would ruin his
professional life.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.600
So he gave a passionate speech
at the American Psychiatric

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.630
Association's annual
general meeting in 1972

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:40.110
under the name
Doctor H. Anonymous,

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:45.730
wearing a rubber mask, a
fluffy wig, and a bow tie.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.810
Now he said, I am gay.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:49.680
I am a shrink.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.034
I don't think I suffer from
mental illness, et cetera.

00:12:52.034 --> 00:12:53.450
It's a wonderful
piece of writing.

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:53.870
Look it up.

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:54.536
You can read it.

00:12:54.536 --> 00:12:55.750
It's great.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.920
Now I wouldn't think
that wearing that get up

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.720
would convince people
that you're sane.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.930
But it worked.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:02.680
It worked.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.720
And a year later they removed
homosexuality from the DSM.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.420
Imagine how much
courage it took to sit

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.600
on that stage in that get up and
say everything he said, knowing

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.870
that at any moment someone
could take off his mask

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.410
and ruin his life.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:20.140
To conclusion,
scientists are people.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:20.980
People are flawed.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.482
And sometimes smart people
think stupid things.

00:13:23.482 --> 00:13:25.190
We often think that
scientists are merely

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.750
people who gather data and
present us with their best

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:29.300
approximation of the truth.

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.350
That's not true.

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:32.680
Scientists are people, and
they bring their prejudices

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.600
and their passions to the table.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.220
And sometimes it takes
bravery and rebellion

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:40.820
to overturn
entrenched stupidity.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.370
Now let's talk about drugs.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:45.760
Normally when I talk about
drugs I'm at music festivals.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.300
And so I'll say, oh what
kind of drugs do you like?

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.550
People go TCB, [INAUDIBLE],
na na na na na.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:54.180
We're in Google, so I'm assuming
I can't do that with you guys.

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.471
Because cameras everywhere
will document it and send it

00:13:56.471 --> 00:13:59.130
to Theresa May.

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:00.530
So I'll share a story.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:04.302
I was in Scotland giving
a talk, this same talk.

00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:05.760
Most of the people
were much older.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.700
It was a literary festival.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.590
They were quite buttoned up.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:09.090
And so I wanted to do
a temperature check

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:09.785
on the audience.

00:14:09.785 --> 00:14:12.950
It was like, OK, so do
you guys like any drugs?

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:13.660
Who likes drugs?

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:14.370
People went, woo.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.710
And this old man in the front
row wearing a tweed suit

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:19.150
narrowed his eyes at
me and he said, acid.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.362
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:20.362 --> 00:14:22.570
It's like, all right, I'm
preaching to the converted,

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:23.415
let's go.

00:14:23.415 --> 00:14:24.790
I'm sure you all
can imagine what

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:28.136
science has done for drugs, new
chemistries, blah, blah, blah.

00:14:28.136 --> 00:14:29.510
What I found way
more interesting

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:32.210
is how science has been
influenced by drugs, starting

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:35.290
with Nobel Prizes.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.540
Crick and Watson, it
is reputed that they

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:41.620
got many of their insights due
to experimentation with LSD.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.592
Now this is widely reported.

00:14:43.592 --> 00:14:45.300
We did know that they
were party animals.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.050
We're never really
going to know the truth

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.070
because Crick is dead.

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:52.080
However, we do know that
this jerk, Kary Mullis,

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:58.390
who got the Nobel Prize in 1992,
achieved his insight from LSD.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:00.891
How many people here have
a biology background?

00:15:00.891 --> 00:15:01.890
Mostly you're engineers.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:05.240
OK, who here has heard of the
polymerase chain reaction?

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.860
So this got the Nobel Prize.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.890
I do not have time to
explain how it works.

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:10.850
But it truly was a
stroke of genius.

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.390
Before he came up with
this in the 1980s,

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:17.860
it took geneticists years to
unravel the language of DNA.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.910
With this simple
insight, just take it,

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.320
shatter it into 1,000
shards, read them separately,

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.650
and put them back together.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.660
He really did earn
the Nobel Prize.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.645
And he got this insight on LSD.

00:15:28.645 --> 00:15:30.270
And I'm not making
this up because it's

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:35.420
in his autobiography,
"Dancing in the Mind Field."

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.090
"DNA chains coiled and floated.

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:41.740
Lurid blue and pink images
of electric molecules

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.800
injected themselves somewhere
between the mountain road

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.100
and my eyes."

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:51.670
What are the two most
important words in this quote?

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.770
Mountain road-- he was on
acid and he was driving.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:57.610
And his wife was asleep
in the seat next to him.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:02.514
So here we have Kary Mullis
with-- Ken Kesey with the Merry

00:16:02.514 --> 00:16:04.930
Pranksters, you know, "Electric
Kool-Aid Acid Test," blah,

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:06.440
blah, blah, taking
acid and speed,

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.023
driving around, taking more acid
and speed and driving around.

00:16:09.023 --> 00:16:12.500
A Nobel Prize-winning geneticist
did the exact same thing.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.765
However, as I said, he's a
jerk because since then, he

00:16:14.765 --> 00:16:18.400
has gone on to deny the science
of climate change and AIDS.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.830
As I said, smart people
still think stupid things.

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.320
Now let's get to
a smart person who

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.990
is not a jerk, one of this
country's greatest scientists,

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:29.320
Humphry Davy, founder
of the Royal Society.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.290
Now who here has ever had
a miner in their ancestry?

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:35.230
I'm sure many of you probably
do without even knowing it.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:37.580
If you do, you're probably
alive because of this man.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.240
Because he came up with this
thing, the Davy gas lamp.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.620
Before he invented this,
this very simple mechanism

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.320
for burning methane gas
at a controlled rate,

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.160
miners were dying
by the thousands

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.940
from uncontrolled explosions
and tunnel collapse.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.260
This very simple device
allowed for a small flame

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.870
to burn the methane at
a slow, controlled rate.

00:16:55.870 --> 00:17:00.000
Now before he came up with this,
he was enamored with a drug.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.660
What drug was that?

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:07.119
Nitrous oxide, laughing
gas, everyone's friend.

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:08.230
It's called laughing gas.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:09.640
It's also called hippie crack.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.950
It is, in some ways, a
very silly drug to do.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.430
You get high for 30 seconds,
then your head hurts.

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.740
But it is scientifically and
medically very important.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.550
This is the very first drug
that was made in a lab that

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:22.300
was put into the human brain.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.060
Prior to this it was all
booze, mushrooms, plants,

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.530
things that grew.

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:29.520
This is the first time something
was made in the laboratory that

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.710
was put into the head.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:34.040
It also was the very first
methodical investigation

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:34.620
of a drug.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:37.085
This is the first time a
scientist sat down and took it

00:17:37.085 --> 00:17:38.710
constantly, and gave
it to other people

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:42.310
constantly, and recorded
the dosage and the effects.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.900
And lastly, but
not leastly, this

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.830
led to the gift of
anesthesia-- pain-free surgery.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.830
Who here has had any kind
of pain-free surgery?

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:54.190
Pretty much everybody.

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.120
And we probably wouldn't
have it if it wasn't

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.500
for this wonderful invention.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.970
Now Humphry Davy was
tasked with exploring

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:04.480
the virtues and the
qualities of various gases

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.980
at a facility in Bath.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.440
And he tried a whole
bunch of different gases.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.060
And one thing that
he did that I love

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.745
is that he tried everything
on himself first.

00:18:13.745 --> 00:18:15.120
He wouldn't give
it to an animal.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.619
He wouldn't give
it to other people.

00:18:16.619 --> 00:18:18.617
He would try it
on himself first.

00:18:18.617 --> 00:18:20.450
He was trying to explore
medical potentials.

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:23.300
At one point, he almost died
from carbon monoxide poisoning.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.110
He didn't know what it would do.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:27.730
And then he tried nitrous,
and he decided upon it

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:29.210
for his devoted study.

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:30.680
And devoted he was.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:34.020
He came up with things like
this, silken bags inside

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.520
of wire cages.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.480
He even built a
box that he could

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.655
get inside and have
his assistants pump

00:18:39.655 --> 00:18:40.910
it full of the gas.

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:43.860
At one point he
consumed 80 quarts.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:47.900
--teach any hippie kid today
how to do a drug properly.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.890
And of course, like
hippies today, he

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:52.895
would write down what he
thought were salient thoughts.

00:18:52.895 --> 00:18:56.590
"I existed in a world of newly
connected and newly modified

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:57.540
thoughts.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.610
Nothing exists but thoughts."

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:02.240
And like drug
enthusiasts today, he

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.940
shared it with the cool cats.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:09.490
Robert Southey, poet laureate--
"I am sure the air in heaven

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:13.250
must be this wonder
working gas of delight."

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:16.790
Samuel Taylor Coleridge--
"An unmingled pleasure. "

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:20.700
Anonymous-- "I felt like
the sound of a harp."

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.280
And this man said in
fewer words what others

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.730
would use thousands to say.

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:29.230
"I felt that I knew everything."

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:33.440
Now nitrous, like every other
drug, did not stay in the lab.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.280
You can't keep something
fun secret forever.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.770
It escaped.

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:39.730
Here's another drug that
escaped from the lab

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:44.100
around the same time, about
100 years later, cocaine.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:47.054
We have, your friend
and mine-- before he

00:19:47.054 --> 00:19:49.220
told you that you want to
have sex with your mother,

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.480
and he said that the clitoris
was irrelevant-- this man was

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.980
obsessed with cocaine.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:57.510
After a German chemist
isolated the active component,

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.100
it sat on a lab shelf
for about 20 years

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.780
until a few people started
playing with it-- Freud.

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.170
Freud became obsessed with it.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:08.050
And he stayed up
all night for weeks.

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:10.940
And he wrote a very long
diatribe called "Uber Coca,"

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.744
wonder coke, saying basically,
cocaine is really amazing.

00:20:13.744 --> 00:20:14.910
Everybody should do cocaine.

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:15.990
It's really good
for your creativity.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:17.030
I think everybody
should do a lot of it.

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:19.120
We'd have some really
great insights, et cetera.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.450
It was, like a lot of drug
manuals, it was very boring.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:26.080
But what it did do is it
led to the popularisation

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:26.900
of this drug.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:30.210
And most people think of the
Victorians as being uptight.

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.780
Nope, the Victorians
loved drugs.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:33.760
They loved opiates.

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.330
And they fell in
love with cocaine.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:36.650
They put it in everything.

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:40.810
And it was sold at Harrods They
put it into lozenges, syrups,

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:43.080
candy for children
because children

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.910
need help becoming hyperactive.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:48.970
They put it into a wine
called Vin Mariani,

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:52.420
8% coke, 10% booze,
blessed by a pope,

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.360
and beloved by Queen Victoria.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.140
Now the Victorian
indulgence in drugs

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.540
is scientifically very relevant.

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:02.670
It's not just funny.

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:06.010
It's relevant because this led
to the discovery, directly led

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:08.167
to the discovery, of
neurotransmitters.

00:21:08.167 --> 00:21:09.500
And this is not just my opinion.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.090
This is based on
a wonderful book

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:13.880
you can read called "Drugged"
by Richard Miller, who

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.150
is a neuroscientist and
a chemist in Chicago.

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:20.870
The reason drugs led to the
discovery of neurotransmitters,

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:24.510
things like dopamine,
serotonin, oxytocin,

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:28.610
these things are
mimicked by drugs.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:30.200
Drugs mimic serotonin.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.770
They mimic dopamine.

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:35.330
So for example, here we have
psilocybin on the left, which

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:36.910
comes from magic mushrooms.

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.090
There we have
serotonin on the right.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.490
Psilocybin mimics it.

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:43.050
And what it does is it
goes into your brain cells

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:45.650
and it invades the receptors
that are built for your body's

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:47.090
natural chemicals.

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:49.610
That is how most drugs work.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.890
So scientists and the
average philosopher

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:54.850
who was experimenting
with drugs at the time

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:57.532
thought, well, how can something
that comes from a mushroom,

00:21:57.532 --> 00:21:59.740
or how can something that
comes from a tobacco plant,

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.030
or how can something
that comes from coffee

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.900
change the way I feel?

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:07.220
If you think about it, it
is a scientific puzzle.

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:09.640
And so it was drug
indulgence that led to this.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.500
And so what happened was this.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:14.280
The typical route of
investigation went like this.

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.260
Scientists would map
the drug, and then they

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.412
would find the neurotransmitter
that it mimics.

00:22:20.412 --> 00:22:21.870
So the first time
that it happened,

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:23.710
it was because of nicotine.

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:27.490
The same drug that has killed
untold millions of people

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:30.740
from tobacco, this led to
the very first discovery

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:31.710
of a neurotransmitter.

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:34.660
So nicotine was mapped in 1843.

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:38.210
It wasn't until the 1970s
that scientists tracked down

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:41.390
the receptor in the
brain that it fits into,

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:44.580
which normally binds to
something called acetylcholine.

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.990
They named the
receptor, the keyhole,

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:50.910
they named it the nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor.

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:54.160
We named our body
part after a drug.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.730
And this is not the
first time this happened.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:59.850
Cannabis 1964, it was mapped.

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:03.590
The endocannabinoids, your
body's own natural painkillers,

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:08.510
were mapped in 1990, and
named after cannabis.

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:12.210
Morphine, 1805 it was mapped.

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:15.870
The endorphins were not
tracked down until 1975,

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:18.630
and again, named after the drug.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.970
This even goes for
molecular energy.

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:24.260
Caffeine, which won the
Nobel Prize, mapped in 1881.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.400
And I personally think caffeine
deserves a Nobel Prize.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.190
ATP, what it mimics, the
molecular currency of energy,

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:34.280
was not mapped until 1929.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.170
And this is my favorite example.

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:38.930
LSD and serotonin.

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:41.300
It was not until
experimentation with LSD

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.800
around this time
that people started

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.740
to think that serotonin may
have a role in the mind.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.690
80% of the serotonin
in your body

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.400
is found in your
gut, not your brain.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.650
So people didn't think
it had a role in the head

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:56.430
until a couple of different
teams, one in Glasgow,

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:59.370
one in Baltimore, did some
chemical detective work.

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:03.260
At one point carting
10,000 buckets of cow blood

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:07.410
from an abattoir to a
lab in Baltimore to prove

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:09.345
that serotonin has
a role in the brain.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.120
And we can thank this
man, Albert Hoffman.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.620
This is the man who made LSD.

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:22.150
Did you know the man who
made LSD, a Swiss nerd,

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:24.500
lived to be 102.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.300
And he took acid till he was 96.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.620
This is him on his
hundredth birthday.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.400
And I know people
who were there.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.920
And they say that he
indeed twinkled like a star

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.850
and flirted with all the girls.

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:38.360
Now he was not a hippie.

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.160
He was a nerd.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.600
He was a bigger nerd
than anyone in his room.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.770
He was the biggest nerd
that ever nerded a nerd.

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:47.140
He worked for Sandoz
Chemicals in Switzerland.

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.290
He worked for Sandoz
his entire career.

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:51.450
He was a company man
and a total square.

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:56.180
And he did not experiment with
drugs at all until he made LSD.

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:57.390
He made it by accident.

00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:00.700
He had spent 10 years crushing
up the shells of chiton,

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:04.340
of crustaceans, exploring
other potential applications

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.810
of other chemicals until he
accidentally made LSD, got some

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:09.790
on his fingers,
and rode a bicycle

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:13.190
home in 1943 in Switzerland,
and experienced the world's

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:14.520
first acid trip.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:15.330
It's very famous.

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:16.670
It's known as bicycle day.

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:19.670
And you can get tabs of
acid with its picture on it.

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:23.030
Now what was he actually trying
to do when he accidentally

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:23.990
made LSD?

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.480
Does anyone know?

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.460
Any guesses?

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.030
It will surprise you.

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:32.890
He actually was trying to come
up with treatments to save

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:34.480
the lives of pregnant women.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.610
That was what he spent
most of his career doing,

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:37.660
drugs for obstetrics.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:38.640
And he did succeed.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.060
He made something called
methergine, which is still

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:43.910
one of the most widely
used drugs in obstetrics

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:47.410
to prevent the death of women
from post-partum hemorrhaging.

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:50.030
The reason he came
across LSD is because he

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:52.052
was experimenting with this.

00:25:52.052 --> 00:25:54.650
This is called the ergot fungus.

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:58.650
This is a filthy black fungus
that infest fields of rye.

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:00.020
It's a parasite.

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:02.520
And it's a very
toxic, toxic fungus.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:06.120
And it produces something called
St. Anthony's Fire, gangrene,

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.650
hallucinations.

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:10.710
You can actually have limbs
drop off from gangrene

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:12.700
from St. Anthony's
Fire if you eat

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.130
rye that has been
infected with this fungus.

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:17.740
The largest outbreak in Europe,
and this happened frequently

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:20.680
throughout the medieval
era, killed 10,000 people

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.710
in Aquitaine in 926.

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:25.160
The most recent
outbreak of ergot fungus

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.980
was in 1926 in Russia.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:29.820
And it's called
St. Anthony's Fire.

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.197
It has its own saint.

00:26:31.197 --> 00:26:32.530
And this is a medieval wood cut.

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:34.363
You can see there's
hands and feet strung up

00:26:34.363 --> 00:26:35.390
from the ceiling.

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:37.000
That's because
sometimes peasants

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.860
would have multiple limbs,
even all four, drop off

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:43.050
from eating this fungus.

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:45.370
But it has other qualities.

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:48.030
It has what are called
uterotonic qualities.

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:50.150
It can have actions
on the uterus.

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:53.110
So midwives knew that if
they use small amounts of it,

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:55.850
they could have useful
properties in childbirth.

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:59.580
So what Hoffman wanted to do
was to find synthetic analogs

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:02.090
of this that wouldn't have
the toxic properties that

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:05.710
could kill you but would
still be useful on the uterus.

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:07.670
So if you remember
anything about LSD,

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:10.440
please remember, it comes
from a saint-- Sorry,

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.170
it comes from a parasite.

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:13.640
It has its own saint.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.660
And it was born in
the quest to save

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:17.650
the lives of pregnant women.

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:20.230
Now when Hoffman tried
it, he didn't think

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:21.780
people would do it for fun.

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.520
Bless his heart.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.020
He thought it would
only be useful

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.180
to artists and to scientists.

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:30.080
And he believed that it
could be for psychiatry

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.890
what the microscope
was for biology

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:34.730
and the telescope for astronomy.

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:37.050
Now, he sincerely
hoped it would only

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:39.220
be used by psychiatrists
and scientists.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:42.080
Unfortunately, as I said, you
can't keep something fun secret

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.030
forever.

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:44.780
Once it got into the
hands of the hippies,

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:48.970
especially this guy, Dr. Timothy
Leary, most known for "Turn on,

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:53.240
tune in, drop out," it
became highly popular.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.220
To give you an idea of
just how popular it was

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.140
and how much this
scared the authorities,

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.120
Nixon called him the most
dangerous man in America.

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.540
Which is incredible, because
everything he ever wrote is

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:06.050
unbearably boring .

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:08.307
This is one of my favorite
photographs from the era.

00:28:08.307 --> 00:28:10.390
Did you know that the
American government actually

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:12.370
was considering
dropping bombs made

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:16.179
of acid onto enemy combatants as
a means of destabilizing them?

00:28:16.179 --> 00:28:18.220
They had no idea how ironic
it would be when they

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.600
wrote, drop acid, not bombs.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.380
So for a while you
couldn't experiment

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.760
with psychedelics on humans.

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.150
You can only do it on animals.

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:28.130
This is one of the most famous
illustrations that you can see.

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:30.710
You probably have seen this
on like BuzzFeed or some crap.

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:31.830
It's true though.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:35.110
And this research
was funded by NASA.

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:38.140
NASA in the 1970s, they
gave drugs to spiders

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:41.110
to get a rough idea of
how toxic they were.

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:45.020
So here we have marijuana
on the top left,

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:46.310
which is pretty competent.

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:49.670
But it looks like the spider
just gave up halfway through.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:52.570
The most messed up web is
caffeine, bottom right.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:54.280
Which is a bit disturbing.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.560
And here we have
LSD, bottom left.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.100
Which is basically
perfect, but broad.

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.070
Make of that what you will.

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:04.600
Now you could experiment
on humans legally, and not

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.680
animals, if you did what?

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.310
If you made something brand new.

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:10.226
Like this guy, who you
probably have heard of.

00:29:10.226 --> 00:29:12.510
He died last year,
Alexander Shulgin.

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:16.310
Alexander Shulgin was a
scientist working for Dow.

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:20.030
And he then decided to
quit making pesticides

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:22.330
and set up shop in his
garden to only make

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:25.600
illegal drugs after a
student gave him some MDMA.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:29.540
He figured out how
to re-engineer MDMA,

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.007
and he gave the
world the recipe.

00:29:31.007 --> 00:29:32.590
If it wasn't for
this man, we probably

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:34.030
wouldn't have rave culture.

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:36.280
It was first created
by Merck in 1912.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.610
It wasn't until he tried it
and gave the world the recipe,

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:43.176
which is still freely
available online, erowid.com.

00:29:43.176 --> 00:29:45.510
Now what I love about
Shulgin is that he

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:47.460
made thousands of chemicals.

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.600
And like Humphry
Davy before hand,

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.345
he tried everything
on himself first.

00:29:52.345 --> 00:29:53.720
He wouldn't give
it to an animal.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.750
He would do it on himself first.

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:59.121
And the word for
that is chivalry.

00:29:59.121 --> 00:30:01.620
And then if he thought it was
fun, he'd give it to his wife.

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.036
And if she thought
it was fun they

00:30:03.036 --> 00:30:04.700
would share it
with their friends.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:08.540
So he figured out how to
synthesize MDMA in 1976.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:11.050
He created more
than 2000 chemicals

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:15.130
in his time, of which
200 were psychoactive.

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:17.706
So carrying on, not much
happened because of this jerk.

00:30:17.706 --> 00:30:19.580
But today we're experiencing
something called

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:20.770
the psychedelic Renaissance.

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:22.380
I'll run through
this very quickly.

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.660
But it's very important.

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:26.070
All drugs are
double-edged swords.

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:29.260
Whether you're talking about
caffeine, alcohol, nicotine,

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:32.275
psychedelics, every drug
has good and bad properties.

00:30:32.275 --> 00:30:34.400
There's no such thing as
a bad drug or a good drug.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.055
It's about how you use it.

00:30:36.055 --> 00:30:36.930
Think about morphine.

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:39.310
We've never made a
painkiller more effective

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:41.110
than what plants can give us.

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:43.750
Now these dangerous,
very powerful drugs

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:46.180
can have useful properties
in the right place,

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:48.290
at the right time,
on the right person.

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:49.790
Very briefly, they're
looking at how

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:53.320
to use LSD to treat
alcoholism, psilocybin

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.440
to treat obsessive
compulsive disorder

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.560
MDMA for post-traumatic
stress disorder.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.660
The list goes on and on and on.

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:01.880
And some of this
is crowd sourced.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:06.000
So for example, people who
have high levels of autism,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.330
like adults who are
high functioning,

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:10.340
found that taking
MDMA on a weekend

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:12.940
out with their friends
in the late 90s at raves

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:14.970
helped them with their
social interactions.

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:17.140
They lobbied for legitimate
research into this

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:18.039
and they won.

00:31:18.039 --> 00:31:19.580
And there are real
scientific studies

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:22.730
being conducted to look
at how to use MDMA to help

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:24.480
high functioning autistics.

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.060
Moreover, people who suffer
from cluster headaches, which

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:30.400
are known to be excruciatingly
painful and very hard to treat,

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.350
found that taking LSD
alleviated their symptoms.

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:36.740
And they lobbied for legitimate
science, and they won.

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:39.150
Crowd source science.

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:42.160
So, could psychedelics be for
the mind with the telescope

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.270
was for astronomy?

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:46.440
That remains to be seen, but
at least now we can find out.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:50.080
As David Nutt puts it,
drugs are an important part

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.400
of our evolutionary history.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:55.230
And we cannot ignore them.

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:58.790
Now, last subject, music,
which is my favorite subject.

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:02.180
As I always say, music has
never killed any of my friends

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:03.230
or destroyed my home.

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:05.230
It's my favorite subject of all.

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:07.009
And I can rip through
this very quickly

00:32:07.009 --> 00:32:08.050
in the time we have left.

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:09.670
Because I think it
is the best subject

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:11.500
in the whole wide world.

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.540
So what is music?

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:14.770
It's a biological puzzle.

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:15.640
Give me a guess.

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.764
What do you think music is?

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.894
Define it.

00:32:20.894 --> 00:32:22.560
Come on, this is a
room of smart people.

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:27.460
AUDIENCE: The
universal language.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:31.510
ZOE CORMIER: That's an excellent
answer, the universal language.

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:32.260
That's a good one.

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:34.094
No one's said that
before actually.

00:32:34.094 --> 00:32:35.510
Most of the time
people say things

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:37.860
like this, organized sound.

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.310
OK, yeah, fine, music
is organized sound.

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:41.810
But so is an alarm clock.

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:43.710
That's not music.

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:46.370
Beautiful math-- music
is indeed mathematical.

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:48.096
And it is certainly beautiful.

00:32:48.096 --> 00:32:49.720
But there are many
forms of mathematics

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.940
that are not musical.

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:55.450
Music, above all, is
an exquisite illusion.

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:57.910
It's an illusion that
your brain makes for you.

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:00.520
It doesn't exist in the
objective world around you.

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.000
It is a subjective
reality that your brain

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.030
creates for you
inside your head,

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:07.300
and only inside your head.

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:09.170
The best way that
I can explain this

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:11.720
is that there is a
condition called amusia.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.450
This means no music.

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:15.620
People who have
amusia tend to be

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.831
perfectly intelligent
in every other capacity.

00:33:17.831 --> 00:33:19.580
There is nothing wrong
with their hearing.

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:23.230
They just don't hear the
same composition of harmonies

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:24.880
that most other people hear.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.580
And it's very, very common.

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.930
In fact, 4% of the
human population

00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:31.410
appears to not hear music.

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:34.190
There's about a dozen
different forms.

00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:36.690
Some people can hear timbre,
but they can't perceive rhythm.

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:39.410
Some people can perceive rhythm,
but they can't perceive timbre.

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:41.980
If you think that you
may have some inability

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:44.970
to perceive music in the
way that other people do,

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:47.780
you can take an online test
from scientists at McGill

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:48.520
who study this.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.000
They've studied this
for a very long time.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.740
And there are some
famous people who

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:55.554
seem to have had amusia,
including Che Guevara.

00:33:55.554 --> 00:33:58.680
Now in the rest of
us, what's going on

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.030
to create the
perception of music?

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:04.380
For people who have amusia,
it tends to sound like noise.

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:08.150
It sounds like unstructured,
just bothersome noises.

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:10.420
But in the rest of us
our brains do something

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:12.510
to create the
perception of color,

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:14.730
and emotion, and meaning.

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:15.389
Why is that?

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:18.000
Because, it's a
cliche, but it's true.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.130
The most complicated
thing in the universe

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:21.317
is inside your head.

00:34:21.317 --> 00:34:23.150
It's not even any
computer in this building,

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:25.449
no matter how great you
might imagine them to be.

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:28.022
It's not as great as
what's inside your head.

00:34:28.022 --> 00:34:29.480
There are more
possible connections

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.960
between the neurons in
your head than there

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.210
are atoms in the universe.

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:35.340
And it's an oft repeated
figure, but it's true.

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:38.870
Now scientists used to
think that music was just

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:40.520
a byproduct of language.

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.230
They just thought that
language was the key thing that

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:45.370
made the human brain
special and that music

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:47.285
was basically sonic junk food.

00:34:47.285 --> 00:34:49.159
That it just took
advantage of the structures

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:53.620
in your head that were built for
grammar, patterns, repetition.

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.800
Steven Pinker, a very
famous neuroscientist,

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.760
said in the 1980s that
music was only, quote,

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.420
"auditory cheesecake.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:04.000
What benefit could there be
to diverting time and energy

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.130
to making plinking noises.

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:09.530
As far as biological cause
and effect are concerned,

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:12.430
music is useless."

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:17.370
To quote Vesalius, "useless."

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:20.460
A French scientist went
even further, Dan Sperber.

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:25.140
He called it an evolutionary
parasite, a parasite.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:27.730
OK, let's look at
this logically.

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:30.070
Yes, when you look
in the brain and what

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:31.520
happens when you
listen to music,

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.650
or when you speak,
or read, there

00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:35.900
are some structures that
are shared in common

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.290
but not all of them.

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:38.420
They overlap.

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:42.670
And you can have amusia and
still perceive language.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:45.460
But you can also fail
to perceive language

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.190
in what is called aphasia.

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:50.380
Say if you have a stroke and
you can still perceive music.

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:52.160
The most famous
example is this guy.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:55.370
Vissarion Shebalin was a
composer who had a stroke.

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:57.000
He lost the ability to speak.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.030
But he could still compose
symphonies, not just

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:02.030
melodies, entire symphonies.

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:06.790
And he spoke to his wife through
music for about 15 years.

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:10.230
Now other things in the
realm of neuroscience

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:11.790
can teach us about music.

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:14.240
When neuroscientists
finally looked at the brain,

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.120
and when you listen
to music, they

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:19.390
found that there isn't just
one spot in the brain that

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:20.360
responds to music.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.620
It seems to involve
every single component

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:25.970
of your brain, the new stuff at
the front-- the frontal cortex,

00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:29.410
ancient things at the back-- the
cerebellum, bits on the side,

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:32.380
deep inside, ancient structures
associated with memory,

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.030
with emotion.

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:37.740
Front to back, top to bottom,
left to right, everything, more

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:41.150
parts of your brain than
any other human activity.

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:43.030
And this is why
it is an illusion.

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.530
That's why.

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:46.350
This is this magical thing
that happens inside your head.

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:48.960
This is unique perception.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.230
It even engages
parts of your brain

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:53.570
at the very back, ancient
parts of your brain,

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:55.510
including your
spinal cord, which

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:59.000
is not stimulated by a spoken
language or random noises.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.590
But it is stimulated by music.

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:04.320
Moreover, coming back
to our friends drugs,

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.100
music can produce
releases of endorphins

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:10.440
and dopamine inside your
brain in the same way

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:14.410
that marijuana, sex, and
cocaine and heroin can.

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:16.220
You do not need any drugs.

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:17.740
All you need is your iPod.

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:19.469
It is an auditory sex toy.

00:37:19.469 --> 00:37:21.010
And Apple might want
to phase it out,

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:23.220
but I still think it's the best.

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:26.350
And this is my favorite little
tidbit from neuroscience.

00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:30.240
Music makes every neuron in
your head pulse in synchrony.

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.980
Nothing else does
this to your brain

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.930
as far as we know,
absolutely nothing.

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:38.620
And when they discovered this,
they called it a wow moment.

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:41.800
Moreover, every single
human culture makes music.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:45.230
Not every single human culture
has the number zero, writing,

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:48.890
architecture, agriculture,
stratified social structures.

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:52.070
Every single human culture
in the world makes music.

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:54.720
It is so ancient, some
of the oldest artifacts

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.480
that we have ever found have
been musical instruments.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:00.060
This is a 40,000 year old flute.

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.530
And it's a flute.

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:02.900
This was found in Slovenia.

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.630
It's made from the
bone of a bear.

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:06.880
So imagine how much
further back in time

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.550
we were making drums
or just singing.

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:11.530
Moreover, as I'm
sure most of you who

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:14.520
have kids, or have spent
time with kids, can attest,

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.150
babies love music.

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:17.810
There is a language
called motherese

00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:19.966
that's found in every
single culture in the world.

00:38:19.966 --> 00:38:21.340
When people speak
to their babies

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:24.010
in a lilting sing-song
fashion, every single culture

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:25.472
in the world does this.

00:38:25.472 --> 00:38:27.930
And we know that kids love
music and that they learn things

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:30.380
better through music,
such as the ABC song.

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:31.970
This, by the way,
is a photograph

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:35.270
of my brother at about
two and 1/2 years old.

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:36.350
He also works for Google.

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:37.170
He's in Toronto.

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:39.510
If you guys use Twitter
or Google+ or anything,

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:40.570
Ben Cormier.

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:42.750
I love that photo.

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:46.230
Now, who here knows the
phrase retail therapy?

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:48.130
I think it's one of
the ickiest pairings

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:49.280
in the English language.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:52.410
Buy stuff you don't
need to feel better.

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:55.680
Music therapy though,
using music as medicine--

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.860
and I'm not just talking about
hippie dippie using music

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:01.640
to feel better in some sort
of wishy-washy fashion--

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.950
I'm talking about real,
double-blind constructed

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:07.040
scientific studies where they're
looking at using music to help

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:10.130
real human conditions, such
as Parkinson's, helping people

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:13.360
with their tremors, helping
people with memory problems,

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.110
Alzheimer's.

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:17.040
In the same way that kids
learn to speak using music,

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:20.390
we can help people who have
lost language with music.

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:22.070
We can help people
regain the ability

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:24.720
to speak and read better
if it's aided with music

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.340
than by language alone.

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:29.410
So obviously it has
some deep roots.

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:33.550
How might music have
evolved in the first place?

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:35.800
Could it have an
adaptive benefit?

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.790
Could it have been selected for?

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:41.460
What's the most obvious answer?

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:42.680
Come on, it's a gimme.

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:46.910
The most obvious answer, sex.

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:48.380
Darwin thought so.

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:51.220
"I conclude that musical
notes and rhythm were first

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:54.360
acquired by the male or
female progenitors of mankind

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:58.330
for the sake of charming
the opposite sex," Darwin.

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:00.780
What is the less obvious answer?

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:04.020
Social bonding, using music to
communicate with other people.

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:07.170
In most cultures, music
is not a spectator sport.

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:09.440
It's something that you
do with other people

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.870
together as a communal activity.

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:13.400
And we have found
that when people

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.470
sing in choirs, when
they sing together,

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:20.030
it produces the release of
a hormone called oxytocin.

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:21.750
It's also known as
the trust hormone

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:23.860
that's involved
in breastfeeding,

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:25.450
and released by orgasm.

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:29.210
And it's released when you
sing with other people.

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:31.485
Now if we weren't able to
bond with other people,

00:40:31.485 --> 00:40:33.860
and most importantly, to keep
a rhythm with other people,

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:35.750
we couldn't have done
things like this.

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:37.726
We wouldn't be able to
lift giant structures.

00:40:37.726 --> 00:40:39.600
We wouldn't be able to
coordinate our efforts

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.420
and build monumental
architecture

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:44.010
in the pre-industrial age
if it wasn't for the fact

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:45.700
that we can keep a beat.

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:47.570
Obviously you need
10,000 slaves too.

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:50.890
But being able to do this all
at once, heave ho, heave ho.

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:52.400
If we didn't have
music, we couldn't

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.380
have built the pyramids.

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:57.470
So could we have formed
large complex societies

00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:58.830
without music?

00:40:58.830 --> 00:41:02.060
Could music predate language
as a form of communication?

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:05.730
Would we ever have evolved
language without music?

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:08.890
Would we be human without music?

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:12.780
Last question, do
animals make music?

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.810
If animal could make
music, what kind of music

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:18.140
would animal make?

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:20.090
Animal beat drum!

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:23.400
No one ever gets that.

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:26.880
Some real scientists decided
to investigate this question.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:30.160
Do marmosets like music?

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.500
Obviously birds
and whales, animals

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:36.090
that use vocal
communication, they

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:38.120
enjoy some forms of
sonic composition.

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.990
But the question remains, do
primates, do other primates,

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:41.990
like music?

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:44.600
So, a guy named
Josh McDermott, who

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.160
was a club DJ, who then
became a neuroscientist,

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:49.920
decided to investigate
this in a serious fashion.

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.250
And he made a little
multi-room rave.

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:54.720
And he had different
speakers at different ends

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:57.760
of this little rave playing
different kinds of music,

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:02.216
classical, grunge, techno,
jazz, anything you want.

00:42:02.216 --> 00:42:04.090
What kind of music do
you think the marmosets

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:07.490
preferred, depending on
where they went in the maze?

00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:09.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:11.452
ZOE CORMIER: Jungle?

00:42:11.452 --> 00:42:14.200
No, the answer is silence.

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.240
The answer is silence.

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:17.790
No matter what, they
always preferred silence.

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:21.080
So he concluded that
marmosets don't like music.

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.620
Clearly we're the only
primate that does.

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:25.040
Other scientists
have said, well,

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.260
clearly songbirds like music.

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:28.330
--whales, blah blah blah.

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:30.290
It becomes a big
semantic argument.

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:31.670
What constitutes music?

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:32.380
Blah blah blah.

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:34.590
One scientist decided to
draw a line in the sand.

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:37.850
And he said, OK, lots of
animals have very interesting

00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:38.850
sonic compositions.

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:40.830
But only we can keep a beat.

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:42.313
Only humans can do this.

00:42:42.313 --> 00:42:43.200
[RHYTHMIC CLAPPING]

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:47.040
And when he said this, he
got a flurry of angry emails.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.280
The internet unleashed its rage.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.960
No, no no, my dog loves
Snoop Dogg, na na na.

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:54.460
My cat loves the Pussycat
Dolls, na na na na.

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:56.460
He said fine, fine, fine.

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:59.470
If you have a pet, and you
think your pet can keep a beat.

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:02.830
And you live within 200
miles of the San Diego area.

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:04.110
I will pay for your travel.

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:05.680
You can come to my lab.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.144
And I will test it.

00:43:07.144 --> 00:43:08.810
And you've probably
seen this because it

00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:12.630
has been viewed umpteen
million times on YouTube.

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:13.920
This is Snowball.

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.500
But he kept a beat
so accurately,

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.710
this was written up in a
scientific paper published

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:25.460
in 2009 in the "Annals of the
New York Academy of Sciences,"

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:29.150
the world's first animal
shown to keep a beat.

00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:32.560
If you like this, you can
see videos of Snowball

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:34.980
rocking out to "Thriller,"
by Michael Jackson,

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:36.910
and the Backstreet Boys.

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:39.920
And when they took the music and
slowed it down and sped it up,

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.260
he could still keep a beat.

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:43.090
He wasn't just
following his owner.

00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:45.760
And this was a scientific
first, because of the fury

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.570
of the internet.

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:50.155
Now, just because
Snowball can keep

00:43:50.155 --> 00:43:52.280
a beat doesn't mean that
all birds can keep a beat.

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.080
He's a pet and he's
been habituated

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.950
to his owner's habits.

00:43:55.950 --> 00:44:00.860
But what we do know is that,
among primates, we are alone.

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:03.160
We are the musical monkey.

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.590
We are also the
druggiest monkey.

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:08.000
And we are certainly
a randy monkey.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.270
As I said, we always think about
our higher cognitive capacities

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:13.310
as to being the key to
what makes us human.

00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:15.560
And we denigrate
these three activities

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.470
as being basic, and
primitive, and unimportant.

00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:20.150
But in fact, the more
you look at them,

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:22.572
the more you realize that they
are spectacular components

00:44:22.572 --> 00:44:23.530
of the human condition.

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:26.480
Yes, other animals get high,
and rut, and make noise.

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.720
But we have taken all
three to the next level.

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:32.160
And we wouldn't be human
if it wasn't for them.

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.930
And moreover, being
naughty has led

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:36.840
to some of science's most
important discoveries.

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:40.510
There is redemptive value
in being rebellious.

00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:43.640
Hedonistic impulses have
informed our highest pursuits.

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:46.060
And there is nothing
wrong with having fun.

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:48.110
Don't ever let anyone
tell you otherwise.

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:49.380
Thank you.

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:55.887
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:55.887 --> 00:44:57.970
MALE SPEAKER: We have a
few minutes for questions.

00:44:57.970 --> 00:45:02.850
So please raise your hands
and wait for the microphone.

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:03.664
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:03.664 --> 00:45:04.330
ZOE CORMIER: Hi.

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:05.330
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the talk.

00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:05.955
It was awesome.

00:45:05.955 --> 00:45:09.330
My name is Edyta
and I wanted to ask,

00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:11.490
what happens when
we imagine music?

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:16.455
So you were talking
about [INAUDIBLE] can

00:45:16.455 --> 00:45:18.580
amusic people imagine music?

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:20.580
ZOE CORMIER: Yes, that's
a really good question.

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:23.460
They have found that when you
sit inside a brain scanner,

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:25.220
the pattern of activity
inside your brain

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.370
when you imagine listening
to a particular song

00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:30.690
is pretty much identical to what
happens as to when you actually

00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:31.852
hear that song.

00:45:31.852 --> 00:45:33.810
So you can just make the
music inside your head

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:34.559
whenever you want.

00:45:34.559 --> 00:45:35.550
It looks the same.

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:37.850
As for amusia, as
I said, there's

00:45:37.850 --> 00:45:39.030
a dozen different forms.

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:42.875
And most people who have amusia,
they just find music confusing.

00:45:42.875 --> 00:45:45.500
And they don't really understand
what it is that the rest of us

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:46.800
like.

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.770
It depends on the
different kind you have.

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:50.770
As I said, there's a
dozen different kinds,

00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:51.990
because there's different
bits of your brain

00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:53.410
that could be malfunctioning.

00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:54.870
And there have been
cases of people

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:58.100
who have trained themselves
to perceive music differently.

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:00.430
And some people who don't
perceive timbre, for example.

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:03.140
They still enjoy rhythm.

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:06.660
So if you have
that, go to a rave.

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:08.690
My pleasure.

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:11.678
AUDIENCE: I was wondering,
given how great, obviously,

00:46:11.678 --> 00:46:14.975
sex and drug are, what do you
attribute their social stigmas?

00:46:14.975 --> 00:46:16.350
ZOE CORMIER: --the
social stigma.

00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:17.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:22.410
ZOE CORMIER: That's
a very good--

00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:26.660
that's the question I was forced
to think about an awful lot.

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:27.910
I could quote my mother again.

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:29.930
She said, to the
authorities, sometimes just

00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:31.971
the thought of somebody
else somewhere having fun

00:46:31.971 --> 00:46:34.400
is just intolerable.

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:37.181
Sex, I mean there are some
biological reasons why

00:46:37.181 --> 00:46:38.180
sex would have a stigma.

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:39.225
Because it is dangerous.

00:46:39.225 --> 00:46:40.350
And it does spread disease.

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:42.641
Or it does break your heart
and it is a touchy subject.

00:46:42.641 --> 00:46:45.470
It's not easy to see other
people doing it all the time.

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:46.830
I mean, I hated researching sex.

00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:47.746
I absolutely hated it.

00:46:47.746 --> 00:46:49.670
I hated reading
about it constantly

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:53.520
when I was sitting at
home, dead sober by myself.

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:55.830
As for drugs, again,
there's a realistic reason

00:46:55.830 --> 00:46:58.674
why it might have a stigma.

00:46:58.674 --> 00:46:59.840
Because it can be dangerous.

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:01.120
But your guess is
as good as mine.

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:02.204
I mean, what do you think?

00:47:02.204 --> 00:47:03.828
That's not really a
scientific question

00:47:03.828 --> 00:47:04.910
as it is a political one.

00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:05.451
I don't know.

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:08.972
I don't know.

00:47:12.828 --> 00:47:15.520
AUDIENCE: My question is sort
of connected with that one.

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:17.264
Can you talk a little
bit about-- I'm

00:47:17.264 --> 00:47:18.830
sorry this is a
very broad question.

00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:21.330
Can you talk a little
bit about the connection

00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:23.693
between the science of drugs
and the criminalization

00:47:23.693 --> 00:47:25.234
and the more recent
decriminalization

00:47:25.234 --> 00:47:26.531
of some drugs.

00:47:26.531 --> 00:47:27.530
ZOE CORMIER: Yeah, sure.

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:30.870
It's completely
nonsensical, and it's silly.

00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:32.840
I mean, the war on drugs
has obviously failed.

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:35.110
Everybody knows
that it's failed.

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:37.590
And the scientific basis
for what drugs are illegal

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:40.120
and what drugs are not
illegal is not very sound.

00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:42.757
And the psychoactive
substances bill is ridiculous.

00:47:42.757 --> 00:47:44.590
I'm not sure if many
of you know about this,

00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:46.965
but the bill that they're
putting through where they want

00:47:46.965 --> 00:47:50.320
to make all legal highs,
except for tea, coffee,

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.460
and alcohol, and tobacco.

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:54.260
That's the only
handful of things

00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:55.718
that they're saying
that you should

00:47:55.718 --> 00:47:58.500
be able to buy over the counter
in any way, shape, or form.

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.370
Technically, that would prohibit
you from smelling a rose.

00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:03.000
Technically it
would-- there have

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.666
been lawyers who have
written about this

00:48:04.666 --> 00:48:07.030
in terms of the
neurological effects you

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:09.960
get from other things
that produce pleasure.

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:12.320
As to why they want to
clamp down on these things

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:14.580
and why-- I mean, I understand
why they want to do it.

00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:17.420
Because they don't like the idea
of kids doing drugs in fields

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:18.840
unattended.

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:22.120
Why they think they'll be
successful is beyond me.

00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:23.870
There's no way that
this is going to work.

00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:25.231
Prohibition has never worked.

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.455
MALE SPEAKER: Any
more questions?

00:48:34.305 --> 00:48:37.202
In that case, please
join me in thanking Zoe.

00:48:37.202 --> 00:48:38.160
ZOE CORMIER: Thank you.

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.710
