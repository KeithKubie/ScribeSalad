no way that I could ever get a DARPA
 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.909
no way that I could ever get a DARPA
grant and especially not after some of

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919
grant and especially not after some of
 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.290
grant and especially not after some of
my more recent work that you'll be

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300
my more recent work that you'll be
 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.300
my more recent work that you'll be
seeing later so I thought that was

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310
seeing later so I thought that was
 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.409
seeing later so I thought that was
really funny and of course I've never

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419
really funny and of course I've never
 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.950
really funny and of course I've never
had to express my my ideas in a way

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960
had to express my my ideas in a way
 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.020
had to express my my ideas in a way
like this and like so for instance this

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030
like this and like so for instance this
 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.260
like this and like so for instance this
this is the impact quadrant those are

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270
this is the impact quadrant those are
 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.909
this is the impact quadrant those are
the the new ideas and I was told by

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919
the the new ideas and I was told by
 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.770
the the new ideas and I was told by
Professor Joe Jacobson he does really

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780
Professor Joe Jacobson he does really
 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.659
Professor Joe Jacobson he does really
amazing work he he does for instance

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669
amazing work he he does for instance
 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.100
amazing work he he does for instance
these like little collars that you can

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110
these like little collars that you can
 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.749
these like little collars that you can
fit around your RNA to keep them from

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759
fit around your RNA to keep them from
 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:50.460
fit around your RNA to keep them from
producing protein unless you press a

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470
producing protein unless you press a
 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.749
producing protein unless you press a
button in your pocket that's like a

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759
button in your pocket that's like a
 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.790
button in your pocket that's like a
garage door opener in which case the the

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800
garage door opener in which case the the
 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.050
garage door opener in which case the the
collars get bigger and suddenly the

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060
collars get bigger and suddenly the
 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.909
collars get bigger and suddenly the
proteins can be created so he's doing

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919
proteins can be created so he's doing
 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.700
proteins can be created so he's doing
really amazing stuff you know but but so

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710
really amazing stuff you know but but so
 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.860
really amazing stuff you know but but so
he said you have to have at least three

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870
he said you have to have at least three
 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.529
he said you have to have at least three
completely new ideas and I was like well

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539
completely new ideas and I was like well
 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:06.629
completely new ideas and I was like well
you know Joe I mean my education I I

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639
you know Joe I mean my education I I
 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:07.980
you know Joe I mean my education I I
kind of tend to believe that there are

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990
kind of tend to believe that there are
 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.379
kind of tend to believe that there are
no completely new ideas you know but

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389
no completely new ideas you know but
 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.390
no completely new ideas you know but
rather that there's you know his history

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400
rather that there's you know his history
 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.360
rather that there's you know his history
and and you know culture that that helps

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370
and and you know culture that that helps
 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.400
and and you know culture that that helps
determine new ideas and and that these

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410
determine new ideas and and that these
 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.749
determine new ideas and and that these
things are kind of you know I can't

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759
things are kind of you know I can't
 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:20.010
things are kind of you know I can't
really pull those out and he was like no

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020
really pull those out and he was like no
 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.960
really pull those out and he was like no
no they have to be completely new ideas

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970
no they have to be completely new ideas
 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.909
no they have to be completely new ideas
and then later like I had done some

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919
and then later like I had done some
 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:25.589
and then later like I had done some
stuff down here and and he said oh

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599
stuff down here and and he said oh
 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:26.640
stuff down here and and he said oh
that's not good that's the

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650
that's not good that's the
 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.409
that's not good that's the
quantification you know the impacts they

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419
quantification you know the impacts they
 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.210
quantification you know the impacts they
have to be quantifiable you have to make

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220
have to be quantifiable you have to make
 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.310
have to be quantifiable you have to make
DARPA promise about quantification that

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320
DARPA promise about quantification that
 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.960
DARPA promise about quantification that
you meet and I was like I don't know I

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970
you meet and I was like I don't know I
 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.490
you meet and I was like I don't know I
don't know any artists who quantify

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500
don't know any artists who quantify
 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.809
don't know any artists who quantify
their work that way you know I just

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:36.819
their work that way you know I just
 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:38.279
their work that way you know I just
think it was like no has to be

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289
think it was like no has to be
 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.469
think it was like no has to be
quantified so this is what I came up

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479
quantified so this is what I came up
 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:43.350
quantified so this is what I came up
with you know there are no completely

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360
with you know there are no completely
 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.960
with you know there are no completely
new ideas technology is power we're

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970
new ideas technology is power we're
 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.270
new ideas technology is power we're
researching who uses technology and for

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280
researching who uses technology and for
 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.490
researching who uses technology and for
what what is that missing and of course

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500
what what is that missing and of course
 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.050
what what is that missing and of course
you know I promise to make the world

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060
you know I promise to make the world
 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.999
you know I promise to make the world
120% safer so so that's that's actually

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:57.009
120% safer so so that's that's actually
 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:58.439
120% safer so so that's that's actually
yeah that's yeah I guess that's a pretty

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449
yeah that's yeah I guess that's a pretty
 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:00.330
yeah that's yeah I guess that's a pretty
good description of the goal of our

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340
good description of the goal of our
 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.249
good description of the goal of our
research is to make the world about a

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:02.259
research is to make the world about a
 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:06.360
research is to make the world about a
hundred twenty percent safer I'm I'll

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370
hundred twenty percent safer I'm I'll
 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.689
hundred twenty percent safer I'm I'll
show this is kind of one of the I've

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:09.699
show this is kind of one of the I've
 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:12.360
show this is kind of one of the I've
done lectures of small sections of my

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370
done lectures of small sections of my
 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.909
done lectures of small sections of my
work in New York before but never at

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919
work in New York before but never at
 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.820
work in New York before but never at
Columbia and I've never shown some of my

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830
Columbia and I've never shown some of my
 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.740
Columbia and I've never shown some of my
earlier work so I'm going to go back to

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750
earlier work so I'm going to go back to
 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.209
earlier work so I'm going to go back to
about 1992 and show some of the stuff

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:24.219
about 1992 and show some of the stuff
 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:25.770
about 1992 and show some of the stuff
that I've been doing but basically you

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780
that I've been doing but basically you
 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:26.999
that I've been doing but basically you
know right now my research group

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:27.009
know right now my research group
 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:29.640
know right now my research group
computing culture is a research group

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650
computing culture is a research group
 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.740
computing culture is a research group
where we're looking at two areas of

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750
where we're looking at two areas of
 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.110
where we're looking at two areas of
Technology and we're looking

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120
Technology and we're looking
 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.760
Technology and we're looking
specifically through the focus of what

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770
specifically through the focus of what
 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.339
specifically through the focus of what
what are science and engineering

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:38.349
what are science and engineering
 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:39.870
what are science and engineering
you know there's there's a lot of really

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880
you know there's there's a lot of really
 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.089
you know there's there's a lot of really
phenomenal empirical work a lot of

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:42.099
phenomenal empirical work a lot of
 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:43.589
phenomenal empirical work a lot of
really great ethnography of science

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599
really great ethnography of science
 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:45.450
really great ethnography of science
right now that are showing that the

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460
right now that are showing that the
 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.219
right now that are showing that the
traditional stories that scientists have

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:47.229
traditional stories that scientists have
 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:48.629
traditional stories that scientists have
told people about their work

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639
told people about their work
 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:50.520
told people about their work
or that philosophers of science for

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:50.530
or that philosophers of science for
 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.649
or that philosophers of science for
instance have have told people about the

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:52.659
instance have have told people about the
 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:54.270
instance have have told people about the
work of science are a little bit

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.280
work of science are a little bit
 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.480
work of science are a little bit
misleading they they tend to they tend

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.490
misleading they they tend to they tend
 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.369
misleading they they tend to they tend
to be over simplifications and and you

00:06:59.369 --> 00:06:59.379
to be over simplifications and and you
 

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:01.379
to be over simplifications and and you
know part of the two cultures debate

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:01.389
know part of the two cultures debate
 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:03.089
know part of the two cultures debate
between humanities and Sciences that

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:03.099
between humanities and Sciences that
 

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:05.129
between humanities and Sciences that
those two areas really aren't speaking

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:05.139
those two areas really aren't speaking
 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:07.260
those two areas really aren't speaking
so you have scientific explanation of

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:07.270
so you have scientific explanation of
 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.019
so you have scientific explanation of
how science gets done you have sort of

00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:10.029
how science gets done you have sort of
 

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:12.869
how science gets done you have sort of
kuhnian models or philosophy of science

00:07:12.869 --> 00:07:12.879
kuhnian models or philosophy of science
 

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:15.149
kuhnian models or philosophy of science
on the other side since the late 1970s

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:15.159
on the other side since the late 1970s
 

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:16.559
on the other side since the late 1970s
there have been some people from the

00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:16.569
there have been some people from the
 

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:18.059
there have been some people from the
humanity side who have been doing really

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:18.069
humanity side who have been doing really
 

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:20.129
humanity side who have been doing really
exhaustive ethnographies of science and

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:20.139
exhaustive ethnographies of science and
 

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:22.499
exhaustive ethnographies of science and
that's a you know alternately called

00:07:22.499 --> 00:07:22.509
that's a you know alternately called
 

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:24.570
that's a you know alternately called
science and technology studies or more

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:24.580
science and technology studies or more
 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.640
science and technology studies or more
specifically sociology of scientific

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:26.650
specifically sociology of scientific
 

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.050
specifically sociology of scientific
knowledge and these are these are fields

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:28.060
knowledge and these are these are fields
 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.540
knowledge and these are these are fields
to which I've gone to to try to

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:30.550
to which I've gone to to try to
 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:31.920
to which I've gone to to try to
understand a little bit about how

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:31.930
understand a little bit about how
 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.559
understand a little bit about how
science and engineering operate and you

00:07:34.559 --> 00:07:34.569
science and engineering operate and you
 

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:36.330
science and engineering operate and you
know what what becomes really clear is

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:36.340
know what what becomes really clear is
 

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.550
know what what becomes really clear is
that through the process of Education

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560
that through the process of Education
 

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.959
that through the process of Education
and engineering schools and then

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:39.969
and engineering schools and then
 

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:42.269
and engineering schools and then
graduate degrees or companies that

00:07:42.269 --> 00:07:42.279
graduate degrees or companies that
 

00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:44.339
graduate degrees or companies that
engineers work in it's a process of

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:44.349
engineers work in it's a process of
 

00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:47.189
engineers work in it's a process of
socialization people like Susan Lee Star

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199
socialization people like Susan Lee Star
 

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:48.989
socialization people like Susan Lee Star
and others have have pointed out that

00:07:48.989 --> 00:07:48.999
and others have have pointed out that
 

00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:52.050
and others have have pointed out that
that process of socialization leads to a

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:52.060
that process of socialization leads to a
 

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.360
that process of socialization leads to a
kind of an idea of the world and idea of

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:54.370
kind of an idea of the world and idea of
 

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.040
kind of an idea of the world and idea of
what's an interesting problem to solve

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:56.050
what's an interesting problem to solve
 

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.529
what's an interesting problem to solve
and so scientists and engineers just

00:07:58.529 --> 00:07:58.539
and so scientists and engineers just
 

00:07:58.539 --> 00:08:00.300
and so scientists and engineers just
like artists go through this kind of

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:00.310
like artists go through this kind of
 

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.640
like artists go through this kind of
socialization process and are more more

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:02.650
socialization process and are more more
 

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.950
socialization process and are more more
likely to be solving particular kinds of

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960
likely to be solving particular kinds of
 

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.619
likely to be solving particular kinds of
areas building technologies to look at

00:08:07.619 --> 00:08:07.629
areas building technologies to look at
 

00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:11.279
areas building technologies to look at
particular kinds of ideas an example is

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:11.289
particular kinds of ideas an example is
 

00:08:11.289 --> 00:08:12.959
particular kinds of ideas an example is
that many many artists work with ideas

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:12.969
that many many artists work with ideas
 

00:08:12.969 --> 00:08:14.879
that many many artists work with ideas
of surveillance because they're obsessed

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:14.889
of surveillance because they're obsessed
 

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:16.409
of surveillance because they're obsessed
with you know Foucault and ideas of

00:08:16.409 --> 00:08:16.419
with you know Foucault and ideas of
 

00:08:16.419 --> 00:08:18.719
with you know Foucault and ideas of
social control technologists aren't

00:08:18.719 --> 00:08:18.729
social control technologists aren't
 

00:08:18.729 --> 00:08:20.339
social control technologists aren't
typically they really don't care that

00:08:20.339 --> 00:08:20.349
typically they really don't care that
 

00:08:20.349 --> 00:08:22.980
typically they really don't care that
much about surveillance so for them it's

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:22.990
much about surveillance so for them it's
 

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.809
much about surveillance so for them it's
the work fails both on kind of its

00:08:24.809 --> 00:08:24.819
the work fails both on kind of its
 

00:08:24.819 --> 00:08:26.999
the work fails both on kind of its
rhetorical level but also on the idea of

00:08:26.999 --> 00:08:27.009
rhetorical level but also on the idea of
 

00:08:27.009 --> 00:08:29.790
rhetorical level but also on the idea of
what's even important in it so when you

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:29.800
what's even important in it so when you
 

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.929
what's even important in it so when you
see people who are working on

00:08:30.929 --> 00:08:30.939
see people who are working on
 

00:08:30.939 --> 00:08:33.269
see people who are working on
surveillance technologies typically they

00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279
surveillance technologies typically they
 

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:35.279
surveillance technologies typically they
don't find surveillance spooky you know

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:35.289
don't find surveillance spooky you know
 

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:36.870
don't find surveillance spooky you know
they don't they don't find it unsettling

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:36.880
they don't they don't find it unsettling
 

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.459
they don't they don't find it unsettling
they don't really mind the idea of

00:08:38.459 --> 00:08:38.469
they don't really mind the idea of
 

00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:41.550
they don't really mind the idea of
social control and so so this is kind of

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:41.560
social control and so so this is kind of
 

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.259
social control and so so this is kind of
the schism that right now in our culture

00:08:43.259 --> 00:08:43.269
the schism that right now in our culture
 

00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:46.350
the schism that right now in our culture
we have you know a couple of classes of

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:46.360
we have you know a couple of classes of

certain ways scientists and engineers
 

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.519
certain ways scientists and engineers

computing culture group is to to go back
 

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.390
computing culture group is to to go back
and try to understand what is the

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:24.400
and try to understand what is the
 

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.710
and try to understand what is the
subculture of science and engineering

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:25.720
subculture of science and engineering
 

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.370
subculture of science and engineering
and what technologies are they not

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:29.380
and what technologies are they not
 

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.350
and what technologies are they not
building just because they wouldn't find

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360
building just because they wouldn't find
 

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.000
building just because they wouldn't find
them interesting and then we try to go

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.010
them interesting and then we try to go
 

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:34.920
them interesting and then we try to go
ahead and build those technologies so

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:34.930
ahead and build those technologies so
 

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:36.510
ahead and build those technologies so
we're not really you know building

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:36.520
we're not really you know building
 

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.430
we're not really you know building
technologies so much for expression

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:38.440
technologies so much for expression
 

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.470
technologies so much for expression
although that's an important point we're

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480
although that's an important point we're
 

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.300
although that's an important point we're
not building them to make a point

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:42.310
not building them to make a point
 

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:44.070
not building them to make a point
although that is of course very

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:44.080
although that is of course very
 

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.870
although that is of course very
important all of our technologies do

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:45.880
important all of our technologies do
 

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.520
important all of our technologies do
operate on some kind of rhetorical level

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:47.530
operate on some kind of rhetorical level
 

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.770
operate on some kind of rhetorical level
but more importantly we're building

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:49.780
but more importantly we're building
 

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.930
but more importantly we're building
technologies that actually work as you

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:51.940
technologies that actually work as you
 

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.810

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.700
know proofs of concept as prototypes for
a world that we would rather be kind of

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:56.710
a world that we would rather be kind of
 

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.220
a world that we would rather be kind of
living in or as you'll see for a world

00:09:59.220 --> 00:09:59.230
living in or as you'll see for a world
 

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:00.570

that we would absolutely not want to be
 

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.090
that we would absolutely not want to be
living in so so we kind of go in both

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:03.100
living in so so we kind of go in both
 

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.070
living in so so we kind of go in both

which is yeah but if we keep building

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:24.100
which is yeah but if we keep building

generation and so his point is that you
 

00:11:32.889 --> 00:11:34.259
generation and so his point is that you
have just as much status quo if you

00:11:34.259 --> 00:11:34.269
have just as much status quo if you
 

00:11:34.269 --> 00:11:35.809
have just as much status quo if you
continue to build without thinking so

00:11:35.809 --> 00:11:35.819
continue to build without thinking so

would pass that shape through a pattern

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:04.370
would pass that shape through a pattern
 

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.009
would pass that shape through a pattern
recognition system called a neural

00:14:06.009 --> 00:14:06.019
recognition system called a neural
 

00:14:06.019 --> 00:14:08.620
recognition system called a neural
network and the the pattern recognition

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:08.630
network and the the pattern recognition
 

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.110
network and the the pattern recognition
system would go and analyze whether or

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120
system would go and analyze whether or
 

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.740
system would go and analyze whether or
not the sound was a clap a slap of metal

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:14.750
not the sound was a clap a slap of metal
 

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.290
not the sound was a clap a slap of metal
together or in fact a gunshot and if it

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:17.300
together or in fact a gunshot and if it
 

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.120
together or in fact a gunshot and if it
was a gunshot then this is um the

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:19.130
was a gunshot then this is um the
 

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:20.379
was a gunshot then this is um the
inner-city option it would aim this

00:14:20.379 --> 00:14:20.389
inner-city option it would aim this
 

00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:22.540
inner-city option it would aim this
small 9-millimeter can and exactly in

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:22.550
small 9-millimeter can and exactly in
 

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:23.920
small 9-millimeter can and exactly in
the direction where the gunshot had come

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:23.930
the direction where the gunshot had come
 

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:25.540
the direction where the gunshot had come
from and then fire a bullet in that

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:25.550
from and then fire a bullet in that
 

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:27.550
from and then fire a bullet in that
direction so the idea of it was sort of

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:27.560
direction so the idea of it was sort of
 

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.129

Hammurabi's eye-for-an-eye it was a
 

00:14:29.139 --> 00:14:31.809
Hammurabi's eye-for-an-eye it was a
little technological instantiation of a

00:14:31.809 --> 00:14:31.819
little technological instantiation of a

actually getting out in public and I had

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:28.130
actually getting out in public and I had
 

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.429
actually getting out in public and I had
tried in my role as a product designer

00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:30.439
tried in my role as a product designer
 

00:15:30.439 --> 00:15:33.009

market or something like this and in
fact the the chance of that actually

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:40.550
fact the the chance of that actually
 

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.340
fact the the chance of that actually
getting out in a product where we're

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:42.350
getting out in a product where we're
 

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.630
getting out in a product where we're
really

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:42.640
really

say was smaller or lighter or you know

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440
say was smaller or lighter or you know

cost less to produce so so I began to

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:50.380
cost less to produce so so I began to
 

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:51.870
cost less to produce so so I began to
notice that both with engineering and

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:51.880
notice that both with engineering and
 

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.420
notice that both with engineering and
product design that relationship that

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:54.430

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:55.770
product design that relationship that
you're trying to do something that's

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:55.780
you're trying to do something that's
 

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.100
you're trying to do something that's
innovative and you know ethical you can

00:15:59.100 --> 00:15:59.110
innovative and you know ethical you can
 

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:01.230
innovative and you know ethical you can
do that in very small limited runs and

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:01.240
do that in very small limited runs and
 

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.300
do that in very small limited runs and
so if you're good product designer

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:03.310
so if you're good product designer
 

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:04.620
so if you're good product designer
you're actually accountable to this

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:04.630
you're actually accountable to this
 

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.390
you're actually accountable to this
whole system and so I'd actually gone

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:06.400
whole system and so I'd actually gone
 

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.890
whole system and so I'd actually gone
back to arts school because I thought

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:07.900
back to arts school because I thought
 

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.150
back to arts school because I thought
well that's the place where I can be the

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:09.160
well that's the place where I can be the
 

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.010
well that's the place where I can be the
least accountable to anyone you know

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:11.020
least accountable to anyone you know
 

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.540
least accountable to anyone you know
it's like the most irresponsible role

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:12.550
it's like the most irresponsible role
 

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:15.450
it's like the most irresponsible role
you can take in contemporary society but

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:15.460
you can take in contemporary society but
 

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.010
you can take in contemporary society but
but the problem with art school is that

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:17.020
but the problem with art school is that
 

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.600
but the problem with art school is that
there's very little technical education

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:18.610
there's very little technical education
 

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.190
there's very little technical education
so I was largely teaching myself how to

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:20.200
so I was largely teaching myself how to
 

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.860
so I was largely teaching myself how to
do machining this is it kind of looking

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:22.870
do machining this is it kind of looking
 

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:24.300
do machining this is it kind of looking
around the gallery at people walking by

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:24.310
around the gallery at people walking by
 

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:27.650
around the gallery at people walking by
they would walk really gingerly

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:27.660
they would walk really gingerly
 

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:32.070
they would walk really gingerly
so my machining is is crap you know my

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:32.080
so my machining is is crap you know my
 

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.750

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839
reports came on and it was about a
 

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:22.890
reports came on and it was about a
company Oakland you know kind of a high

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:22.900
company Oakland you know kind of a high
 

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.350
company Oakland you know kind of a high
crime area of Oakland and this company

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360
crime area of Oakland and this company
 

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.610
crime area of Oakland and this company
had been hired by the city to put up

00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:26.620
had been hired by the city to put up
 

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:28.740
had been hired by the city to put up
microphones like every city block so

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:28.750
microphones like every city block so
 

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:30.480
microphones like every city block so
that they could triangulate gunshots and

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:30.490
that they could triangulate gunshots and
 

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.670
that they could triangulate gunshots and
and I thought that was amazing it was

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:32.680
and I thought that was amazing it was
 

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.470
and I thought that was amazing it was
like you know not long after I'd had my

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480
like you know not long after I'd had my
 

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.090
like you know not long after I'd had my
idea and I thought my idea was so

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:36.100
idea and I thought my idea was so
 

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:38.400
idea and I thought my idea was so
dystopic right you know but but here

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:38.410
dystopic right you know but but here
 

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:39.450
dystopic right you know but but here
they were doing in Oakland you know the

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:39.460
they were doing in Oakland you know the
 

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.640
they were doing in Oakland you know the
one advantage of my system is in Oakland

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:41.650
one advantage of my system is in Oakland
 

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:43.380
one advantage of my system is in Oakland
they would send like you know a fat cop

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:43.390
they would send like you know a fat cop
 

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.810
they would send like you know a fat cop
out to shoot you and I thought well at

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:45.820
out to shoot you and I thought well at
 

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.130
out to shoot you and I thought well at
least I've eliminated the middleman you

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:47.140
least I've eliminated the middleman you
 

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.530
least I've eliminated the middleman you
know but but it became clear to me and

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:49.540
know but but it became clear to me and
 

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.150
know but but it became clear to me and
and Jeff machen told me this in grad

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:51.160
and Jeff machen told me this in grad
 

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.890
and Jeff machen told me this in grad
school he said you're not going to

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:52.900
school he said you're not going to
 

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.360
school he said you're not going to
produce anything stranger than what

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:54.370
produce anything stranger than what
 

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:56.169
produce anything stranger than what
science is already producing and I

00:17:56.169 --> 00:17:56.179
science is already producing and I
 

00:17:56.179 --> 00:17:57.460
science is already producing and I
realized at that point that I needed to

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:57.470
realized at that point that I needed to
 

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.259
realized at that point that I needed to
understand a lot more about science and

00:17:59.259 --> 00:17:59.269
understand a lot more about science and
 

00:17:59.269 --> 00:18:00.669
understand a lot more about science and
a lot more about kind of the history of

00:18:00.669 --> 00:18:00.679
a lot more about kind of the history of
 

00:18:00.679 --> 00:18:02.859
a lot more about kind of the history of
engineering and and you know if I wasn't

00:18:02.859 --> 00:18:02.869
engineering and and you know if I wasn't
 

00:18:02.869 --> 00:18:04.419
engineering and and you know if I wasn't
gonna have my work trumped by some

00:18:04.419 --> 00:18:04.429
gonna have my work trumped by some
 

00:18:04.429 --> 00:18:05.799
gonna have my work trumped by some
startup with a lot more money than me

00:18:05.799 --> 00:18:05.809
startup with a lot more money than me
 

00:18:05.809 --> 00:18:07.749
startup with a lot more money than me
you know often before I even get the

00:18:07.749 --> 00:18:07.759
you know often before I even get the
 

00:18:07.759 --> 00:18:09.669
you know often before I even get the
piece out I would have to understand the

00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679
piece out I would have to understand the
 

00:18:09.679 --> 00:18:11.200
piece out I would have to understand the
systems that you know I was essentially

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:11.210
systems that you know I was essentially
 

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:13.509
systems that you know I was essentially
in competition with much better so I

00:18:13.509 --> 00:18:13.519
in competition with much better so I
 

00:18:13.519 --> 00:18:15.549
in competition with much better so I
started doing historical work and um I

00:18:15.549 --> 00:18:15.559
started doing historical work and um I
 

00:18:15.559 --> 00:18:17.529
started doing historical work and um I
showed hunter hunter in Helsinki and

00:18:17.529 --> 00:18:17.539
showed hunter hunter in Helsinki and
 

00:18:17.539 --> 00:18:18.999
showed hunter hunter in Helsinki and
someone said oh you should if you're

00:18:18.999 --> 00:18:19.009
someone said oh you should if you're
 

00:18:19.009 --> 00:18:20.230
someone said oh you should if you're
interested in history of Technology you

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240
interested in history of Technology you
 

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.669
interested in history of Technology you
should really go to tahleen Estonia

00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679
should really go to tahleen Estonia
 

00:18:21.679 --> 00:18:22.989
should really go to tahleen Estonia
because there's a great medical Museum

00:18:22.989 --> 00:18:22.999
because there's a great medical Museum
 

00:18:22.999 --> 00:18:25.600
because there's a great medical Museum
there and I went and I found some you

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:25.610
there and I went and I found some you
 

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:27.190
there and I went and I found some you
know old research some old equipment

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200
know old research some old equipment
 

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.899
know old research some old equipment
from research that was phenomenal like I

00:18:28.899 --> 00:18:28.909
from research that was phenomenal like I
 

00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:33.159
from research that was phenomenal like I
just blew my mind and you know I went

00:18:33.159 --> 00:18:33.169
just blew my mind and you know I went
 

00:18:33.169 --> 00:18:35.200
just blew my mind and you know I went
back to the US and and started looking

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:35.210
back to the US and and started looking
 

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:36.489
back to the US and and started looking
at history of Technology and ended up

00:18:36.489 --> 00:18:36.499
at history of Technology and ended up
 

00:18:36.499 --> 00:18:38.739
at history of Technology and ended up
going to a couple museums and I started

00:18:38.739 --> 00:18:38.749
going to a couple museums and I started
 

00:18:38.749 --> 00:18:40.749
going to a couple museums and I started
for a couple of years doing kind of

00:18:40.749 --> 00:18:40.759
for a couple of years doing kind of
 

00:18:40.759 --> 00:18:43.749
for a couple of years doing kind of
reanimations of old experiments which

00:18:43.749 --> 00:18:43.759
reanimations of old experiments which
 

00:18:43.759 --> 00:18:45.850
reanimations of old experiments which
were sort of dried branches on the tree

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:45.860
were sort of dried branches on the tree
 

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:48.159
were sort of dried branches on the tree
of science and technology evolution so

00:18:48.159 --> 00:18:48.169
of science and technology evolution so
 

00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:50.470
of science and technology evolution so
so some area that that someone was doing

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480
so some area that that someone was doing
 

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.440
so some area that that someone was doing
really great research in but in fact

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:53.450
really great research in but in fact
 

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:56.200
really great research in but in fact
they hadn't actually gotten out in

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:56.210
they hadn't actually gotten out in
 

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.299
they hadn't actually gotten out in
contemporary science or technology other

00:18:58.299 --> 00:18:58.309
contemporary science or technology other
 

00:18:58.309 --> 00:19:00.549
contemporary science or technology other
ideas had become more ascendant so this

00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559
ideas had become more ascendant so this
 

00:19:00.559 --> 00:19:02.950
ideas had become more ascendant so this
is an example this is a technology by a

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960
is an example this is a technology by a
 

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.239
is an example this is a technology by a
group called American hydropower

00:19:04.239 --> 00:19:04.249

Institute which was a sort of a

00:19:06.539 --> 00:19:06.549
Institute which was a sort of a
 

00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:08.980
Institute which was a sort of a
consortium of hydropower companies in

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:08.990
consortium of hydropower companies in
 

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:10.930
consortium of hydropower companies in
the American Southwest and these

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:10.940
the American Southwest and these
 

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.659
the American Southwest and these
companies they were building dams the

00:19:13.659 --> 00:19:13.669
companies they were building dams the
 

00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:14.649
companies they were building dams the
problem is when you build a dam you

00:19:14.649 --> 00:19:14.659
problem is when you build a dam you
 

00:19:14.659 --> 00:19:16.600
problem is when you build a dam you
flood all the valleys behind the dam and

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:16.610
flood all the valleys behind the dam and
 

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:19.600
flood all the valleys behind the dam and
in this case the dam was going to cause

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:19.610
in this case the dam was going to cause
 

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:22.149
in this case the dam was going to cause
the extinction of a species of ant that

00:19:22.149 --> 00:19:22.159
the extinction of a species of ant that
 

00:19:22.159 --> 00:19:24.310
the extinction of a species of ant that
only lived in that part of Arizona or

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.320
only lived in that part of Arizona or
 

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.499
only lived in that part of Arizona or
Amiga Micro Nica I think was named I'm

Species Act had just been passed so

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:31.340
Species Act had just been passed so
 

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:32.799
Species Act had just been passed so
Congress was saying no you can't build

00:19:32.799 --> 00:19:32.809
Congress was saying no you can't build
 

00:19:32.809 --> 00:19:35.799
Congress was saying no you can't build
the dam so they decided well what if we

00:19:35.799 --> 00:19:35.809
the dam so they decided well what if we
 

00:19:35.809 --> 00:19:38.549
the dam so they decided well what if we
can ensure to the US government the EPA

00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559
can ensure to the US government the EPA
 

00:19:38.559 --> 00:19:40.749

which was a fairly new institution at
 

00:19:40.759 --> 00:19:41.799
which was a fairly new institution at
that point what if we can ensure that

that point what if we can ensure that
will keep the ant alive in perpetuity in

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:44.840
will keep the ant alive in perpetuity in
 

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.419
will keep the ant alive in perpetuity in
an artificial environment and you know

an artificial environment and you know
 

00:19:46.429 --> 00:19:47.649
an artificial environment and you know
the government said well you know keep

00:19:47.649 --> 00:19:47.659
the government said well you know keep

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:32.850
systems weren't very good at the time a
 

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:34.670
systems weren't very good at the time a
very simple vision system would look at

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:34.680
very simple vision system would look at
 

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.350
very simple vision system would look at
kind of the density of the ants make

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360
kind of the density of the ants make
 

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.270
kind of the density of the ants make
judgments and at this point you know in

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:38.280
judgments and at this point you know in
 

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.860
judgments and at this point you know in
the in the this was I think 1974 at this

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:42.870
the in the this was I think 1974 at this
 

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:46.010
the in the this was I think 1974 at this
point one of the the biggest ethology

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:46.020
point one of the the biggest ethology
 

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.100
point one of the the biggest ethology
sin well I mean in the 20th century guy

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:49.110
sin well I mean in the 20th century guy
 

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:51.140
sin well I mean in the 20th century guy
named Leo Wilson who is a mer mala gist

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:51.150
named Leo Wilson who is a mer mala gist
 

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:52.880
named Leo Wilson who is a mer mala gist
who study ants he had these these

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:52.890
who study ants he had these these
 

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:55.610
who study ants he had these these
equations which he said were true for

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:55.620
equations which he said were true for
 

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.080
equations which he said were true for
species no matter where they lived it

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:57.090
species no matter where they lived it
 

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:58.910
species no matter where they lived it
was a very simple one if you look at a

00:20:58.910 --> 00:20:58.920
was a very simple one if you look at a
 

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.350
was a very simple one if you look at a
European carpenter and whether it's in

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360
European carpenter and whether it's in
 

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.480
European carpenter and whether it's in
Poland or France or the Ukraine or

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:02.490
Poland or France or the Ukraine or
 

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:05.780
Poland or France or the Ukraine or
wherever they will always have the same

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:05.790
wherever they will always have the same
 

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:09.350
wherever they will always have the same
amount of caloric input to how many ants

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360
amount of caloric input to how many ants
 

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.750
amount of caloric input to how many ants
get killed so where the carpenter ant

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760
get killed so where the carpenter ant
 

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.100
get killed so where the carpenter ant
can live has to be in a microclimate

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:13.110
can live has to be in a microclimate
 

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:15.200
can live has to be in a microclimate
where the same number of kind of seeds

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:15.210
where the same number of kind of seeds
 

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:16.490
where the same number of kind of seeds
are on the ground that the ant can eat

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:16.500
are on the ground that the ant can eat
 

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.830
are on the ground that the ant can eat
in relation to the same you know the

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840
in relation to the same you know the
 

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.240
in relation to the same you know the
number of sparrows that are eating the

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:20.250
number of sparrows that are eating the
 

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.520
number of sparrows that are eating the
adds so there's this predator-prey ratio

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:22.530
adds so there's this predator-prey ratio
 

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:24.350
adds so there's this predator-prey ratio
that EO Wilson said was constant for

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:24.360
that EO Wilson said was constant for
 

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.960
that EO Wilson said was constant for
species so this was modeled in the robot

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:26.970
species so this was modeled in the robot
 

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.090
species so this was modeled in the robot
so it had you know both the technology

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:29.100
so it had you know both the technology
 

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.710
so it had you know both the technology
for shaking food out and feeding the

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720
for shaking food out and feeding the
 

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.750
for shaking food out and feeding the
ants but then it exactly the ratio that

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:32.760
ants but then it exactly the ratio that
 

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.610
ants but then it exactly the ratio that
sparrows would do it would also pair the

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:34.620
sparrows would do it would also pair the
 

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.350
sparrows would do it would also pair the
pair of the population so there was this

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360
pair of the population so there was this
 

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.580
pair of the population so there was this
very bright light up there in a

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:37.590
very bright light up there in a
 

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:39.680
very bright light up there in a
magnifying glass and it would

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:39.690
magnifying glass and it would
 

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:42.500
magnifying glass and it would
occasionally yeah pair pair of the ants

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:42.510
occasionally yeah pair pair of the ants
 

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.870
occasionally yeah pair pair of the ants
and so so this was their system and they

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880
and so so this was their system and they
 

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.300
and so so this was their system and they
built it in this great kind of a

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:47.310
built it in this great kind of a
 

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:49.880
built it in this great kind of a
geodesic structure that was you know

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:49.890
geodesic structure that was you know
 

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:53.330
geodesic structure that was you know
constantly heated and there was this

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:53.340
constantly heated and there was this
 

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.910
constantly heated and there was this
video that went along with it in which

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:55.920
video that went along with it in which
 

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.070
video that went along with it in which
these hippies are protesting outside of

00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080
these hippies are protesting outside of
 

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.720
these hippies are protesting outside of
a power plant saying you know save the

00:21:59.720 --> 00:21:59.730
a power plant saying you know save the
 

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:02.240
a power plant saying you know save the
ants down with progress sort of

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:02.250
ants down with progress sort of
 

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:03.530
ants down with progress sort of
Hollywood hippies and then this kind of

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:03.540
Hollywood hippies and then this kind of
 

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:05.360
Hollywood hippies and then this kind of
warm gray-haired industry representative

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:05.370
warm gray-haired industry representative
 

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.400
warm gray-haired industry representative
comes up and says no no no we're trying

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:07.410
comes up and says no no no we're trying
 

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:09.140
comes up and says no no no we're trying
to help the ants not not hurt them this

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:09.150
to help the ants not not hurt them this
 

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:11.780
to help the ants not not hurt them this
is a machine for living you know I wish

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:11.790
is a machine for living you know I wish
 

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.280
is a machine for living you know I wish
my mother-in-law had a place to retire

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:13.290
my mother-in-law had a place to retire
 

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:15.380
my mother-in-law had a place to retire
that was this comfortable and in the end

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:15.390
that was this comfortable and in the end
 

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:16.700
that was this comfortable and in the end
the hippies understand that you know

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:16.710
the hippies understand that you know
 

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:19.580
the hippies understand that you know
technological progress is good and the

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:19.590
technological progress is good and the
 

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:22.910
technological progress is good and the
the installation as I recreated it was

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:22.920
the installation as I recreated it was
 

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.190
the installation as I recreated it was
both both the promotional video on some

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200
both both the promotional video on some
 

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.620
both both the promotional video on some
sides and then also this kind of moving

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:27.630
sides and then also this kind of moving
 

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:29.060
sides and then also this kind of moving
interactive software that was a

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:29.070
interactive software that was a
 

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:30.560
interactive software that was a
representation of what the robot was

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:30.570
representation of what the robot was
 

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:32.570
representation of what the robot was
doing at the moment and it looks like

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:32.580
doing at the moment and it looks like
 

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:37.610
doing at the moment and it looks like
that ant is soon to go you know when

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:37.620
that ant is soon to go you know when
 

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:40.190
that ant is soon to go you know when
when I was presenting and saw this

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200
when I was presenting and saw this
 

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.320
when I was presenting and saw this
Medical Museum in tahleen Estonia I came

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:42.330
Medical Museum in tahleen Estonia I came
 

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.180
Medical Museum in tahleen Estonia I came
across this research which was really

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:44.190
across this research which was really
 

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:46.880
across this research which was really
remarkable research because it had this

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:46.890
remarkable research because it had this
 

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:48.860
remarkable research because it had this
very unique relationship to researcher

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:48.870
very unique relationship to researcher
 

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:50.030
very unique relationship to researcher
that was happening in the u.s. at the

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:50.040
that was happening in the u.s. at the
 

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:54.770
that was happening in the u.s. at the
time this is a this is an example so on

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:54.780

some experiments that were coming out of

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.080
some experiments that were coming out of
 

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.820
some experiments that were coming out of
the u.s. in in the early 1960s late

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:04.830
the u.s. in in the early 1960s late
 

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:08.750
the u.s. in in the early 1960s late
1950s this is a period in in science

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:08.760
1950s this is a period in in science
 

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.670
1950s this is a period in in science
there was a kind of a movement called

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:10.680
there was a kind of a movement called
 

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.740
there was a kind of a movement called
cybernetics how many of you are familiar

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:12.750
cybernetics how many of you are familiar
 

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:15.500
cybernetics how many of you are familiar
with cybernetics just a little yeah okay

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:15.510
with cybernetics just a little yeah okay
 

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:17.840
with cybernetics just a little yeah okay
so Norbert Wiener and a couple of other

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:17.850
so Norbert Wiener and a couple of other
 

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:21.230
so Norbert Wiener and a couple of other
people had decided that they were

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:21.240
people had decided that they were
 

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.220
people had decided that they were
building now technologies essentially

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:24.230
building now technologies essentially
 

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:26.900
building now technologies essentially
Wiener Wiener was in the army he was

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:26.910
Wiener Wiener was in the army he was
 

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:30.560
Wiener Wiener was in the army he was
working with systems to help people

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:30.570
working with systems to help people
 

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:34.850
working with systems to help people
shoot down German planes and basically

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:34.860
shoot down German planes and basically
 

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.280
shoot down German planes and basically
his his approach was that people weren't

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:37.290
his his approach was that people weren't
 

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.620
his his approach was that people weren't
smart enough to do the calculation or

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:39.630
smart enough to do the calculation or
 

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:41.440
smart enough to do the calculation or
they weren't used to doing a calculation

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:41.450
they weren't used to doing a calculation
 

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:43.850
they weren't used to doing a calculation
when you fire bullets by the time they

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:43.860
when you fire bullets by the time they
 

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.200
when you fire bullets by the time they
reached the plane the plane somewhere

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:45.210
reached the plane the plane somewhere
 

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:48.020
reached the plane the plane somewhere
else so you actually have to fire ahead

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:48.030
else so you actually have to fire ahead
 

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:49.850
else so you actually have to fire ahead
of the plane and it's it's not it's not

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:49.860
of the plane and it's it's not it's not
 

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:51.860
of the plane and it's it's not it's not
an easy thing people weren't trained on

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:51.870
an easy thing people weren't trained on
 

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:54.830
an easy thing people weren't trained on
video games at that point so so people

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:54.840
video games at that point so so people
 

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.210
video games at that point so so people
soldiers didn't know how to do it so he

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:56.220
soldiers didn't know how to do it so he
 

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.680
soldiers didn't know how to do it so he
would build mechanical systems which

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:57.690
would build mechanical systems which
 

00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:59.720
would build mechanical systems which
would watch the speed at which someone

00:23:59.720 --> 00:23:59.730
would watch the speed at which someone
 

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:02.180
would watch the speed at which someone
was following the plane guessed by that

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:02.190

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:04.130
was following the plane guessed by that
how far the plane was away and then

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:04.140
how far the plane was away and then
 

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:05.900
how far the plane was away and then
moved the gun based on that and this was

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:05.910
moved the gun based on that and this was
 

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:07.970
moved the gun based on that and this was
a system where essentially it was a

you shoot up and the connections between
 

00:25:44.809 --> 00:25:46.299
you shoot up and the connections between
the neurons are strengthened and your

you know so so they were beginning to

00:25:50.019 --> 00:25:50.029
you know so so they were beginning to
 

00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:52.330
you know so so they were beginning to
model these analog systems of neurons

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:52.340
model these analog systems of neurons
 

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:55.269
model these analog systems of neurons
and they they came up with these things

00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279
and they they came up with these things
 

00:25:55.279 --> 00:25:57.009
and they they came up with these things
called perceptrons we're now called

00:25:57.009 --> 00:25:57.019
called perceptrons we're now called
 

00:25:57.019 --> 00:25:58.560
called perceptrons we're now called
neural networks and they're essentially

00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:58.570
neural networks and they're essentially
 

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:00.909

analog little computers that can take
some input in analog input make

00:26:03.609 --> 00:26:03.619
some input in analog input make
 

00:26:03.619 --> 00:26:05.919
some input in analog input make
connections to other other ones like

connections to other other ones like
 

00:26:05.929 --> 00:26:08.019
connections to other other ones like
them and then make some kind of an

00:26:08.019 --> 00:26:08.029
them and then make some kind of an
 

00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:10.690
them and then make some kind of an
output and and Rosenblatt you can still

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:10.700
output and and Rosenblatt you can still
 

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.220

successfully reproduces the human brain

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:25.570
successfully reproduces the human brain
 

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:28.930
successfully reproduces the human brain
you know it's an amazing system and and

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:28.940
you know it's an amazing system and and
 

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.359
you know it's an amazing system and and
and what he's done with it is you know

00:26:31.359 --> 00:26:31.369
and what he's done with it is you know
 

00:26:31.369 --> 00:26:33.159
and what he's done with it is you know
reproduced our ability to recognize

00:26:33.159 --> 00:26:33.169
reproduced our ability to recognize
 

00:26:33.169 --> 00:26:35.169
reproduced our ability to recognize
gender in people that we're talking to

00:26:35.169 --> 00:26:35.179
gender in people that we're talking to
 

00:26:35.179 --> 00:26:37.269
gender in people that we're talking to
and so basically he came up with a

00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279
and so basically he came up with a
 

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:39.070
and so basically he came up with a
system that had light inputs and you

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:39.080
system that had light inputs and you
 

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.169
system that had light inputs and you
could present an image of a face to the

00:26:41.169 --> 00:26:41.179
could present an image of a face to the
 

00:26:41.179 --> 00:26:43.539
could present an image of a face to the
system and it would output whether they

00:26:43.539 --> 00:26:43.549
system and it would output whether they
 

00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:45.099
system and it would output whether they
were male or female based on the image

00:26:45.099 --> 00:26:45.109
were male or female based on the image
 

00:26:45.109 --> 00:26:46.210
were male or female based on the image
of the face and so he's doing this in

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:46.220
of the face and so he's doing this in
 

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.339
of the face and so he's doing this in
the 1950s really interesting really

00:26:48.339 --> 00:26:48.349
the 1950s really interesting really
 

00:26:48.349 --> 00:26:49.990
the 1950s really interesting really

Papert they wrote a book called

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:56.690
Papert they wrote a book called
 

00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:58.120
Papert they wrote a book called
perceptrons which proved that these

00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:58.130
perceptrons which proved that these
 

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:00.670
perceptrons which proved that these
things didn't work and so in the u.s.

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:00.680
things didn't work and so in the u.s.
 

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.620
things didn't work and so in the u.s.
research stopped in neural networks for

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:02.630
research stopped in neural networks for
 

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:04.090
research stopped in neural networks for
about 20 years I didn't start again till

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:04.100
about 20 years I didn't start again till
 

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.340
about 20 years I didn't start again till
the 1980s and so there was this 20 year

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:06.350
the 1980s and so there was this 20 year
 

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:08.890
the 1980s and so there was this 20 year
period where based on this one book and

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:08.900
period where based on this one book and
 

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.600
period where based on this one book and
a very convincing set of arguments by

they managed to divert almost all of the
 

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.440
they managed to divert almost all of the
funding towards symbolic logic and

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:17.450
funding towards symbolic logic and

Rosenblatt's did but you know he found

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:04.880
Rosenblatt's did but you know he found
 

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.090
Rosenblatt's did but you know he found
that he could output this analog wave

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:07.100
that he could output this analog wave
 

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.500
that he could output this analog wave
you know if it was a female face it

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:08.510
you know if it was a female face it

wave there was a little bump and he

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:15.110
wave there was a little bump and he
 

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:16.660
wave there was a little bump and he
couldn't figure out what the bump was it

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:16.670
couldn't figure out what the bump was it
 

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:18.580
couldn't figure out what the bump was it
was regard it was there for some men and

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:18.590
was regard it was there for some men and
 

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:20.500
was regard it was there for some men and
some women but not all men not all women

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:20.510
some women but not all men not all women
 

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:23.320

you know the the wave was going low for

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:23.330
you know the the wave was going low for
 

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:24.910
you know the the wave was going low for
male the bump would be in the same place

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:24.920
male the bump would be in the same place
 

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.310
male the bump would be in the same place
and so it was this kind of sub harmonic

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:27.320
and so it was this kind of sub harmonic
 

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:28.570
and so it was this kind of sub harmonic
on the main partial and he was trying to

on the main partial and he was trying to
figure out what does that represent and

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:30.220
figure out what does that represent and
 

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.950
figure out what does that represent and
you know first he thought well let's see

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960
you know first he thought well let's see

I mean are all the photographs lit the
same could it be that you know could it

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:36.320
same could it be that you know could it
 

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.010

be the haircut you know and so he

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:39.020
be the haircut you know and so he
 

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.260

gradually you know isolated all of these

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:41.270
gradually you know isolated all of these

and none of them worked and so he then

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:46.070
and none of them worked and so he then
 

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:48.040
and none of them worked and so he then
started asking people questions and he

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:48.050
started asking people questions and he
 

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:49.330
started asking people questions and he
found that the bump was only there for

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:49.340
found that the bump was only there for
 

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.730
found that the bump was only there for
members of the Communist Party and so he

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:51.740
members of the Communist Party and so he
 

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:53.350
members of the Communist Party and so he
became very interested of course is

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360
became very interested of course is
 

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.730

the NKVD immediately saw the
 

00:28:56.930 --> 00:29:00.580
the NKVD immediately saw the
applications of this and so so his

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:00.590
applications of this and so so his
 

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:02.470

something that could have almost been
 

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.190
something that could have almost been
built and then go ahead and build that

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200
built and then go ahead and build that
 

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.200
built and then go ahead and build that
and so I would kind of put a new bud on

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:11.210
and so I would kind of put a new bud on
 

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:12.520

in art venues I made no claims about

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:31.880
in art venues I made no claims about
 

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.240

I was completely unprepared for it in
 

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:43.419
I was completely unprepared for it in
most cases like when I showed the am

00:30:43.419 --> 00:30:43.429
most cases like when I showed the am
 

00:30:43.429 --> 00:30:44.830

piece you know I was in one of the

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:44.840
piece you know I was in one of the
 

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.799
piece you know I was in one of the
videos and and you know no one really

00:30:47.799 --> 00:30:47.809
videos and and you know no one really
 

00:30:47.809 --> 00:30:49.540

they saw the the crazy glasses and the
mad scientist and I guess it was

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:54.200
mad scientist and I guess it was
 

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.650
mad scientist and I guess it was
convincing that but you know I asked the

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:56.660
convincing that but you know I asked the
 

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.330
convincing that but you know I asked the
Finns why why did you believe it you

00:30:58.330 --> 00:30:58.340
Finns why why did you believe it you
 

00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.560
Finns why why did you believe it you
know some of my friends saw it and they

00:30:59.560 --> 00:30:59.570
know some of my friends saw it and they
 

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.090
know some of my friends saw it and they
believed it and I said it was so clearly

as historical fictions but you can
actually I think most of them and taken

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:14.600
actually I think most of them and taken
 

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.120
actually I think most of them and taken
off by now but on the internet for about

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:16.130
off by now but on the internet for about

a period of
 

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:18.009
a period of
two or three years there were a bunch of

00:31:18.009 --> 00:31:18.019
two or three years there were a bunch of
 

00:31:18.019 --> 00:31:19.419
two or three years there were a bunch of
histories of technology where you would

00:31:19.419 --> 00:31:19.429
histories of technology where you would
 

00:31:19.429 --> 00:31:22.779
histories of technology where you would
actually see this stuff inserted and one

00:31:22.779 --> 00:31:22.789

and we went through the whole process of

00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399
and we went through the whole process of
 

00:31:28.399 --> 00:31:29.919
and we went through the whole process of
the contract and then they sent me a

00:31:29.919 --> 00:31:29.929
the contract and then they sent me a
 

00:31:29.929 --> 00:31:31.149
the contract and then they sent me a
letter and I realized that they didn't

00:31:31.149 --> 00:31:31.159
letter and I realized that they didn't
 

00:31:31.159 --> 00:31:32.139
letter and I realized that they didn't
know that they were fiction's and I

00:31:32.139 --> 00:31:32.149
know that they were fiction's and I
 

00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:35.680
know that they were fiction's and I
didn't want to get them fired so this is

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:35.690
didn't want to get them fired so this is
 

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:37.419
didn't want to get them fired so this is
the last piece that I did in these kind

00:31:37.419 --> 00:31:37.429
the last piece that I did in these kind
 

00:31:37.429 --> 00:31:39.580
the last piece that I did in these kind
of historical series called natural

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:39.590
of historical series called natural

language processor and this this one is

00:31:41.259 --> 00:31:41.269
language processor and this this one is
 

00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:44.370
language processor and this this one is
about sort of the relationship of

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:44.380
about sort of the relationship of
 

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:48.519
about sort of the relationship of
language and and inculturation and

00:31:50.669 --> 00:31:50.679
biology and this is a question that
 

00:31:50.679 --> 00:31:52.990

basically in all of these three pieces

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:53.000
basically in all of these three pieces
 

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.659
basically in all of these three pieces
these historical fictions I take an

00:31:55.659 --> 00:31:55.669
these historical fictions I take an
 

00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:57.789
these historical fictions I take an
issue which is a pen historical

00:31:57.789 --> 00:31:57.799
issue which is a pen historical
 

00:31:57.799 --> 00:31:59.320
issue which is a pen historical
scientific issue so the thing about

00:31:59.320 --> 00:31:59.330
scientific issue so the thing about
 

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:02.230
scientific issue so the thing about
human faces is something that has come

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240
human faces is something that has come
 

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.139
human faces is something that has come
up many times I mean most of you are

00:32:05.139 --> 00:32:05.149
up many times I mean most of you are
 

00:32:05.149 --> 00:32:06.399
up many times I mean most of you are
familiar with what's considered really

00:32:06.399 --> 00:32:06.409
familiar with what's considered really
 

00:32:06.409 --> 00:32:08.440

bad science like phrenology and crania
Skippy these are universally held up as

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:10.730
Skippy these are universally held up as
 

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:12.039
Skippy these are universally held up as
examples of bad science

00:32:12.039 --> 00:32:12.049
examples of bad science
 

00:32:12.049 --> 00:32:13.990
examples of bad science
in fact if you look at the history it's

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000
in fact if you look at the history it's
 

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.820
in fact if you look at the history it's
very very complicated set of issues and

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:15.830
very very complicated set of issues and
 

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:17.799
very very complicated set of issues and
those Sciences one of the reasons that

00:32:17.799 --> 00:32:17.809
those Sciences one of the reasons that
 

00:32:17.809 --> 00:32:20.379
those Sciences one of the reasons that
phrenology phrenology essentially is the

if the brain in fact has areas that that

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:24.980
if the brain in fact has areas that that
 

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:27.879
if the brain in fact has areas that that
do certain things which we now believe

00:32:27.879 --> 00:32:27.889
do certain things which we now believe
 

00:32:27.889 --> 00:32:29.289
do certain things which we now believe
in again for a long period of time

people didn't believe in it but but in

00:32:30.789 --> 00:32:30.799
people didn't believe in it but but in
 

00:32:30.799 --> 00:32:32.919
people didn't believe in it but but in
the in the you know eight late 18th and

00:32:32.919 --> 00:32:32.929
the in the you know eight late 18th and
 

00:32:32.929 --> 00:32:34.389
the in the you know eight late 18th and
early 19th century it was pretty clear

00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399
early 19th century it was pretty clear
 

00:32:34.399 --> 00:32:36.250
early 19th century it was pretty clear
that if you drove a railroad spike

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:36.260
that if you drove a railroad spike
 

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:37.690
that if you drove a railroad spike
through someone's head you know this

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:37.700
through someone's head you know this
 

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.220
through someone's head you know this
angle and it took out parts of the brain

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:39.230
angle and it took out parts of the brain
 

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:40.870
angle and it took out parts of the brain
they would stop being able to do certain

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880
they would stop being able to do certain
 

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.789
they would stop being able to do certain
things and so they said okay let's look

00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799
things and so they said okay let's look
 

00:32:42.799 --> 00:32:44.049
things and so they said okay let's look
at all the cases and they began to

00:32:44.049 --> 00:32:44.059
at all the cases and they began to
 

00:32:44.059 --> 00:32:45.820
at all the cases and they began to
figure out that you know like over here

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:45.830
figure out that you know like over here
 

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.500
figure out that you know like over here
your powers of like reasoning and

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:47.510
your powers of like reasoning and
 

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:50.259
your powers of like reasoning and
spatialization so up here is kind of the

00:32:50.259 --> 00:32:50.269
spatialization so up here is kind of the
 

00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:52.810
spatialization so up here is kind of the
important stuff you know for for human

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:52.820
important stuff you know for for human
 

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:54.730
important stuff you know for for human

which is your love power known you know
 

00:32:57.799 --> 00:32:58.899
which is your love power known you know
and part of the reason they got that is

00:32:58.899 --> 00:32:58.909
and part of the reason they got that is
 

00:32:58.909 --> 00:33:00.610
and part of the reason they got that is
because cats and apes have very strong

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:00.620
because cats and apes have very strong
 

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.669

bonobos have very big areas back here so

00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679
bonobos have very big areas back here so
 

00:33:03.679 --> 00:33:05.080
bonobos have very big areas back here so
even you know I know people whose

their skull and tell them what they were
 

00:33:10.669 --> 00:33:11.769
their skull and tell them what they were
going to be when they grew up so I mean

00:33:11.769 --> 00:33:11.779
going to be when they grew up so I mean
 

00:33:11.779 --> 00:33:13.539
going to be when they grew up so I mean
these are fairly popular Sciences but

00:33:13.539 --> 00:33:13.549
these are fairly popular Sciences but
 

00:33:13.549 --> 00:33:15.430
these are fairly popular Sciences but
they're discredited now on the other

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:15.440
they're discredited now on the other

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:42.480
bad ethnography you know
that New Guineans have less culture and

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:42.490
that New Guineans have less culture and
 

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:44.400
that New Guineans have less culture and
civilization than we do so they're

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:44.410
civilization than we do so they're
 

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:46.020

to try to understand language because
 

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:15.210
to try to understand language because
we're so embedded in language and in

we're so embedded in language and in
 

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:17.130
we're so embedded in language and in

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:38.280
Poteau and Kabongo it's a really great
film from the 1970s and he's another

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:38.290
film from the 1970s and he's another
 

00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:39.960
film from the 1970s and he's another
issue but but the film is great and um

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:39.970
issue but but the film is great and um
 

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:41.700
issue but but the film is great and um
and it's about these two kids who

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:41.710
and it's about these two kids who
 

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:43.530
and it's about these two kids who
develop their own language at home and

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:43.540
develop their own language at home and
 

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.600
develop their own language at home and

scientists will descend on you from all
 

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:50.730
scientists will descend on you from all
corners of the planet and start studying

you and and so that's one of the ways
 

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.120
you and and so that's one of the ways
that you can study language but there

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:54.130
that you can study language but there
 

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:56.220
that you can study language but there
aren't many so this is the installation

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:56.230
aren't many so this is the installation

would have been if they weren't in the
 

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:48.060
would have been if they weren't in the
machine all day and you know all they

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:48.070
machine all day and you know all they
 

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:49.590
machine all day and you know all they
all they know is that by the end of it

different words for milk so
 

00:37:55.059 --> 00:37:57.420
different words for milk so
so so those are the kind of the past I

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:57.430
so so those are the kind of the past I
 

00:37:57.430 --> 00:38:00.180
so so those are the kind of the past I
got to Rensselaer Polytechnic and two

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:00.190
got to Rensselaer Polytechnic and two
 

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:02.490
got to Rensselaer Polytechnic and two
things happen so so I left grad school

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:02.500
things happen so so I left grad school
 

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.470
things happen so so I left grad school
started teaching in a engineering

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480
started teaching in a engineering
 

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.849

Institute in upstate New York and for
 

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:09.900
Institute in upstate New York and for
the first time I was really confronted

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:09.910
the first time I was really confronted
 

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:13.500
the first time I was really confronted
with being not having a kind of a home I

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:13.510
with being not having a kind of a home I
 

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:14.880
with being not having a kind of a home I
was in an art department but it was very

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:14.890
was in an art department but it was very
 

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:17.400
was in an art department but it was very
small art department and really all the

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:17.410
small art department and really all the
 

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:18.900
small art department and really all the
people I had to interact with all day

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:18.910
people I had to interact with all day
 

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:20.609
people I had to interact with all day
were scientists and engineers and I kind

00:38:20.609 --> 00:38:20.619
were scientists and engineers and I kind
 

00:38:20.619 --> 00:38:21.809
were scientists and engineers and I kind
of realized that I was actually for the

00:38:21.809 --> 00:38:21.819
of realized that I was actually for the
 

00:38:21.819 --> 00:38:23.579
of realized that I was actually for the
first time you know in a position where

00:38:23.579 --> 00:38:23.589
first time you know in a position where
 

00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:25.829
first time you know in a position where
I could make technologies and get them

00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839
I could make technologies and get them
 

00:38:25.839 --> 00:38:27.539
I could make technologies and get them
out in the world you know in a way that

00:38:27.539 --> 00:38:27.549
out in the world you know in a way that
 

00:38:27.549 --> 00:38:29.370
out in the world you know in a way that
I had some authority now because I was

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:29.380
I had some authority now because I was
 

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:31.530
I had some authority now because I was
teaching in an engineering school and so

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:31.540
teaching in an engineering school and so
 

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.000
teaching in an engineering school and so
I thought about well I've got to kind of

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:33.010
I thought about well I've got to kind of
 

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:34.620
I thought about well I've got to kind of
it makes sense for me it's sort of my

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:34.630
it makes sense for me it's sort of my
 

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:36.170
it makes sense for me it's sort of my
responsibility now to design

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:36.180
responsibility now to design
 

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:40.020
responsibility now to design
technologies for the contemporary and so

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:40.030
technologies for the contemporary and so
 

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:42.510
technologies for the contemporary and so
I started thinking about that and at the

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:42.520
I started thinking about that and at the
 

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.339
I started thinking about that and at the
same time I had been working so hard on

00:38:44.339 --> 00:38:44.349
same time I had been working so hard on
 

00:38:44.349 --> 00:38:47.460
same time I had been working so hard on
all these historical you know histories

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:47.470
all these historical you know histories
 

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:50.430
all these historical you know histories
of technology that that I I kind of felt

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:50.440
of technology that that I I kind of felt
 

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:52.680
of technology that that I I kind of felt
like well you know I need to get out of

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:52.690
like well you know I need to get out of
 

00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:54.299
like well you know I need to get out of
the library more you know I haven't been

00:38:54.299 --> 00:38:54.309
the library more you know I haven't been
 

00:38:54.309 --> 00:38:57.059
the library more you know I haven't been
clubbing enough and and you know sure

00:38:57.059 --> 00:38:57.069
clubbing enough and and you know sure
 

00:38:57.069 --> 00:38:59.010
clubbing enough and and you know sure
enough I figured out a way to kind of

00:38:59.010 --> 00:38:59.020
enough I figured out a way to kind of
 

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.390
enough I figured out a way to kind of
combine this kind of interest in the

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400
combine this kind of interest in the
 

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.160
combine this kind of interest in the
present there were a lot of technologies

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:02.170
present there were a lot of technologies
 

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:03.870
present there were a lot of technologies
coming out for DJ's that were supposed

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:03.880
coming out for DJ's that were supposed
 

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:07.289
coming out for DJ's that were supposed
to get rid of the problem of vinyl and I

00:39:07.289 --> 00:39:07.299
to get rid of the problem of vinyl and I
 

00:39:07.299 --> 00:39:08.250
to get rid of the problem of vinyl and I
always think that that's really

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:08.260
always think that that's really
 

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:09.359
always think that that's really
interesting because there are all these

00:39:09.359 --> 00:39:09.369
interesting because there are all these
 

00:39:09.369 --> 00:39:10.530
interesting because there are all these
technologies they're getting rid of

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:10.540
technologies they're getting rid of
 

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:12.329
technologies they're getting rid of
problems like body odor that you didn't

00:39:12.329 --> 00:39:12.339
problems like body odor that you didn't
 

00:39:12.339 --> 00:39:14.220
problems like body odor that you didn't
know you had until the technology came

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:14.230
know you had until the technology came
 

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:17.069
know you had until the technology came
out and and you know one of them is for

00:39:17.069 --> 00:39:17.079
out and and you know one of them is for
 

00:39:17.079 --> 00:39:19.170
out and and you know one of them is for
me vinyl I mean vinyl is amazing and DJ

DJ culture is a phenomenal kind of

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:21.700
DJ culture is a phenomenal kind of
 

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:24.299
DJ culture is a phenomenal kind of
contemporary art that was developed you

00:39:24.299 --> 00:39:24.309
contemporary art that was developed you
 

00:39:24.309 --> 00:39:26.549

where's Chernobyl but so our research

00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:57.240
where's Chernobyl but so our research
 

00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:00.050
where's Chernobyl but so our research
continues as of a couple of years ago we

were building the system to listen to a
 

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.510
were building the system to listen to a
deejay and then be able to reproduce

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520
deejay and then be able to reproduce
 

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.910

essentially um let's see if we have

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:16.020
essentially um let's see if we have

this is him whistling into a microphone

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:20.370
this is him whistling into a microphone
 

00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:28.160
this is him whistling into a microphone
and then this is the system about five

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:28.170
and then this is the system about five
 

00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:32.300
and then this is the system about five
seconds later scratching it

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:32.310
 

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:34.320
and the warbling is because it was a

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:34.330
and the warbling is because it was a
 

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:36.090
and the warbling is because it was a
warble tone to begin with so it's kind

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:36.100
warble tone to begin with so it's kind
 

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:37.740
warble tone to begin with so it's kind
of a perfect system and so DJ could do a

October 2001 I was just I was looking at

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:07.870
October 2001 I was just I was looking at
 

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:09.360
October 2001 I was just I was looking at
the speed at which the US was going to

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:09.370
the speed at which the US was going to
 

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:11.280
the speed at which the US was going to
war and it really it really bothered me

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:11.290
war and it really it really bothered me
 

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:12.510
war and it really it really bothered me
I mean I was like you know that

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:12.520
I mean I was like you know that

you know in a hotel and in Cambridge and

00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:17.140
you know in a hotel and in Cambridge and
 

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:20.010
you know in a hotel and in Cambridge and
and just looking for some TV station

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:20.020
and just looking for some TV station
 

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:22.400
and just looking for some TV station
that seemed to have some degree of

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:22.410
that seemed to have some degree of
 

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:24.840
that seemed to have some degree of
mindfulness about what was going on and

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:24.850
mindfulness about what was going on and
 

00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:26.280

I just couldn't find it and I'm flipping

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:26.290
I just couldn't find it and I'm flipping
 

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:27.690
I just couldn't find it and I'm flipping
and I'm flipping and finally I come

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:27.700
and I'm flipping and finally I come
 

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:29.370
and I'm flipping and finally I come
across one and and there's this teenager

00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:29.380
across one and and there's this teenager
 

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:31.590
across one and and there's this teenager
crying and she says you know I'm just

00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:31.600
crying and she says you know I'm just
 

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.030
crying and she says you know I'm just
really worried about what the US is

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040
really worried about what the US is
 

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.380
really worried about what the US is
gonna do you know I'm really worried

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:34.390
gonna do you know I'm really worried
 

00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:35.670
gonna do you know I'm really worried
that they're gonna overreact and it's

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680
that they're gonna overreact and it's
 

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.080
that they're gonna overreact and it's
gonna change the US and the whole world

this is the first thing I've seen in
 

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:45.570
this is the first thing I've seen in
like an hour of flipping and

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:45.580
like an hour of flipping and
 

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:47.070

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:52.950
so you know so so I I kind of I kind of
uh I realized I had to do something

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960
uh I realized I had to do something
 

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:54.960
uh I realized I had to do something
about about this and and the speed at

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:54.970
about about this and and the speed at
 

00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:57.060
about about this and and the speed at
which the US was going to war because I

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:11.310
that I'd just been doing a lot of
research in and I knew that facial

00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:11.320
research in and I knew that facial
 

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:13.170
research in and I knew that facial
recognition systems are awful they're

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:13.180
recognition systems are awful they're
 

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:14.940
recognition systems are awful they're
they're terrible they you know they

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:14.950
they're terrible they you know they
 

00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:16.890
they're terrible they you know they
don't work very well they have lots of

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:16.900
don't work very well they have lots of
 

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.560
don't work very well they have lots of
false positives they have like even more

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:19.570
false positives they have like even more
 

00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:21.930
false positives they have like even more
false than you know negatives so so

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:21.940
false than you know negatives so so
 

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:23.400
false than you know negatives so so
there's all these ways in which that was

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:23.410
there's all these ways in which that was
 

00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:25.020
there's all these ways in which that was
probably not the best legislation to

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:25.030
probably not the best legislation to
 

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:26.700
probably not the best legislation to
pass and so I realized that a lot of the

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:26.710
pass and so I realized that a lot of the
 

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:27.930
pass and so I realized that a lot of the
reason we were going to war so quickly

00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:27.940
reason we were going to war so quickly
 

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:29.580
reason we were going to war so quickly
was just this issue that there's a huge

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:29.590
was just this issue that there's a huge
 

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:31.530
was just this issue that there's a huge
amount of money and energy pushing the

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:31.540
amount of money and energy pushing the
 

00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:32.880
amount of money and energy pushing the
government towards that I mean you you

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:32.890
government towards that I mean you you
 

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:35.160
government towards that I mean you you
spend all this money on defense you're

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:35.170
spend all this money on defense you're
 

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:37.110
spend all this money on defense you're
not gonna not use it it's like having a

00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:37.120
not gonna not use it it's like having a
 

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:39.930
not gonna not use it it's like having a
you know Ferrari in your driveway so so

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:39.940
you know Ferrari in your driveway so so
 

00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:41.670
you know Ferrari in your driveway so so
so what's the you know what was I going

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:41.680
so what's the you know what was I going
 

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:42.930
so what's the you know what was I going
to do I was going to try to figure out a

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:42.940
to do I was going to try to figure out a
 

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:44.910
to do I was going to try to figure out a
system to to keep the u.s. from going to

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:44.920
system to to keep the u.s. from going to
 

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.410
system to to keep the u.s. from going to
war and so to do that I attacked like a

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:46.420
war and so to do that I attacked like a
 

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:47.880
war and so to do that I attacked like a
good engineer and analyzed the problem

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:47.890
good engineer and analyzed the problem
 

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:49.950
good engineer and analyzed the problem
and the problem to me one of the main

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:49.960
and the problem to me one of the main
 

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.450
and the problem to me one of the main
problems was that we got out of the war

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:51.460
problems was that we got out of the war
 

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:53.550
problems was that we got out of the war
in Vietnam largely because of the

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:53.560
in Vietnam largely because of the
 

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:55.140
in Vietnam largely because of the
attempts to bring the war home both in

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:55.150
attempts to bring the war home both in
 

00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:56.820
attempts to bring the war home both in
the media and Martha Rossler and other

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:56.830
the media and Martha Rossler and other
 

00:46:56.830 --> 00:46:59.040
the media and Martha Rossler and other
people like that so so because of the

00:46:59.040 --> 00:46:59.050
people like that so so because of the
 

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:00.750
people like that so so because of the
images of war in people's living rooms

00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:00.760
images of war in people's living rooms
 

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.550
images of war in people's living rooms
Americans are pretty good people they

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:02.560
Americans are pretty good people they
 

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:04.140
Americans are pretty good people they
they didn't approve of what the

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:04.150
they didn't approve of what the
 

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:05.520
they didn't approve of what the
government was doing and so they forced

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:05.530
government was doing and so they forced
 

00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:07.770
government was doing and so they forced
a change from the inside now you know

00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:07.780
a change from the inside now you know
 

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:09.330
a change from the inside now you know
lots of activists noticed this the

00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:09.340
lots of activists noticed this the
 

00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:11.550
lots of activists noticed this the
Pentagon really noticed it and for the

00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:11.560
Pentagon really noticed it and for the
 

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:13.380
Pentagon really noticed it and for the
last you know 20 25 years they've been

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:13.390
last you know 20 25 years they've been
 

00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:15.540
last you know 20 25 years they've been
working on doing nothing but preventing

00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:15.550
working on doing nothing but preventing
 

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:17.280
working on doing nothing but preventing
Americans from seeing what happens in

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:17.290
Americans from seeing what happens in
 

00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:19.830
Americans from seeing what happens in
war so in in for instance Grenada you

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:19.840
war so in in for instance Grenada you
 

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.770
war so in in for instance Grenada you
know one of our moments of pride when

00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:22.780
know one of our moments of pride when
 

00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:23.880
know one of our moments of pride when
journalists were flying there they

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:23.890
journalists were flying there they
 

00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:25.800
journalists were flying there they
forced their airplane down you know in

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:25.810
forced their airplane down you know in
 

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:27.870
forced their airplane down you know in
the first Gulf War there was the you

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:27.880
the first Gulf War there was the you
 

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:30.840
the first Gulf War there was the you
know press pool system and what I

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:30.850
know press pool system and what I
 

00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:32.490
know press pool system and what I
realized is that in the Gulf War both

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:32.500
realized is that in the Gulf War both
 

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:34.470
realized is that in the Gulf War both
the one you know the first and the one

00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:34.480
the one you know the first and the one
 

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:37.410
the one you know the first and the one
now the other side was much less worried

00:47:37.410 --> 00:47:37.420
now the other side was much less worried
 

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:39.600
now the other side was much less worried
about journalists but in Afghanistan the

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:39.610
about journalists but in Afghanistan the
 

00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:40.830
about journalists but in Afghanistan the
Taliban absolutely didn't want

00:47:40.830 --> 00:47:40.840
Taliban absolutely didn't want
 

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:42.300
Taliban absolutely didn't want
journalists either so I realized that

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:42.310
journalists either so I realized that
 

00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:43.920
journalists either so I realized that
this was going to be you know has anyone

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:43.930
this was going to be you know has anyone
 

00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:45.330
this was going to be you know has anyone
seen any images of the war in

00:47:45.330 --> 00:47:45.340
seen any images of the war in
 

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:47.940
seen any images of the war in
Afghanistan what it was happening like

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:47.950
Afghanistan what it was happening like
 

00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:48.990
Afghanistan what it was happening like
on the New York Times there would be an

00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:49.000
on the New York Times there would be an
 

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.940
on the New York Times there would be an
image of a Northern Alliance soldier

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:50.950
image of a Northern Alliance soldier
 

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:52.650
image of a Northern Alliance soldier
with some smoke trails in the back and

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:52.660
with some smoke trails in the back and
 

00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:54.480
with some smoke trails in the back and
they would say US bombing happens have

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:54.490
they would say US bombing happens have
 

00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:59.010
they would say US bombing happens have
you seen video ok yeah so

00:47:59.010 --> 00:47:59.020
you seen video ok yeah so
 

00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:00.780
you seen video ok yeah so
so so it's it's you know it was

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:00.790
so so it's it's you know it was
 

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:02.430
so so it's it's you know it was
completely closed down and I was worried

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:02.440
completely closed down and I was worried
 

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:03.570
completely closed down and I was worried
that that would happen I was worried it

00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:03.580
that that would happen I was worried it
 

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:04.770
that that would happen I was worried it
would make it possible to get into

00:48:04.770 --> 00:48:04.780
would make it possible to get into
 

00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:08.430
would make it possible to get into
another war soon after call me crazy so

00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:08.440
another war soon after call me crazy so
 

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:10.980
another war soon after call me crazy so
so I decided that I would try to solve

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:10.990
so I decided that I would try to solve
 

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:12.420
so I decided that I would try to solve
this again with the technology and I

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:12.430
this again with the technology and I
 

00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:16.380
this again with the technology and I
designed a war reporter that was

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:16.390
designed a war reporter that was
 

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:19.080
designed a war reporter that was
essentially actually when I show this on

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:19.090
essentially actually when I show this on
 

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:22.109
essentially actually when I show this on
video a war reporter which was a robotic

00:48:22.109 --> 00:48:22.119
video a war reporter which was a robotic
 

00:48:22.119 --> 00:48:24.359
video a war reporter which was a robotic
war reporter at the time the US was

00:48:24.359 --> 00:48:24.369
war reporter at the time the US was
 

00:48:24.369 --> 00:48:25.500
war reporter at the time the US was
saying that they weren't allowing

00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:25.510
saying that they weren't allowing
 

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:26.760
saying that they weren't allowing
journalists in because they were

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:26.770
journalists in because they were
 

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:28.310
journalists in because they were
concerned about the journalists safety

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:28.320
concerned about the journalists safety
 

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:30.870
concerned about the journalists safety

so concerned that Donald Rumsfeld said
 

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.250
so concerned that Donald Rumsfeld said
that if Americans saw wounded

00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:32.260
that if Americans saw wounded
 

00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:34.560
that if Americans saw wounded
journalists on the battlefield American

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:34.570
journalists on the battlefield American
 

00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:35.700
journalists on the battlefield American
soldiers they shouldn't help the

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:35.710
soldiers they shouldn't help the
 

00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:37.770
soldiers they shouldn't help the
journalist because that wasn't their

00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:37.780
journalist because that wasn't their
 

00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:39.000
journalist because that wasn't their
responsibility so they were very

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:39.010

basically basically what I did is I came
up with this reporting system and Matt

00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:12.040
up with this reporting system and Matt
 

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:14.820
up with this reporting system and Matt
Mira Paul had wanted to do a story for

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:14.830
Mira Paul had wanted to do a story for
 

00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:17.820
Mira Paul had wanted to do a story for
the New York Times on the robot DJ and I

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:17.830
the New York Times on the robot DJ and I
 

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:19.200
the New York Times on the robot DJ and I
said well you know that projects kind of

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:19.210
said well you know that projects kind of
 

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:21.540
said well you know that projects kind of
over but I'm working on something new

00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:21.550

it's it's it's real real aspects of
 

00:52:39.499 --> 00:52:41.680
it's it's it's real real aspects of
death and blood and the other half is

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:41.690
death and blood and the other half is
 

00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:43.690
death and blood and the other half is
you know 17 miles away with a targeting

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:43.700
you know 17 miles away with a targeting
 

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:46.059
you know 17 miles away with a targeting
system and and I think that's what we're

00:52:46.059 --> 00:52:46.069
system and and I think that's what we're
 

00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:47.620
system and and I think that's what we're
doing and I think it's it's easier to go

00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:47.630
doing and I think it's it's easier to go
 

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:49.989
doing and I think it's it's easier to go
back to war now not only because the

00:52:49.989 --> 00:52:49.999
back to war now not only because the
 

00:52:49.999 --> 00:52:51.430
back to war now not only because the
media isn't showing people what's going

00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440
media isn't showing people what's going
 

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:53.559
media isn't showing people what's going
on but also because soldiers are

00:52:53.559 --> 00:52:53.569
on but also because soldiers are
 

00:52:53.569 --> 00:52:55.109
on but also because soldiers are
increasingly not seeing what's going on

00:52:55.109 --> 00:52:55.119
increasingly not seeing what's going on
 

00:52:55.119 --> 00:52:57.339
increasingly not seeing what's going on
they're not even there when the death

00:52:57.339 --> 00:52:57.349
they're not even there when the death
 

00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:58.870
they're not even there when the death
happens when the wedding parties are

00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880
happens when the wedding parties are
 

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:02.019
happens when the wedding parties are
being killed by mistake so so this is a

00:53:02.019 --> 00:53:02.029
being killed by mistake so so this is a
 

00:53:02.029 --> 00:53:04.319
being killed by mistake so so this is a
kind of a project that we're continuing

00:53:04.319 --> 00:53:04.329
kind of a project that we're continuing
 

00:53:04.329 --> 00:53:07.210
kind of a project that we're continuing
I'm actually you know this was a really

00:53:07.210 --> 00:53:07.220
I'm actually you know this was a really
 

00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:09.099
I'm actually you know this was a really
stupid robot it worked rhetorically but

00:53:09.099 --> 00:53:09.109
stupid robot it worked rhetorically but
 

00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:11.589
stupid robot it worked rhetorically but
a single landmine would have taken it

00:53:11.589 --> 00:53:11.599
a single landmine would have taken it
 

00:53:11.599 --> 00:53:13.420
a single landmine would have taken it
out so we're now working on our own

00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:13.430
out so we're now working on our own
 

00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:15.220
out so we're now working on our own
unmanned aerial vehicle called freedom

00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:15.230
unmanned aerial vehicle called freedom
 

00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:20.259
unmanned aerial vehicle called freedom
flies and it's it's there to do more

00:53:20.259 --> 00:53:20.269
flies and it's it's there to do more
 

00:53:20.269 --> 00:53:23.289
flies and it's it's there to do more
reporting in areas you know borders and

00:53:23.289 --> 00:53:23.299
reporting in areas you know borders and
 

00:53:23.299 --> 00:53:24.809
reporting in areas you know borders and
areas where people aren't allowed to go

00:53:24.809 --> 00:53:24.819
areas where people aren't allowed to go
 

00:53:24.819 --> 00:53:28.120
areas where people aren't allowed to go
so so that's kind of that's that's sort

00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:28.130
so so that's kind of that's that's sort
 

00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:30.759
so so that's kind of that's that's sort

Lab and kind of envision these from the

00:53:54.579 --> 00:53:54.589
Lab and kind of envision these from the
 

00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:56.769
Lab and kind of envision these from the
get-go at a very basic level in a

00:53:56.769 --> 00:53:56.779
get-go at a very basic level in a
 

00:53:56.779 --> 00:53:58.059

different different way than they're
 

00:53:58.069 --> 00:54:00.400
different different way than they're
being envisioned typically and so I'll

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:00.410
being envisioned typically and so I'll
 

00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:03.519

just show let me show one more project

00:54:03.519 --> 00:54:03.529
just show let me show one more project
 

00:54:03.529 --> 00:54:06.339
just show let me show one more project
that's been happening since since that

government information awareness and
 

00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.200
government information awareness and
this was our kind of second response to

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:11.210
this was our kind of second response to
 

00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:14.620
this was our kind of second response to
contemporary American politics how many

00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:14.630

this is uh this is a project that is a

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160
this is uh this is a project that is a
 

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:30.220
this is uh this is a project that is a
dark a hard project so it was getting

00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:30.230
dark a hard project so it was getting
 

00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:31.749
dark a hard project so it was getting
about five hundred million dollars a

00:54:31.749 --> 00:54:31.759
about five hundred million dollars a
 

00:54:31.759 --> 00:54:33.940
about five hundred million dollars a

year minimum they like what they
 

00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:35.470
year minimum they like what they
counted was five million dollars a year

00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:35.480
counted was five million dollars a year
 

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:38.470
counted was five million dollars a year
and this is a project to spy on everyone

00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480
and this is a project to spy on everyone
 

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:41.319
and this is a project to spy on everyone
in the entire world all the time to

00:54:41.319 --> 00:54:41.329
in the entire world all the time to
 

00:54:41.329 --> 00:54:42.700
in the entire world all the time to
monitor all of their electronic

00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:42.710
monitor all of their electronic

transactions it was very interesting one
 

00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:49.420
transactions it was very interesting one
of the lucky things for us is that it

00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:49.430
of the lucky things for us is that it
 

00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:51.400
of the lucky things for us is that it
was you know basically the Bush

00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:51.410
was you know basically the Bush
 

00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:53.470
was you know basically the Bush
administration was like hmm who can we

00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:53.480
administration was like hmm who can we
 

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:55.060
administration was like hmm who can we
hire to do really good science and they

00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:55.070
hire to do really good science and they
 

00:54:55.070 --> 00:54:58.270

came across Admiral Poindexter the only

00:54:58.270 --> 00:54:58.280
came across Admiral Poindexter the only
 

00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:01.030
came across Admiral Poindexter the only
known known felon from iran-contra who

known known felon from iran-contra who
 

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.829
known known felon from iran-contra who
was pardoned obviously he doesn't have

00:55:02.829 --> 00:55:02.839
was pardoned obviously he doesn't have
 

00:55:02.839 --> 00:55:04.450
was pardoned obviously he doesn't have
much of a military feature his political

00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:04.460
much of a military feature his political
 

00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:06.579
much of a military feature his political
future is bust so you know where can he

00:55:06.579 --> 00:55:06.589
future is bust so you know where can he
 

00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:09.700
future is bust so you know where can he
go but science so he was he was called

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:09.710
go but science so he was he was called
 

00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:11.200
go but science so he was he was called
on by the administration to run this

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:11.210
on by the administration to run this
 

00:55:11.210 --> 00:55:15.069
on by the administration to run this
incredibly expensive project luckily he

00:55:15.069 --> 00:55:15.079
incredibly expensive project luckily he
 

00:55:15.079 --> 00:55:16.450
incredibly expensive project luckily he
turned out to be such a lightning rod

00:55:16.450 --> 00:55:16.460
turned out to be such a lightning rod
 

00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:18.250

veterinary records I don't know what

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:16.250
veterinary records I don't know what
 

00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:17.680
veterinary records I don't know what
that's about and then it's fed into the

00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:17.690
that's about and then it's fed into the
 

00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:20.620
that's about and then it's fed into the
cylinder and then her kind of her

00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:20.630
cylinder and then her kind of her
 

00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:22.120

quotient of terror comes out of the

00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:22.130
quotient of terror comes out of the
 

00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:24.940
quotient of terror comes out of the
bottom and and this is what ti a was

00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:24.950
bottom and and this is what ti a was
 

00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:27.670
bottom and and this is what ti a was
doing and so my student Ryan McKinley he

00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:27.680
doing and so my student Ryan McKinley he
 

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:30.339
doing and so my student Ryan McKinley he
kind of looked at them he made friends

00:56:30.339 --> 00:56:30.349
kind of looked at them he made friends
 

00:56:30.349 --> 00:56:33.849
kind of looked at them he made friends
he's a really good programmer and so he

00:56:33.849 --> 00:56:33.859
he's a really good programmer and so he
 

00:56:33.859 --> 00:56:35.140
he's a really good programmer and so he
made friends with some very interesting

00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:35.150
made friends with some very interesting
 

00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:39.520
made friends with some very interesting
people who were actually working for ti

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:39.530
people who were actually working for ti
 

00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:41.380
people who were actually working for ti
a some computer scientists and figured

00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:41.390
a some computer scientists and figured
 

00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:42.940
a some computer scientists and figured
out some of how they did their structure

00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:42.950
out some of how they did their structure
 

00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:44.829
out some of how they did their structure
this is still their stuff and he came up

00:56:44.829 --> 00:56:44.839
this is still their stuff and he came up
 

00:56:44.839 --> 00:56:47.230
this is still their stuff and he came up
with an alternative and basically his

00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:47.240
with an alternative and basically his
 

00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:47.920
with an alternative and basically his
premise was

00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:47.930
premise was
 

00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:49.270
premise was
take the intelligence of the American

00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:49.280
take the intelligence of the American
 

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:52.990
take the intelligence of the American
people and and you know everyone has a

00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:53.000
people and and you know everyone has a
 

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.600
people and and you know everyone has a
neighbor a pharmacist a postman you know

00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:55.610
neighbor a pharmacist a postman you know
 

00:56:55.610 --> 00:56:57.700
neighbor a pharmacist a postman you know
and so so if you could get all of those

00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:57.710
and so so if you could get all of those
 

00:56:57.710 --> 00:56:59.710
and so so if you could get all of those
people able to inform on government

00:56:59.710 --> 00:56:59.720
people able to inform on government
 

00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:01.480
people able to inform on government
officials we would be able to have the

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:01.490
officials we would be able to have the
 

00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:03.040
officials we would be able to have the
resolution of information on government

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:03.050
resolution of information on government
 

00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:04.330
resolution of information on government
officials that they would have on us

00:57:04.330 --> 00:57:04.340
officials that they would have on us
 

00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:05.860
officials that they would have on us
and so this is open government

00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:05.870
and so this is open government
 

00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:07.000
and so this is open government
information awareness and he came up

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:07.010
information awareness and he came up
 

00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:11.290
information awareness and he came up
with this idea November November a you

00:57:11.290 --> 00:57:11.300
with this idea November November a you
 

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:13.870
with this idea November November a you
know year and several months ago and he

00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:13.880
know year and several months ago and he
 

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:15.520
know year and several months ago and he
said I want to do something to really

said I want to do something to really
 

00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:17.680
said I want to do something to really
you know kind of help torpedo TIAA cuz

00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:21.520
whether or not it it's it's not gonna
come up as a good index for terror we

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:21.530
come up as a good index for terror we
 

00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:22.660
come up as a good index for terror we
know that ahead of time because we've

00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:22.670
know that ahead of time because we've
 

00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:25.750
know that ahead of time because we've
seen lots of projects like it but it is

00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760
seen lots of projects like it but it is
 

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:27.040
seen lots of projects like it but it is
going to be a great way for the

00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:27.050
going to be a great way for the
 

00:57:27.050 --> 00:57:28.060
going to be a great way for the

this programming and comes up with a

00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:38.720
this programming and comes up with a
 

00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:42.670
this programming and comes up with a
system called open gov and and and

00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:42.680
system called open gov and and and
 

00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:44.080
system called open gov and and and
basically it does a couple things like

00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:44.090
basically it does a couple things like
 

00:57:44.090 --> 00:57:45.970
basically it does a couple things like
it watches um it watches c-span and

00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:45.980
it watches um it watches c-span and
 

00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:47.950
it watches um it watches c-span and
c-span too because of course they're too

00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:47.960
c-span too because of course they're too
 

00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:51.430
c-span too because of course they're too
boring to watch by a human so so as

these are going on it's going through

00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:52.850
these are going on it's going through
 

00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:55.420
these are going on it's going through
the closed captioning and it does you

00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:55.430
the closed captioning and it does you
 

00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:56.800

faces so that you can spot them at
 

00:57:58.190 --> 00:58:00.640
faces so that you can spot them at
airports later and then correlates it

00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:00.650
airports later and then correlates it
 

00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:02.200
airports later and then correlates it
into a database so it's constantly

00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:02.210
into a database so it's constantly
 

00:58:02.210 --> 00:58:03.550
into a database so it's constantly
gathering stuff which you can then also

00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:03.560
gathering stuff which you can then also
 

00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:05.080
gathering stuff which you can then also
take a look against the congressional

of how the congressional record gets
 

00:58:43.850 --> 00:58:45.700
of how the congressional record gets
built so now you can correlate that but

00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:45.710
built so now you can correlate that but
 

00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:46.900
built so now you can correlate that but
also you're building up this facial

00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:46.910
also you're building up this facial
 

00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:47.440
also you're building up this facial
database

00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:47.450
database
 

00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:49.000
database
it also has alerts that run on your

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:49.010
it also has alerts that run on your
 

00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:50.320
it also has alerts that run on your
desktop to let you know when someone's

talking and so you can bring in a
 

00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:54.610
talking and so you can bring in a
real-time stream this is you know kind

00:58:54.610 --> 00:58:54.620
real-time stream this is you know kind
 

00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:56.050

of how the vision system works it looks

00:58:56.050 --> 00:58:56.060
of how the vision system works it looks
 

00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:58.660
of how the vision system works it looks
for incidents of motion

00:58:58.660 --> 00:58:58.670
for incidents of motion
 

00:58:58.670 --> 00:59:01.120
for incidents of motion
just like a good good killing robot

00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:01.130
just like a good good killing robot
 

00:59:01.130 --> 00:59:04.990
just like a good good killing robot
would so so these are this is an example

00:59:04.990 --> 00:59:05.000
would so so these are this is an example
 

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:06.340
would so so these are this is an example
of the database that's built up there

00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:06.350
of the database that's built up there
 

00:59:06.350 --> 00:59:07.600
of the database that's built up there
are some you know mistakes it's

and eventually give up its assembler
code but it has this incredibly powerful

01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:22.540
code but it has this incredibly powerful
 

01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:25.080
code but it has this incredibly powerful
motor underneath it so it's it's really

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:25.090
motor underneath it so it's it's really
 

01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:26.460
motor underneath it so it's it's really
fighting and it's actually stronger than

levels of pollution and fatality are
 

01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:46.140
levels of pollution and fatality are
much higher in poor neighborhoods than

01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:46.150
much higher in poor neighborhoods than
 

01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:47.790
much higher in poor neighborhoods than
in rich neighborhoods so he's trying to

01:04:47.790 --> 01:04:47.800
in rich neighborhoods so he's trying to
 

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:50.070
in rich neighborhoods so he's trying to
come up with a system that can do very

01:04:50.070 --> 01:04:50.080
come up with a system that can do very
 

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:52.500
come up with a system that can do very
very inexpensive environmental

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:52.510
very inexpensive environmental
 

01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:54.990

typically neighborhoods don't have

01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:57.760
typically neighborhoods don't have
 

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.250
typically neighborhoods don't have
access to that because it's an

01:04:59.250 --> 01:04:59.260
access to that because it's an
 

01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:01.230
access to that because it's an
incredibly expensive process to be able

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:01.240
incredibly expensive process to be able
 

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:02.490
incredibly expensive process to be able
to defend it legally but if you have

01:05:02.490 --> 01:05:02.500
to defend it legally but if you have
 

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.620

many distributed sensors that can be
 

01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:06.570
many distributed sensors that can be
made much cheaper and you essentially

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:06.580
made much cheaper and you essentially
 

01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:08.340
made much cheaper and you essentially
average their outputs and come up with

01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:08.350
average their outputs and come up with
 

01:05:08.350 --> 01:05:10.560
average their outputs and come up with
as statistically significant as an

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:10.570
as statistically significant as an
 

01:05:10.570 --> 01:05:12.180
as statistically significant as an
expensive technology and so this is some

01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:12.190
expensive technology and so this is some
 

01:05:12.190 --> 01:05:15.390

through humanities education you know
some basic skills and and the kind of

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:04.110
some basic skills and and the kind of
 

01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:05.120

technology studies I'll stop that in
 

01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:11.030
technology studies I'll stop that in
science and technology studies right now

01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040

to do khd work you have to work in a lab

01:13:13.610 --> 01:13:13.620
to do khd work you have to work in a lab
 

01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:15.740
to do khd work you have to work in a lab
like a genetics lab so you have someone

01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:15.750
like a genetics lab so you have someone
 

01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:17.570
like a genetics lab so you have someone
who's never taken any science going into

01:13:17.570 --> 01:13:17.580
who's never taken any science going into
 

01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:19.280
who's never taken any science going into
a genetic lab doing maybe a year and a

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:19.290
a genetic lab doing maybe a year and a
 

01:13:19.290 --> 01:13:20.660
a genetic lab doing maybe a year and a
half of field work and by the end being

01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:20.670
half of field work and by the end being
 

01:13:20.670 --> 01:13:22.010
half of field work and by the end being
a fully functioning member of the lab

01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:22.020
a fully functioning member of the lab
 

01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:24.830
a fully functioning member of the lab
it's not impossible so you know so I

01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:24.840
it's not impossible so you know so I
 

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:26.300
it's not impossible so you know so I
think I think you know and those people

01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:26.310
think I think you know and those people
 

01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:27.620
think I think you know and those people
come out being able to understand

01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:27.630
come out being able to understand
 

01:13:27.630 --> 01:13:29.600
come out being able to understand
science in this really remarkable way so

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:29.610
science in this really remarkable way so
 

01:13:29.610 --> 01:13:31.550
science in this really remarkable way so
so likewise I think that humanities

01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:31.560
so likewise I think that humanities
 

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:32.930
so likewise I think that humanities
people can actually get involved in some

01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:32.940
people can actually get involved in some
 

01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:34.040
people can actually get involved in some
of these issues in terms of building

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:34.050
of these issues in terms of building
 

01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:35.690
of these issues in terms of building
stuff so that's sort of what I've been

01:13:35.690 --> 01:13:35.700
stuff so that's sort of what I've been
 

01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:49.709
stuff so that's sort of what I've been
trying to work on good question yeah

01:13:49.709 --> 01:13:49.719
 

01:13:49.719 --> 01:13:55.180
yeah yeah it's totally true I mean I'll

01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:55.190
yeah yeah it's totally true I mean I'll
 

01:13:55.190 --> 01:13:56.950
yeah yeah it's totally true I mean I'll

know they were very very interested in

01:13:58.149 --> 01:13:58.159
know they were very very interested in
 

01:13:58.159 --> 01:14:00.310
know they were very very interested in
the system so I mean some of their

01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320
the system so I mean some of their
 

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:01.570
the system so I mean some of their

been threatened by US troops had guns
pointed at them so and that's because

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:20.510
pointed at them so and that's because
 

01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:21.970
pointed at them so and that's because
they weren't they weren't being embedded

01:14:21.970 --> 01:14:21.980
they weren't they weren't being embedded
 

01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:32.020

yeah yeah yeah some some have approached

01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:32.030
yeah yeah yeah some some have approached
 

01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:37.300
yeah yeah yeah some some have approached
us you know and and that's actually what

01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:37.310
us you know and and that's actually what
 

01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:38.620
us you know and and that's actually what
we were working with actually at that

01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:38.630
we were working with actually at that
 

01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:41.740
we were working with actually at that
point were some independent media in in

01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:41.750
point were some independent media in in
 

01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:44.979
point were some independent media in in
Iran and because that was probably the

01:14:44.979 --> 01:14:44.989
Iran and because that was probably the
 

01:14:44.989 --> 01:14:48.910
Iran and because that was probably the
best way for us to get it in so so but

01:14:48.910 --> 01:14:48.920
best way for us to get it in so so but
 

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:50.530
best way for us to get it in so so but
nothing really came of it because we

01:14:50.530 --> 01:14:50.540
nothing really came of it because we
 

01:14:50.540 --> 01:15:03.180
nothing really came of it because we
were too late

01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:03.190
 

01:15:03.190 --> 01:15:07.000
yeah it's just one or two one or two you

tongue-in-cheek Technologist I mean the

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:12.170
tongue-in-cheek Technologist I mean the
 

01:15:12.170 --> 01:15:13.930
tongue-in-cheek Technologist I mean the
interviews that you know if you read an

01:15:13.930 --> 01:15:13.940
interviews that you know if you read an
 

01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:15.970

interview with me I was in character I

01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:15.980
interview with me I was in character I
 

01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:19.510
interview with me I was in character I
mean I was um I was pretending I was

mean I was um I was pretending I was
 

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:21.390

kind of intentionally pre post-colonial

01:15:21.390 --> 01:15:21.400
kind of intentionally pre post-colonial
 

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:25.450
kind of intentionally pre post-colonial
in my attitudes and and so I was often

01:15:25.450 --> 01:15:25.460
in my attitudes and and so I was often
 

01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:27.190
in my attitudes and and so I was often
saying things that were you know

01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:27.200
saying things that were you know
 

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:29.080
saying things that were you know
patently offensive as a way to kind of

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:29.090
patently offensive as a way to kind of
 

01:15:29.090 --> 01:15:31.990
patently offensive as a way to kind of
you know generate more of a story and

01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:32.000
you know generate more of a story and
 

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.640
you know generate more of a story and
also you know they weren't really that

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:33.650
also you know they weren't really that
 

01:15:33.650 --> 01:15:35.140
also you know they weren't really that
far off I mean I would say things like

01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:35.150
far off I mean I would say things like
 

01:15:35.150 --> 01:15:38.320
far off I mean I would say things like
well you know really it's not such an

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:38.330
well you know really it's not such an
 

01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:40.860

the Mars Pathfinder you know so of

01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:48.260
the Mars Pathfinder you know so of
 

01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:50.020
the Mars Pathfinder you know so of
course it makes sense that uh that I

01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:50.030
course it makes sense that uh that I
 

01:15:50.030 --> 01:15:51.820
course it makes sense that uh that I
would be doing this you know one

01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:51.830
would be doing this you know one
 

01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:54.190
would be doing this you know one
advantage is that designing for Mars is

01:15:54.190 --> 01:15:54.200
advantage is that designing for Mars is
 

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:55.240
advantage is that designing for Mars is
much harder than designing for

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:55.250
much harder than designing for
 

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:57.310

Afghanistan there's a lot of roads in

01:15:57.310 --> 01:15:57.320
Afghanistan there's a lot of roads in
 

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:58.480
Afghanistan there's a lot of roads in
Afghanistan and it's not that

01:15:58.480 --> 01:15:58.490
Afghanistan and it's not that
 

01:15:58.490 --> 01:16:00.940
Afghanistan and it's not that
radioactive yet and and so the

journalists would typically say what do
 

01:16:02.150 --> 01:16:03.370
journalists would typically say what do
you mean yet and I would say well we're

01:16:03.370 --> 01:16:03.380
you mean yet and I would say well we're
 

01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:05.050
you mean yet and I would say well we're
gonna use depleted uranium you know this

01:16:05.050 --> 01:16:05.060
gonna use depleted uranium you know this
 

01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:07.060

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:13.650
 

01:17:13.650 --> 01:17:16.830
I'd say maybe when a green wins the

01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:16.840
I'd say maybe when a green wins the
 

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:20.970
I'd say maybe when a green wins the
presidential election so you know I'm

01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:20.980
presidential election so you know I'm
 

01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:23.700
presidential election so you know I'm
moving to Denmark I don't know I it's it

01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:23.710
moving to Denmark I don't know I it's it
 

01:17:23.710 --> 01:17:25.320
moving to Denmark I don't know I it's it
just seems impossible right now you know

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:25.330
just seems impossible right now you know
 

01:17:25.330 --> 01:17:26.970
just seems impossible right now you know
I just I mean the way the country is

01:17:26.970 --> 01:17:26.980
I just I mean the way the country is
 

01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:30.380
I just I mean the way the country is
going right now you know it's a level of

01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:30.390
going right now you know it's a level of
 

01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:33.060
going right now you know it's a level of
militarism and technology that we really

01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:33.070
militarism and technology that we really
 

01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:36.060
militarism and technology that we really
haven't seen since the 50s so we're

01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:36.070
haven't seen since the 50s so we're
 

01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:37.290
haven't seen since the 50s so we're
going in the wrong direction at the

01:17:37.290 --> 01:17:37.300
going in the wrong direction at the
 

01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:39.570
going in the wrong direction at the
moment
