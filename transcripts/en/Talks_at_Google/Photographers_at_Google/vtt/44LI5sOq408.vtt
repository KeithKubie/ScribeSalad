00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.860
FEMALE SPEAKER: I've been
a big fan of Art

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.180
for many, many years.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.660
And a couple years ago, I
actually went to his studio in

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.970
Seattle, Washington, and was
able to take a seminar, The

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.430
Art of Composition.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.110
And it really helped change my
view of how I look through the

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.310
viewfinder of the camera.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.220
And you're going to get a taste
of that today, which is

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.020
really exciting.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.960
Art is an award-winning
photographer.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.620
And he's traveled around
the globe.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.450
And he documents wildlife,

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.010
landscapes, and native cultures.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.630
He hosted the popular television
series, "Art

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.560
Wolfe's Travels to the Edge."
He's also released over 60

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.130
books and is a Canon
Explorer of Light.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.190
He is an honorary fellow at the
Royal Photographic Society

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.530
and a fellow of International
League of Conservation

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.690
Photographers.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.490
And the list goes on and on.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.440
Visit his website.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.940
You'll see.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.130
To sum it up, Art focuses on
what's beautiful on the earth.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.360
And it's my extreme pleasure
and honor to be able to

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.072
introduce to you
Mr. Art Wolfe.

00:00:56.072 --> 00:01:01.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.220
ART WOLFE: Normally I roam the
audience, but speaking of the

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.430
audience, I would just like a
show of hands of how many

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.980
people in this room are just
hiding out from what you would

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.560
normally be doing on a Friday
afternoon or are you really

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.690
interested in photography?

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.500
How many of you are, in
fact, photographers?

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.340
Great.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.040
So I now know how
to talk to you.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.450
This talk is really just pulling
out from various

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.960
lectures I've given
over the years.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.420
I teach a lot of seminars,
workshops.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.740
I'm working on books and
various projects.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.070
So I'm going to show you a
little bit of everything in

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.770
the next 45 minutes, at the end
of which if there's any

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.740
interest in engaging me
one-on-one, we'd invite you to

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.940
walk up to the microphone.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.300
And so during the course of
the next 40 minutes as I'm

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.170
talking, if you think of a
question that you think might

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.200
be salient for everybody else,
keep it in mind and come on up

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.310
and join the conversation.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.520
I decided to start with
some of the lectures

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.780
that I've put together.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.919
And what I teach is not
about technology.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.750
In fact, I only know how to
use probably 4% of what my

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.640
camera can do.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.220
And that's the reality
of these modern

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.280
cameras these days.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.600
What I try to teach is what
I've learned to do.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.150
My background as a painter and
an art educator allows me to

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.380
kind of dissect an
image, to, more

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.200
importantly, find the images.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.010
If you think about somebody
starting off in photography

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.690
and somebody that's been doing
it like me for 40 years,

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.560
what's the single hardest
thing for a

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.010
photographer to do?

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.120
And I'll answer it.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.170
It's to find a compelling image
out there in that 360

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.090
degree world.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.140
We're all going see the Golden
Gate shrouded in fog with the

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.980
city beyond.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.660
And that's a very common
and beautiful sight.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.420
But most people, whether it's
your aunt from Dubuque, Iowa,

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.260
or a rank amateur, it's
going to see the

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.610
same at the same time.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.810
We may have different
points of view.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.100
But we're going to
see the subject.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.980
What I try to teach is finding
the subjects as you're walking

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.370
down the street in any location
on the planet and

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.370
pull out something that 99% of
the rest of the population

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.160
would never see and try to make
a compelling argument

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.370
that this is worthy
of photograph.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.790
That's easier to say than do.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.970
And so when I started a
curriculum years ago, it was

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.510
based on some of the interviews
that I have had

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.940
with magazine editors who would
normally say, OK, who

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.870
has been your influence?

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.690
What photographers have
really directly

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.500
influenced your career?

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.500
And as I really pondered the
question, I always and

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.290
invariably would come up with,
well, it wasn't really

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.340
photographers that really have
influenced the way I see.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.830
It was really my background
in studying art history.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:02.965
So I'm going to make
that case.

00:04:02.965 --> 00:04:06.160
And I'll make it fairly clear
in the next series of photos

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.900
that follow.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.490
And then after that, I will kind
of lately dance upon a

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.080
few of the book projects I've
worked on over the years and

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.350
the points of view
of those books.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.149
And then I'll end up with a body
of work that I've been

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:25.950
working on for the last couple
of years, and, and, and.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.800
OK?

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.290
One of the people I've drawn
from for finding photos--

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.210
and it's interesting statement
to make this, and I'll go back

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.290
to the first slide, that for
the longest time in human

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.820
history, paintings were not
considered as artwork.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.750
Digest that for a second.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.130
Paintings weren't
considered art.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.530
They weren't hung on the
walls of houses.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.190
They were really records
of what had

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.020
historically gone before.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.460
Paintings of Crusades and wars
and Biblical scenes were

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.440
primarily what was painted.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.390
And they were what photographs
are today.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.120
And so over the evolution of the
years, eventually came the

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.870
Renaissance.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.890
And at the backside of the
Renaissance was the

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:21.790
Impressionist period.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.220
And that's where I kind of
started, looking at the

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.540
Impressionist paintings and
mining their work for

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.760
photographic compositions that
I would argue I simply

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.580
wouldn't have found before.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.870
So within the Impressionist
period that occurred towards

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.310
the late 1800s and early 1900s,
one of the famous

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.640
painters was Seurat.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.990
Seurat had a way of painting
his pictures--

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.340
and now they're painting
everyday scenes in a city,

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.720
like along the Seine in Paris,
or still lifes, or your uncle

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.210
or somebody, but not Biblical
scenes and certainly not wars.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.140
So during the Impressionist
period Seurat painted with

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.250
tiny points of color.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.870
And it became known
as pointillism.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.410
So if you look at a Seurat
painting and people like

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.000
Gustav Klimt that followed, it
was just tiny points of color

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.910
on a canvas, really different
than what we tend to teach,

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.270
which is horizons and leading
lines and balance.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.140
That was just simply tiny points
of color on a canvas.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.970
And how is that relevant
for me?

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.720
Well, when I'm out traveling the
world, as I'm doing nearly

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.110
9 to 10 months a year, I'm on
guard looking for photos to

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.250
take back, to capture
and bring back.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.810
And sometimes a little
red light in my mind

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.360
is blinking a Seurat.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.950
It could be blinking other
painters that I'm familiar

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.230
with, but in this
case, Seurat.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.060
And when I'm in a Swedish
forest in the fall where

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.630
there's a little bit of snow,
I'm not looking for horizons.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.940
I'm not looking for lines,
leading lines.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.620
I'm looking for little
points of color.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.010
So that to me is a Seurat.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.980
And therefore, it reveals a
subject before me, because I'm

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.260
looking for photos
to bring back.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.130
In the north woods of Minnesota,
you look at the

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.530
scene and again, no horizon.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.780
There's no big, solid
areas or dark areas.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.150
There's not what we call
negative and positive space to

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.770
hang a photo.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.050
It's just flat color and
tiny points of color.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.350
Even the birch trees, which we
think of as white trunks of

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.040
trees, are little bits of gray
and little bits of white.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.790
So to me, again, a point in this
painting reveals itself.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.900
And therefore, I
see the image.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.400
I think that anybody with
any disciplines--

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.590
maybe your history, you have a
much more profound knowledge

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.830
of music, for instance,
or poetry.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.550
The point I'm trying to make is
my background was painting.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.700
And I would see different
painters in the landscape or

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.990
the urbanscape before me.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:57.160
You may see or hear music when
you look at water flowing down

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.090
a stream or the wind blowing
through blades of grass or

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:01.220
whatever it may be.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.110
Those are the things you start
to mine to help reveal a

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:08.330
subject that we didn't
see seconds before.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.670
Monet, Claude Monet was another
famous painter during

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.370
the Impressionist period.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:19.450
And he painted in his later
years very, very imprecise

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:20.940
brush strokes.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:24.160
And in fact, the word
Impressionism comes from the

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.140
fact that the people at that
time of their life had very

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.060
poor sight.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:34.020
There was no cataract surgery
or latest contact lenses.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.570
They had really poor sight.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:39.360
But they were hard-wired to
paint from young painters.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.480
But now, in their late '80s
and early '90s, they were

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.190
hard-wired to paint but
they could not see

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:44.780
what they were painting.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.180
Do you believe that?

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.080
And hence the expression,
Impression.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.780
They were paying the impressions
of what they

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.920
thought they were painting.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.660
And none of them had very
precise lines within.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.750
So all right, as a photographer
that's looking

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:02.280
for new subjects and new ways of
creating a dialogue between

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.540
myself and my audience--

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.170
But at any rate, here's another
one that painted

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:11.370
really fine details and yet in
the late '80s, late '80s in

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.790
his life, much more
Impressionistic.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.010
There's not a sharp line
within this painting.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:19.330
So as a photographer 20 years
ago, I thought how can I pay

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.300
homage to these Impressionist
painters?

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.840
So I started experimenting
with long exposures.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.070
Wherever wind was blowing
through trees, snow was

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:30.350
falling, water was flowing,
birds were flying, anywhere

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:35.510
nature was on the move, I was
intentionally taking long

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.380
exposures of the camera.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.320
And I learned to become
a better photographer

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.110
all along the way.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:46.350
At that time, Ernst Haas was
doing some really interesting

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:49.310
studies with Olympic athletes
and bullfights.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.150
But he was also an influence.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.810
But it was the painters, the
Impressionist painters, that

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.980
really influenced this
body of work.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:00.630
And when you have two or three
photos that are connected, you

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.690
have the beginnings of
a magazine article.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:05.740
When you get up into the 20s
or 30s, it's a viable book.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:08.000
And this eventually became
a book called

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.085
Rhythms From the Wild.

00:10:09.085 --> 00:10:12.920
But as I said earlier, I started
studying the subjects

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.980
before me and kind of
visualizing what a long

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.770
exposure would mean with leaves
floating down a creek,

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.920
or what it would look like
with people getting up in

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.170
Tibet and stretching after
a long prayer session.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:29.370
And I knew that a lot of my
photos would just look like

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:33.170
garbage, where there's nothing
sharp enough in the frame to

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.180
really warrant the image.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.520
It always worked where there
was one element.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.470
And in a shot like this, you
see the monk in the lower

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:41.900
right, he's sharp enough.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:46.130
He's frozen enough that he is
the point from where your eye

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:49.430
references the rest
of the movement.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.640
It was a great project, because
if you think about it,

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.770
in today's world now you can
take a picture with a digital

00:10:55.770 --> 00:11:00.040
camera and see instant
gratification.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.050
A lot of the mystery of whether
you're getting a shot

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.230
or not is kind of dispelled
by seeing it instantly.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:09.010
Back in these days, it could be,
in the case of an Everest

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:12.750
expedition that I participated
on, three months before I

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.220
could confirm I got
what I wanted.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:18.990
But for me, it was the
discovery at the end.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.410
In an experiment like that,
I could not pre-visualize

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.410
exactly what I was getting.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:25.950
So the element of surprise
brought fun

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.960
back to taking pictures.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:34.010
Horses racing across the Rhone
River delta in southern France

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.770
became a study of motion.

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:38.870
And I certainly realized at
that point and during that

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:42.270
process that some of the most
graphic images of horses that

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.910
I had taken, where everything
was frozen in the moment of

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:49.170
time, were less appealing than
ones that conveyed motion.

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.540
This started to look, then, more
like the paintings and

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.790
the history that I had.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.230
I remember taking this
picture 20 years ago.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:03.230
Now I've desaturated and used
Nik software to make it a nice

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.850
black and white.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.970
But back then, I said,
oh, I almost got it.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:08.400
But I didn't quite get it.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.830
But it was too early on in my
career to even recognize some

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:13.910
potential photos.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:15.250
So I didn't throw it away.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:16.340
I kept it in the archive.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.620
And 20 years later,
it got rebirthed.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:22.060
And now it's an image that we
have in galleries that sells.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.620
So people love that
Impressionistic view.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.520
Van Gogh was another famous
painter during the

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.510
Impressionist period.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:31.900
And as you look at an image like
this, and if you look at

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.920
the trunks and the branches of
the trees, there's not a sharp

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:39.150
image, not a sharp line in
the entire painting.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.460
And a couple years ago
I was in Shanghai.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:46.010
And along the [INAUDIBLE], or
the most famous walking avenue

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:49.980
in Shanghai, there were these
giant metal pandas.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.300
And as I walked close to the
giant metal pandas, in the

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:57.330
indentations of the sculptures,
I could see the

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.930
reflections of trees behind
me and in fact myself.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:05.760
But as I looked into this
reflection, I thought, wow,

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.980
that looks like a van Gogh.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.370
And hence, I shot it.

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:12.100
I would not have seen it or even
possibly processed it if

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.650
it wasn't connected back to
something I recognized.

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.520
And that's the point I'm trying
to make, and I do in

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.840
overall lectures.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.770
I wasn't a big fan of Picasso
when I was in my 20s in art

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:25.360
school up in Seattle.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.760
I was too immature to get him.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.900
I looked at his work and
thought, ah, it just doesn't

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:31.930
speak to me.

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:36.970
I remember studying the Cubist
period during Picasso's life.

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:38.880
And it was 15 years later.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.620
I was in Siberia in the middle
of the winter, a miserable

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.230
place, I have to say.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:47.290
And there was all these
overturned boats along Baikal.

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:50.530
And as I saw it, I thought
instantly back to Picasso.

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:53.530
It looked like a Cubist
painting, and therefore it

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:55.650
revealed itself as such.

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:57.710
So that's the point I try
to make about all

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:59.060
these different painters.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.400
Georgia O'Keefe painted the
American west in very simple

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.850
forms, with very
little detail.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:08.570
And there are times where I'm
inverting photos, reflections

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:12.820
on lakes, or taking the very
subjects that she painted, and

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.810
I shoot them as I discover them
as I'm traveling through

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:17.750
an environment.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:26.230
Her watercolor images of giant
roses I see in the icebergs in

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:28.650
both the Arctic and
the Antarctic.

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:31.990
So instantly, as I'm floating
around the Antarctic Peninsula

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.710
and I see an iceberg, it
looks to me like a

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:37.870
Georgia O'Keefe subject.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:41.740
So if you have all those
painters, and knowledge of

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:46.030
their style, it just opens up
the world of possibilities,

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:51.630
because we all can shoot
Yosemite from the viewpoint.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:54.510
But it's finding, turning around
and looking at the way

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:57.930
the sign is cracking and dented
that there could be a

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:58.560
shot there.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.800
There could be a shot that 99%
of people never found.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.120
I never was into Jackson Pollock
when I was young.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.290
I was just too immature.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:07.530
My mind, I painted--

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:10.270
when I was a painter, I painted
very realistically.

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.510
And this was just too abstract
for my brain.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:17.010
But as I've matured, as I have
studied other art, I've

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:20.700
started to understand the
nuances of Jackson Pollock.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.520
So when I see a Jackson Pollock,
I start to see it in

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.830
a mud-spattered vehicle
in southern China.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.050
To me it looks like
a Jackson Pollock,

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:30.300
and suddenly, a subject.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.660
So I see a Jackson Pollock in a
half-painted building on the

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.170
outskirts of Marrakesh,
Morocco.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:43.910
The random pattern of paint or
the way those willows are

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:47.440
hanging in front the wall, those
are subjects I would

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.840
definitely never have even
considered when I was younger.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.920
I started off in the late
'70s and early '80s.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.200
And my primary subjects and the
way people know me today

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.440
is through wildlife work.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.470
At any one time, if you wanted a
grizzly bears or polar bears

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:05.500
or emperor penguins, I was one
of three or four photographers

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.900
you would go to if you were an
editor to buy those photos for

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:09.610
a magazine.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:13.220
Today, I'm shooting everything
from rusting cans in the

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.140
gutter to the grand landscapes
and everything in between,

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.540
because as an artist, having a
background in painting and

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.300
illustration and graphic
design, I

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.770
shoot without prejudice.

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.240
And it just opens
up the world.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.420
Colleagues of mine that started
off at the same time

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.730
in the same period of time
that were into birds or

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:35.440
mammals kind of exhausted
their subject matter.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:39.370
And if they were not willing
or open to evolving their

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:42.820
intellect or their eyes, they
simply found some new

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.080
discipline to go onto.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.140
I never run out of ideas.

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.280
It's not hard for me to, after
I've gotten up early in the

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.430
morning and I've photographed
portraits of people in

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:55.770
downtown Delhi in the old city,
as I'm walking back to

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:59.620
my bus looking at these old
walls, these old walls you see

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.170
everywhere where posters have
been posted over the last 20

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:07.300
years, and seeing the beauty
in that old decay.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:11.819
There's a story about rebirth
and renewal and reinvention in

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:13.180
yesterday's society.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:21.849
And that really comes from my
studying of American Abstract

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:26.210
Expressionism, looking at what
made those photos sing.

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:26.710
And they're.

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:29.300
by the way, among the
highest paid.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.760
If you're going to buy a
painting, American abstract

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.880
painters now are the hottest
thing on the market.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:40.680
So looking at the abstract now,
rather than the literal,

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.310
is where I'm taking
my audience and

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.230
the work I'm doing.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.780
And you'll see that come home
as we migrate through this

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.520
conversation.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.160
So in those abandoned buildings,
those old ruins,

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.570
are amazing photos to
be yet discovered.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:04.720
I have traveled to Havana twice
over the last 15 years.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:09.900
And Havana as a city is an
amazing place, great columns

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.670
and arches and verandas.

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.310
It was once the most beautiful
city on the planet.

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:19.150
And now as it's in decay, it's
a great place to go and

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:20.890
photograph from a
street level.

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:24.130
And by the way if you've ever
gone to Havana, you will know

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:25.140
this to be true.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.110
The people are the easiest
people ever to photograph on

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:28.960
the street.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.050
If they find out that you
are from America,

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:31.780
they embrace you.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:35.030
They want to invite you into
their homes to have food,

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.910
because they uniquely identified
with the United

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:40.500
States from the birth
of the nation.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:44.080
So Havana is a great place
to find the unexpected.

00:18:48.115 --> 00:18:51.590
You know, I'm opening a gallery
in Soho, New York--

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:54.090
any rate, this is a
wall in Havana.

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.260
And it's just all chipped,
old paint.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.580
But if you can tell yourself
this looks like a modern

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:03.590
Chinese painting, if you think
it, you can make it that way.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:06.870
And I would guarantee you if
this was well printed, and it

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:10.370
will be, and framed and matted
and signed in limited edition,

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:13.150
there will be somebody in New
York that will buy it and put

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:14.740
it in their living room.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.570
Is there any doubt about that?

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:17.870
There shouldn't be.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:21.620
There should be no
doubt about that.

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:25.460
So it's interesting that now
as I've come down to San

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.930
Francisco, I'm going to be going
out tomorrow to Treasure

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:32.300
Island and down to what they
call the Dogpatch and into the

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.540
back alleys of the Bay Area,
looking for graffiti where

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:40.590
it's built up over time, because
in that old graffiti

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:43.750
of different artists and
different statements are

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.310
photos I am mining.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:47.630
And what I'm going to do with
this work is turn it into

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:51.570
black and white and then take a
human nude and lay them over

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:54.890
the top of what I'm creating
and then hand-painting them

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:55.640
into the scene.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:59.620
As you will see, this is a new
direction based on what I'm

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.930
going to close this
lecture with.

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:07.910
The other lectures that I give
during a day-long course is

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:09.920
talking about how to
use wide angles.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.810
And this is maybe a little
more pedestrian.

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:14.100
But it's nonetheless
interesting.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.600
The next three shots are
actually taken with the same

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.600
lens, same subject.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.480
It's a abalone shell that
I've put out on

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.020
the Washington coast.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.340
I placed it there to illustrate
this point.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:27.270
And as I've moved in closer,
the relationship--

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:30.180
the background remains the same,
but the relationship of

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:33.560
the foreground subject becomes
obviously more dominant.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.520
So it's perspective
and point of view

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.780
that I'm talking about.

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:41.230
And as I shoot, as I travel
around, if I'm using a wide

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:44.430
angle, I'm trying to create a
sense of depth, a relationship

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:46.580
between the foreground elements,
the middle ground,

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:47.540
and the background.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.020
And the reason that's important
is the more depth

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:54.800
that I can convey within a
photo, your eye goes in and

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.510
out, forward and backwards.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:59.540
And that's what we as
photographers would want to

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:02.540
ascribe to have our audience,
the people ultimately that

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:03.750
look at our work.

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:06.630
We want their eye to stay with
the subject, to move

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:08.560
throughout the composition,
because you're

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.540
hooking them in.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.710
Otherwise, if they simply look
at a photo you've taken and

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:14.790
go, all right, got it,
move on, you haven't

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.100
connected with them.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.230
They wonder why you
took the picture.

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:20.660
But if you can just have them
move throughout the entire

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:24.160
composition, even if it's for
just a few seconds, you're

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.630
connecting with them.

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:29.320
And that's what any writer, any
sculptor, any painter or

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.730
dancer, you want to connect
with the audience that

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:33.230
ultimately looks at your work.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:35.990
So with a wide angle here, I've
gone back to a place I

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:40.130
love in the Nagano district
west of Tokyo.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:44.950
And about 25 years ago, snow
macaques discovered the luxury

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:48.840
of hot water on a cold day,
a natural hot springs that

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.420
leaches out of the mountains.

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:54.510
And so for the last 25 years,
these macaques and their

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:58.410
parents and their grandparents
have come down once during

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:01.510
every day in the winter and
gotten in, so much so that

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:04.622
they're so blase about people
you can virtually be within a

00:22:04.622 --> 00:22:07.120
half-inch with your camera,
shooting these macaques.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.300
And as long as you don't try
to touch them, you're good.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:15.740
You broach that one half-inch of
space between you and they

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:16.230
could bite you.

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:18.280
But as long as you're
reverent--

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.015
Here's a Weddell seal, for
instance, down along the

00:22:21.015 --> 00:22:22.630
Antarctic Peninsula.

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:25.460
So using that wide angle
perspective, getting in close,

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:29.570
moving slow, I did an entire
book using a wide angle

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:31.000
perspective.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.020
So when you hear about leading
lines, this is what we're

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:37.170
talking about, lines that you
can incorporate into your

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:39.850
composition and you're basically
directing them.

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:43.300
All these lines force your eye
to look, in this particular

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:48.480
case, to an old stone church
in the Italian Alps.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.080
So I often find ways of
directing the eye, because

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:55.910
what I'm trying to do is connect
you to the subject

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:57.870
that I chose to shoot.

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:00.900
So I'm leading you, with these
tracks, right to the animal

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.330
that made the tracks.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:04.860
I'm not filling the frame
with the bear.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.910
I'm not trying to spell it
out so overtly obviously.

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:11.610
I'm trying to bring you in,
allow you to discover it.

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:15.120
And so leading lines, these
tracks are like those leading

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.000
lines that take you there.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.540
Your eye cannot help
but go here.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.550
All these lines are forcing
your eye to stay there.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:26.930
This is a rural road on the
outskirts of Kyoto.

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:30.300
And you know, if you try to
look up here, you are

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.440
constantly being forced
to look back where I

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.890
want your eye to go.

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:37.570
So it's a pure form
of communication,

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:38.820
these leading lines.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.460
A lot of people think
photography is like, whatever

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.450
you want to shoot.

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:50.220
Everybody's got an opinion.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.750
And there's good shots
and bad shots.

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:55.860
But really, there is a lot of
formal lines of composition.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.950
There's ways you think about
a subject to bring it out.

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:01.920
There's ways you can cover a
subject that's less obvious

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:02.910
than the other ones.

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:07.010
I like to take photos and direct
your eye to where I

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:11.420
want it to go or have it
hidden as an agenda.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:14.080
There's a lot of different books
I've worked on over the

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:18.592
years that have very distinct
points of view.

00:24:18.592 --> 00:24:21.610
You know, a shot like this means
I had to get up early in

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:22.160
the morning.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.550
I gathered icons
of the culture.

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:26.460
This is in Benares, India.

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:31.340
And what the people of Benares
do is they buy little

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.870
offerings of marigolds that
have been pressed

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:35.000
into the shape of--

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.710
or banyan leaves pressed into
the shape of bolts.

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:42.040
In the evenings, they'll come
down to the river's edge, the

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.760
Ganges, and light the candles
and offer them to the waters,

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:49.430
because the waters, the sacred
waters of the Ganges,

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:50.700
represents the gods.

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:53.920
The gods, the Hindu gods, reside
in the Himalayas, from

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.210
which the Ganges comes from.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:59.780
So there's a beautiful history
and tradition that I try to

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.820
capture in a single photo.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:07.860
In Benares, during much of the
early part of the year,

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:11.070
there's a natural haze, buildup
from burning grasses

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:16.560
in the entire subcontinent of
India, which basically means

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:17.880
it's a beautiful sunrise.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.090
Every morning you get
this red orb.

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:23.050
For five seconds, you've got a
moment when the sun is coming

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:24.300
out, it's not so bright
that it's going

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.540
to create lens flare.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:27.040
And so you have to
get it right.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:29.990
So you have to get up early
enough that all these people

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:33.240
who initially stare at
you, gawking at you,

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.620
become bored of you.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.050
And then they start doing what
they normally would be doing,

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:38.220
which is talking.

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.640
And by the time I'm ready to
take the picture, they're

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.880
completely not paying attention,
which adds to this

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:49.900
whole image, the cinematic
view of culture.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.350
Here I'm laying in the snow on
the edge of the lake right at

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:53.440
the base of Mount Fuji.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:57.990
But by laying in the snow, I'm
gaining the perspective of the

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:02.080
reflection of Mount Fuji, the
frost-covered rocks, wide

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.900
angle as I was speaking
about before.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.990
So yeah, I could stand like
everybody else in this image

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:10.120
and just get the mountain
at sunrise.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.070
Or I can lay down and gain a
perspective that gives it a

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:14.980
little more subject
to work with.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:18.300
And what I said earlier really
applies, creating depth,

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.950
movement of the eye,
and just carefully

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:22.840
constructing the image.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:27.650
In this particular case, I'm
higher than low in the sense

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:31.880
simply because the flame would
obscure these two men that

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:35.540
have just spent the day coming
out of the heart of the Sahara

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.480
with their camels
laden with salt.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.380
So at the end of the day, at
dusk, they routinely will

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:41.790
build a fire.

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:46.320
They will commence their dinner
by having some tea.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.750
It's a very ritualistic
way of ending a day.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.780
So I wanted to be there
at the right time.

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.250
I had to wear a turban.

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:54.570
Why do you think I had
to wear a turban.

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:57.880
Do you think I was trying to
ape Lawrence of Arabia?

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:01.280
The reason I had to wear a
turban was the camels.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.260
If I was wearing a baseball
cap, those camels would

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:06.380
distrust me, literally.

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.200
So I had wear what they
would normally wear.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.960
And the camels were
pretty chill.

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:15.430
I was photographing Himba girls,
which are people of the

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:17.100
desert of Namibia.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.850
And I was originally going to
photograph their amazing

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:22.420
hairdos and all that
as portraits.

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:23.620
Then I saw their big feet.

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:28.080
They have big feet that are
created as a result of never

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.200
wearing shoes.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.790
And they live in an environment
of thorn acacias.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:38.790
So what it means is they get
big, fat, wide feet that are

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:40.400
analogous to tennis shoes.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.990
And so that became
the perspective.

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:45.900
So I instantly went from
portrait to more of a wide

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:50.900
angle perspective, paying to
the strength of the image.

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:51.080
OK.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.870
How did I get that shot?

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:56.750
Do I kind of wave magic fairy
dust at these animals?

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:59.150
Do they know who I am and they
want to be part of a National

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:00.680
Geographic spread?

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.140
I have a pretty good working
knowledge of animal behavior.

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.530
I studied--

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:07.290
when I was seven, I had
a little tree book,

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:08.350
mammal book, bird book.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:10.920
I virtually knew everything
that was in the forest.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.800
And over the years, as I've paid
attention, I know that

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.920
goats, wild goats, mountain
goats, and wild

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.180
sheep, crave salt.

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:22.180
That's why mineral licks occur
in the mountains where animals

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:23.500
come every day.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.430
And so I drank a lot of water.

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:30.090
I urinated on the
rock right here.

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:31.800
Anybody dispute that?

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:32.560
No, I did that.

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:33.880
I peed on the rock.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.620
And I set up with
a wide angle.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.310
And I got them as
they came in.

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.910
All right.

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:41.160
So drinking water is
critical to get

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.890
pictures of wild animals.

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:44.720
You paid your money.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.150
You paid good money to
be here today, right?

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:48.160
So you hear the story.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.810
But here the story was
about the habitat.

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:55.300
This was a book I was working
on called The Living Wild.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:58.080
And for the text, I had George
Schaller, who is one of the

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.460
world's foremost wildlife
biologists.

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:03.640
Jane Goodall, who you know
through her work with

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:08.960
chimpanzees, John Sawhill out of
the Nature Conservancy, and

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.490
Bill Conway, who created the
Wildlife Conservation Society.

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:16.240
They all wrote original text
about the need to preserve

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:20.130
more land than we currently
have under protection.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:24.650
Simply put, animals in a habitat
without proper habitat

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:26.420
will go extinct.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.390
So from that perspective,
I started

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:29.980
shooting with wide angles.

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:33.520
Wherever I could sneak up or
stay and wait for animals to

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.260
come to me, I would do it so
that I could shoot not just

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:38.860
the goats, but the mountain
ridge, the clouds, and

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.310
everything around it.

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:44.230
Historically, we as wildlife
photographers would focus only

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:46.480
on the animal and anything
before it or

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.990
behind was out of focus.

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:53.580
Now the habitat was as critical
as the animals.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:57.500
So in this series I got close.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:02.110
And that was the style
of the entire book.

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:07.130
Traveling to South Georgia
Island, to the Amazon, I did

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:09.700
some things that are, as I look
back, saying, God, that

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.240
was really stupid.

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:15.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:17.430
ART WOLFE: And I realize
that these are caiman.

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:20.390
These are not alligators or
crocodile that historically

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:21.760
would kill people.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.460
But they do bite.

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:23.350
And they can bite.

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:25.670
With a big mouth full of
teeth, they can bite.

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:29.360
So they were there because
ranchers in the Pantanal Marsh

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:33.080
of Brazil would come down at
the end of a day and huck

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.210
chicken bones at the caiman.

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:36.690
And that was their
afternoon fun.

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:38.530
They didn't have TV back then.

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:40.230
And so I went down there.

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:42.880
And all these animals came
crawling out of the river and

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.090
wanted chicken bones.

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:46.780
But it was just my skinny little
body and a camera.

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:48.420
So they were a little
disappointed.

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.290
They were ready for dinner.

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:51.680
This was probably the stupidest

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:52.840
thing I've ever done.

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.650
These are badges of stupidity,
not honor.

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:59.670
By getting down close to a
waterhole and waiting for

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:05.170
elephants to come out, you
cannot outrun a bull elephant.

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:08.590
Just simply put, you
cannot outrun one.

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:11.760
So you have to kind of be there
and you're committed to

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:12.710
getting the shots.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:15.000
But some of these big boys
would be annoyed.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.600
And they would come my way
and just kick dirt all

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.950
over the top of me.

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:21.930
And I would have a guy that
was like 40 feet behind me

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:23.460
saying, don't run.

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:27.680
Don't run, because if you run,
you create a chase instinct.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:31.380
And you don't want to try
to outrun and elephant.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:34.050
I would crawl out on the rocks
of the Galapagos Islands and

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:37.000
wait for marine iguanas to
come out of the waters.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.740
And they spent the entire day
under the ocean eating algae.

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:44.040
That's what marine
iguanas eat.

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.500
And then towards the end of
the day, when the light is

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:47.840
beautiful, they come out.

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.810
They warm their bodies
in the sun.

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:53.690
And they're sneezing, sneezing,
sneezing, because

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:56.450
they expend salt that they've
accrued during the course of

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:58.720
the day underwater through
their nose.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.980
So if you get close like this,
you are virtually covered in

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:05.090
salty snot from a lizard.

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:08.380
So if that's the lifestyle and
that's what you want to do,

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.340
this is what you would do.

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:14.660
So I traveled all over the
planet shooting animals in

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:18.520
their habitat with a wide
angle perspective.

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.610
Migrations was a book
about patterns.

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:23.070
It was inspired by the
work of MC Escher.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:25.470
And for the most part,
I got in ultralights.

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:28.550
I shot patterns of animals.

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:31.200
And flying around in an
ultralight in Africa just

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.230
above flocks of flamingos or
herds of wildebeests or Cape

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:36.880
buffalo, it was a
great project.

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.870
But it was really
about patterns.

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:43.380
Now, this book became very
controversial because in 30 of

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:47.540
the images out of 100, we
incorporated what we were

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:50.270
calling at the time in the
introduction digital

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:54.190
illustration, where we now at
the beginning of the digital

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:57.400
era would put like three or four
birds in here if there

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:00.400
was no birds and it created a
hole, a disruption, if you

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.180
will, of the pattern.

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.900
We would clone animals from one
area of the composition

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.040
and put it in there.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.910
And this was total blasphemy.

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:11.470
We had hate letters from
all around the world.

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:14.090
And on one side of the fence
were people that just hated

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:15.050
the fact that we did this.

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:19.430
Even though we identified it
in the introduction, people

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:20.870
hated the fact that
we did this.

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:23.440
And on the other side of the
coin, it won international

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.420
design awards.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:27.840
Never so clearly was the
division between art and

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:28.880
natural history.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.490
If we had called the book
Wallpaper nobody would have

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:33.110
complained.

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:34.930
But we called it Migrations.

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:37.070
But for the most part and
everything you have seen

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:40.310
except for that zebra
shot, was unaltered.

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:43.460
Everything was preconceived,
getting above shooting down at

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:44.710
patterns of animals.

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:53.220
And as an extension from that
point of view, I'm moving

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.770
forward on a new book, and
you'll see this in a minute,

00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:58.990
where I'm getting above cultures
and shooting down.

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:03.080
So yeah, here it's almost
obscuring the view.

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.480
You're looking at three
donkeys covered

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.100
in carpets in Morocco.

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:10.380
From a ground perspective, this
would have been a more

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:12.420
traditional point of view.

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:15.840
So now I'm again doing what I
suggested I wanted to do,

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.929
which is abstracting the
subject, forcing you to kind

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:21.110
of figure out what you're
looking at.

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:24.310
When I photographed these monks
out at a monastery in

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:28.170
Kathmandu, Nepal, the person
at the hotel that I was

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:30.090
staying at looked at it and
said, what is that?

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:31.440
Is that a flower?

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.860
And he thought it was
like a dahlia.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.130
And I said, it's monks.

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:37.110
And it was totally different
than any way he had ever seen

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:38.300
monks before.

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:41.820
So that's the trick and that's
the challenge is to constantly

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:45.370
come up with perspectives,
points of views, that haven't

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:46.639
quite been done before.

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:48.530
That's what gets
me out of bed.

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:49.969
That's what motivates me.

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:52.969
And in some cases, like this,
I've had to build platforms

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:58.700
over an area and bring in 200
dancers directly below me.

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:02.830
And here there was an old ladder
in a Rajasthani village

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:04.180
out in India.

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:07.230
And we just laid it across
the top of a roof.

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:09.390
And I had two people stand
on one end of the ladder.

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:12.840
And then I crawled out on the
other to shoot straight down

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.220
on these women around a
medallion that was on the

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.850
courtyard floor.

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:22.330
So it's combining culture,
natural history, with a sense

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:25.610
of design and history and art
that is where I'm chipping and

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:29.200
carving out my niche.

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:33.540
Vanishing Act was how animals
really are seen in nature.

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:37.160
They're not out there
distinguished against a branch

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.180
clearly focused and
everything's out.

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:40.450
It's like this.

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:44.040
So that book was really a
challenge to my audience.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.230
You know, in the previous
book it was about

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:47.600
migrations and patterns.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.460
In the book before that it was
the wide angle perspective.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:55.790
In this book, it was hiding
the animal in plain sight.

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:59.570
And of all the books I've ever
worked on, people started

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:02.610
squirming and looking and then
like yelling out, left-hand

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:04.830
corner, leopard.

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:07.680
And they could not
help themselves.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:11.040
They wanted to find the animal
first and demonstrate that

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.690
they were smarter than anybody
else in the room.

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:17.160
So yeah, there's a leopard
right actually here.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.650
This is so far from where you're
sitting that you can't

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:21.740
see it, even if you
knew where it was.

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:24.480
A Great Grey Owl, sitting
on a tree.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:28.130
So we're showing natural
evolution, the concept is eat

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:29.270
or be eaten.

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:32.290
So there's benefits for an
animal to really disguise

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:36.260
itself or hide in
the environment.

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:39.780
I would photograph a composition
because I knew

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:41.440
white shiny objects--

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.640
you humans are really
simple people.

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:46.680
You know, you're attracted to
glitz and bling, right?

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.440
So if there were shiny leaves,
it would pull your eye away

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.370
from the baby shore bird hiding
in the leaf litter

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:54.000
along the Arctic river.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.090
These are thorny devils that
are broken up by light and

00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:59.330
dark areas throughout
the composition.

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:03.110
So the entirety of the book was
about hiding the animal in

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:04.490
front of you.

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:09.080
There's a little seahorse that
wasn't known to science 15

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:12.210
years ago that's no bigger than
your little fingernail.

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:17.120
So I got in coral reefs 60 feet
below the surface of the

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.040
reefs in New Guinea.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.310
I found scorpion fish and stone
fish and all those kind

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:25.260
of creatures that live in the
coral reefs are highly

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:30.340
decorative and camouflaged, so
that they can eat other little

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:33.148
critters that come their way.

00:37:33.148 --> 00:37:35.730
Do you see it?

00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:37.570
You're looking for an animal
around this rock.

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:39.790
So I hid the animal by scale.

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:41.790
There's a polar bear up there
hiding in the rocks.

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:47.060
A nightjar on the rock
in front of you.

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:53.730
If that fox closes its eyes, it
blends in with the habitat.

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:57.110
There's two ptarmigan here.

00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:00.070
So that book alone took
about nine years.

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:03.380
When I work on a book, I usually
commit about nine

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:04.620
years to a project.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:08.520
And the most recent one that's
coming out in September of

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.460
next year is called Earth
Is My Witness.

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:14.370
And it's a look back over the
years to some of the most

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:18.260
memorable moments I've had
around the globe in the genres

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:20.190
of culture, wildlife,
and landscape.

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:26.600
So what I try to do with the
work and the time on this

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:31.170
planet is to inspire, to uplift,
to inform people that

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:32.270
look at my work.

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:35.260
It was stated in the
introduction that I photograph

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:36.100
beautiful scenes.

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.680
Well, there's a reason I
do photograph beauty.

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.880
I photograph destruction
and carnage as well.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.110
But I don't choose to
show those within a

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:47.380
context of a book.

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:49.870
I think that there's enough
negative news coming through

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:53.270
our airwaves every day that I
choose to do the work that

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:55.850
uplifts people, inspires
them to travel.

00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:59.090
And when I teach workshops,
they're usually geared towards

00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:02.550
people in the second part of
their lives that have been

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:05.430
successful in their chosen
endeavor but now they're

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:06.320
looking for passion.

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:10.030
They're for looking for passion
in their lives.

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:14.030
Because of the very nature,
they're in my rooms, they are

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:15.480
there because of photography.

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:19.060
And I say, do not treat
photography like a hobby that

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:22.840
you're just relegating to once
a week or every two weeks.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.190
Jump in it with both feet.

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:26.000
And live it.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.070
Live your life around
photography.

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:32.360
And cultivate the passion of
it, because it's all about

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:37.160
really keeping your psychology
healthy.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.560
In a time of a lot of stress and
a lot of frustrations, I

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.030
think creative people--

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:46.840
that's the reason that the
Impressionist painters that I

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:50.070
cited lived into their late
'80s and early '90s.

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:54.920
At that time, they were living
20 to 25 years longer than the

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.080
average person.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.290
And I think that's true today.

00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:01.070
The creative types tend to have
happier, longer lives.

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:02.060
Poets do.

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:02.860
Writers do.

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.140
Dancers do.

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.720
Photographers do.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:10.930
So in this book, I celebrate
humanity in all its glory.

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:13.870
And I'm not a religious person,
but I can navigate

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:17.890
Islam or Hinduism, Buddhism,
Christianity with impunity.

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:20.760
I don't have an agenda,
in other words.

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:25.530
I see it all as good and all
races as good, so you see that

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:28.390
reflected in the work
that I present from

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:29.640
throughout the world.

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:36.140
In India, in early March,
Holi is celebrated.

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:39.970
One particular temple in the
center of India is this

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:40.880
ancient temple.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:45.030
And 5,000 people cram in there
and throw paint at each other

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:47.890
and water's flying and it's
just a great time.

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:52.630
In Jaipur they paint elephants
to look like other creators.

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:54.790
I've traveled many times
to Myanmar, starting

00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:55.790
about 10 years ago.

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:58.760
It's a country waiting
to be discovered.

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.170
It's changing fast.

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:03.770
Hillary Clinton and Obama went
there in the last year.

00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:05.410
And suddenly it's
the place to go.

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:08.970
So if you ever entertain
thoughts of going to Myanmar,

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:11.240
now would be the good
time to do it.

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:14.520
I love working around Buddhist
monks, simply because they're

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.030
so chilled.

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:18.250
You can ask if you can
photograph this or that, and

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:20.080
they just go, whatever.

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:21.200
Fine.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.910
And so it's great to
work around that.

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:31.060
These photos all have been
photographed in Myanmar.

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:33.700
And then in the landscapes
section, it's going around the

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:37.090
world and capturing moments like
a total eclipse of the

00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:40.970
sun in southern Australia 40
minutes before sunset, which

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:44.380
meant I could incorporate the
eclipse within the context of

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:50.270
the earth, which is a rare
view of a solar eclipse.

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:55.000
Anywhere from Antarctica to the
Arctic, tops of exploding

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.640
volcanoes, I've gone and capture
the earth's deserts,

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.330
mountains, rain forests.

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:05.450
This is in Namibia, where the
sand dunes rise 1,000 feet in

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:07.720
this beautiful orange
ochre color.

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:10.480
Beisa oryx or gemsboks
are at the base.

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.440
So I've been very lucky.

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:17.800
I was raised in Seattle, on the
outskirts of Seattle, in

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.610
the early '50s.

00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:22.290
Like many families at that
period of time, there wasn't

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:24.060
very much money in our family.

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:27.000
I never dreamed that I would
be able to have traveled as

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.210
far as I have.

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:32.260
The camera that I adopted early
on has literally become

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:37.080
the passport into the world's
cultures and landscapes.

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:40.700
And I have had the great fortune
to be healthy and have

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:45.250
a lot of drive, so all those
things are part and parcel to

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:47.550
a life that I've lived.

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:51.640
And I'm very, very fortunate
to have lived that life.

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:55.680
And more importantly, being open
and receptive to evolving

00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:00.310
my work, my intellect, my ideas
to find subjects that

00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:04.190
haven't been shot or go places
that haven't been traveled is

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:07.320
part of who I am as
a photographer

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:09.480
but also as an educator.

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:13.180
Giant river otters in the
Amazon, jaguars coming down to

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:17.730
the river's edge, all those are
a monthly routine for me.

00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:19.750
A month ago, I was
down in Patagonia

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:21.240
photographing wild lions.

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:26.030
Next week I'm travelling to
Borneo and the week after

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:28.280
that, North Australia.

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.420
So I continue to travel.

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:32.410
These are the mountain lion
shots I just shot down in

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:35.740
Patagonia, completely wild.

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:38.380
Here I was about from here to
this gentleman with the camera

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:42.320
away, and this mountain lion,
a male, came out of some

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:45.740
shrubbery, looked at me, and
stared at me for about three

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:47.640
minutes, and then just
disappeared.

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:54.470
A bear up in Alaska last year
has brought three cubs.

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:57.000
And she's watching a river
otter with a pup

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.440
move across the grass.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:00.680
She's concerned about
what it was.

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:03.110
The cubs are waiting
for instructions.

00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:04.820
Are we going to run away or
are we going to stay here?

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:05.030
What ?

00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.285
What?

00:44:05.285 --> 00:44:05.840
What?

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:07.000
And then she just relaxed.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.500
And then they start
playing again.

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.510
I've been there on the first day
cubs are brought out of a

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:15.890
den in the Arctic, up in
northern Manitoba.

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:23.570
Two months ago I was in Haido
photographing whooper swans

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:25.200
and Steller sea eagles.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.040
So it's a life that's
enjoyable and

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:31.660
full of exciting things.

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:35.310
And the last body of work was
inspired from work I did 20

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:39.020
years ago in remote areas
of Africa called Tribes.

00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:42.630
And now I'm going back with
a different perspective.

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:45.280
Thomas Knoll, who wrote
Photoshop, is a good friend of

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.190
mine and travels with
me frequently.

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:50.050
And we went back to some of
these remote cultures, showed

00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:52.880
them photos of their fathers
that I had photographed 20

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.180
years before.

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:57.920
And now it's collaborating
with them on looking at

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:02.470
cultures and humans, nudes,
in a new way.

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:05.780
So abstracting the culture from
that above perspective

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:11.110
that you saw early, now I'm
extending into photographing

00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:12.570
the human form.

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:14.680
But it's not sexual
or even sensual.

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:15.980
It's more theatrical.

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:20.200
It's using camouflage
and abstraction

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:23.380
to photograph nudes.

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:27.230
I hate to say the word nudes,
because it instantly implies

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:29.250
something that I'm not
trying to mean.

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:30.980
The human form would
be a better way.

00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:34.340
I'm incorporating
Jackson Pollock.

00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:36.940
So from where you're sitting
looking at this, it may not

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:37.430
make sense.

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:41.530
But you could imagine a giant
print on a moderate house and

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:43.710
there's three people
painted within.

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:46.090
And that's that moment, that
aha moment, that there's

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:48.570
actually more there than
meets the eye.

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:52.270
So I'm incorporating my
knowledge of tribal designs

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:54.950
throughout the planet and
putting humans in it.

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:58.640
Now these are PC photos, because
this will be broadcast

00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:59.460
through Google+.

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:03.660
So there's a lot more
nudity, if you will.

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:09.050
I'm showing you more tamed
down versions of it.

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:13.090
And I'm also learning how to
clay people, cover them in

00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:17.840
clay, dry the clay, and do
something analogous to

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:20.860
Vanishing Act.

00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:22.690
And the gallery in New
York will open with

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:25.790
this work in September.

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:27.940
And if I can raise enough money,
we'll create a film

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:31.070
that will be broadcast on
either Showtime or PBS,

00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:32.810
depending on how we edit it.

00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:34.620
So that's my little talk.

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:38.180
It was never put together
or talked in this

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:39.130
group of photos before.

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:41.030
But as you can see,
I just talk.

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.830
I just talk.

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:43.010
And now it's your turn.

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:45.990
Anybody that has an idea
or a question or

00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:47.180
anything, don't be shy.

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:48.595
None of you are shy.

00:46:48.595 --> 00:46:52.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:55.870
ART WOLFE: Thank you.

00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:59.270
AUDIENCE: How to be a good
judge of your pictures?

00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:02.200
ART WOLFE: How to be a good
judge of your pictures?

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:06.520
I think time and distance gives
somebody perspective.

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:09.990
You know, when you go out and
you take a picture, it's

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:12.010
pretty fresh in your mind
and you're pretty

00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:12.900
excited about it.

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:16.510
But after two weeks if you look
at it again, it may not

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:19.470
either be as good as you thought
or it actually may

00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:21.710
have hidden things that
you didn't even see.

00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:25.750
So I think creating a
perspective is a good starting

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:28.560
point for judging
your own work.

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:32.220
Taking classes and getting
involved in the

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:34.130
dialogue is a good way.

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:37.160
And I think that Google+ is
going to be championing that.

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:38.150
It has been.

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:40.760
That open dialogue between
people that do this

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:44.630
professionally and people that
are getting into it, the terms

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:48.540
they use, if you pay attention,
you will learn to

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:51.020
look at your work objectively
and see what ones

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:52.350
are better than not.

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:54.650
AUDIENCE: In talking about the
Impressionists, you were

00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:59.170
talking about using motion to
help blur your images and get

00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:00.930
that kind of feel.

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:04.160
Have you considered or
experimented with actually

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:07.450
changing focus to get a more
Impressionistic feel?

00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:10.030
ART WOLFE: You know, it's a good
question, because if you

00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:14.280
put a photo out of focus, then
theoretically everything

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.570
within the frame is
going to be out of

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:17.830
focus, I believe, right?

00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:22.200
And what I said earlier in that
context is the ones that

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:26.440
really work are when there's one
monk that's sharp and by

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:29.540
contrast, then the rest of it
can be wildly out of focus.

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:33.380
If everything's out of focus,
it's more static and it looks

00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:36.770
frustrating, because the human
eye, our eyes, our intellects,

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:38.210
want to have a starting point.

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:42.410
We are searching in that frame
for that point of reference

00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:45.210
from which the rest of
the frame can be

00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:46.090
wildly out of focus.

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:48.360
But I don't know that
just simply putting

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.320
something out to focus--

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:53.590
a lot of the mystery and the
beauty of shooting those long

00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:57.990
Impressionist shots is they're
creating movement of the eye.

00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:01.170
And when it's simply out of
focus, if it's a static shot,

00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:03.060
is going to be a static shot.

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:06.020
AUDIENCE: So perhaps using
extreme depth of field

00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:08.130
reduction on a long--

00:49:08.130 --> 00:49:11.360
you were showing very much
with a wide angle lens

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:15.950
foreground and distance, use
something like that with a

00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:17.810
very tight depth of
field control?

00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:19.690
ART WOLFE: I would stop talking
right now, because I

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:21.300
think you're on to something
and you should

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:22.550
be doing that book.

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:29.040
Honestly, when I give a talk,
most of the people in my

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:31.610
audience are 40- to
70-year-olds.

00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:36.030
To give a talk before people
that are younger than me and

00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:38.450
very smart people,
I love this.

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:41.110
Nobody would have ever come up
with that as a suggestion.

00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:42.630
So thank you for that.

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:44.930
I would have to kind of execute
it and see if that

00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:45.620
would work.

00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:47.960
But it is worthy a try.

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:49.400
Thank you for the
contribution.

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:50.790
AUDIENCE: Could you talk a
little bit about the equipment

00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:51.690
that you use?

00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:54.110
And have you tried a
plenoptic camera?

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:54.930
Do you have an opinion
about that?

00:49:54.930 --> 00:50:00.040
ART WOLFE: I am completely
camera illiterate.

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:03.250
As I said from the get-go, I
know 5% or 4% of what my

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:04.570
camera does.

00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:09.970
I am so uninterested in
technology that it's painful.

00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:11.160
Seriously.

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:13.480
People that take my class often
know way more about the

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.680
cameras and technology
than I do.

00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:18.540
I don't even know what
that camera was.

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:19.570
Seriously.

00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:23.340
So yeah, I mean, nobody is a
complete package, right?

00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:26.180
I mean, God, I've got a
great build and I'm

00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:28.900
just drop-dead gorgeous.

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:30.250
And I can take a composition.

00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:33.404
But I don't have that technology
side of me.

00:50:33.404 --> 00:50:35.093
AUDIENCE: Any place you haven't
been to yet that you

00:50:35.093 --> 00:50:36.450
want to go?

00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:38.100
ART WOLFE: There's a lot of
places I have not been to.

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:40.260
I have not been to Egypt.

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:41.930
I have not been to Spain.

00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:43.460
I have not been to places
that people just

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:44.410
say, are you kidding?

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:46.630
This is where we went last
year for our vacation.

00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:48.200
So there's places that
I've been back to.

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:52.430
I've been back to China since
1984 15 times, or

00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:53.680
Antarctica 12 times.

00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:58.120
I go back to places that tend to
deliver, knowing full well

00:50:58.120 --> 00:50:59.050
that I'll go to Spain.

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:04.000
I know everything about Spain,
having studied it, and Egypt.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.640
And know where I want to go?

00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:07.030
I haven't been to Jerusalem.

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:08.400
I want to go Oman.

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:09.920
I want to go to places
I've not been.

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.920
And you know, I do have
a few more years.

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:13.570
And I'll go there.

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:14.820
But that's a good question.

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:18.440
All right.

00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:19.110
Well, listen.

00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:21.240
Thank you very much
for coming today.

00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:21.930
You honor me.

00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:22.530
Thank you very much.

00:51:22.530 --> 00:51:23.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:24.980
Thank you.
