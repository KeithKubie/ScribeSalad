Vsauce! Fortune cookies are a staple of Chinese
food here in America but they're not from

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.839
China. The modern fortune cookie was actually
invented in California.

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:15.869
One man who claimed credit for the invention
was Makoto Hagiwara - a Japanese man who said

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:21.250
he based the cookie off of grilled rice wafers
called senbei. Yet, the only place where fortune

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.910
cookies aren't considered Chinese is...China.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.359
English muffins were invented by Samuel Bath
Thomas in New York City - not England. Thomas

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.730
immigrated from England to New York City in
1880 where he opened up a bakery and created

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.180
the toaster crumpet.&nbsp; Which can now be found
in most english-speaking supermarkets around

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.270
the world as English muffins.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.430
Russian Dressing was invented... in New Hampshire.&nbsp;
James E. Colburn created the mayonnaise and

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.559
ketchup-based dressing sometime in the 1910s
and named it Russian because it originally

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.590
included a small amount of a Russian ingredient
- caviar.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.100
The French Dip sandwich is not only not from
France - apparently they don't even know or

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.120
probably care what it is. Two restaurants
in Los Angeles claim ownership of creating

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.340
the French Dip which consists of roast beef
on a French Baguette - dripped in au jus or

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.610
beef juice. Cole's Pacific Electric Buffet
claims they invented it in 1908 while one

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.250
of Philippe The Original's origin stories
claims that one of the cooks accidentally

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.070
dropped a roast beef sandwich in some meat
drippings and the customer loved it.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.760
German chocolate cake is named after American
chocolate maker - Sam German. In 1852 German

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.500
developed a dark baking chocolate and it was
originally called German's chocolate cake

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.770
- nothing to do with Germany.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.860
Although not really a foreign food the origins
of Doritos are interesting in that they were

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.230
invented at Disneyland. Casa de Fritos cut
up and fried surplus tortillas and added a

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.550
seasoning similar to Mexican chilaquiles.
The Vice President of Marketing at Frito-Lay

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.530
noticed their popularity and cut a deal to
start making them locally eventually becoming

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.930
so popular that they released Doritos nationwide
in 1966.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.759
There's a saying that something native to
the US is as American as apple pie. But Apple

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:17.159
Pie recipes date back to 14th century England.
So maybe we should start starting as American

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:24.159
as German Chocolate Cake or fortune cookies?
And as always - thanks for watching.
