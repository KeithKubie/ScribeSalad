00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.134
Does the following table
represent a linear equation?

00:00:05.134 --> 00:00:06.550
So let's see what's
going on here.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.360
When x is negative 7, y is 4.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.900
Then when x is
negative 3, y is 3.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.960
So let's see what happened
to what our change in x was.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.880
So our change in
x-- and I could even

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.080
write it over here,
our change in x.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.050
So going from negative
7 to negative 3,

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.610
we had an increase in 4 in x.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.510
And what was our change in y?

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.000
And this triangle, that's
just the Greek letter delta.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.450
It's shorthand for "change in."

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.380
Well, our change in y
when x increased by 4,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.680
our y-value went from 4 to 3.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.470
So our change in
y is negative 1.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.870
Now, in order for this
to be a linear equation,

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.580
the ratio between our change
in y and our change in x

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.370
has to be constant.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.780
So our change in
y over change in x

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.210
for any two points
in this equation

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.730
or any two points in the table
has to be the same constant.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.930
When x changed by 4, y
changed by negative 1.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.100
Or when y changed by
negative 1, x changed by 4.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.310
So we have to have a
constant change in y

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.300
with respect to x
of negative 1/4.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.210
Let's see if this is true.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.900
So the next two points, when
I go from negative 3 to 1,

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.520
once again I'm
increasing x by 4.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.520
And once again, I'm
decreasing y by negative 1.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.110
So we have that same ratio.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.270
Now, let's look at
this last point.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.670
When we go from 1 to
7 in the x-direction,

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.640
we are increasing by 6.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.390
And when we go from 2 to 1,
we are still decreasing by 1.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.140
So now this ratio, going
from this third point

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.940
to this fourth point,
is negative 1/6.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:41.800
So it is not.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.840
So just for this last
point right over here,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.660
for this last point, our change
in y over change in x, or I

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.710
should say, really, between
these last two points

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.710
right over here, our change
in y over change in x--

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.036
let me clear this up.

00:01:57.036 --> 00:01:57.910
Let me make it clear.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.500
So just between these
last-- in magenta.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.080
Just between these last
two points over here,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.410
our change in y is negative
1, and our change in x is 6.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.620
So we have a different rate of
change of y with respect to x.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.880
Because we had a different
rate of change of y

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.940
with respect to x, or ratio
between our change in y

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.560
and change in x, this is
not a linear equation.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.490
No, not a linear equation.
