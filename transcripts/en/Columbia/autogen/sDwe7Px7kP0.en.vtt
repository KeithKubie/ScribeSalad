01:04:02.170 --> 01:04:05.970
questions if I get you one is about the
especially dire consequences of the

01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:05.980
especially dire consequences of the
 

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:16.590
especially dire consequences of the
American alliance with Israel the I said

01:04:16.590 --> 01:04:16.600
American alliance with Israel the I said
 

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:21.410
American alliance with Israel the I said
that there are other lobbies that are

01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:21.420
that there are other lobbies that are
 

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:24.390
that there are other lobbies that are
able to get their goals in American

01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:24.400
able to get their goals in American
 

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.970
able to get their goals in American
foreign policy and some people might say

01:04:26.970 --> 01:04:26.980
foreign policy and some people might say
 

01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:28.620
foreign policy and some people might say
well those lobbies don't actually have

01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:28.630
well those lobbies don't actually have
 

01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:32.099
well those lobbies don't actually have
dire consequences but I would disagree

01:04:32.099 --> 01:04:32.109
dire consequences but I would disagree
 

01:04:32.109 --> 01:04:36.170
dire consequences but I would disagree
with you totally I think that the

01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:36.180
with you totally I think that the
 

01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:40.950
with you totally I think that the
ability of American ethnic groups to

01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960
ability of American ethnic groups to
 

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:45.240
ability of American ethnic groups to
shape an often veto American policy

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:45.250
shape an often veto American policy
 

01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:47.160
shape an often veto American policy
toward its closest allies throughout the

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:47.170
toward its closest allies throughout the
 

01:04:47.170 --> 01:04:49.290
toward its closest allies throughout the
Cold War would have to be considered a

01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:49.300
Cold War would have to be considered a
 

01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:52.740
Cold War would have to be considered a
pretty significant consequence so I

01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:52.750
pretty significant consequence so I
 

01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:56.370
pretty significant consequence so I
think you're not right if you if you

01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:56.380
think you're not right if you if you
 

01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:58.640
think you're not right if you if you
think that there's just something really

01:04:58.640 --> 01:04:58.650
think that there's just something really
 

01:04:58.650 --> 01:05:02.790
think that there's just something really
weirdly distinctive about this policy I

01:05:02.790 --> 01:05:02.800
weirdly distinctive about this policy I
 

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:05.370
weirdly distinctive about this policy I
mean you know you probably are not aware

01:05:05.370 --> 01:05:05.380
mean you know you probably are not aware
 

01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:09.900
mean you know you probably are not aware
of this but the term the Israel lobby is

01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:09.910
of this but the term the Israel lobby is
 

01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:14.760
of this but the term the Israel lobby is
I think meant to be an evocation of a

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:14.770
I think meant to be an evocation of a
 

01:05:14.770 --> 01:05:17.070
I think meant to be an evocation of a
very powerful lobby that was always

01:05:17.070 --> 01:05:17.080
very powerful lobby that was always
 

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.560
very powerful lobby that was always
spoken of in

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:18.570
spoken of in
 

01:05:18.570 --> 01:05:20.900
spoken of in
in kind of demonizing terms in the past

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:20.910
in kind of demonizing terms in the past
 

01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:22.850
in kind of demonizing terms in the past
in American foreign policy that was

01:05:22.850 --> 01:05:22.860
in American foreign policy that was
 

01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:25.910
in American foreign policy that was
called the China Lobby and the idea was

01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920
called the China Lobby and the idea was
 

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.590
called the China Lobby and the idea was
that the China Lobby had kind of

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:27.600
that the China Lobby had kind of
 

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:31.700
that the China Lobby had kind of
dictated American policy in a in a very

01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:31.710
dictated American policy in a in a very
 

01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:34.880
dictated American policy in a in a very
dangerous way by creating a decades-long

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:34.890
dangerous way by creating a decades-long
 

01:05:34.890 --> 01:05:37.670
dangerous way by creating a decades-long
estrangement between the United States

01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680
estrangement between the United States
 

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:41.060
estrangement between the United States
and communist China well you can go into

01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:41.070
and communist China well you can go into
 

01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:44.450
and communist China well you can go into
the historical you know how what really

01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:44.460
the historical you know how what really
 

01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:45.950
the historical you know how what really
produced that estrangement between

01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960
produced that estrangement between
 

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.630
produced that estrangement between
United States and kind of China and I

01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:47.640
United States and kind of China and I
 

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:50.030

think it's the China lobbies role is not

01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:50.040
think it's the China lobbies role is not
 

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.040
think it's the China lobbies role is not
quite what it is thought to be in

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:52.050
quite what it is thought to be in
 

01:05:52.050 --> 01:05:54.020
quite what it is thought to be in
popular mythology but you certainly

01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:54.030
popular mythology but you certainly
 

01:05:54.030 --> 01:05:55.340
popular mythology but you certainly
couldn't say that that didn't have dire

01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:55.350
couldn't say that that didn't have dire
 

01:05:55.350 --> 01:05:57.950
couldn't say that that didn't have dire
consequences I mean this is just a

01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960
consequences I mean this is just a
 

01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:00.740
consequences I mean this is just a
reality is that often these policies are

01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:00.750
reality is that often these policies are
 

01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:05.600

01:06:39.090 --> 01:06:40.580
it seems to me it's incomplete to say
the very least to say that this shows

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:40.590
the very least to say that this shows
 

01:06:40.590 --> 01:06:44.270
the very least to say that this shows
the power of the Israel lobby over the

01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:44.280
the power of the Israel lobby over the
 

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:45.800
the power of the Israel lobby over the
American media I think it just shows the

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:45.810
American media I think it just shows the
 

01:06:45.810 --> 01:06:47.930
American media I think it just shows the
defects of the American media if you

01:06:47.930 --> 01:06:47.940
defects of the American media if you
 

01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:49.760
defects of the American media if you
don't mind my saying so and I'll tell

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:49.770
don't mind my saying so and I'll tell
 

01:06:49.770 --> 01:06:52.090
don't mind my saying so and I'll tell
you a little bit as an example of this

01:06:52.090 --> 01:06:52.100
you a little bit as an example of this
 

01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:55.460
you a little bit as an example of this
just a little proof of it I read a

01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:55.470
just a little proof of it I read a
 

01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:57.650
just a little proof of it I read a
couple of articles about what president

01:06:57.650 --> 01:06:57.660
couple of articles about what president
 

01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:00.080
couple of articles about what president
Bollinger said in introducing the

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:00.090
Bollinger said in introducing the
 

01:07:00.090 --> 01:07:02.540
Bollinger said in introducing the
President of Iran and I thought man

01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:02.550
President of Iran and I thought man
 

01:07:02.550 --> 01:07:07.190
President of Iran and I thought man
that's strange and then I read his

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200
that's strange and then I read his
 

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:09.500
that's strange and then I read his
statement and it struck me is really

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:09.510
statement and it struck me is really
 

01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:13.070
statement and it struck me is really
very different from what was reported in

01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:13.080
very different from what was reported in
 

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:17.519
very different from what was reported in
the in the media now I think you know he

01:07:17.519 --> 01:07:17.529
the in the media now I think you know he
 

01:07:17.529 --> 01:07:19.779
the in the media now I think you know he
probably should have anticipated that it

01:07:19.779 --> 01:07:19.789
probably should have anticipated that it
 

01:07:19.789 --> 01:07:21.039
probably should have anticipated that it
would be covered in the way that it was

01:07:21.039 --> 01:07:21.049
would be covered in the way that it was
 

01:07:21.049 --> 01:07:23.709
would be covered in the way that it was
but you know when the American media

01:07:23.709 --> 01:07:23.719
but you know when the American media
 

01:07:23.719 --> 01:07:26.640
but you know when the American media
failed to cover a problem perfectly

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:26.650
failed to cover a problem perfectly
 

01:07:26.650 --> 01:07:29.499
failed to cover a problem perfectly
there are more parsimonious explanations

01:07:29.499 --> 01:07:29.509
there are more parsimonious explanations
 

01:07:29.509 --> 01:07:31.839
there are more parsimonious explanations
and looking for the influence of an

01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:31.849
and looking for the influence of an
 

01:07:31.849 --> 01:07:55.709
and looking for the influence of an
ethnic lobby now other comments yeah

01:07:55.709 --> 01:07:55.719
 
 

01:07:55.719 --> 01:08:04.299
 
well you're easily shocked but I like

01:08:04.299 --> 01:08:04.309
well you're easily shocked but I like
 

01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:08.469
well you're easily shocked but I like
this I like these sort of is the shocked

01:08:08.469 --> 01:08:08.479
this I like these sort of is the shocked
 

01:08:08.479 --> 01:08:12.039
this I like these sort of is the shocked
ability of cephus students

01:08:12.039 --> 01:08:12.049
ability of cephus students
 

01:08:12.049 --> 01:08:16.569
ability of cephus students
see this is this is why we have programs

01:08:16.569 --> 01:08:16.579
see this is this is why we have programs
 

01:08:16.579 --> 01:08:18.160
see this is this is why we have programs
to train people in international

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:18.170
to train people in international
 

01:08:18.170 --> 01:08:20.849
to train people in international
politics is make them less easily shot

01:08:20.849 --> 01:08:20.859
politics is make them less easily shot
 

01:08:20.859 --> 01:08:24.249
politics is make them less easily shot

01:08:24.249 --> 01:08:24.259
nan I'm teasing I'm teasing you here's
 

01:08:24.259 --> 01:08:28.959

what I mean I mean it's a constructivist

01:08:28.959 --> 01:08:28.969
what I mean I mean it's a constructivist
 

01:08:28.969 --> 01:08:33.819
what I mean I mean it's a constructivist
idea in this sense that it's based on it

01:08:33.819 --> 01:08:33.829
idea in this sense that it's based on it
 

01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:38.109
idea in this sense that it's based on it
is based on ideas for one thing soft

01:08:38.109 --> 01:08:38.119
is based on ideas for one thing soft
 

01:08:38.119 --> 01:08:40.839
is based on ideas for one thing soft
power is a term that I believe it's a

01:08:40.839 --> 01:08:40.849
power is a term that I believe it's a
 

01:08:40.849 --> 01:08:43.450
power is a term that I believe it's a
brilliant term and it's a very important

01:08:43.450 --> 01:08:43.460
brilliant term and it's a very important
 

01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:45.669
brilliant term and it's a very important
concept in international politics and I

01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:45.679
concept in international politics and I
 

01:08:45.679 --> 01:08:47.979
concept in international politics and I
also think that my good friend Joe Nye

01:08:47.979 --> 01:08:47.989
also think that my good friend Joe Nye
 

01:08:47.989 --> 01:08:49.749
also think that my good friend Joe Nye
has done a lot to have people

01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759
has done a lot to have people
 

01:08:49.759 --> 01:08:51.760
has done a lot to have people
misunderstand it you know that it's

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:51.770
misunderstand it you know that it's
 

01:08:51.770 --> 01:08:54.339
misunderstand it you know that it's
based too much on movies and McDonald's

01:08:54.339 --> 01:08:54.349
based too much on movies and McDonald's
 

01:08:54.349 --> 01:08:55.089
based too much on movies and McDonald's
and all that

01:08:55.089 --> 01:08:55.099
and all that
 

01:08:55.099 --> 01:09:00.189
and all that
what soft power is is its legitimacy

01:09:00.189 --> 01:09:00.199
what soft power is is its legitimacy
 

01:09:00.199 --> 01:09:03.579
what soft power is is its legitimacy
that is it and he defines it this way

01:09:03.579 --> 01:09:03.589
that is it and he defines it this way
 

01:09:03.589 --> 01:09:06.399
that is it and he defines it this way
it's having people want what you want

01:09:06.399 --> 01:09:06.409
it's having people want what you want
 

01:09:06.409 --> 01:09:10.479
it's having people want what you want
and that gets you into a conceptual

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:10.489
and that gets you into a conceptual
 

01:09:10.489 --> 01:09:13.660
and that gets you into a conceptual
range into conceptual territory where

01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:13.670
range into conceptual territory where
 

01:09:13.670 --> 01:09:16.629
range into conceptual territory where
it's the I it isn't just your ideas that

01:09:16.629 --> 01:09:16.639
it's the I it isn't just your ideas that
 

01:09:16.639 --> 01:09:19.299
it's the I it isn't just your ideas that
matter but it is I think their we're

01:09:19.299 --> 01:09:19.309
matter but it is I think their we're
 

01:09:19.309 --> 01:09:22.299
matter but it is I think their we're
talking about a construct a sort of set

01:09:22.299 --> 01:09:22.309
talking about a construct a sort of set
 

01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:24.370
talking about a construct a sort of set
of concepts that I think constructivists

01:09:24.370 --> 01:09:24.380
of concepts that I think constructivists
 

01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:27.939
of concepts that I think constructivists
actually explained better than than

01:09:27.939 --> 01:09:27.949
actually explained better than than
 

01:09:27.949 --> 01:09:29.680
actually explained better than than
liberals because liberals tend to focus

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:29.690
liberals because liberals tend to focus
 

01:09:29.690 --> 01:09:32.709
liberals because liberals tend to focus
on institutions making things legitimate

01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:32.719
on institutions making things legitimate
 

01:09:32.719 --> 01:09:34.780
on institutions making things legitimate
and I think constructivists have a lot

01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:34.790
and I think constructivists have a lot
 

01:09:34.790 --> 01:09:38.769
and I think constructivists have a lot
to add in pointing us toward the ideas

01:09:38.769 --> 01:09:38.779
to add in pointing us toward the ideas
 

01:09:38.779 --> 01:09:42.640
to add in pointing us toward the ideas
that create legitimacy as well and I was

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:42.650
that create legitimacy as well and I was
 

01:09:42.650 --> 01:09:46.829
that create legitimacy as well and I was
pointing toward an American idea that

01:09:46.829 --> 01:09:46.839
pointing toward an American idea that
 

01:09:46.839 --> 01:09:51.339
pointing toward an American idea that
democratization adds to soft power in a

01:09:51.339 --> 01:09:51.349
democratization adds to soft power in a
 

01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:53.049
democratization adds to soft power in a
way that I think has actually probably

01:09:53.049 --> 01:09:53.059
way that I think has actually probably
 

01:09:53.059 --> 01:09:54.760
way that I think has actually probably
been more important in the history of

01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:54.770
been more important in the history of
 

01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:56.770
been more important in the history of
American foreign policy than any number

01:09:56.770 --> 01:09:56.780
American foreign policy than any number
 

01:09:56.780 --> 01:10:00.669
American foreign policy than any number
of Arnold Schwarzenegger movies or any

01:10:00.669 --> 01:10:00.679
of Arnold Schwarzenegger movies or any
 

01:10:00.679 --> 01:10:12.760
of Arnold Schwarzenegger movies or any
number of Big Macs yes

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:12.770
 
 

01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:18.080
 
well I'm saying that the democratization

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:18.090
well I'm saying that the democratization
 

01:10:18.090 --> 01:10:20.630
well I'm saying that the democratization
is a goal that you can pursue lots of

01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640
is a goal that you can pursue lots of
 

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:22.340
is a goal that you can pursue lots of
different ways including through hard

01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:22.350
different ways including through hard
 

01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:25.060
different ways including through hard
power and what the Bush administration

01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:25.070
power and what the Bush administration
 

01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:29.150
power and what the Bush administration
has discovered is that you can get into

01:10:29.150 --> 01:10:29.160
has discovered is that you can get into
 

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:32.260
has discovered is that you can get into
a lot of trouble with the pursuit of

01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:32.270
a lot of trouble with the pursuit of
 

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:38.330
a lot of trouble with the pursuit of
this goal through hard hard power the

01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:38.340
this goal through hard hard power the
 

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:41.810
this goal through hard hard power the
correction I mean in a way what a lot of

01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:41.820
correction I mean in a way what a lot of
 

01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:44.810
correction I mean in a way what a lot of
academic theorists have said to the Bush

01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:44.820
academic theorists have said to the Bush
 

01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:47.330
academic theorists have said to the Bush
administration is you don't get it you

01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:47.340
administration is you don't get it you
 

01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:48.979
administration is you don't get it you
know this is something that to be

01:10:48.979 --> 01:10:48.989
know this is something that to be
 

01:10:48.989 --> 01:10:52.250
know this is something that to be
effective to serve the interests that

01:10:52.250 --> 01:10:52.260
effective to serve the interests that
 

01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:54.350
effective to serve the interests that
you're talking about serving actually

01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:54.360
you're talking about serving actually
 

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:55.490
you're talking about serving actually
can't be done in this way

01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:55.500
can't be done in this way
 

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:59.360
can't be done in this way
it has to be more a goal served by soft

01:10:59.360 --> 01:10:59.370
it has to be more a goal served by soft
 

01:10:59.370 --> 01:11:01.490
it has to be more a goal served by soft
power but that's something one can you

01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:01.500
power but that's something one can you
 

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:04.840
power but that's something one can you
know that that that you debate the

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:04.850
know that that that you debate the
 

01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:08.720
know that that that you debate the
achievement of regime change is you know

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:08.730
achievement of regime change is you know
 

01:11:08.730 --> 01:11:12.229
achievement of regime change is you know
many people have argued in Germany and

01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239
many people have argued in Germany and
 

01:11:12.239 --> 01:11:14.479
many people have argued in Germany and
Japan sure wasn't achieved through soft

01:11:14.479 --> 01:11:14.489
Japan sure wasn't achieved through soft
 

01:11:14.489 --> 01:11:17.360
Japan sure wasn't achieved through soft
power now we've probably got some

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:17.370
power now we've probably got some
 

01:11:17.370 --> 01:11:25.919
power now we've probably got some
questions over here yeah

01:11:25.919 --> 01:11:25.929
 
 

01:11:25.929 --> 01:11:28.359
 
well then you're good corrective to

01:11:28.359 --> 01:11:28.369
well then you're good corrective to
 

01:11:28.369 --> 01:12:01.149
well then you're good corrective to
these previous questions I don't I don't

01:12:01.149 --> 01:12:01.159
these previous questions I don't I don't
 

01:12:01.159 --> 01:12:04.239
these previous questions I don't I don't
want to I don't want to say that the

01:12:04.239 --> 01:12:04.249
want to I don't want to say that the
 

01:12:04.249 --> 01:12:06.009
want to I don't want to say that the
question is yeah well you weren't

01:12:06.009 --> 01:12:06.019
question is yeah well you weren't
 

01:12:06.019 --> 01:12:08.859
question is yeah well you weren't
bellowing as sufficiently because you're

01:12:08.859 --> 01:12:08.869
bellowing as sufficiently because you're
 

01:12:08.869 --> 01:12:10.629
bellowing as sufficiently because you're
right up at the front it's hard to

01:12:10.629 --> 01:12:10.639
right up at the front it's hard to
 

01:12:10.639 --> 01:12:13.089
right up at the front it's hard to
projector at the back the question is it

01:12:13.089 --> 01:12:13.099
projector at the back the question is it
 

01:12:13.099 --> 01:12:15.790
projector at the back the question is it
will in the future if American

01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:15.800
will in the future if American
 

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:19.569
