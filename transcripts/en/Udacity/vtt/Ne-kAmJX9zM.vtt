00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.885
Do you remember Wingdings?

00:00:01.885 --> 00:00:02.719
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:06.660
&gt;&gt; That weird font that was
oddly popular in the 90's?

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.820
Have you ever wondered why a font
like that would even exist?

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.720
&gt;&gt; Well, as it turns out,
it's possible to build a font family

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.960
made of images and
icons rather than letters.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.810
Now, icon fonts provide
a fantastic option for

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.979
the little images and
icons that often decorate websites.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.440
There's an icon font
I like called Zocial.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.650
Now, this font is free and
open source, so

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.380
I could download it and
serve it from my site.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.210
However, the font is publicly available
from the font site itself so,

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.030
I'll use that instead.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.440
Let's see it in action.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.660
Notice that I've added some
shadow to the font icons.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.900
This file looks a bit complex so,
bear with me.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.440
Here's what's going on.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.330
The icon font characters are added
using the CSS before selector.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.540
I've added some formatting to that
as well including CSS text shadow.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.790
Now that rule is applied to
every element whose class

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.550
name begins with zocial.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.800
And you can see that each of
the list items has a class

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.080
with a name made up of zocial and
a brand name.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.472
Now, at the top,
you'll see an @import url,

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:16.740
that points to an external CSS file.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.510
Let's look at that now, the @font-face
url, at the top of this gives the source

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.570
of the actual font files and
there's some variations available there.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.310
And what you see below that
are selectors based on class names like

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.010
the ones we've used, zocial-flickr,
zocial-laughter and so on.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.660
For example, set the class
zocial-flickr on an element and

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.660
the character F will be
displayed before it.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.150
Which in the zocial font
is the flickr logo.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.550
Clever, huh?

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.400
Icon fonts have a number of advantages,
over plain old images.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.480
They're vector graphics that
can be infinitely scaled and

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.230
an entire set of images can
be downloaded in one font.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.740
And this makes them a great potential
solution for responsive designs where

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.060
you require minimum downloads and
maximum scalability.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.970
Now, if you look at
the resources required for

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.905
the weloveiconfonts site,
you can see that the total wait for

00:02:10.905 --> 00:02:15.845
that hundred of images from all
the fonts on the page is less than 300k.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.190
Icon fonts have a number of
advantages over plain old images.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.190
They're vectorgraphics that
can be infinitely scaled.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.530
An entire set of images can
be downloaded in one font.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.760
This makes them a great potential
solution for responsive designs where

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.300
you require minimum downloads and
maximum scalability.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.330
The example here shows lots of
different options for icon fonts.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.170
And of course the characters
in icon fonts behave

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.100
just like letters in other fonts.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.630
So you can resize and color them and

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.510
use other CSS effects,
just like you would with text.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.975
There are lots of tools for
creating icon fonts and

00:02:56.975 --> 00:02:59.575
lots of pre-built icon fonts.

00:02:59.575 --> 00:03:01.715
Check out the links below the video.

00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:04.895
There's also a link to information
about improving accessibility

00:03:04.895 --> 00:03:05.785
by using Aria attributes
