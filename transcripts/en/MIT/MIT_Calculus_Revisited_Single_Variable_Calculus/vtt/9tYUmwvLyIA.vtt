00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.630
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.520
Welcome, once again, to another
lecture on limits.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.880
Actually, from a certain point
of view, today's lecture will

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.290
be the same as the last
lecture, only

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.130
from a different viewpoint.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.850
Our lecture today is
called 'Limits: a

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.440
More Rigorous Approach'.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.690
And what our objective for the
day is, aside from helping you

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.660
gain experience and facility
with using limit expressions

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.630
and absolute values and the
like, is to have you see how

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.740
we can use the power of
objective, well-defined

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.220
mathematical definitions to
find rather easy ways of

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.210
solving certain types
of problems.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.620
Now to this end, let's very
briefly review our fundamental

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.730
definition of last time.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.540
Namely, the limit of 'f of x'
as 'x' approaches 'a' equals

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.820
'l' means that for each epsilon
greater than 0, we can

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.770
find delta greater than 0,
such that whenever the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.120
absolute value of 'x minus a' is
less than delta but greater

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.580
than 0, then the absolute value
of ''f of x' minus 'l''

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.800
will be less than epsilon.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.270
To state that once again, but
in more intuitive terms, for

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.400
any tolerance limit epsilon at
all, we can suitably find

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.630
another tolerance limit, delta,
such that whenever we

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.130
make 'x' within delta of 'a', 'f
of x' will automatically be

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.800
within epsilon of 'l'.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.290
And again, the very, very
important emphasis here, we do

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.980
not allow 'x' to equal 'a'.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.680
Again, in terms of a diagram,
if this is the curve 'y'

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.650
equals 'f of x', this
is 'x' equals 'a'.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.890
This is 'l'.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.710
If we call this 'l' plus
epsilon, if we call this 'l'

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.950
minus epsilon-- in other words,
epsilon is this width

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.230
over here--

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.520
then the way we find delta is to
reflect back to the curve,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.100
emphasizing, again, in
the neighborhood

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.360
of the point 'a'--

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.230
I can't stress that point
strongly enough, that if this

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.510
curve were not 1:1, there are
going to be other places where

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.690
this line meets the curve.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.320
So if that happens, you must
make sure that you pick the

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.280
neighborhood of 'a', not some
other point over here.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.530
We're interested in what
happens near 'a'.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.660
But at any rate, again notice
that the fact that these two

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.670
intervals here were equal does
not guarantee that when you

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.090
project down here, they
will be equal.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.480
In fact, the only time that
these two widths would be

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.210
equal is if the curve happened
to be a straight line.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.120
And what it means, again, is
that the delta that we're

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.170
talking about, for example,
is the minimum

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.140
of these two widths.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.310
In other words, as I've drawn
this diagram, delta would be

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.900
the distance from 'a'
to this end point.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.560
And all we're saying is that
once 'x' is in this open

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.090
interval but not including 'a'
itself, 'f of x' will be in

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.960
this open interval.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.140
And again, notice, as we were
emphasizing last time, once

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.970
this delta happens to work,
automatically any smaller

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.700
delta will also work.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.640
In other words, if something
is true for everything in

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.250
here, it's certainly true
for everything in some

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.370
subinterval of this.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.440
What you must be careful
about is not to

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.520
reverse this process.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.100
Don't get outside and pick
bigger deltas, then you might

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.320
very well be in a little
bit of trouble.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.200
At any rate, once we've reviewed
what the basic

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.900
definition is, it seems about
the only way to show what

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.290
mathematics is all about is to
actually do a few theorems,

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.050
that is, derive a few
inescapable consequences of

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.830
the definition that show how
our theorems coincide with

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.150
what we believe to be
intuitively true

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.470
in the first place.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.840
And for obvious reasons, we
should start with what

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.750
hopefully would be the simplest
possible theorems and

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.630
then proceed to tougher
ones as we go along.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.130
So as my first one, I've
chosen the following.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.170
The limit of 'c' as 'x'
approaches 'a' is 'c', where

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.080
'c' is any constant.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.520
Now again, that may look a
little bit strange to you.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.560
Let's look at it this way.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.250
What I'm saying is let
'f of x' equal 'c',

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.120
where 'c' is a constant.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.600
Then what we're saying is for
this choice of 'f of x', the

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.410
limit of 'f of x' as 'x'
approaches 'a' is 'c' itself.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.280
That's what this thing says.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.450
How do we prove this?

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.680
Well, you see, we have
a criteria given.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.190
Namely, what is our
basic definition?

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.750
Let's just juxtaposition our
basic definition with this

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:40.940
particular result.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.800
To prove that the limit here
is 'c', notice that in this

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.150
particular problem, if we come
back and compare this with our

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.180
basic definition, notice that
we have the same basic

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:00.630
definition as before, only the
role of 'f of x' is played by

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.390
'c' and 'l' is also
played by 'c'.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.710
In other words, in this
particular problem 'f of x' is

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.230
'c' and 'l' is also 'c'.

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:10.410
Now what must we do?

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.430
We must show that for each
epsilon greater than 0, or for

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.910
an arbitrary epsilon
greater than 0--

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.530
now what does it mean to say
an arbitrary epsilon?

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.590
In a way, think of it as being
a game, a battle of wits

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.320
between you and your worst
enemy, and you're out to win

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.160
and your worst enemy
is out to beat you.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.180
So to make this as difficult a
game as possible, you allow

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.790
your worst enemy to choose the
epsilon, provided only that

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.570
it's positive.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.690
For whichever one he picks, you
must be able to find the

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.340
delta that matches that epsilon,
such that what?

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.750
Whenever 'x' is within delta of
'a' but not equal to 'a',

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.170
'f of x' will be within
epsilon of 'l'.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.900
So let's write that
down over here.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.330
Let's write what that says.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:05.480
Given epsilon greater than 0,
we must find a delta greater

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:11.040
than 0, such that what?

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.590
Well, by definition.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:19.330
Such that when the absolute
value of 'x minus a' is less

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.160
than delta but greater
than 0, the absolute

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.620
value of 'f of x'--

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.660
well, that of course, is
'c' in this case--

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.430
minus 'l', which is also 'c' in
this case, the 'l' stands

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.640
for the limit, has to be
less than epsilon.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.740
And lo and behold, we find that
this is a rather simple

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.700
procedure because what
is 'c' minus 'c'?

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.090
'c' minus 'c' is 0, and
automatically that will be

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.710
smaller than any positive
epsilon.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.520
In other words, what this says
is even your worst enemy can't

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.720
give you a tough time
with this problem.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.340
Namely, no matter what epsilon
he prescribes, no matter how

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:01.020
sensitive, you say, well, for
delta I'll pick anything.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.670
And it works.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:03.700
And why does that work?

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.350
Well, here again we
can emphasize

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:07.920
the geometric approach.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:14.980
Namely, if we plot the graph 'f
of x' equals 'c', observe

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.180
that that plot equals a straight
line, 'y' equals 'c'.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.150
Now take 'x' equals
'a' over here.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.290
What is 'f of a'?

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.860
'f of a' is 'c'.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.860
Now pick an epsilon, which is
this half-width over here,

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:34.220
knock that off on either
side of 'c'.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.780
And all you're saying in this
particular case is no matter

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:41.679
how far away 'x' is from 'a', 'f
of x' will be within these

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:43.860
tolerance limits of 'c'.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.050
And why is that?

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:50.040
Because 'f' is defined in such
a way that the output for any

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.360
element in its domain
is 'c' itself.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.930
In other words, every element
maps up here.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.390
This is what you mean by saying
that the graph is the

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:00.160
straight line 'y' equals 'c'.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.110
By the way, another
word of caution.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:09.930
We must always make sure that
your solution does not depend

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:10.930
on the diagram.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:13.160
You see, if a person were to
look at this diagram very

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.330
quickly, he would assume that
'c' had to be a positive

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.470
constant here, because look at
how I've drawn the line 'y'

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:19.870
equals 'c'.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.430
It's above the x-axis.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:23.900
Well, 'c' could just as easily
be a negative constant.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.990
And if I drew the diagram
that way, 'c' would

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:27.690
be below the x-axis.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:29.290
The important thing
to check is this.

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.750
When you draw a diagram, you
can't have a certain number

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:35.780
being positive and negative at
the same time, so you choose

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.650
it one way or the other.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.960
Always make sure when you do
this that your formal proof,

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.150
your analytic proof, goes
through word for word if you

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.800
reverse the signature of the
sign of the number that you're

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.920
working with.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:53.010
Make sure that your answer does
not depend on the picture

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:54.240
that you've drawn.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.040
Make sure that your answer
follows, inescapably, from

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.410
your basic definition.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:00.000
And notice that this is
what we did here.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.200
We showed what?

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.210
That no matter what epsilon we
were given, we could find a

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:06.420
delta-- in fact, in this
case, any delta--

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.950
such that when 'x' was within
delta of a as long as 'x'

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:10.790
wasn't equal to 'a'.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.940
Well in this case, even
if 'x' equaled 'a',

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.160
there was no harm done.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.780
But the point is we want to keep
away from a 0 over 0 form

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.760
so we always impose
this condition.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.940
In this case, once 'x' was
within delta of 'a', 'f of x'

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.410
was automatically within epsilon
of 'c', as long as

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.920
epsilon was positive,
because 'f of x' was

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.570
already equal to 'c'.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.010
The difference was already 0.

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.620
Now again, notice what
happens here.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:41.850
The more pragmatic student will
say, why did you use this

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:46.660
long math when it was obvious
from either the diagram or

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.820
from intuition that this
is the correct answer?

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.380
And the reason, is as we have
already seen and as we will

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.640
see many, many times during
our course, the intuitive

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.270
answer and the correct
answer will not

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.200
necessarily be the same.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.650
The point is we always want to
make sure that when we prove

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:09.110
something, the proof follows
from the assumed definitions

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.770
in a logically rigorous way.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:15.080
If it happens once you prove
this that you can intuitively

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.340
recognize the same result,
that's like a double reward

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.240
because now you won't have to
memorize what the result was,

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.980
you'll just use this thing
automatically.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.910
But the beauty is that for
somebody who doesn't have the

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:29.290
same intuitive insights that you
have, if he says it's not

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:32.240
self-evident to me, explain
to me what's happening.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.110
Then, you see, once he's
accepted the basic definition

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:38.210
and assuming that he knows the
rules of mathematics, he has

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.770
to come up with the same
answer that you did.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:43.850
And this is what we mean by an
objective criterion for doing

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.560
mathematics, okay.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.550
Well, this was kind
of an easy one.

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.425
Let's do another kind of
easy one that's harder.

00:11:50.425 --> 00:11:54.370
Let's make some gradual
transitions, here.

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:57.230
Let's pick another theorem.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.520
Here's another one that sounds
pretty self-evident.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:04.410
The limit as 'x' approaches
'a' is 'a'.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:07.310
In fact, what that seems to say
in a self-evident way is

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:11.620
that as 'x' gets arbitrarily
close to 'a', 'x' gets

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.450
arbitrarily close
to equal to 'a'.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.490
And if anything is a truism,
I guess that's it.

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:20.890
So we certainly suspect that
this is a true statement.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.530
All I'm trying to get you used
to is not to make a mountain

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:25.780
out of a mole hill, not to have
to think that mathematics

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:30.050
becomes a severe thing where
we try to find hard ways of

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.375
doing easy things, but rather
that we can find an

00:12:33.375 --> 00:12:37.660
unambiguous, logically
constructed language from

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.020
which all of our results can be
proven without recourse to

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:44.260
intuition once our basic
definitions are chosen.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.010
So let's see how this
would work.

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.820
Let's again go back to
our basic definition.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.850
You see, again, what we're
saying here is that this is

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:55.780
just a special case now where
'f of x' equals 'x'.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.740
You see the function
is 'f of x'.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.720
In this case, it's 'x', and this
is a special case where

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.550
'a' is 'l'.

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:04.650
Now what are you saying here?

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:08.540
You're saying given epsilon
greater than 0, we must find a

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:11.380
delta greater than 0,
such that what?

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.510
Such that whenever 'x' is within
delta of 'a' but not

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:20.900
equal to 'a', then 'x' will
be within epsilon of 'a'.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.340
And now you just look at this
thing, I hope, and you say

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.640
well, there's sort of a
similarity over here.

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:34.850
How close should 'x' be chosen
to 'a' if you want 'x' to be

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:36.920
within epsilon of 'a'?

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.680
And the answer, quite obviously
in this case

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.490
without, cause to define again,
is to simply say what

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:43.460
in this case?

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:48.520
For the given epsilon,
choose, for example,

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.940
delta to equal epsilon.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:54.590
Because certainly, if the
absolute value of 'x minus a'

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:57.810
is less than epsilon but greater
than 0, then certainly

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:02.920
the absolute value of 'x minus
a' is less than epsilon.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.070
Don't be upset that the proof
happened to be fairly

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.280
easy in this case.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.890
More importantly, don't be upset
that there was a more

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.330
intuitive way of doing it.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:13.060
Remember what we want to do is
to get these rigorous ways

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:19.370
down pat, interpret them in
terms of pictures wherever the

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:20.960
pictures are available.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.560
And then, when we get to the
case where pictures aren't

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:28.110
available, to be able to extend
the analytic concepts.

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.780
Again, to see what happens here
pictorially, you notice

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:34.090
that if you start with the
function 'f of x' equals 'x,'

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:37.220
its graph is a straight
line 'y' equals 'x'.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:41.620
And I'll risk some freehand
drawing here.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:45.600
So in other words, we suspect
that this is 'a'.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.550
It better be, if this says that
all points on this line

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.600
have the property that the
y-coordinate is equal to the

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.740
x-coordinate.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:52.770
Now what do we want to do?

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:58.610
We pick an epsilon and
knock off a plus

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:01.150
epsilon and a minus epsilon.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:05.150
And now what we want to find out
is how close must x be to

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:10.440
a on the x-axis in order that 'f
of x'-- namely 'y' in this

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.730
case, or 'x' itself--

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:15.660
be within this prescribed
tolerance limits of 'a'?

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.070
You see what happens here?

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:20.230
This is that one case where
it happens that what?

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:27.320
If you draw these lines over
and project down, but by

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.800
proportional parts--

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.140
and this is crucial here.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:33.520
Even if this weren't the 45
degree line, the fact that

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.580
these two pieces here are equal
would guarantee that

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.440
these two pieces here are equal,
in spite of how I've

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.410
drawn this.

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:44.280
The fact that this is the 45
degree line not only says that

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.920
these two pieces here are
equal but it says what?

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:52.330
That each of these pieces is
equal to each of these pieces.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.930
I wish I had drawn this better
for you, but in fact the worse

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:57.590
I draw it, the more you have
to rely on being able to

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:00.040
visualize abstractly what's
happening here.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.290
What I'm saying is that this
point here would be labeled 'a

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.410
plus epsilon', this point here
would be labeled 'a minus

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:09.540
epsilon', and this is the
pictorial version of what it

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:13.660
means to say you could have
chosen delta to equal epsilon,

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.180
in this particular case.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:20.040
Well, that's enough of the
easier ones, so let's pick one

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.510
that gets slightly tougher.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:27.700
And this one gets tougher in one
sense, but insidiously--

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.250
meaning it's real sneaky--

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:30.950
simple in another sense.

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:34.280
In other words, it turns out
that one can reason falsely

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.690
and get the right answer
just by a quirk.

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:40.020
You see, what I want to prove
next is a very important

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.450
theorem that says that the limit
of a sum is equal to the

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:45.740
sum of the limits.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.690
Written out more formally, if I
have two functions 'f of x'

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:54.240
and 'g of x' and formed the sum
''f of x' plus 'g of x''

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.610
and I want to take the limit of
that sum as 'x' approaches

00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:00.660
'a', what this theorem says is
you can find the limit of each

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.320
of the functions separately
first, and

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.500
then add the two results.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.980
Now at first glance, you might
be tempted to say, well, what

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.140
else would you expect
to happen?

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:11.859
The answer is, I don't know,
again, what else you would

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:12.609
expect to happen.

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:13.970
But this is a luxury.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:17.010
You see, evidently what's
happened here is that we've

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.819
reversed the order
of operations.

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:20.950
You see, this says what?

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.329
First add these two, and
then take the limit.

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:26.440
What are we doing down here?

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:30.130
First we're taking the limits
and then we're adding.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:33.380
Now, is it self-evident that
just by changing the order of

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.740
operations you don't
change anything?

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:39.290
We've seen many examples already
in the short time that

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:42.660
this course has been in
existence where changing the

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:46.720
order, changing the voice
inflection, what have you,

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.930
changes the answer.

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:50.830
And in fact, we're going
to see more drastic

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:52.510
examples later on.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:54.470
I guess this is one of
the tragedies of

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:56.710
a course like this.

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:58.740
I guess it's typical of
problems every place.

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.320
If the place that the person is
going to get into trouble

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.010
comes far beyond the time at
which you're lecturing to him,

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:08.030
it's kind of empty to threaten
him with the trouble he's

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:09.220
going to get into.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.560
So I'm not going to threaten
you with the trouble you're

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.510
going to get into until
we get into it.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:16.760
All I'm going to say is be
careful when you say that it's

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.960
self-evident that we can first
add and then take the limit or

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.620
whether we first take the
limits and then add.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.230
In general, it does make a
difference in which order you

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.840
perform operations.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.760
Well, let's take this just a
little bit more formally to

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.770
see what this thing says.

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:33.460
First of all, when we write
something like this, we assume

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:36.030
that the limit of 'f of x' as
'x' approaches 'a' exists,

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:37.940
otherwise we wouldn't
write this thing.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.770
So let's call that limit 'l1'.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:42.020
In other words, let the limit of
'f of x' as 'x' approaches

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.570
'a' equal 'l1'.

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:47.910
Let the limit of 'g of x' as 'x'
approaches 'a' equal 'l2'.

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:51.790
Now define a new function 'h of
x' to be equal to ''f of x'

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.070
plus 'g of x''.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.510
And by the way, this is
something I didn't say

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.050
strongly enough in one of our
early lectures, and I want to

00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:00.950
make sure that it's very clear
that this is understood.

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:06.420
And that is, notice that when
you define 'h' to be the sum

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:11.000
of 'f' and 'g', you had better
make sure that 'f' and 'g'

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.810
have the same domain.

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:17.540
You see, if some number 'x'
belongs to the domain of 'f'

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:21.590
but it doesn't belong to the
domain of 'g', then how can

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:24.280
you form ''f of x' plus
'g of x''? 'g'

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.320
doesn't operate on 'x'.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.250
By the way, this is not quite
as serious a problem as it

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:33.600
seems if you understand the
language of our new

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.670
mathematics and sets
and the like.

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:42.350
Namely, if the domain of 'f'
happens to look like this and

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:49.900
the domain of 'g' happens to
look like this, what we do is

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.730
we restrict the sum to the

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:53.560
intersection of the two domains.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:20:00.150
In other words, referring back
to our function 'h', we define

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:01.980
the domain of 'h' to
be the intersection

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.290
of these two domains.

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.580
And that way, for any 'x', which
is in the domain of 'h',

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:10.910
it automatically belongs to both
the domain of 'f' and the

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:11.950
domain of 'g'.

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:14.730
And so this becomes
well-defined.

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:17.220
Another way of looking at this
is what you're really saying

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:21.820
is that 'f' and 'g' must
include in their domain

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:25.340
intervals surrounding
'x' equals 'a'.

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.100
And since you're only interested
in what's happening

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:31.750
near 'x' equals 'a', you don't
really care whether these have

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:35.150
the same domains or not,
provided they have what?

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:38.520
An intersection that can serve
as a common domain.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.600
But that, I think, is more
clear from the context.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.280
It's a very, very important
fine point.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.690
It's a tragedy to try to add
two numbers, one of which

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:48.890
doesn't exist.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:50.240
I don't know if it's a tragedy,

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.760
it's certainly futile.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.710
At any rate, though, let's see
what this thing then says.

00:20:55.710 --> 00:21:00.260
If we now define 'h' to be 'f
plus g', what we want to prove

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:04.250
is that the limit of 'h of x'
as 'x' approaches 'a' equals

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:06.700
'l1 plus l2'.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.310
Now here's the point again.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:11.420
What does this mean
by definition?

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:17.300
It means that given epsilon
greater than 0, we must be

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:21.170
able to find a delta such that
when 'x' is within delta of

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:25.540
'a' but not equal to 'a',
'h of x' is within

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.380
epsilon of 'l1 plus l2'.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.000
That's probably kind of hard
to keep track of, so I've

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.860
taken the liberty of writing
this down for

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.740
you right over here.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:38.310
See, given epsilon greater than
0-- so that's given, we

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:39.800
have no control over that--

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:45.180
what we must do is find delta
greater than 0, such that 0

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.280
less than the absolute value
of 'x minus a' less than

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.930
delta, implies--

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:51.140
now, what is 'h of x'?

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.860
It's ''f of x' plus 'g of x'',
and our limit that we're

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.640
looking for in this case
is 'l1 plus l2'.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.640
So mathematically, we replace 'h
of x' by ''f of x' plus 'g

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.430
of x'', the limit
is 'l1 plus l2'.

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:06.935
So what must we show that the
absolute value of the quantity

00:22:06.935 --> 00:22:10.830
of ''f of x' plus 'g of x''
minus the quantity 'l1 plus

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.690
l2' is less than epsilon.

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:15.560
And now we start to play
detective again.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.980
This is the expression
that we want to

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.570
make less than epsilon.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:23.970
So what we do is we look at this
particular expression and

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:27.500
we try to see what kind of cute
things we can do with it.

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.220
Now, what do I mean
by a cute thing?

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.490
Well, we're assuming that the
limit of 'f of x' as 'x'

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:36.150
approaches 'a' equals 'l1'.

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:39.230
Let me write this as
an aside over here.

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:42.730
Among other things, what this
tells us is that we have a

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:47.480
hold on expressions like this.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.080
In other words, the fact that
the limit of 'f of x' as 'x'

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.310
approaches 'a' is equal to 'l1'
tells us that we can make

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.970
this as small as we want.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:57.940
I'll use a subscript over here
for epsilon 1 because it

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.050
doesn't have to be the same
epsilon that was given here.

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:03.540
For any positive number, say
epsilon 1, the point is I can

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:08.980
make 'f of x' within epsilon 1
of 'l1' just by choosing 'x'

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.330
sufficiently close to
'a' by definition

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:12.610
of what limit means.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:15.390
So in other words, I like
expressions of this form.

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:20.140
And similarly, I like
expressions of this form.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.530
And again, the reason is that
since the limit of 'g of x' as

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:26.260
'x' approaches 'a' is 'l sub 2',
it gives me a hold on the

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.100
difference between 'g
of x' and 'l2'.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:33.420
So again, using the old adage
that hindsight is better than

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.860
foresight by a darn site,
knowing exactly what it is I

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:40.260
have to do, I come back here
and try to doctor things up

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.360
for myself.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:45.360
The first thing I observe is
that this can be rewritten.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:46.800
There's no calculus
in this, notice.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.090
Just plain ordinary algebra,
arithmetic.

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:53.830
This can be rewritten so that
I can group the 'f sub 'f of

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:58.160
x' and 'l1'' together and 'g
of x' and 'l2' together.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:01.940
In other words, this is indeed
nothing more than 1.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.700
The absolute value of the
quantity of ''f of x' minus

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.370
l1' plus the absolute value
of the quantity

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:09.290
''g of x' minus l2'.

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:12.980
Now, the point is since we
already know that the absolute

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.810
value of a sum is less than
or equal to the sum of the

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:18.760
absolute values, that
tells me that--

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.480
treating this is one number and
this is another number,

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:26.831
the absolute value of a sum is
less than or equal to the sum

00:24:26.831 --> 00:24:29.010
of the absolute values.

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:32.700
What this now tells me is I can
say that this, that I'm

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.580
trying to get a hold on,
is less than this.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.670
But look at this expression.

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:40.560
This expression is the
absolute value of

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.240
''f of x' minus l1'.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.680
And this expression is
the absolute value of

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.140
''g of x' minus l2'.

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:50.360
In other words, then, since
I can make 'f of x' as

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:54.300
arbitrarily nearly equal to 'l1'
as I want and 'g of x' as

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.290
close to 'l2' as I want just by
choosing 'x' sufficiently

00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:02.150
close to 'a', why don't I choose
'x' close enough to 'a'

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:05.140
so each of these will be less
than epsilon over 2?

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.700
Now again, this calls
for a little aside.

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.830
When one talks about epsilon,
that is 'a',

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:12.040
what shall we say?

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:19.325
A generic name for any number
which exceeds 0.

00:25:19.325 --> 00:25:22.590
Or I could have written that
less mystically by just saying

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.530
any positive number.

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:27.020
Well, if epsilon is positive,
what can you say

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.860
about half of epsilon?

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.620
It's also positive.

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.700
In other words, if I had chosen
a different epsilon,

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:37.300
say 'epsilon sub 1', equal to
the original epsilon divided

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:41.310
by 2, then I'm guaranteed
what?

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:45.170
That I can get 'f of x' with an
epsilon 2 of 'l1', 'g of x'

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:46.860
with an epsilon 2 of 'l2'.

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:49.560
And now adding these two
together, if this term is less

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.420
than epsilon over 2 and this
term is less than epsilon over

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:56.110
2, the whole sum is
less than epsilon.

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:58.770
And it seems now
semi-intuitively--

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:00.460
what do I mean by
semi-intuitively?

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.100
Well, this is far from an
intuitive job over here.

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.150
It's quite mathematical.

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:06.460
It's rigorous in that sense.

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.790
It's intuitive in the sense that
I'm not playing around

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:09.620
with the deltas here.

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.560
All I'm saying is look, I can
make this as small is I want,

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.230
I could make this as small as
I want, therefore I can make

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:16.810
the sum as small as I want.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:18.700
And the fancy way of saying
that is I can make it less

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.730
than any given epsilon, and
therefore it appears that this

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.390
will be the limit.

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:27.960
Using our old adage again of
being able, knowing what we

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.460
want, to be able to doctor
things up rigorously, once

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:35.090
we've gone through this it's now
relatively easy to clean

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:36.310
up the details.

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:39.350
In other words, for those
of us who are

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:43.130
mathematically-oriented enough
to say, the way you've proven

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:46.220
this last result is the same
sloppiness that I was used to

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:49.400
seeing in certain types of
engineering proofs where

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.860
people were more interested in
the result than with the

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.600
answer, I still don't see how
you used the epsilons and the

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.430
deltas here.

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:58.790
Let me show you what a simple
step it is to now go from the

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:02.960
semi-rigorous approach to the
completely rigorous approach.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.940
All we do is reword what
we've done before.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.590
In fact, this is true
in most mathematics.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:10.970
You take a geometry book and
there's a theorem that says

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:14.000
something like if 'a', 'b', 'c',
and 'd' are true, then

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:14.680
'e' is true.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.490
And you learn this proof
quite mechanically.

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:18.060
You sort of memorize it.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.820
Well you know, the man who
proved that theorem didn't, in

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:24.020
general, start out by saying, I
wonder what happens if 'a',

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.190
'b', 'c', and 'd' are true.

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:28.890
In general, what he tries to
do is to prove that some

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:30.740
result, like 'e', is true.

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.360
And as he's proving it,
he hits pitfalls.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.650
And he says, you know, if I
could only be sure 'a' was

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:37.670
true, I could get over
this pitfall.

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:40.440
And if I could be sure 'b' was
true, I could get over the

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.310
second pitfall, et cetera.

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:44.710
And when he makes enough
assumptions to get over all

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:48.940
the pitfalls and he has his
answer, he then we writes down

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:51.310
the answer in the reverse
order from

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:52.600
which he invented it.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:53.620
Namely, he says what?

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.580
Suppose 'a', 'b', 'c',
and 'd' are true.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.210
Let's prove that 'e' is true.

00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:00.620
And the student is then robbed
of any attempt to see

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:03.320
intuitively how this whole
thing came about.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.450
As a case in point, let
me show you what

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:06.490
I'm driving at here.

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:09.240
My first exposure to formal
limit proofs was

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.240
something like this.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.700
When somebody said prove the
limit of a sum equals the sum

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.590
of the limits, something
like this would happen.

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.410
The first statement in the book
would say, given epsilon

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:24.440
greater than 0, let epsilon
1 equal epsilon over 2.

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.870
Now, I respected my teacher,
I respected the

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:27.630
author of the book.

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.000
If he says let epsilon
1 equal epsilon over

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.150
2, all right, fine.

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:32.250
We can do that.

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:34.730
And more to the point, it turned
out that the problem

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:37.220
worked if you did that.

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:40.880
The part that bothered me is why
did he say epsilon over 2?

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.230
Why not 2 epsilon over 3?

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:44.820
Or epsilon over 5?

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:48.090
Or epsilon over 6,872?

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:49.920
Why epsilon over 2?

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:52.220
And the point was that
he had cheated.

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.720
He had already done the problem
that we had over here,

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.290
and knowing what he needed, then
came back here and said

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:02.120
let epsilon 1 equal
epsilon over 2.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.670
And notice how this
is going to mimic

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:06.240
everything we said before.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:10.230
For this choice of epsilon 1, we
can find a delta 1 greater

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:14.910
than 0 such that if the absolute
value of 'x minus a'

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:18.200
is less than delta 1 but greater
than 0, then the

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.910
absolute value of ''f of
x' minus l1' is less

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:21.800
than epsilon 1.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.260
Why do we know that?

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:28.720
That's the definition of what it
means to say that the limit

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:32.530
of 'f of x' as 'x' approaches
'a' equals 'l1'.

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:35.820
In a similar way, he says we can
find delta 2 greater than

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:40.040
0, such that whenever the
absolute value of 'x minus a'

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.610
is greater than 0 but less than
delta over 2, we can make

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:49.020
the absolute value of ''g of
x' minus 'l sub 2'' and be

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.100
less than epsilon 1.

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.610
And now comes the
beautiful step.

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:57.590
He says, now that these delta
1 and delta 2 exist

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:01.210
separately, pick delta to be
the minimum of these two.

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:04.020
In other words, if I let delta
equal the minimum of these

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:06.230
two, what does that
guarantee me?

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:09.500
If delta is the minimum of these
two, it guarantees me

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:14.180
that both of these conditions
are met at the same time.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:15.120
What does that tell me?

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:20.160
It tells me that as soon as the
absolute value of 'x minus

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:23.430
a' is less than delta but
greater than 0, automatically

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:24.970
these two conditions hold.

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:26.850
And that, in turn,
tells me what?

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:32.600
That the absolute value of ''f
of x' minus l1' is less than

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:37.380
epsilon 1 and the absolute value
of ''g of x' minus l2'

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.940
is less than epsilon 1.

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:44.620
And now by adding unequals to
equals, that tells me what?

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:48.910
That this plus this is less
than 2 epsilon 1.

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:52.410
But see, using my hindsight, I
picked epsilon to be what?

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:53.980
Epsilon over 2.

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:59.000
So 2 epsilon 1 is just another
way of saying epsilon.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.100
In other words, what this now
implies is that the absolute

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:07.860
value of ''f of x' minus l1'
plus the absolute value of ''g

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:11.740
of x' minus l2' is less
than 2 epsilon 1,

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:14.140
which equals epsilon.

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:19.110
But you see, this
in turn is what?

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:23.880
This is greater than the
absolute value of ''f of x'

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:28.105
minus l1' plus ''g
of x' minus l2'.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.350
And so this was the thing
we wanted to make

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:35.010
smaller than epsilon.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:38.250
Since this is smaller than
this and this is already

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:40.910
smaller than epsilon, then
this must be smaller than

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:42.520
epsilon too.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.480
Again, notice, this
is rigorous.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.740
But if you understand what's
happening here piece by piece,

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:51.010
you never really have
to memorize a thing.

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:54.080
Let's just take a look back
here to reinforce what I'm

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.050
saying here.

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:55.860
Notice what we did.

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:58.960
We started with the answer that
we wanted to show, worked

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.270
around to get ahold of things
that we wanted.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:03.430
We were lucky enough--

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:05.320
and this is true in any
game, for example.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.210
One can plot masterful strategy
and still lose,

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:10.170
there's no guarantee we're
going to win with our

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:11.730
masterful strategy.

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:14.670
But we usually do in this
course, usually.

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:18.510
What we do is we masterfully
come back to this, see what

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:19.740
has to be done.

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:22.770
Knowing what the right answer
has got to be, we come back

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:25.590
here and then formalize it.

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:28.350
Essentially, what we've done
is reverse the steps here.

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:30.860
I guess there is one thing that
bothers many people that

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:32.830
I should make an aside about.

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:36.580
Why do you need a different
delta 1 and delta 2 for the

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:38.020
same epsilon 1?

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.980
See, if you're memorizing,
there's a danger that you

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.390
won't realize this and
why this happens.

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:48.670
Let me show you in terms of
a picture what this means.

00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:51.710
Let this, for the sake of
argument, be the curve 'y'

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:53.480
equals 'f of x'.

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:58.550
And let this be the curve
'y' equals 'g of x'.

00:32:58.550 --> 00:32:59.800
All we're saying is this.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:10.220
That when you prescribe an
epsilon, the same epsilon that

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:15.400
surrounds 'l2', if you have
that surround 'l1'.

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.910
Because the curves may have
different slopes.

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:18.360
Look what happens over
here, even as badly

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.150
as I've drawn this.

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:22.760
Notice that in epsilon,
neighborhood of 'l2', projects

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:26.070
down into this size neighborhood
around 'a'.

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:28.380
On the other hand, an epsilon
neighborhood of 'l1'.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.500
You get what you pay
for, I guess.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:37.950
An epsilon, neighborhood of
'l1', projects into a much

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:39.220
smaller region.

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:40.810
And by the way, that's exactly
what we meant.

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:43.030
This is a delta 1,
for example.

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:46.470
This is delta 2.

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:50.060
And when we said pick delta to
be the minimum of delta 1 and

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:53.730
delta 2, all we were saying was
listen, if we guarantee

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:57.770
that 'x' stays in here, then
certainly both of these two

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:00.730
things will be true
at the same time.

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:04.530
Well again, we have many
exercises and reading material

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:05.840
to reinforce these points.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.940
All I want to do with the
lecture is to give you an

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:12.030
overview as to what's happening
so that you see

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:12.650
these things.

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:15.690
And I'm afraid I might cure
you with details if I just

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:18.670
keep hammering home these
rigorous little points.

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:20.570
As I say, I hope you
get the main idea

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:21.670
from what we're doing.

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:25.360
Let me just, for the sake of
argument, try to work with

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:31.370
just one more idea and we'll see
how this works out also.

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:36.340
Let's, for example, try to play
around with the idea that

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:39.400
a companion to the limit of a
sum equals the sum of the

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:42.219
limits would be what?

00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:45.469
The limit of a product equals
the product of the limits.

00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:49.050
In other words, as before, if
the limit of 'f of x' as 'x'

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:52.380
approaches 'a' is 'l1' and the
limit of 'g of x' as 'x'

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:55.659
approaches 'a' is 'l2', let's
form a new function, which we

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:58.170
could call 'k of x' which
is equal to the

00:34:58.170 --> 00:34:59.810
product of 'f' and 'g'.

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:03.800
Again, noticing that the 'f' and
'g' have to have a common

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.780
domain here.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:08.330
You want to show that the limit
of 'f of x' times 'g of

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:12.940
x' is 'l1' times 'l2'.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:16.920
And this is the hard part of the
course, this is the part

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.110
of the course that I don't think
anybody in the world can

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:20.150
really teach.

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:24.410
All one can do is try to expose
the student to ideas

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:27.400
and hope that the student has
the knack of putting these

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.550
things together to form
his own repertoire.

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:32.030
The idea is something
like this.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:34.020
I'll show you alternative
methods and the like.

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:36.480
One way is we want to
get ahold of 'f of

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.710
x' times 'g of x'.

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:40.380
Now what do we have a hold on?

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:41.930
It's very clever what
we do here.

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:45.360
We have a hold of ''f of x'
minus l1' and we have a hold

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.540
of ''g of x' minus l2'.

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:52.620
So as we so often do in
mathematics, we simply add and

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:53.870
subtract the same thing.

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:56.570
We frequently add on zeroes
in this cute way.

00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:58.360
We add and subtract
the same thing.

00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:59.640
Notice what we did over here.

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:04.520
We wrote 'f of x' as 'l1' plus
''f of x' minus l1'.

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:06.180
Again, why did we do that?

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.260
Because from our definition of
the limit of 'f of x' as 'x'

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:12.380
approaches 'a' equaling 'l1',
we know that we can

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:14.250
control this side.

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:15.710
And the same thing is
true over here.

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:17.660
The fact that the limit of 'g
of x' as 'x' approaches 'a'

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:20.710
equals 'l2' means we have
some control over this.

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:23.710
Now let's just multiply
everything out.

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:27.975
This is what? 'f of
x' times 'g of x'.

00:36:27.975 --> 00:36:30.650
I'm going to save myself some
space and keep the board

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:31.750
somewhat symmetric.

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:34.360
When I multiply these terms out,
I'm going to get what?

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.770
An 'l1' times 'l2' term over
here as one of my four terms?

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:40.790
Let me already transpose
that one so I kill two

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:42.050
birds with one stone.

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:44.440
One is I keep a little bit
of symmetry in what

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.510
I'm going to write.

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:50.110
And secondly, notice that later
on, this is what I want

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:51.080
to get a hold on.

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.350
In other words, notice that the
proof of the limit of 'f

00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:57.320
of x' times 'g of x' as 'x'
approaches 'a' is 'l1' times

00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:01.360
'l2', this is precisely the
expression I must make small.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:04.170
Our show can be made as small is
I wish just by picking 'x'

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:05.550
sufficiently close to 'a'.

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:08.050
And again, I will not go through
all the details here,

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:11.810
I will simply outline
what we do here.

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:14.430
Namely, let's multiply out
the rest of this thing.

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:15.570
We have what here?

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:18.390
This times this,
which is what?

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:23.660
'l1' times ''g of
x' minus l2'.

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:32.160
Then we have this times this,
which is 'l2' times

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:35.880
''f of x' minus l1'.

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.530
And now we have what?

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:39.770
This times this.

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:47.140
That's ''f of x' minus l1' times
''g of x' minus l2'.

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.970
Now, the point is this is the
thing that we'd like to make

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:52.140
very small in absolute value.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:54.900
Well again, the absolute value
of this is equal to the

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:57.770
absolute value of this, which is
less than or equal to-- and

00:37:57.770 --> 00:38:00.560
I'm going to go through these
details rather rapidly, and

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.750
allow you to fill these
in for yourself-- all

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:03.930
I'm using is what?

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:07.200
That the absolute value of a sum
is less than or equal to

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.740
the sum of the absolute
values.

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.010
The absolute value of a product
is equal to the

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:13.650
product of the absolute values,
so this is going to be

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:14.900
less than or equal to.

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:19.930
Let's break these things up.

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:25.050
And now, you see what
the key idea is?

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:31.720
'l1' and 'l2' are certain fixed
numbers, fixed numbers.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:34.570
Notice that because 'g of x' can
be made as close to 'l2'

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:37.800
as I want and 'f of x' can be
made as close to 'l1' as I

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:41.130
want, notice that no matter what
epsilon I'm given, I can

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:45.660
certainly make this as small as
I wish, just by picking 'x'

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:47.150
close enough to 'a'.

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:49.040
For example, for a given
epsilon, how many

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.220
terms do I have here?

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:55.670
One, two, three.

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:59.280
To make this whole sum less than
epsilon, it's sufficient

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:02.240
to make each of these three
factors less than

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.490
epsilon over 3.

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:10.950
I can make these two less than
epsilon over 3 pretty easy.

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:13.880
How do I make this less
than epsilon over 3?

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:16.280
And the answer is, if you want
this times this to be less

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.820
than epsilon over 3 where these
are positive numbers,

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:22.070
make each of these less than
the square root of

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:23.690
epsilon over 3.

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:27.200
Then when you multiply these two
together, if this is less

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.110
than this and this is less than
this, this times this

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:32.610
will be less than
epsilon over 3.

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:35.680
And now what you see what
we do is very simple.

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:39.760
To finish this proof off, all we
do now is say, let epsilon

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.430
greater than 0 be given.

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:45.410
Choose epsilon 1 to equal
epsilon over 3.

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:48.480
Choose epsilon 2 to equal
epsilon over 3.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:53.630
Choose epsilon sub 3 and epsilon
sub 4 to each be the

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:55.680
square root of epsilon over 3.

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.870
Then we can find delta
1, delta 2, delta

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:01.660
3, delta 4, et cetera.

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:06.130
Clean up all of these, you see,
and pick delta to be the

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:08.470
minimum of the four
deltas involved.

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:11.800
Again, this is done much more
explicitly both in the text

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.090
and in the exercises.

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:15.160
I just wanted you to get
an overview here.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:17.920
And by the way, while we're
speaking of this, there's

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.390
always the danger that some
of you may respect the

00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:21.670
professor too much.

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:25.320
So that danger is one I don't
mind living with.

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.580
The problem is this.

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:29.240
You may get the idea out of
respect for me that I have

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:31.280
invented a unique proof here.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.250
Let me tell you this.

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:34.460
One, I did not invent
this proof.

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:37.070
Two, it is not unique.

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:40.040
There are many different ways
of proving the same result.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:44.690
For example, a person being
told to work on this--

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:46.880
and I'm not going to carry
the details out here--

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:50.230
but a person being told to work
on something like this

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:52.720
might have decided that instead
of doing the clever

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:55.650
thing that we did before, he
was going to do the clever

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:58.280
thing of adding and subtracting

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:00.250
'l1' times 'g of x'.

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:03.050
Because you see, if he did
that, what would happen?

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:06.450
He could now factor out a 'g
of x' from here and rewrite

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:10.450
this as 'g of x' times
''f of x' minus l1'.

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.970
And these two terms could be
combined together, we factor

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:19.430
out an 'l1' times what?

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:22.060
''g of x' minus 'l2'.

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.150
And even though the details
would have been considerably

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:26.420
different, the intuitive
approach would have been--

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:28.060
well, look.

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:33.730
This is pretty close to 'l2'
when 'x' is near 'a'.

00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:35.820
This I can make as
small as I want.

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.580
Similarly, I can do the same
things over here, and pretty

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:42.010
soon you've got the idea that
you can make this sum as small

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:46.800
as you want just by choosing
these sufficiently small.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.840
And there's no unique
way of doing this.

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:52.700
Now, here's a main point.

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:56.900
Once all this work has been
done, for a wide variety of

00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:01.730
problems we never again have to
use an epsilon or a delta.

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:04.010
Let me illustrate with
one problem.

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:06.760
Let's suppose we were given
the problem limit of 'x

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:10.010
squared plus 7x' as 'x
approaches 3', and we wanted

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:11.450
to find that limit.

00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:14.300
Our intuitive thing would
be to do what?

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:19.880
Let 'x' equal 3, in which case
we get 9 plus 21 is 30.

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:23.190
But we know by now that this
instruction says that 'x'

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:25.850
can't equal 3.

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:26.620
This is the problem.

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:28.960
We get what appears to be a nice
answer that we believe

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.090
in, but by an illegal method.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:34.410
Can we use our legal methods
to gain the same result?

00:42:34.410 --> 00:42:36.000
The answer is yes.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.440
Because, you see, what is
'x squared plus 7x'?

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:43.260
It's the sum of two functions,
and we've just proven that the

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:46.140
limit of the sum is the
sum of the limits.

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:48.170
For example, what I
can say is this.

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:49.340
I don't know if this is true.

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:56.880
What I do know is true is that
the limit of 'x squared plus

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.930
7x' as 'x' approaches 3 is a
limit of 'x squared' as 'x'

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:03.960
approaches 3 plus the limit of
'7x' as 'x' approaches 3.

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:05.000
How do I know that?

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.700
I've proven that the
limit of a sum is

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:07.900
the sum of the limits.

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:09.100
Now what is this?

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:11.330
This is really a product.

00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:14.210
This is really the limit
of 'x' times 'x'.

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:17.490
But we already know that the
limit of a product is the

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:18.580
product of the limits.

00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:20.130
See, we proved that theorem.

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:23.240
Well, we almost proved it,
certainly close enough so I

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:27.000
think that we can
say that we did.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.250
And this is a product also.

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:37.765
So you see, we can get from here
to here to here just by

00:43:37.765 --> 00:43:39.100
our theorem.

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:42.420
Now didn't we also prove as one
of our theorems earlier

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:45.910
that the limit of 'x' as 'x'
approaches 'a' is 'a' itself?

00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:46.870
Sure, we did.

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:50.580
In particular then, the limit of
'x' as 'x' approaches 3 has

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:54.390
already been proven to be 3.

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:56.800
So this is 3, this is 3.

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.670
What is the limit of 7
as 'x' approaches 3?

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:03.810
Well, 7 is a constant, and we
already proved that the limit

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:05.690
of a constant as 'x'
approaches 'a'

00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:07.080
is that same constant.

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.740
So what is the constant here?

00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:09.830
It's 7.

00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:12.340
And what's the limit of 'x'
as 'x' approaches 3?

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:13.600
That's 3.

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.810
So by using our theorems,
we get from what?

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:20.050
From here to here
to here to here.

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:22.645
And now hopefully from a theorem
that comes from some

00:44:22.645 --> 00:44:26.480
place around the third grade,
3 times 3 is 9, 7 times 3 is

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.220
21, the sum is 30.

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:32.280
And now you see this is no
longer a conjecture.

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.660
This follows, inescapably, from
the rules of our game,

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:38.140
from the rules and our
basic definition.

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:43.470
By the way, you may have a
tendency to feel when you see

00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:47.220
something like this that, why
did we need the epsilons and

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:48.210
deltas in the first place?

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:49.450
Wasn't it a terrible waste?

00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:50.670
Well, two things.

00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:54.160
First of all, we couldn't prove
our theorems without the

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:55.430
epsilons and deltas.

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:58.860
And secondly, and don't lose
sight of this, in many real

00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:02.930
life situations you may very
well be faced with the type of

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:06.420
a problem that doesn't ask you
to prove that the limit of 'x

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:10.050
squared plus 7x' is 30 as 'x'
approaches 3, but rather might

00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:15.710
say how close must 'x' be chosen
to 3 if we want 'x

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:21.100
squared plus 7x' to be
less than 30.023.

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:23.430
And then, you see, if that's
the kind of a problem you

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:26.030
have, these new theorems
will not solve

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:27.740
that problem for you.

00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:29.030
So we're not making
a choice here.

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:32.130
All we're saying is that the
epsilons and deltas are the

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:36.210
backbone of limits, but that
fortunately through

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:40.920
mathematical theorems, we can
get simpler ways of getting

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:41.980
important results.

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:43.800
And that was our main
purpose of today's

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:44.970
lecture, these two things.

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:47.870
That completes our lecture for
today, and so on until next

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:49.120
time, good bye.
