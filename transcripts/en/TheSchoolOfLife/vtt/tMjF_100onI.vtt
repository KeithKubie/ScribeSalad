00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.910
Christianity has, traditionally, spoken a
lot about sinners. In the fourth century,

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.150
the Church identified ‘seven deadly sins’:
failings of character that were to be particularly

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:23.390
condemned and avoided by all righteous people.
They were; Pride (being snobbish and boastful)

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:30.590
Envy, Wrath (getting very angry), Gluttony
(eating too much), Lust (wanting to sleep

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:38.559
around), Sloth (being lazy) and finally
 Greed. Christianity took these to be severe

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.559
faults of the soul that marked out a person
as a fitting target for scolding and punishment.

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.030
God himself would, on the Day of Judgement,
be remorseless with sinners and send them

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.940
to spend millennia in the darker, more tortured
bits of Purgatory. We may not use precisely

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.670
such traditional, theological words today,
and we may not imagine the Creator of the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.920
Universe as someone who organises chastisement
for people beyond the grave. But, in the spirit

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.960
in which we interpret failings of character
and respond to people’s less fortunate sides

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.440
in the online and real worlds, we tend to
retain a similarly damning and ungenerous

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.050
set of attitudes. We may feel that, through
our harshness, we are helping humanity to

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.020
improve, but if this is really our goal, then
it pays to move beyond mere condemnation in

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.780
an attempt to understand what truly drives
people in their more regrettable moments.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.860
We stand to stumble on a surprising truth:
behaviour we call sinful is never simply that.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.471
It represents an unfortunate first response
to difficulty and distress that could, if

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:52.270
it were properly understood, guided and forgiven,
be redirected towards nobler ends. We aren’t

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.590
evil, so much as in a lot of pain in a series
of areas. Let’s consider each of the seven

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.370
sins in turn: Pride – It can appear as if
we end up boasting and grandstanding because

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.349
we’re so pleased with ourselves. Far from
it. Boasting is only ever a response to a

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.400
feeling of invisibility. We badly need to
thrust forward an idea of our own importance

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.319
because (behind the scenes) our very right
to exist seems so much in question. We see

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.379
it as almost inevitable that others will think
ill of us – unless we urgently and dramatically

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:32.300
assert our greatness. That is why, of all
people, the proud don’t need to be told

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.680
they are terrible; this is precisely what
they secretly think they are already. They

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.230
need encouragement to feel a more genuine
pride in their own merits – so as to be

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:49.150
spared the manic impulse constantly to call
them to the attention of others. Envy – Envy

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.250
is a graceless way of confronting an idea
that is, in other contexts, fundamental to

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.529
decent ambition as well as modesty of character:
the notion that we are incomplete, imperfect

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:06.349
and in need of improvement. Envy grows from
the legitimate insight that others have something

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.669
to teach us – mixed together with a degree
of inaccuracy and panic about what this might

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:18.769
actually be. Envy should, ideally, be our
teacher. We should note when it strikes us,

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.969
sift through its confused signals and use
them to work out our direction and purpose.

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:28.459
The solution isn’t to be made to feel guilty
for our envious attacks. It is to be helped

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:35.480
to understand what is truly missing from our
lives. Wrath – The mean angry things we

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.790
say when we’re upset are almost never truly
meant. They are the result of panic and anxiety.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.659
We call someone a stupid fool because we are,
that moment, terrified. We shout because we

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:52.920
feel we’re fighting for our lives. Therefore,
instead of being repeatedly told how appalling

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.530
it is to be angry (we of course know this
quite well already), what we need is someone

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.590
to demonstrate a proper understanding of our
underlying fears. ‘You must be scared’

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.349
is the kindest but also the most effective
response to any angry outburst; it puts its

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:14.800
finger on what is really going on. We need
others to appreciate our fragility, not berate

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:21.310
us for our roars. Gluttony – We eat too
many chicken wings and toasted sandwiches

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.560
not because we’re greedy, but because we
are emotionally starving. We want love far

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.590
more than we want calories; we’re just at
a loss as to how to find it. So the solution

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.900
isn’t to be told to eat less (as diet gurus
and Christian theologians suggest); it is

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.340
to be helped to discover new sources of kindness,
security and emotional connection. Our appetite

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.470
isn’t essentially bad – it simply hasn’t
found its ideal target. Our excess weight

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:57.090
is a symbol of our background emotional undernourishment.
Lust – We want to keep jumping into bed

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:03.060
with people not out of degeneracy, but because
we are lonely. Sex is the epitome of connection

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.600
and acceptance. The so-called ‘bad’ and
erotic things we crave feel so exciting because

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.140
we read them as proofs of someone else’s
open-ended affection, which is in such short

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:20.320
supply in ordinary life. Ideally we’d not
be less lustful, we’d be clearer about what

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:29.030
we genuinely need from sex: which is acceptance
of our messy, complex and all-too-human selves.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:35.110
Sloth – Laziness is really fear. We can’t
bear to get down to our work, because if we

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.750
were to apply ourselves, we risk terrifying
humiliation. We might not succeed as well

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.780
as we’d like, we might find a task too hard,
we may realise we’re not yet equipped to

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.860
undertake it or be mocked by the world. These
aren’t failings so much as hugely understandable

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:57.690
anxieties. Behind our inaction is anticipated
disaster; a catastrophizing mind. We will

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:03.560
begin at last when the fear of doing nothing
at all trumps the crippling fear of doing

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:11.990
something badly. Greed – The powerful urge
to take more than our fair share is really

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.870
a reaction to a feeling of deprivation; we’ve
felt so neglected and vulnerable, we require

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:23.440
ever more. Our fear is so entrenched, we’re
trying to keep it at bay by grabbing as much

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:30.500
as we can, as quickly as possible. To others,
we may make look already advantaged and privileged;

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:43.750
inside we just feel desperate. In short, our
‘sins’ are not signs of being bad people.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:49.300
They are the shape our unmet needs take when
we haven’t found any better way of addressing

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:55.360
them. We don’t have to be berated or threatened
with hell. We need an open affection that

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.580
welcomes us as we are, a forgiveness that
doesn’t involve criticism and a tenderness

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:06.960
that delicately, without humiliation, locates
our true vulnerabilities and encourages our

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.560
own native appetite 
for reform.
