1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.600
Is there a way to practice the hard conversations? 100% there is,

2
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.350
and so many people think they're above rehearsals,

3
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.650
roleplay. Those are,

4
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.980
those are things that are critical to seal performance in the battlefield.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.190
I think a lot of people don't realize that. We actually, we,

6
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.280
we do work rehearsals and walk throughs before every single operation and we try

7
00:00:25.151 --> 00:00:28.030
to mimic that. Maybe it's, you know, we're out training in the desert.

8
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.860
We might even have like, you know,

9
00:00:29.861 --> 00:00:34.330
we might lay out rocks or our put tape on the ground. So it, it mimics bill.

10
00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:37.540
If we, if we, if there's not actual buildings to use for training facilities,

11
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.130
there are, uh, uh,

12
00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:42.670
and we have everyone stand together and their sticks and we know who's getting

13
00:00:42.671 --> 00:00:45.610
on the helicopter here and these guys are gonna be on the second helicopter

14
00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:46.000
there.

15
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Those are the kinds of things that allow people in the dark of night when it's

16
00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:52.570
crazy and it's chaotic to go to the right place, do what they're supposed to do.

17
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.860
Everything is simple as unloading from a vehicle. Just,

18
00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.220
we would practice that. We, we, we, we had this, uh,

19
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.340
we had this giant truck that we use when,

20
00:01:03.341 --> 00:01:07.960
when the ID threat started getting really bad in Iraq. Uh, initially, um,

21
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.370
seal seal softeners were riding in the back on benches in the back of a Humvee,

22
00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:16.240
kind of an open bed, like a truck truck tie back. Uh, and then the ID thread,

23
00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:19.120
the road tie bombs are sort of getting so dangerous that we had to put guys

24
00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:23.150
inside armor. And so, uh, that means that the Humvees were,

25
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.200
can only carry five guys, you know, if you don't have guys in the back. So, um,

26
00:01:26.201 --> 00:01:29.500
so we had to take this giant, we call it the man truck and we would,

27
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.160
I think we nicknamed it big Ziff was our, it was our truck and it was a,

28
00:01:33.161 --> 00:01:36.850
it was a big, um, five ton truck and you know,

29
00:01:36.851 --> 00:01:38.800
a flatbed truck and they'd,

30
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.110
I don't know if previous seals or if the army had done it marine,

31
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.840
but we had welded these a a quarter inch steel, uh, plates around it.

32
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.340
And then we had a, than we had a sandbox in the bottom of it.

33
00:01:51.341 --> 00:01:52.210
So that was like our,

34
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.550
that was our protection and most of the sandbags were like torn up cause the

35
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.780
boots going in and out. And so it was, you're just sitting on sand.

36
00:01:58.781 --> 00:01:59.680
So if you got blown up,

37
00:01:59.681 --> 00:02:02.500
it would not have provided a whole lot of protection from me.

38
00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:05.800
But getting blown up in Sandy, getting out of the truck is, is substantial.

39
00:02:05.801 --> 00:02:09.490
When you got 20 guys sit in the back of that truck and there, you know, uh,

40
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.760
with some of our guys, Iraqi, uh, of soldiers that were with us, our junkies,

41
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.080
um, and you got to open swing open this giant heavy, you know,

42
00:02:17.081 --> 00:02:20.890
quarter inch steel doors in the back and then you've got to put a ladder out and

43
00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:23.530
everyone's got to climb down that ladder. That takes some time.

44
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.080
And guess what? That can turn into three stooges real quick.

45
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.570
No doubt. People just fall onto them. We can get injured.

46
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.870
We've had guys fall off in trucks like that and dislocate their shoulders and

47
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.200
literally have to get sent home. But more important if it's,

48
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.840
if it takes three minutes or four minutes to do something like that,

49
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.110
that's three or four minutes that you don't have guns pointed in every

50
00:02:44.111 --> 00:02:45.760
direction. Uh, and it's critical.

51
00:02:45.761 --> 00:02:48.970
So we had to practice that and practice that and practice that until we could do

52
00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:53.140
it in less than 30 seconds. And then if we have two different assault forces,

53
00:02:53.141 --> 00:02:55.360
we got to make sure assault ones line up on the left side of the road,

54
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.920
assault twos line up on the right side of the road.

55
00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.610
I mean those things that you, we have to practice over and over and over again.

56
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.490
And it seems really juvenile, it seems very elementary. But if, if you did,

57
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.810
if you took the time to practice that performance,

58
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.590
your performance is so much better when you actually get out in the dark of

59
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:14.530
night. The chaos of me in an unknown area and worried about, you know,

60
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.200
bad guys and where they are and all those things happening and making sure

61
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:20.080
people went to the place they need to go. So having those conversations,

62
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.161
practicing it,

63
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:24.820
sitting down with someone who understands how that person might respond for a

64
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:28.430
tough conversation, roleplay maybe, you know, they, they, uh, they,

65
00:03:28.431 --> 00:03:31.030
they tried different scenarios where they're, they're really,

66
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:34.510
it's a softball or easy scenario. It's a difficult scenario. And, and uh,

67
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.020
it's the worst case scenario, worst case scenario. So the more you do that,

68
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.900
the better it is. And this is something that Jocko and I have done quite a bit,

69
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.450
is with comedies we work with is roleplay.

70
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.180
You've got to counsel a guy and it's easy just to say, well, you screwed up.

71
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.050
We're firing you. But if it's, this is a good guy, he messed up.

72
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.150
You got to try to get him on board to use this plan,

73
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:55.450
or you have to talk him down from doing this out on it. You know,

74
00:03:55.451 --> 00:03:58.190
he did something out in town that is making the company a little about what or

75
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.940
whatever it is, uh, and you have to talk to them.

76
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:04.120
And that role play is critical and it makes you better and enables you to

77
00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:08.970
perform better. Uh, and so yes, you have to do that. Or hers. Yup.

78
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.600
Three or four iterations with someone dealing with, in a roleplay scenario,

79
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.930
they get better. You can literally see them get better. It's pretty, uh,

80
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.530
pretty cool. We got pretty good getting in and out of big Zev.
