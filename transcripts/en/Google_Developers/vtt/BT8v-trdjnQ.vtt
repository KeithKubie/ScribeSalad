00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:10.775
ARJITA SETHI: Welcome back
to Public Speaking Pro

00:00:10.775 --> 00:00:14.630
Tips with Speechless presented
by Google Developers.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.510
We help people turn the
mundane into memorable.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.260
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
Challenges into insights.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.800
ARJITA SETHI: And presentations
into performances.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.770
CLAIRE SLATTERY: And we
do that with something we

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.030
call improv thinking.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.405
ARJITA SETHI:
Today, we are going

00:00:25.405 --> 00:00:28.040
to help Claire come up with
a company [INAUDIBLE] script

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.590
while we walk between meetings.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.090
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
So I just found out

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.729
that I have to say a little
something about myself

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.210
tomorrow at a meeting, and
I have absolutely no time

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.175
to prepare for it.

00:00:36.175 --> 00:00:38.030
ARJITA SETHI: So
let's do something

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.025
we call elevator pitch.

00:00:39.025 --> 00:00:40.150
CLAIRE SLATTERY: All right.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.084
Let's do it.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.410
ARJITA SETHI: Now tell me, what
are you going to talk about?

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.260
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Well,
that's the thing.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.409
I have no idea.

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:50.700
ARJITA SETHI: Well, if you're
just introducing yourself

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.930
to the team, just pick
one thing that stands out

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.380
and focus on that.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.904
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Well, I did
recently moved to Los Angeles.

00:00:57.904 --> 00:00:58.820
ARJITA SETHI: Perfect.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.535
Talk about that.

00:00:59.535 --> 00:01:00.660
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Right now?

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.660
ARJITA SETHI: Right now.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.522
You have only 10
more floors to go.

00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:05.110
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Oh, OK.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.940
MALE SPEAKER: Excuse me.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.440
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
I'm Claire Slattery

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.160
and I'm a Speechless specialist.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.330
It's great to be back
in San Francisco.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.270
I loved living here
for 4 and 1/2 years.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.260
But last year, I
decided to make the move

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.630
to Hollywood-- you know,
because I like wearing shorts

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.190
every day of the year.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.440
And also, I'm a professional
actor-- no big deal.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.280
And as much as I love
me some San Francisco,

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.110
I can't win an Emmy doing
commercials for startups--

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.100
unless I can, in
which case, I'm moving

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.581
back immediately because I
really miss the burritos.

00:01:33.581 --> 00:01:34.580
ARJITA SETHI: OK, great.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.750
But you rambled a bit.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.260
Tell me the story again, but
now you have only five more

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.100
floors to go.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.840
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Fair enough.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.760
Hi, I'm Claire Slattery and
I'm a Speechless specialist

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.020
based in LA.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.610
It's great to be
back in the Bay Area.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.060
But as much as I love
me some San Francisco,

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.610
I can't win an Emmy doing
commercials for startups--

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.030
unless I can, in which case,
I'm coming back immediately.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.580
ARJITA SETHI: OK, time's up.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.260
That was great.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.802
I'll send you the audio files.

00:02:01.802 --> 00:02:03.010
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Audio files?

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.037
ARJITA SETHI: Yep, I
recorded the entire thing.

00:02:05.037 --> 00:02:05.870
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Oh.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.210
ARJITA SETHI: Basically,
you TimeBox your talk

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.580
so that you can get the general
outline out of your month.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.910
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
Wow, I love that.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.940
ARJITA SETHI: Yep,
starting the script

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.630
is a lot of times
the hardest part.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.520
But giving a presentation is
something you do by speaking,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.330
ultimately.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.867
So why not just start speaking?

00:02:24.867 --> 00:02:26.450
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
Makes a lot of sense.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.590
ARJITA SETHI: Doesn't it?

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.360
It's what we call on
your feet first draft.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.630
And with elevator pitch, you can
expand and contract your talk

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.810
based on how much time
you either have to prepare

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.260
or how long the
talk needs to be.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.080
CLAIRE SLATTERY: So
how long were those?

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.580
ARJITA SETHI:
Well, the first one

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.130
was about 10 floors--
I mean, 30 seconds.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.120
And the second one-- 15 seconds.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.370
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Good to know.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.259
So what do I do now?

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:54.050
ARJITA SETHI: Just
listen back to the files

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.110
and keep iterating on the talk.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.816
You can TimeBox and
record yourself.

00:02:57.816 --> 00:02:59.940
CLAIRE SLATTERY: But wait
a second, what's TimeBox?

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.481
ARJITA SETHI: It's
just an alarm that

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:04.960
allows you to know when to
move onto your next task.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.900
Let's say you only want to
spend 30 minutes on your talk.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.060
You set the timer and then
record your rehearsals,

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.600
and keep improving it.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.750
When your timer goes off,
you put the last touches

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.700
on what you want to finish.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.080
And you might never have to
sit down and write anything.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.080
CLAIRE SLATTERY: You have
just saved me, Arjita.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.360
I really thought I
was going to have

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.880
to cancel dinner plans with a
friend and work on this speech

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.380
all night.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.490
But basically, we have
it outlined before lunch.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.130
ARJITA SETHI: And
Claire, you can't

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.080
win an Emmy doing commercials,
but you could win a Clio.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.700
See you later.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.300
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
Now you tell me.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.480
Now it's your turn.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.740
Go ahead and make a video with
your one-minute elevator pitch.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.090
Then do it in 30 seconds,
15 seconds, and finally

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.320
just one word.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.820
Not only do you have the
outline for the longer version,

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.630
but you also have the
keyword for your whole talk.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.580
We like to think of it
as your mantra word.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.190
After you make your
elevator pitch,

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.200
post it to social with the
hashtag #DevelopYourVoice.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.610
