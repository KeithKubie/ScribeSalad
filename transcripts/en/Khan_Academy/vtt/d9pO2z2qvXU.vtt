00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.952
Which of the following real
numbers are irrational?

00:00:03.952 --> 00:00:07.090
Well, irrational just
means it's not rational.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.630
It means that you cannot
express it as the ratio of two

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.489
integers.

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:12.780
So let's see what we have here.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.920
So we have the square
root of 8 over 2.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.850
If you take the square root
of a number that is not

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.471
a perfect square, it is
going to be irrational.

00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:23.470
And then if you just take
that irrational number

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.150
and you multiply it, and you
divide it by any other numbers,

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.680
you're still going to
get an irrational number.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.140
So square root of
8 is irrational.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.090
You divide that by 2,
it is still irrational.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.930
So this is not rational.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.240
Or in other words, I'm
saying it is irrational.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.520
Now, you have pi,
3.14159-- it just

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.740
keeps going on and on and on
forever without ever repeating.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.930
So this is irrational,
probably the most famous

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.210
of all of the
irrational numbers.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.690
5.0-- well, I can
represent 5.0 as 5/1.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.550
So 5.0 is rational.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.030
It is not irrational.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:08.540
0.325-- well, this is the
same thing as 325/1000.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.160
So I can clearly represent
it as a ratio of integers.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.180
So this is rational.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.250
Just as I could represent
5.0 as 5/1, both of these

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.070
are rational.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.130
They are not irrational.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.180
Here I have
7.777777, and it just

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.930
keeps going on and
on and on forever.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.680
And the way we denote
that, you could just

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.120
say these dots that say
that the 7's keep going.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.860
Or you could say 7.7.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.840
And this line shows that
the 7 part, the second 7,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.260
just keeps repeating on forever.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.570
Now, if you have a repeating
decimal-- in other videos,

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.790
we'll actually convert
them into fractions--

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.360
but a repeating decimal
can be represented

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.350
as a ratio of two integers.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.860
Just as 1/3 is equal to
0.333 on and on and on.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.060
Or I could say it like this.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.260
I could say 3 repeating.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.910
We can also do the
same thing for that.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.580
I won't do it here,
but this is rational.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.830
So it's not irrational.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.150
8 and 1/2?

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.360
Well, that's the same thing.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.530
8 and 1/2 is the
same thing as 17/2.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.540
So it's clearly rational.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.530
So the only two
irrational numbers

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.659
are the first two
right over here.
