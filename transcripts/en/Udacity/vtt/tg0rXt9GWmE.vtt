00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.260
&gt;&gt; So how exactly different are human beings?

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.430
&gt;&gt; Well, our genomes are approximately 99.9% similar.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.650
&gt;&gt; That is not a lot of difference.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.010
&gt;&gt; Well, it may seem like there's not

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.498
much difference between us, but our human genome is

00:00:13.498 --> 00:00:17.340
three billion letters. And if we're only 0.1% different,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.590
you tell me. What's 0.1% of 3 billion letters?
