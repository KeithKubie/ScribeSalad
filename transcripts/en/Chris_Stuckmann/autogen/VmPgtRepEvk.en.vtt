00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730
don't really want to say what he is or
 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.890
don't really want to say what he is or
what he does because his character is

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900
what he does because his character is
 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.360
what he does because his character is
also very twisty and turny and I don't

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370
also very twisty and turny and I don't
 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.250
also very twisty and turny and I don't
want to spoil what his character is but

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260
want to spoil what his character is but
 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.990
want to spoil what his character is but
I didn't really buy his character I'll

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000
I didn't really buy his character I'll
 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.309
I didn't really buy his character I'll
just put it that way he didn't have that

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319
just put it that way he didn't have that
 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:03.449
just put it that way he didn't have that
much screen time he didn't have that

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459
much screen time he didn't have that
 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:04.860
much screen time he didn't have that
much depth behind him at all

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870
much depth behind him at all
 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.089
much depth behind him at all
he didn't really understand what he was

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099
he didn't really understand what he was
 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.559
he didn't really understand what he was
doing some of the things he did and that

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569
doing some of the things he did and that
 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:08.759
doing some of the things he did and that
leads me to my biggest problem with this

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769
leads me to my biggest problem with this
 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.440
leads me to my biggest problem with this
movie and that is the screenplay this is

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450
movie and that is the screenplay this is
 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.330
movie and that is the screenplay this is
one of the most twisty turny movies of

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340
one of the most twisty turny movies of
 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.069
one of the most twisty turny movies of
the summer every other minute it seems

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079
the summer every other minute it seems
 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.509
the summer every other minute it seems
like there's a new twist of some kind

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519
like there's a new twist of some kind
 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.220
like there's a new twist of some kind
where a character is now at a different

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230
where a character is now at a different
 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.530
where a character is now at a different
place you're like oh what what no what

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540
place you're like oh what what no what
 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.390
place you're like oh what what no what
now it doesn't really make sense it's

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400
now it doesn't really make sense it's
 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.640
now it doesn't really make sense it's
very convoluted and scatterbrained and

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650
very convoluted and scatterbrained and
 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.349
very convoluted and scatterbrained and
as the movie goes on more twists more

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359
as the movie goes on more twists more
 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.300
as the movie goes on more twists more
turns and more twists and more turns and

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310
turns and more twists and more turns and
 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.619
turns and more twists and more turns and
more characters going this way and

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629
more characters going this way and
 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:29.819
more characters going this way and
characters going that way and you're

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829
characters going that way and you're
 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.970
characters going that way and you're
like where does this make sense and that

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980
like where does this make sense and that
 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.080
like where does this make sense and that
really is my biggest problem with the

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090
really is my biggest problem with the
 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.610
really is my biggest problem with the
movie the script is all over the place I

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620
movie the script is all over the place I
 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.110
movie the script is all over the place I
can't really sit down and say I'm going

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120

fight and then it was pretty awesome but

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849
fight and then it was pretty awesome but
 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.250
