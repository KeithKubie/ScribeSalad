00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.010
&gt;&gt; Well, I've said this 21 times
before so, ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.780
welcome to the 22nd annual
Vardanants Day Lecture Series,

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.730
Armenian Lecture Series.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.170
This year -- well,
they're all been special

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.720
but this year is really special
because we have a conference

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.140
with some of my friends,
colleagues and academic types

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.920
to fill your day talking about
Armenian history and culture.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.440
But before I began, and
before we start this program,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.110
I'd like to introduce you
to a colleague of many years

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.780
who has held many, various
positions at the Library

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.590
of Congress, of importance
to the collections

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.060
and the preservation of those
collections, and I'm delighted

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.960
to introduce him thanks to the
appointment by the new librarian

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.110
of Congress Dr. Carla Hayden,
I'd like to introduce you

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.220
to Mr. Mark Sweeney, who is now
the principal deputy librarian

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.020
of Congress.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:02:31.070
[ Applause ]

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.370
&gt;&gt; Thank You, Lee.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.540
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the Library of Congress

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.880
in today's 22nd Vardanants
Day, Armenian Lecture Series.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.710
I'm delighted to be
addressing you in this hall

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.030
in the historic Thomas Jefferson
Building, attached to a room

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.070
on there that is dedicated to
Woodrow Wilson, the president

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.250
of so many important
moments in history,

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.910
especially of the Armenians

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.510
in the early part
of the 20th century.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.290
In 1991m Mrs. Marjorie Dadian
made a generous donation

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.790
to the Near East Section in
the name of our husband Arthur,

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.320
for the health and maintenance
of the Armenian collections.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.620
That gift not only allowed us

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.920
to appoint the first
Armenian area specialists,

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.220
but also was the
genesis of a long-running

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.600
and very successful olestra
series, which began in 1994,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.900
which is why we're here today.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.200
Since that time, the Armenian
collections have grown

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.500
from some 7,000 items
to over 40,000 --

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.800
45,000 items in our collection.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.100
The Near East section has
sponsored conferences,

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.400
such as the American response to
the Armenian Genocide in 2000,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.530
a major exhibit in 2012 to
celebrate the 500th anniversary

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.830
of the first printed
Armenian book.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.130
That exhibit to note wisdom

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.430
and instruction the
Armenian literary tradition

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.730
at the Library of Congress,
brought nearly a quarter

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.030
of a million visitors here to
the library into the galleries.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.330
The Library of Congress
remains an described important

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.630
repository of the
world's heritage,

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.930
this universal collection.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.230
And we're proud to include
among those ancient,

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.530
yet still vibrant cultures, the
history of the Armenian people,

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.830
as exemplified in the talks

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.130
of the scholars you will
soon hear today and enjoy.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.430
Again, welcome to the
Library of Congress

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.730
and please enjoy
today's program.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.040
Thank you very much.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.160
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Mark Sweeney.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.420
None of these programs
have happened in a vacuum.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.670
We have many people who are
responsible for supporting,

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.180
for helping erect everything
that in the construction

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.830
of lectures and exhibits, some
of whom I will mention later.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.750
But at this point the most
important is the next speaker,

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.420
Dr. Mary-Jane Deeb who is
the chief of the African

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.410
and Middle Eastern Division who
has been a constant supporter

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.780
of all my Armenian programs,
and this one in particular

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.970
since it is a special edition
of the Vardanants series.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.510
So, please, join me in
welcoming Dr. Mary Jane Deeb.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:31.590
[ Applause ]

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.710
&gt;&gt; Thank You, LaVon, and
thank you Mark Sweeney,

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.190
for all your support and
for everything you've done.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.560
So, honored guests, ladies
and gentlemen good morning.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.960
I too wish to welcome you
to the Library of Congress.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.580
And in the name of the Division,

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.530
the African Middle
East division,

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.360
which is hosting
this program today.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.040
I would like to use
the little time I have

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.070
to recognize all those who have
made possible this program.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.690
It takes a village,
as the saying goes,

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.460
to put together a
program such as this one,

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.690
that brings together the
best and brightest colors

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.690
in Armenian history
under one roof, or,

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.950
in the case of the
Thomas Jefferson Building,

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.950
under one dome.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.240
My thanks go first and
foremost to Dr. Lebon Abdulyang,

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.630
the organizer of this and the
21 other Vardanants programs

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.510
that have put the Armenian
collections at the Library

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.930
of Congress, at the very heart

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.740
of any scholarly
research work on Armenia.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.210
The French have a wonderful
term "uncontournable",

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.670
that loosely translates to
"unmissable", or "inescapable",

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.870
and most aptly describes
the status

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.480
of our Armenian collections
today.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.870
This is thanks to
LaVon's efforts

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.410
in developing these collections,
as well as with outreach efforts

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.130
to make these collections better
known in the United States

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.050
and throughout the world.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.710
Thanks go to Mark Sweeney,
who not only has taken time

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.480
from his extremely busy
schedule to be with us today

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.590
for Vardanants day, but who
has, throughout his tenure

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.790
as associate librarian, acting
deputy librarian and now

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.930
as a primary deputy librarian,
been extremely supportive

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.420
of the African and
Middle Eastern division,

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.720
giving us funding for new staff,

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.390
for microfilming
our newspapers --

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.200
including the Armenian
newspapers,

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.260
and giving us badly needed space

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.430
to shell our ever-growing
collections.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.530
My thanks also go to
Helena Syncome, the director

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.710
of collections and
services and her staff,

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.850
for their support regarding
all the administrative aspects

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.540
involved in planning an
event such as this one.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.830
Thanks to the Communications
Office that worked

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.410
on announcing the program and
sending out press releases,

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.680
the special events office
that turned this room

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.710
into the wonderful conference
hall that you're enjoying,

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.590
and arranging with the
caterer for breakfast,

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.630
for lunch, for breaks.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:21.130
To John Regan, who via his sound
system ensures, as he has today

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.630
and has for the past 20 years,

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.850
ensured that we can all
hear what is being said,

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.550
despite the echoes in the room,

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.920
that we can all see
what we are showing

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.350
on our PowerPoint presentations

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:38.860
and on whom we have
depended on all those years.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.120
I want to thank the webcasting
team that's behind you

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.730
that has been filming our
programs and all our events.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:53.080
And that is of critical
importance

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.330
because you'll be able to go
back to your students and say,

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.680
"I was there, I gave
this lecture,

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:03.210
I had colleagues whom I had not
met before, they're all there --

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.610
all the top scholars are
there", and share this

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.050
with your students, because
this is part of the archives

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:12.070
of this division, our webcast.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:16.510
I want to thank you, last
but certainly not least.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.290
Thank you all for
coming and being with us,

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:23.060
to celebrate this very special
day in Armenian history.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.430
I know you will very much
enjoy the program today.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:29.880
The speakers have traveled
from far and wide just to be

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.440
with you, and to have
and to share the research

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.510
and their work here at
the Library of Congress.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.510
So, thank you all for
being here, thanks.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:48.020
[ Applause ]

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.930
&gt;&gt; My thunder has
just been taken away

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:55.800
because Mary Jane has thanked so
many of the people that I wanted

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.420
to thank heart full
-- with my heart full.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:03.180
It happens that you deal with
so many people here and this is,

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:08.310
if anything, an extremely
collegial institution.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:12.290
But I'd be remiss if I did
not point out a few others.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:17.340
Dr. Paul Crego has been
my partner in acquisitions

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.410
and cataloguing of both
Armenian and Georgian,

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:24.870
and he also dabbles in
Amharic and other languages.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.400
Tomorrow Ohanyan and Clare Dego

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:32.910
of the conservation department
have taken truly unusable

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.260
manuscripts and valuable
Armenian items and turned them

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.760
into bibliographic gold.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:46.000
John Evans, the former
ambassador to Armenia who is

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.560
in attendance as he usually is,

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.140
has been a great
supporter of our programs.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.430
"The voice of America",

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:57.540
with Armen hiding his face
behind a camera has been a

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:02.000
constant source of
publicity for our programs.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.420
I want to thank them and I
want to thank the speakers

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.730
that you will hear today.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.050
Each and every one of
them I count a friend

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.140
and a dear colleague.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:20.350
Now, I purposely did not
write down my introduction

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.020
to Armenian history because I
didn't know how much time I had,

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.500
but since I had this time,
I'll speak for about an hour is

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.970
that -- no [laughter].

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:29.660
No? OK, fine.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:34.020
Let me tell you the
genesis of this conference.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.540
A little over a year ago I
was approached by someone

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.200
from the Smithsonian
and said, "this festival

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.540
on Armenian culture is
happening, would the library

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.700
like to do something to
complement this festival?"

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.250
And I said, "absolutely".

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:51.360
And I said, "now,
what could I do?"

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:56.440
Now, I had been wanting to
invite Dr. Armen Matterosian

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:02.250
and Dr. Luke Vartan Baronian to
participate in the conference

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:07.000
because of their work on
R2 and genetics etcetera,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.820
and I built this
conference around them.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:14.360
And I must tell, you I invited
these dear people and not one

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.850
of them took more than
24 hours to say, "yes,

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:18.560
we would like to participate".

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.270
However, Dr. Baronian
is not here

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:24.640
because of an unavoidable
emergency

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:28.800
and Armen has told me he
did not plan it this way,

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.300
but his wife was due
yesterday so, I said,

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.050
"you're forgiven
for not attending".

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:40.070
This year marks the 50th
anniversary of my beginning

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:45.390
to study Armenian history
and culture, academically.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:52.140
I take this study so seriously
that I will no longer call it

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.190
"Armenian Studies",
because that reduces it

00:11:55.190 --> 00:12:00.520
to almost a ghetto studying of
Armenian history and culture.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:06.210
This is the scholarly study
of Armenia, including history,

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:09.340
linguistics, literature.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:13.180
One of the things that is
maddening that I find --

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:16.690
with every culture, but
Armenian in particular,

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:18.950
is the fact that there
are certain tropes

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:21.460
that everyone knows.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:25.660
You know, the ark
landed on Mount Ararat,

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:30.850
Armenia as first Christian
country, the genocide,

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.560
the kingdom of Silesia.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:36.520
People know this, but
what they don't know is

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.770
from the very first
solid mention of Armenia

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:43.420
in the 6th century BC by the
Greek geographer Heckatias

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.070
of Mialitus and on a
Persian inscription

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:48.960
of Darrius the Great,
from that time

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.700
to the present there
is an exceedingly rich

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.880
and largely unknown history.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.470
So, I said -- I wrote to
my dear friends and said,

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:02.530
"I would like anything but first
Christian country, genocide

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.990
and the ark landing
on Mount Ararat".

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:07.290
If everyone had been able

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:10.320
to come you literally would
have gone away at 5 o'clock,

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.900
totally confused because you
would have been bombarded

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:18.010
with fact after fact and
richness after richness.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:20.580
You still are going to
go away not confused,

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:24.420
but very enlightened about
this very rich history.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.690
I'm just going to say two things
that you need to both know

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.770
about Armenia before
we continue.

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:34.000
Look at the map.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.380
You will see that Armenia
historically has been

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:41.430
in eastern Anatolia,
the Armenian plateau

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:43.320
and up to the Caucasus.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:48.120
East-west transit,
very easy, north-south,

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.390
transit extremely difficult.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:54.560
So, and this is known
as Garzonian's law

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.280
after Nina Garzon at
Columbia University.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.920
When the surrounding powers --

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.030
because Armenia was
always a client state

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:07.340
between surrounding powers,
were equal in strength or equal

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.670
in weakness, Armenia flourished

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:14.940
because east-west trade
transit was plentiful.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:21.230
When, however, one of those
entities grew stronger,

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:25.930
it created a vacuum, sucking the
other power into guess where?

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:28.550
Armenia, and it was
at these periods

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:32.340
that Armenia did not thrive.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:36.320
That is a constant in Armenian
history, most of the time it was

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.700
to surrounding powers -- I
could argue now but I won't,

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.080
that we have five at the moment.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:46.280
So, and the other constant is
the fact that Armenia thrived

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.180
and survived because there
were communities on top

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.250
of many different
mountains, and when one fell,

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.440
the other one existed.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:15:00.780
This fostered independence
but it also fostered a feeling

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:04.370
against a centralized authority.

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.770
Those are the two constants
of Armenian history,

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:09.640
and within those constants,
I want you to listen

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.960
to everything that follows.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.700
And what is going to
follow right now is

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:18.760
from my dear friend Helen C.
Evans the Metropolitan Museum

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.060
of Art.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.370
She is the Mary and
Michael Jahara's curator

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:23.670
for Byzantine Art.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:28.280
I am not going to give
you an entire biography

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.490
because that's why I
prepared this program.

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:34.310
While she is talking,
you may read it.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.160
The one thing I want
to draw your attention

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:42.530
to about Dr. Evans is that she
is curating yet another exhibit,

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:47.580
and this exhibit is on Armenia,
a huge exhibit on Armenian Art,

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.720
which will open at the
Metropolitan Museum

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.400
of Art on September 22nd.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:58.320
So, at this point, Dr. Helen
Evans, to speak on Silesia

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.510
on Mongol trade routes.

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:08.610
[ Applause ]

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:13.800
&gt;&gt; So, as the first speaker,
I would like to be the first

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.980
to thank LaVon, not just
for organizing today

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:21.120
but for all he's done farming
in studies in the United States,

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.680
by what he's done at the Library
of Congress over so many years.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:30.420
Its effect is something that we
don't always fully think about,

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.930
but we really should
always admire.

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:36.420
So, I hope very much
that all of you join me

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:39.460
in admiring him and
what he's done.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:43.400
As I hope you will know from
him, we will open an exhibition

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.920
on medieval Armenian art

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:49.130
at the MET this fall,
on September 22nd.

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:53.900
And in our research for the
exhibition and its catalog,

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:59.360
I and other catalog authors
have realized that our view

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:03.210
of the role of the Mongols,
in terms of Silesia,

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:07.400
as well as greater Armenia,
should be reconsidered.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:11.150
The devastation caused by
the Mongols as they advanced

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:15.130
into greater Armenia in the
early 1200s has been described

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:18.990
by Gregoria Wagner in Caracas
[inaudible] and recorded

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:21.710
in numerous manuscript
color fonts.

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:24.890
However, the exhibition's
research has shown

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:28.070
that there was another,
more positive aspect

00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:31.830
of the interaction between
the Mongols and the Armenians

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:37.460
in Silesia and greater Armenia
that should be studied further.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:41.410
That aspect is how much the
critical role Armenians played

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:45.770
on the trade routes of the packs
Mongolica [phonetic] contributed

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.340
to Armenian wealth in Silesia

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:52.400
and greater Armenia during the
second half of the 13th century

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.710
and well into the 14th century.

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:59.490
This talk introduces the topic

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:01.650
from an art historical
perspective,

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:05.980
in the hope that others will
study the matter further.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.750
As someone whose primary
research has been on the kingdom

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:14.660
of Silesia, I'm approaching the
issue through evidence there.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.260
Like others, I've
always recognized

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:21.200
that the Silesian king had the
first alliance with the Mongols

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.150
in the early 1250's
was important.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:27.230
However, when viewing the
handsome, fortified ruins

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.020
of the Armenian killing
Kingdom of Silesia

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.540
on the Mediterranean coast,

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:36.800
I've never adequately considered
the source of the funds required

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.110
to maintain such magnificent
sites as the hegemon fortress

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:43.690
of Lambrom on the
right and the walls

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:47.090
of the Silesian capital
of Cyss on the left.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:49.880
I hope to show today
that from the time this

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:54.640
of the Silesian-Mongol
Alliance until the fall

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.880
of the Silesian Kingdom
in the late 14th century,

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.490
Silesian control of
Mongol trade routes was key

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:06.880
to the great Kingdom's
wealth and authority.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.930
Richly gilded royal
portraits like these

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:11.720
of king Heptune's son LaVon

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.890
and his wife display
elaborate silk robes.

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:21.170
What was the source of the
silks in 1262 when LaVon

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:24.770
and lady Quran were shown if
their marriage on the left,

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:27.210
and a decade later when
they knelt in prayer

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:29.910
with their children
on the right?

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:34.020
It's not enough to argue as
I long have that these images

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.300
with their extensive
references to Byzantine art,

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.170
were only evidence of
the increasing power

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.740
of the Silesian state
and its ambition

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:46.450
to be the new Byzantium, as the
power of the Empire weakened

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:49.890
with the Fourth Crusade in 1204.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:53.150
It is relevant that they
displayed their ambition

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:56.770
by increasingly adopting
the Royal images and dress

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:58.530
of the Byzantine emperors.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.420
At their wedding, the young
royals are shown being blessed

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:04.110
by Christ, as found
in Byzantine art,

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:07.390
and Prince LaVon wears the
tablon of Byzantine Royals

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:09.090
on his tunic -- on his mantle.

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:14.140
A few years later, when they
kneel beneath the Byzantine

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:18.510
douses, now king LaVon and
queen Quran, they are dressed

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.170
like the Byzantine emperors,

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:23.240
including wearing
the imperial laurels.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:27.720
Nothing in the images
directly relates to Mongols.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:32.170
Rather the only other
external influence is the West,

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:36.430
as shown in the kneeling poses
and the crowns of the royals

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:41.080
and the Queen Quran
Gospel on the right.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.430
What is relevant today
is to consider the source

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:47.910
of the wealth that supported
the richly gilded portraits

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:49.640
and the ambitions

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.440
of the Silesian ruling
class they portray.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.430
I am arguing that the
answer was a control

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:59.190
of trade routes for the Mongols.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:01.640
Armenians had long
been of critical force

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.540
on the Silk Route
trade, east-west,

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.650
as LaVon referred to
with the Garzoian.

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:10.940
In the 13th century with
arrival the Mongols,

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:15.080
the Armenians ultimately were
able to maintain a similar role

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:19.610
under Mongol rule, and
expanded, by controlling Ayahs,

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:23.350
as we will see, a major
port city for the exchange

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:25.530
of goods with the West.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.830
The expanse of the textile trade

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:30.970
for Silesia is most
easily visible

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:35.370
in these two manuscripts written
for archbishop Johannes John,

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:38.760
the brother of King Heptune The
First and uncle of King LaVon.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:43.260
On the left, in the
Marshall Ocean gospel of 1274

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.870
from the Morgan Library,

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:50.320
the archbishop wears a
fleur-de-lis decorated vestment

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:54.650
and he's to the far left.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:57.420
That is representative
of Western Europe,

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.590
most especially France.

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:03.790
He presents the marshal's family
to the Virgin they are kneeling,

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:07.350
and she is reaching --
extending her mantle over them.

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:11.330
That's opposed, most closely
associated with Minnuchio's

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.400
"Madonna of the Franciscans",

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.800
as their necessity
unrecognized long ago.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:20.590
On the right in 1289,
the year of his death,

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:25.450
the Archbishop's tunic is
decorated with a Chinese dragon.

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:29.310
Dikron Kim Jong has linked
the Dragons posed to a textile

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:32.460
in the MET's collection,
from East Central Asia,

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:35.810
a region under Mongol control.

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:39.660
You see a fleur-de-lis
textile beside the early image

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.200
of the archbishop on the left,

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.440
and the MET's Chinese dragon
beside his later image

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.900
on the right.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.160
The fabrics of the Arts bishops
two vestments represent the

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.490
extreme ends of Silesia
trade routes.

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:56.050
To the west, links to France,

00:22:56.050 --> 00:23:00.370
whose King Louis the Ninth had
allied so closely with Silesia

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:03.520
when he came East on
crusade, that on his return

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.350
to France he left his
ward Bowman the Sixth,

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:11.760
the young Prince of Antioch
under the care of King Heptune.

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:15.070
To the east, a continued
Armenian presence

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:19.210
on the silk routes that were
now under Mongol control.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:22.320
By the dates of bishop
John's manuscripts,

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:26.160
the Silesian state had extensive
links with the Mongols.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.200
To avoid Mongol military
conquests that had happened

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.820
in greater Armenia, King Heptune
had surrendered the harem

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.290
of the Seljuk ruler,
who had been sent to him

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:37.970
for safety to the Mongols.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:40.370
Constable Simbad had
to his older brother,

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:44.040
then went to the Mongol
capital at Karakorum in Siberia

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:48.660
and 1247-48, where he
successfully arranged the first

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.670
treaty between the Mongols
and a Christian state

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:53.900
which had not been invaded.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.430
When Simbad returned to Silesia,

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:59.160
he brought with him
a Mongol wife,

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:03.490
as Mongol treaties were
confirmed by marriage alliances.

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:07.830
The son of that alliance is
recorded as being present

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:12.300
at the Silesian court
in 1264-65,

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.810
evidence of the Silesian
state's role as a vassal

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:20.920
of the Mongols was also clear
clearly demonstrated in 1260,

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:25.510
when King Heptune, accompanied
by the Prince of Antioch,

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:29.000
marched with the Mongols as
they entered Damascus upon their

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.380
conquest of the city.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:35.990
Silesia's port cities,
especially Ayahs,

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:40.470
are an understudied link in
the appreciation of the wealth

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:44.510
that came to Silesia through
control of Mongol trade routes.

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:49.780
The Western book of
Marbles illuminated in 1271,

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.500
shows Ayahs as a busy
city, filled with men

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.290
and Western dress as
you see on the left.

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:58.480
But it was a Silesian
city, and by that fact,

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:02.240
the westernmost port
of the Mongol Empire.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:07.330
Western Europeans who wish
to reach the east for trade,

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:09.870
or as missionaries,
were most likely

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:12.920
to enter the east through Ayahs.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.530
Most famous of those was
Marco Polo, who went east

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:19.580
through the port in 1271.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:23.890
He recorded that it was a city
full of spices and textiles

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:28.200
of wool and cloth of gold, that
were brought there from inland,

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.050
clearly meaning that these
goods were then transported

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:32.630
further west.

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:35.740
The image on the screen
doesn't record in a way

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:39.740
that we can recognize the
Silesians who rule the city,

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.880
are any Mongols who would
have been interested

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.390
in protecting their
Western north city,

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:46.310
yet they were present.

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:49.350
And this is shown on a portalon,

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:55.590
a chart of the Mediterranean
Sea routes of 1339 on the right.

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:57.790
Let's see if I can
make this work.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:01.110
Silesia -- boy, that's
doing no good.

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:05.340
So, come two-thirds of the
way down and third of the way

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:08.780
over you see kind
of a green square,

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:12.520
that is Silesia and
it's port cities.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:17.790
The Silesian flags in this
western map are prominently

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:21.990
displayed and Eius and the
other solution ports of Tarsus

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:24.490
and Cortez are clearly
identified

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:27.750
within the green area, if
you can see it clearly.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:31.840
What's also interesting is
that the two mount peaks

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:36.520
of Mount Ararat are, if you go
up, and there's a red square

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.720
and then right to the side
of that are two green Peaks,

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.440
which actually have
Noah's Arc on them,

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.450
and are clearly identified
as Mount Ararat.

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:46.670
And I think -- I would suggest
that that shows that they know

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:50.340
that goods are traveling through
greater Armenia to reach Silesia

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:54.220
to be loaded onto the ships
whose roots are being shown

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:55.520
on this map.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:59.530
And that this is
a relevant aspect

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:02.710
of what makes Silesia
so wealthy.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:11.000
Mongol Authority and Silesia in
the early 1300s is most visible

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.810
and the illumination of
king LaVon the fourth

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:18.160
by Sergei's pit sack of 1331.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:22.060
The text is a translation
of a crusader legal code,

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:27.780
the ascesis of Antioch meant for
use in Silesia, and King LaVon

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:31.280
on the upper right wears
a western fleur-de-lis

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.220
inspired crown.

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:38.330
However, he sits cross-legged on
a low throne, the type of pose

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:42.990
and throne found in depictions
of Mongol authorities.

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:46.090
By this date, the Western
presence through intermarriage

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:49.000
and connections with the
Catholic Franciscans was

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.640
so widespread in Silesia that it
would seem logical for the King

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.920
to be shown sitting,
as in the West.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.360
And I would argue
that his Eastern pose

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:01.870
in this image should be
understood as further evidence

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:04.000
of the important of
Silesia relations

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.690
with their Mongol overlords,
whom we know had troops

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:12.000
in Silesia that often
functioned his tax collectors.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.060
Silesian's links with the
Mongols have been have --

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.650
excuse me, Silesian links

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:19.890
with the Mongols must
have included connections

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:21.870
with the trade routes
the Armenians

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:25.850
of Greater Armenia controlled
for the Mongols also.

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:29.240
Rachel Kashkarian and the
exhibition catalogue notes

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.890
that the authority
of Silesia was such,

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:35.580
that around 1200 Anni
refused to make changes

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:39.000
in religious practices without
the approval of the King

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.370
of Silesia and the
patriarch of Romkla.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:44.300
Evidence of continuing
connections

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.810
between Greater Armenia arsal

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:48.910
and Silesia are also
found in manuscripts.

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:52.870
A colophon and a
commentary on Isaiah records

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:56.200
that it was written
in Silesia in 1295 --

00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:00.280
1299 before being sent to
the monastery of Gladsor,

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.160
whose school was called
a "Second Athens".

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:06.270
The portrait of S.A
Negetski on the right,

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:09.760
he's at the upper left
who was its great teacher,

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.760
was added to the
work at Gladsor.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.930
Wealthy Armenian families,
especially the Prussians

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:18.950
and Arabellians funded
the school.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:24.200
This is the era when
the Persians, Karyans

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.850
and Orbellians flourished
through their control

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:29.250
of trade routes for the Mongols.

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:31.810
Through greater Armenia
and perhaps beyond,

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:35.050
our historical evidence of
the wealth of the Persians

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:38.470
and the exhibition includes
this handsome reliquary

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:44.310
of the true cross on the left
that Prince Asayah dedicated

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:48.170
to a monastery of vegetarians,
providing perpetual problems

00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:51.950
with what to call it, his
portrait is at the base.

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:58.220
You see it in detail that I
blew up, with his hands raised

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:00.130
in prayer in the
ancient Christian manner.

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:05.450
His son, Emir Hassan,
completed the monastery

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:09.550
"The White Virgin" begun by his
father that is at the top right,

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:12.280
and decorated it with an
image of himself hunting

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.750
in Mongol dress, that
you see below it.

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:18.750
I would suggest that the
Mongol features on both

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:22.740
of these men may
indicate that the family,

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:27.060
like Constable Simbad in Silesia
seam it at their authority

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.880
with the Mongols by the
necessary intermarriage

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.690
with the elite, because
it was the way

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:34.530
on treaties were concluded.

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:39.100
And to conclude, I
am going to be brief.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:43.090
I believe that further study
is needed of the relations

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:45.410
between the Mongols
and Armenians

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:48.260
of Silesia and greater Armenia.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:53.160
This nativity scene of 1311
has long been considered

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:56.820
to be a work created in
the Mongol capital Tabriz.

00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:00.760
Silvie Marion, who is speaking
today, as shown in the catalogue

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:03.530
for Armenia, that it was
produced at Glandsor,

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:09.540
but in 1311 when the monastery
was in contact with Silesia.

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:11.860
And Evalion suggests
in the catalogue

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.920
that the Nativity displays the

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.750
"may chi" [phonetic]
in Mongol dress.

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:21.420
If so, it may be that by
the early 14th century,

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.090
Armenians profiting

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:26.770
by controlling Mongol trade
routes solve the Mongols

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:33.150
to their east, and as positive
a light as this image suggests.

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:36.970
As research expands on the work
done in the exhibition catalogue

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:41.590
by a variety of authors, with
most especially Rachel Costaryan

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:44.880
on the Armenian wealth,
derived from being a power

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:49.350
on Mongol trade routes, I
think other issues will arise.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:53.830
And one of interest to me is
whether the Silesian Armenians,

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:58.660
who moved to the Crimea,
which was under Mongol,

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:02.520
rule as the Mongols
devastated their own country,

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.720
move there as a deliberate
choice

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.730
to maintain their trade
routes with the Mongols,

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:12.030
even as the extent of the
"Pox Mongolica" declined.

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:15.130
I hope this brief
introduction to the question

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:18.040
of the Mongol impact of
the wealth of Silesia

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.340
and Mongol great control

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:22.430
of Greater Armenia will
encourage further research

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:25.230
into the role of the
Armenians as a power

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:26.530
on Mongol trade routes.

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:28.330
Thank you.

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:34.800
[ Applause ]

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.210
&gt;&gt; Thank You, Dr. Evans, I think

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:40.360
that actually is a brilliant
introduction to what I said

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.560
that there's so much
left to be studied

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.290
and produced in Armenian
history.

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:49.640
Our next speaker is someone who
is not unknown to the Library

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:53.310
of Congress and to the
region, Dr. Amy Landau.

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:56.860
She is at the -- she is the
director of cultural affairs

00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:01.000
and curator of Islamic and
South and Southeast Asian art

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.080
at the Walters Art
Museum in Baltimore.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:07.390
And if you have not been
there I really urge you to go

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:11.270
to see the splendors, and not
just the Armenians splendors.

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:15.020
Dr. Landau will speak on
a concert of luxury wares

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:16.320
and estates, the will

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.090
of the 17th century
Armenian merchants Po-hos

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:21.510
[inaudible] Anyang.

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:26.580
[ Applause ]

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:27.880
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.180
Can you all hear me?

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:33.890
I would like to begin by
warmly thanking LaVon to return

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:37.990
to some old friends who I'll
talk about today, and also to be

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:40.810
in the company of good friends.

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:44.190
And I hope to welcome all of
you to the Walters Art Museum,

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:47.080
it's only 45 minutes away.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.840
We honor, preserve and
celebrate great collection

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:54.580
of Armenian art there,
and I still look forward

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:56.790
to a future collaboration
between the Walters

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:59.010
and the Library of Congress.

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:05.830
So, my talk today pivots around
a document of great interest

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:09.290
for early modern Armenian
patronage and collecting.

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:14.030
It is the will of Jota
Pohos Vallejanian.

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:15.520
Pohos was a Zion of one

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.680
of the wealthiest
Armenian merchant families

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:20.060
of 17th century Iran.

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:24.720
His will is dated 1062
of the Islamic calendar,

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:28.540
which translates as
1646 of our Common Era

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:31.740
and it was amended
seven years later.

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:33.870
The will was originally
written in Persian,

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:37.990
and his bequest was
translated into Armenian

00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:42.480
by the 19th century historian
Ter of Hanians, to be included

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.820
in that authors "Pat
Mattoon Nor Juhaiu",

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:48.580
or "History of New Julfa".

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:53.090
Ter of Hanians oversaw the
archives of Sorb Amana Parchik,

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:55.340
was a great archivist
and historian,

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:56.640
like our dear friend LaVon,

00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:00.600
and he wrote his extraordinary
useful history published

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.770
in 1880, primarily on
the basis of Persian

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:08.950
and Armenian documents
preserved at the cathedral.

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:12.250
Poho's will, with its
really dizzying list

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:15.990
of palatial estates,
vineyards, shops,

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:19.400
gold and silver tableware,
carpets, porcelain,

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:22.090
provides a rare view of
the vast possessions owned

00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:26.040
by Armenian elites
residing in Safavid, Iran.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.170
This document excites
me as an art historian,

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:33.420
since it offers concrete
evidence of the sizable,

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:36.930
financial and physical
wealth of Armenian merchants,

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:41.530
who were also major
patrons of Arts.

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:43.830
We often reference
the enormous wealth

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:45.310
of Armenian merchants patrons

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:50.010
but rarely do we know the
details of their assets,

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:53.060
which are provided
in Poho's will.

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:56.010
In its dazzling enumeration
of properties, objects

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:59.580
and textiles, Poho's will
offers a platform for us

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:02.320
to discuss the amassment
of possessions both local

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.740
and foreign that I believe
was key to the identity

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:08.970
of 17th century Armenians.

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:13.530
Surplus wealth was constantly
communicated by Polos,

00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:17.790
his family and other
Armenian resort merchants,

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:19.190
residing as Kristyn Dime

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:21.630
that has protected
religious minorities

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:24.090
within the Safavieh Empire.

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:29.030
Pohos' lists of luxury wears
and estates prompts us to think

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:31.420
about Armenian patrons
as great collectors

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:34.440
of the early modern
world, and it has pushed me

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.160
to consider our medium
merchants,

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:41.520
not just as devout patrons, but
also as voracious collectors.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:42.820
Compared with scholarship

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:45.530
on early modern European
collecting,

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:48.470
there has not been thorough
investigation of collecting,

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:51.700
collections and collectors
in Iran.

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.430
Within the sphere of Persian
and collecting practices,

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:57.490
scholarship has tended
to focus on aggregations

00:36:57.490 --> 00:37:03.200
of specific media, such as
arts of the book and porcelain.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:07.670
Manuscripts and ceramics,
however, they were intended --

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:10.250
they were intended to
be seen and enjoyed

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:13.970
with other valuable objects,
resulting in "collections

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:19.700
of collections", according to
Hoary Twatsea, or "a concert

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:23.740
of things" as described
by Stefan Weber.

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:27.810
Drawing upon the will of Pohos,
in association with other texts

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:29.160
and images of the period,

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:32.060
such as these beautiful
life-sized oil paintings were

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:35.230
seeing in front of us, I'm
starting to explore the amassing

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:38.530
of luxury items in association
with the accumulation

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:41.690
of properties to understand
how various objects,

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:46.030
such as clocks Mira's,
Italian red velvet and glass,

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:48.940
placed in architectural
surrounds, all worked in concert

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:52.110
to express a carefully
constructed Armenian identity,

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:54.830
a successful merchant,
worldly collector

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:58.000
and devout community member.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.860
So, let me begin by just
giving you a taste of the will,

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.330
and as you could all see,

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:06.500
and this is just
the will's preamble.

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:10.190
"Before a Council, Khwaja
Polos, son of Khwaja Petros,

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:12.850
son of Kwaja Velijanean
willfully

00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:17.070
and with complete rationality
bequeaths, to his sons Hacobjan

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:21.480
and Hovhanjan, and their mother
Murasay, daughter of Voskan,

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:24.480
all his possessions of which
he himself has ownership,

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.520
either considerable
or inconsiderable,

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.440
ready cash or possessions.

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:31.960
That is, domestic movables,
vessels, table-cloths, rugs,

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.850
carpets, thick felts, clothing,
household utensils, goldware,

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:38.120
silverware, copperware,
enamelware" --

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:41.120
which was probably definitely
imported, "precious stones,

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.280
chinaware, livestock, purchased
slaves", and then he goes

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.710
on to describe all
the four-legged beasts

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:48.010
that he owned.

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:52.280
"Landed property, vineyards,
houses", and the list goes on.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:56.030
And it concludes, "whether it be
credit, charitable capital" --

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:59.970
and here he uses the Islamic
term "waqf", "that he invested

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:03.780
in Julfa at Isfahan" a
place he had built and part

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:08.880
of which he had inherited, which
are now properties in his name.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:12.730
So, as many of, you know,

00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:16.930
Shah Abbas forcibly deported
the Armenians from Julfa.

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:20.910
So, Polos' amassed possessions
should be considered in light

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:23.660
of his being third generation

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:27.440
of the Velijanean
family in, Safavid, Iran.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.590
According to Terhov Janean's,

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:31.690
Polos' grandfather
was from Haiajztan.

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:35.130
"I was among those who
were originally relocated

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:38.400
from Julfa", which you
probably saw on the map earlier.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.830
As many of you know, again,

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:43.380
Julfa was on the
contested lands,

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:46.000
along the Ottoman-Safavid
border.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.980
Shah Abbas the first
raised Julfa

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:51.170
and forcibly relocated
Julfa's residents,

00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:54.210
who had already been
profiting from the sale of silk

00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:56.960
through an extensive
trade network.

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:03.690
Due to their wealth and
mercantile connections,

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:06.750
Shah Abbas spared
Velijanean's community,

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:09.480
Velijanean's community,
the hardships endured

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:13.390
by the less affluent Armenians,
and repositioned the Julfans

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:17.830
within his empire, at Esfahan,
close to the core and very close

00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:19.720
to the commercial
center, and you have

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:24.470
to imagine this Maydan
just buzzing with merchants

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:27.600
and buyers in the 17th century.

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:32.660
New Julfa was purposely
built to house the Julfans

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:36.320
across the Zion Derude
river, the Zion Darude,

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.360
the river to the
south of Isfahan.

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:42.700
By the time Polos' father
was an active member

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.370
of the New Julfa
community, the Velijanean's,

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:47.840
along with the suburbs
other merchant families,

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:51.200
were profiting tremendously
from selling Iranian silk

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.630
across the globe,
through a network

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:55.880
of New Julfan satellite
communities.

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:58.320
Representatives of the
main wealthy families

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:03.660
of Julfa were representing the
Julfan families abroad in South,

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:06.060
Southeast Asia, East
Asia, Russia and Europe.

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.570
And, of course, we have
all this information

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:11.910
from wonderful economic
historians who are working

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:16.540
on New Julfa at the moment,
in the past ten years.

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:20.400
Surplus wealth went
into construction --

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:24.290
constructing an awesome
built environment.

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:27.990
Through a network of bridges
New Julfa became an extension

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:30.350
of Isfahan's palace precinct.

00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:31.990
The quarters of Isfahan,

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:36.250
inhabited by the Muslim
political elite, were connected

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:40.130
to the most beautiful
Armenian houses of Julfa,

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:43.660
a suburb of Isfahan through
a network of bridges,

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:46.550
such as the one you're
seeing here.

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:55.840
In Terhov Anians' history,
in the chapter dedicated

00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:00.220
to the Velijanians, he
immediately links Velijan with

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:05.210
"Sorb Bethlehem" or
"Holy Bethlehem",

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:09.340
the most stately domed church
built during the initial decades

00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:13.430
following the transportation
of the Julfans from Julfa

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:17.100
to New Julfa, in
Juha to Nor Juha.

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:19.160
Throughout this church,
one can find the name

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.080
of Polos and his family.

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:27.160
Petros, who founded this
glorious Church in 1628,

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:31.080
and now we're going to
see a picture of Petros,

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:35.060
located in the congregation
area of the church.

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:38.230
Here we see Petros
wearing a dress analogous

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:41.720
to the Muslim political
and economic elite.

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:45.370
He's wearing the fur line
vest and patterned headdress,

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:48.590
the fur probably
imported from Russia

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:53.440
where the Armenians had very
close ties around the 1660s.

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.480
And he rests his hand
on the Holy Gospel,

00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:00.020
and in the other hand, I
believe he's holding a fair mon.

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:03.570
So, a decree issued
by the Safavid Court,

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:07.900
which gives this Dime, this
Christian minority the ability

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:12.270
to build a religious
structure in Isfahan.

00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:16.920
The bequest of Polos
makes frequent reference

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:20.590
to this church, and this church
is located in the Great Square

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:24.990
of New Julfa called
Mezmaydan, "the Great Maydan".

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:27.430
17th century visitors, as well

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:31.130
as our 19th century
historian Terhov Haneans,

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:35.430
has written that Polos and
his father Petros were highly

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:41.360
regarded for their massive
investment in this great square,

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:45.530
which was really the
commercial heart of the suburb.

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:48.700
And here I quote Terhov
Hanians who writes,

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:53.390
"especially its homes, its
beautifully laid out shops

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:55.970
and its magnificent Church".

00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:01.930
I'd like to pause on the overall
effect of Bethlehem Church,

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:04.450
which is decorated with
European-style murals,

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:07.650
and here Bethlehem is actually
the first church to be decorated

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:10.130
with these Europeanized
murals so, we have to think

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:12.850
of the Velijanean
family as really ushering

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:18.420
in this new mode referred to
as "ferein ushazi" in Isfahan.

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:21.500
So, one, as we all know at this
point, many of us have worked

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:25.900
on this, the wall paintings
in the church are based

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:29.780
on prints -- will
ultimately derive from prints,

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:32.960
"Evangelicae Historiae
Magnus", and this was printed

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.520
in the late 16th
century and Antwerp

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:38.250
and it had many different
iterations throughout the

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:39.870
17th century.

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:42.450
But we really have to
see, we've been focusing

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:44.070
on these wall paintings,

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:49.230
but we have to see the
entire structure in concert.

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:54.030
So, we have to look at the
portrait, the paintings,

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:56.860
the gilded stucco
and the cobble tiles

00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:00.370
with yellow inscriptions just
really pronouncing the name

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:03.330
of Petros, Polos
and their family.

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:05.920
And we have to imagine
this building covered

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:10.740
in beautiful silk carpets,
embroidered with metallic thread

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:15.120
and with Pope's -- with
Popes, sorry about that,

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.870
that was a bad mistake.

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:20.280
But [laughter] with
priests processing

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:23.560
in such glorious copes
as the one you see here,

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.800
which actually the members

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:29.870
of Victorian Albert Museum have
found an Armenian inscription

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:32.650
in this cloak.

00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:34.240
Adjacent to this church --

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:36.520
so, we have to think
of entering this church

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.120
as a sensory experience,

00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:42.820
and when the visitor leaves
the church, there is a plethora

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:45.740
of shops that are
also associated

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:49.950
with Polos and his family.

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:54.440
The French traveler Jean
Baptiste Tavernier writes,

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:58.300
"the beautiful square in which
the market is held is entirely

00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:01.720
surrounded by shops,
it's another of the works

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:06.950
for which the public is beholden
to Petros, Polos' father,

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:11.700
and which render his memory
famous among the Armenians".

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:15.900
The will also continue to
list all the other shops,

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:20.930
not just in New Julfa but
in other suburbs of Isfahan.

00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:28.900
Well, the request
statement does not say.

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:31.160
We may assume that the
various shops owned

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:36.530
by Polos sold both
local and foreign goods.

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:39.470
Although the Safavid Court
unilaterally commissioned

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:42.390
European merchants to obtain
foreign items for them,

00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:45.480
it was the Armenians who
really had the lion's share

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.840
of the market as
importers of European

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:50.840
and Russian luxury wares.

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.330
Importation of foreign goods

00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:55.600
by Armenian merchants is
really well documented,

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:57.750
and we see reference to this

00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:01.300
in these two oil
paintings in front of us.

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:05.690
Venetian glass, Italian
red velvet,

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:09.840
enamelware, European clocks.

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:14.720
Reading through the latter part
of the will, one is astounded

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:18.430
by the sheer number of
properties owned by Polos.

00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:21.640
The document lists houses in
New Julfa and, as I mentioned,

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:24.390
other suburbs of Isfahan.

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:30.020
They were built close to the
church and close to the shops,

00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:31.320
but we also have to think

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:34.300
about all these houses
being built next

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:37.820
to other important patrons of
New Julfa, such as the family

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:41.310
of Tsar Fras and the
family of Abbatik.

00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:45.220
Abbatik -- the reference to
Abbatik may be the individual

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:50.980
who was part of the commission
of the cathedral, Amana Parkich.

00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:54.440
Clearly ownership of property
was a good investment.

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:57.040
Traditionally land
ownership in the Middle East

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:59.930
in Europe was the
basis of wealth.

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:03.220
Houses were assets that
could be used or bequeathed

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:06.020
by family members
and there is evidence

00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:10.150
that the domestic properties
were even rented out.

00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:12.130
Aside from the economic
benefits, however,

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:14.570
I'd like to point out
the sociological aspect

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:16.910
to the amassment of properties.

00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:18.980
And for comparison we
could look to the Jews

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:21.990
of the Ottoman Empire.

00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:25.770
New Julfa, merchants who were
also "outsiders", quote-unquote,

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:27.980
as a relocated Dimmi community,

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:31.570
desire to show their communal
investment and their ties,

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:35.610
their location to their
built environment.

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:39.270
Within these spaces, these
public and private spaces,

00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:43.800
affluent Armenian families like
the Velijaneans, received --

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:47.190
they welcomed into their
house Armenian, European,

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:50.930
Russian merchants, as well as
members of foreign embassies,

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:53.800
including ambassadors.

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:57.840
This is especially true
of the public areas

00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:03.160
of palatial estates, and 17th
century sources are replete

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:08.100
with references to visits on
behalf of the Safavids Court.

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:11.620
We know through the good
work of Cara Pettean

00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:15.670
that the Velijaneans
owned a house, a mansion,

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:18.220
that in one room was decorated
with the eight wonders

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:21.090
of the world so, that's
an additional one.

00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:25.380
And much work needs to be done
on interpreting why they felt

00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:28.220
that these eight
wonders were important.

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:33.060
They probably derived from
Hemskirk, a printed source.

00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:35.780
And also we could
assume that in the houses

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:40.270
of the Velijaneans they
had life-size oil paintings

00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:42.480
such as the ones were
seeing before us.

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:45.670
A number of these survived
and they're seen in situ

00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:48.440
and the few mansions
of the Armenians

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:51.720
that survived in
New Julfa today.

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:54.130
What are we looking at?

00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:56.360
So, here we're looking
at single figures

00:49:56.360 --> 00:50:00.040
in these fantastic
European-style interiors.

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:05.740
The columns are decorated
with Pucci, the ballast rod

00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:10.210
and the claw leg-type table
are all service backdrops

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:13.980
and basically they're riffing
off of royal portraiture

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:17.360
that is being circulated
throughout Iran,

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:20.540
and here we see Louis
XIII and Anne of Austria.

00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:24.510
And on the right hand side --

00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:28.290
no, yes, on your left
hand side we see an urn

00:50:28.290 --> 00:50:31.390
that is probably drawn
from a printed source.

00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:35.270
They're really fantastical,
imagined objects

00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:40.520
that European artists
are circulating in Iran.

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:43.730
And what -- these
are not individuals

00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:45.030
that are being depicted --

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:48.540
they are types, and they're what
type they are is communicated

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:54.900
by the details of
dress and head wear.

00:50:54.900 --> 00:51:00.440
And Cornelius Debruyne documents
one of the elite Armenian women,

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:03.440
and just look closely -- and
I don't need to describe it

00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:07.040
for you, but if you look
at her specific head wear

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:12.900
and gold coins hanging down
from it, it was created

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:15.080
to make a great impression.

00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:20.580
So, the luxury goods depicted,

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:22.830
they speak to both
the realities,

00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:27.830
as well as the aspirations of
Armenian mercantile elites.

00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:30.280
The wine tape -- the wine
decanter on the table

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:33.390
on the long stem glass,
they've been identified

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:37.020
as venetian manufacture and
the stopper of the decanter

00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:40.510
in the form of the three
eagle head is believed

00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:43.090
to be a Russian design.

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:47.660
And I already mentioned her
coat, red velvet, is a reference

00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:51.960
to Italian manufacturer
and we also find references

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:57.740
to Italian red velvet in
Persian sources of the period.

00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:03.250
So, let's just recall the
list in Polos' request.

00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:07.180
The silverware, the china, the
carpets, the enamels and more.

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:08.480
Polos like other members

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:11.530
of the Safavid elite amassed
a significant collection

00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:13.470
of luxury items.

00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:16.560
The desire to assemble
diverse objects

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:20.710
in this massive quantity, which
is enumerated in this will,

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:24.210
was shared by the Safavid Court
and by other Armenian families.

00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:27.600
And these individuals
were all mutually invested

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:31.320
in imparting this image
of really unlimited wealth

00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:36.310
and opulence, in a
17th century context.

00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:38.380
The emphasis is usually
on foreign goods,

00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:42.380
and there was an
investment, actually,

00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:44.620
to maintain the foreign
nature of goods

00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:47.950
by not making certain
things like enamels locally,

00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:51.310
but importing them
abroad, from abroad.

00:52:51.310 --> 00:52:54.830
And that ability to own
foreign items became a privilege

00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:57.290
of the court and the Armenians.

00:52:57.290 --> 00:53:00.580
It became a sign of class
and social differentiation.

00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:07.710
I believe that the amassment
of luxury wares and domiciles

00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:10.270
on behalf of the Armenians
like Polos was driven

00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:14.550
by this common impulse, a desire
to maintain a privileged social

00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:18.630
and economic standing
in the Safavid Empire.

00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:22.080
Objects and architecture worked
in concert as an expression

00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:24.140
of lifestyle, taste
and the knowledge

00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:27.970
of worlds well beyond
Safavid, Iran.

00:53:27.970 --> 00:53:31.160
According to Dimmi Law, New
Julfa's Armenians were to be

00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:33.600
of lower social standing
and political stratum

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.640
than their Muslim peers.

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:39.470
Their ready access of cash,
however, allowed these merchants

00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:42.370
to build and buy beautiful
homes and wonderful things

00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:44.500
to decorate them with.

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:48.020
This conspicuous consumption
signaled membership and thus off

00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:51.200
of it upper class,
including an association

00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:53.670
with the Persian court.

00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:57.240
Polos' is request -- the
quest gives an immediate

00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:01.580
and firsthand description
of the numerous houses

00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:06.400
and the luxury items that
were used to furnish them.

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:10.260
There must be more documents
like this and I'm looking

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:16.100
to my colleagues in the field to
work on them and to publish them

00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:19.260
because only then will we
actually know the enormous

00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:22.910
wealth that these
Armenians of New Julfa had,

00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:26.610
and we need to analyze exactly
what objects are coming in

00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:30.590
and how foreign and local
goods are working together

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:33.920
in the houses of New
Julfa, which still remain

00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.440
to be documented in full.

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:37.510
I thank you for your attention

00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:44.270
[ Applause ]

00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:48.490
&gt;&gt; All right, thanks
Jamie Landau.

00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:52.660
This, both Dr. Evans and Dr.
Landau's paper reminds me

00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:57.940
of another point that needs to
be made, which is the influence

00:54:57.940 --> 00:55:01.400
of Armenia on its neighbors and
the influence of the neighbors

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:05.600
on Armenia, both of those papers
give wonderful examples of that.

00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:09.760
And also the fact that
everyone you are listening

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:15.660
to today is an active
researcher in archives and user

00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:18.090
of digital collections,
and that's another point

00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:20.290
to be made by their papers.

00:55:20.290 --> 00:55:26.450
And that also brings me to a
dear friend, a colleague of mine

00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:31.350
at Columbia studied under
Nina Garzion, who will speak

00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:34.660
on some beloved manuscripts
of ours here in the Library

00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:36.020
of Congress and elsewhere.

00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:39.680
I speak of Sylvie
Merion, who is at --

00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:43.640
and I have got to get
this absolutely correct,

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:51.050
is at the Pierpont
Morgan Museum and --

00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:53.240
&gt;&gt; Morgan Library and Museum.

00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:54.540
&gt;&gt; Library and Museum.

00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:58.360
And is an expert on all
things related to Book Arts,

00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:00.730
manuscript arts and
illuminations,

00:56:00.730 --> 00:56:04.480
and today she will speak to
us on the eclectic nature

00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:09.510
of late Armenian manuscripts
from Constantinople, Dr. Merion.

00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:14.740
[ Applause ]

00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:18.020
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, LaVon,
for that nice introduction

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:20.750
and for inviting me, and also

00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:24.390
for all the wonderful things
you've done in the decades now.

00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:25.910
OK, can everybody hear me?

00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:27.210
All right.

00:56:27.210 --> 00:56:32.380
OK, I just want to see
how does this work, OK.

00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:37.020
OK so, Armenians have a long
history in Constantinople.

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:40.010
Their presence in the city
has been attested to since

00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:42.760
at least the 4th,
5th century AD.

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:45.630
Ongoing political upheavals
in Anatolia over many,

00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:50.010
many centuries generated
increasing Armenian emigration

00:56:50.010 --> 00:56:53.480
across Byzantine lands
into the capital Byzantium,

00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:55.760
later called Constantinople
and its temple.

00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:58.700
After the collapse of
the Byzantine Empire

00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:01.620
with the Ottomans gaining
control of the capital city

00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:06.860
in 1453, Armenian emigration
to Constantinople continued.

00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:09.830
So, I'm not going to go
over this map too much

00:57:09.830 --> 00:57:11.780
because we've already seen one,

00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:14.130
but I have circled areas
I'm going to talk about.

00:57:14.130 --> 00:57:15.690
But one thing I do
want to mention is

00:57:15.690 --> 00:57:17.580
that in Armenian Kalla funds,

00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:21.860
which I will explain a
little more in a second,

00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:24.320
they refer to Constantinople

00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:27.580
by many different names,
including Byzantium.

00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:30.740
So, in 17th century manuscripts
they're still calling the city

00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:32.040
"Byzantium" sometimes.

00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:34.120
So, we have Byzantium,
Constantinople,

00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:39.020
Istanbul or Bolis or Stambul.

00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:43.300
And the circled areas are places
I'm going to be talking about.

00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:45.110
The earliest Armenian Church

00:57:45.110 --> 00:57:49.580
in Constantinople is St.
Sarkis, known since 1360.

00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:53.430
By the 17th century, a large
Armenian community was present

00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:56.990
in Constantinople with many
churches to serve them.

00:57:56.990 --> 00:58:00.160
Manuscript Calafunds indicate
that numerous scriptoria

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:03.160
in the capital were still
producing high quality,

00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:06.660
luxury manuscripts, both
on paper and on parchment,

00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:09.210
which is animal skin
at this time,

00:58:09.210 --> 00:58:10.940
and I want to explain
what a colophon is,

00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:12.540
it's an inscription written

00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:14.800
by the scribe who's
copied the manuscript,

00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:18.730
usually put at the end of the
manuscript saying, "I did this,

00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:21.230
please pray for me, the
miserable scribe Hagop,

00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:26.250
I need your prayers, even
though I don't deserve anything"

00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:31.700
and he will tell you where he
made the manuscript, the date

00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:34.730
and give you a lot of
historical information and a lot

00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:36.870
of information about
his family and anyone

00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:38.910
who worked on this manuscript.

00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:44.460
So, they're very important
for historical research also.

00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:47.780
And so, I will be mentioning
the word "colophon" a lot.

00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:51.160
All right so, three
churches or manuscripts

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:53.140
with scriptoria are
frequently named

00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:55.590
as being the places the
manuscripts were produced.

00:58:55.590 --> 00:58:58.930
Saint Nicholas, St. Sarkis
the general and St. Gevorg

00:58:58.930 --> 00:59:03.070
or St. George, also called
"Sulumanastij" in Turkish,

00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:06.300
and sometimes the
Armenians also use the word

00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:09.380
"Suleimanasteed"
in the colophon.

00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:11.650
The production of
manuscripts in the 17th

00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:15.570
and 18th centuries was not
unique to Armenians, however.

00:59:15.570 --> 00:59:18.410
In Christian, Muslim and Jewish
traditions throughout the Near

00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:22.020
East, manuscripts
continued being created

00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:24.730
until the 18th and
19th centuries.

00:59:24.730 --> 00:59:27.400
By Western standards,
this is very strange

00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:29.430
and surprisingly late.

00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:33.910
I should also mention that in
Western manuscripts you usually

00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:35.210
don't have a colophon.

00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:38.280
If you have it, you will have
something to the effect of,

00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:41.880
"this was copied
by Joe", that's it.

00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:44.520
We have pages and pages
and pages of information

00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:47.630
through colophons in the
Armenian tradition, OK.

00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:51.250
So, Armenian scribes,
artists and bookbinders

00:59:51.250 --> 00:59:54.870
at this time continued making
manuscripts at this late date,

00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:58.120
using traditional methods
and skills, passed on to them

00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:01.210
by their masters, using
parchment at times,

01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:04.590
copying the manuscripts by hand
and painting the eliminations,

01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:08.000
and binding the books using
long-established techniques.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.040
They were, however, receptive
to new ideas, techniques

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.700
and iconography brought
to them through contact

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:16.000
with neighboring peoples

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.110
or European traditions,
as we shall see.

01:00:20.110 --> 01:00:21.470
Now, why were these cultures

01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:23.780
in the Near East still
producing manuscripts

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:26.120
in the 17th and 18th centuries?

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:29.580
By this time in Europe, printed
books had long overtaken the

01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:33.850
production of manuscripts, but
this Western European technology

01:00:33.850 --> 01:00:37.220
of printing, which
began around 1455

01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:39.590
with Gutenberg's
printing press in Europe,

01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:41.890
was not readily available
in the near East.

01:00:41.890 --> 01:00:45.670
It would take time to import
the technology, equipment

01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:49.620
and expertise needed, and even
longer for it to become accepted

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:53.770
and widespread due to
technological issues, funding

01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:57.660
and censure, for example,
by Ottoman authorities.

01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:01.120
Indeed the first printed books
in Armenian, Greek, Hebrew,

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.360
and Arabic were all
produced in Europe.

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:07.480
The first printed book in the
Armenian language was printed

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:13.090
in Venice, Italy around 1511 or
1512, a modest book of prayers

01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:17.900
and spells, particularly useful
to travelers and merchants,

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:20.730
and you see a copy
of this book here.

01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:24.250
An Armenian printing press was
established in Constantinople

01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:29.680
as early as 1567, but it only
functioned for two years.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:34.820
Armenian presses would not be
reestablished there until 1677,

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:38.830
and that press only produced
two books and lasted one year.

01:01:38.830 --> 01:01:41.800
Ottoman authorities would not
officially permit printing

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.840
in the Empire until 1727.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:47.440
However, Armenian
books were printed

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:50.750
in Europe throughout the
17th centuries in cities

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:55.890
such as Amsterdam, Marseilles,
Livorno and Louvre of Poland,

01:01:55.890 --> 01:01:58.930
which were -- and these books
were exported to the Near East,

01:01:58.930 --> 01:02:00.610
but clearly not in the quantity

01:02:00.610 --> 01:02:02.290
which met the needs
of the community.

01:02:02.290 --> 01:02:05.370
It is therefore not surprising

01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:09.390
that scriptoria were still
busily producing superb medieval

01:02:09.390 --> 01:02:13.960
style manuscripts well into
the 17th and 18th centuries.

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:17.210
Consequently, for centuries,
Armenian printed books

01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:20.600
and Armenian manuscripts
were produced simultaneously

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.770
and influenced each other.

01:02:22.770 --> 01:02:27.420
By this -- next slide,
there we go.

01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:30.420
By the 17th century,
Armenian manuscripts

01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:34.040
in Constantinople enjoyed
an undeniable renown

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:36.340
and luxury manuscripts
were commissioned

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:40.310
from Constantinopolitan
scriptoria from distant regions.

01:02:40.310 --> 01:02:43.070
This unusual luxury
manuscript Bible

01:02:43.070 --> 01:02:46.390
on parchment was
commissioned in 1607

01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:49.450
by the wealthy Armenian
merchants Hojin Nazar,

01:02:49.450 --> 01:02:54.300
who New Julfa, Iran, an affluent
Armenian suburb of Isfahan,

01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:56.450
the capital of the
Iranian Safavid empire.

01:02:56.450 --> 01:03:01.920
It was completed in
Constantinople in 1623

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:06.310
and delivered to
Hojin Nazar in 1629.

01:03:06.310 --> 01:03:08.180
Note that the complete Bible

01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:11.920
in the Armenian language would
not exist in printed form

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:16.490
until it was printed
in Amsterdam in 1666.

01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:19.570
So, before 1666 if
you wanted a Bible

01:03:19.570 --> 01:03:23.670
in the Armenian language you
had to have it copied by hand.

01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:27.550
This Bible with Genesis
scenes in roundels --

01:03:27.550 --> 01:03:31.580
it doesn't work on
the thing -- OK.

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:34.760
On this side you see
the round circles.

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:38.460
It had -- these are Genesis
scenes along with the story

01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:41.520
of Adam and Eve in the
three registers below,

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:44.750
uses iconography borrowed
from Europe and found

01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:48.090
in manuscripts -- European
manuscripts from the mid-9th

01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:50.290
to the 15th centuries.

01:03:50.290 --> 01:03:53.900
It is highly unlikely -- and I
would say probably impossible,

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:55.560
however, that Armenians

01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:00.520
in Constantinople had any direct
access to such manuscripts,

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:04.090
and we have not yet determined
the exact sources they used.

01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:06.300
In any case, this type

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:10.410
of Genesis frontispiece became
a popular model for a group

01:04:10.410 --> 01:04:13.080
of 17th century Armenian Bibles.

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:16.340
They exist in at least ten
Armenian manuscripts made

01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:20.090
in Constantinople and
later in New Julfa.

01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:25.340
This sumptuous example of
a parchment Synnex Aryan,

01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:29.260
which is a book of saints lives,
was specially commissioned

01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:32.630
from Constantinople
by Vartavet Sarkis,

01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:34.740
the head of the Armenian
Monastery

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:37.840
of St. Macarius and
Nicosia Cyprus.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:41.630
Perhaps there was no scriptorium
in Nicosia with scribes

01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:45.460
or artists capable of producing
such a lavish manuscript,

01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:50.270
or perhaps there was no exemplar
from which to copy in Nicosia.

01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:54.190
We should note, again, that the
Armenian Synnex Aryan did not

01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:57.760
exist in a printed
version until 1706.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:01.240
So, if you needed one for
your church, monastery

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:05.590
or private use before 1706,
there was no other solution

01:05:05.590 --> 01:05:11.440
than to have one
copied by scribe.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:12.740
Armenian artists

01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:15.040
and Constantinopolitan
scriptoria worked

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:17.130
in two distinguishable styles.

01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:20.140
Both approaches look back
at their solution for bears,

01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:22.820
especially for decorative
elements.

01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:26.160
One employed a more classical
style, constituting a kind

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:29.860
of Silesian, revival
mixed with elements drawn

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:33.150
from Western European
and Byzantine art.

01:05:33.150 --> 01:05:36.590
This manuscript, a
gospel dated 1643,

01:05:36.590 --> 01:05:39.530
exemplifies this more
classical style in the portrait

01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:42.530
of the Evangelist
Matthew on the left.

01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:46.150
On the right is the first
page of Matthew's Gospel,

01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:50.030
and we note that his symbol,
an angel, has been twisted

01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:51.980
to form the first
letter of the text.

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:56.510
So, that angel there is actually
the letter Kim in Armenian.

01:05:56.510 --> 01:06:00.760
The symbols of the evangelists
twisted into letters --

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:04.550
the angel, lion, ox
or eagle has been used

01:06:04.550 --> 01:06:08.040
since the Silesian period
in Armenian iconography.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:10.940
The intricate decoration
of the headpiece as well

01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:12.660
as the marginal design
on the right,

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:16.010
are typical of traditional
manuscript illumination.

01:06:16.010 --> 01:06:19.080
The headpiece is the archway
the on the right-hand page,

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:22.510
and of course you see that
very beautiful fancy decorative

01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:25.430
marginal design.

01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:27.830
Another traditional
characteristic

01:06:27.830 --> 01:06:30.320
of Armenian illuminated
gospel books was

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:34.580
to include sumptuously decorated
Canon tables, which are kind

01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:37.070
of indexed to the four Gospels.

01:06:37.070 --> 01:06:41.820
The example on the left is from
a mid-17th century gospel book

01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:45.410
from Constantinople at the
Morgan, and it's compared

01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:49.490
with one from the 12th
century, on the right.

01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:53.140
The importance of Canon tables
is emphasized by the fact

01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:56.880
that at least three Armenian
medieval commentaries were

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:59.080
written to explain the symbolism

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:02.760
of these usually
lavishly decorated pages.

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:05.820
The most famous of these
commentaries was written

01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:09.790
by the 12th century
Catholicos St. Nersesh Norhali.

01:07:09.790 --> 01:07:12.750
Catholicos, for those who may
not know, is the supreme head

01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:14.280
of the Armenian church

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:17.900
and Nersesh Norhali
was also a theologian,

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:19.690
poet and composer of hymns.

01:07:19.690 --> 01:07:22.930
In his treatise he
discussed the importance

01:07:22.930 --> 01:07:27.270
of lavish cannon tables, as
a visual aid to meditation,

01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:30.070
calling them "baths
of sight and hearing

01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:33.730
for those approaching the
soaring peaks of God".

01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:37.510
17th century Armenian
artists from many regions --

01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:39.020
not just Constantinople,

01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:42.290
continued to illustrate cannon
tables in a similar manner

01:07:42.290 --> 01:07:43.610
as an homage to their
ancestral traditions.

01:07:43.610 --> 01:07:45.200
This is an example
of the second style

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.670
of manuscript illumination
used in Constantinople,

01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:48.260
which developed in the second
half of the 17th century.

01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:49.760
This style was characterized
by figures outlined in strong,

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:51.060
black lines with
prominent noses and the use

01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:52.430
of mostly flat planes of
color, sometimes abstracted

01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:53.730
as we see here on the left.

01:07:53.730 --> 01:07:55.030
And I particularly like
the water shown here.

01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:56.330
It's very, very abstract

01:07:56.330 --> 01:07:57.630
and actually very
modern, to my eyes.

01:07:57.630 --> 01:07:58.930
The unnamed artists of
this manuscript, however,

01:07:58.930 --> 01:08:00.230
still looks back to Armenian
traditions for the decoration

01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:01.530
of the headpiece and the
intricate marginal designs.

01:08:01.530 --> 01:08:02.830
You see the marginal designs

01:08:02.830 --> 01:08:04.630
on both images and,
again, the headpiece.

01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:07.170
[ Applause ]

01:08:07.170 --> 01:08:15.520
These three manuscripts
exemplify this later style

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:26.740
of Constantinopolitan
manuscripts, as demonstrated

01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:33.590
in the works of the
artists Markos Badgerahan,

01:08:36.250 --> 01:08:41.080
which means "portrait painter",
which is a very unusual epithet

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:44.210
for an artist to use,
and his son Gabriel.

01:08:44.210 --> 01:08:53.440
Manuscripts by Markos
date from 1651 to 1694.

01:08:53.440 --> 01:09:00.360
Gabriel was certainly
trained by his father.

01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:08.450
An early Salter by Markos
is on the left dated 1659.

01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:11.750
Father and son sometimes
worked together,

01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:15.980
as in the Alexander romance
in the center, done in 1694

01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:17.590
when Markos was elderly.

01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:21.460
It was copied by Gabriel,
who also informs us

01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:24.800
through the Colophon that
he painted the pictures,

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:27.710
but that his father
decorated it.

01:09:27.710 --> 01:09:31.830
By this he probably means that
Markos had a more minor role

01:09:31.830 --> 01:09:34.360
in illustrating this manuscript.

01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:38.400
The manuscript on the right is
illustrated by Gabriel alone,

01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:42.200
who now informs us that
his father has died.

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:46.290
The stylistic connections
between the two men are obvious.

01:09:46.290 --> 01:09:48.880
We can see the small
black dots for eyes,

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:52.910
strong black lines outlining the
nose, eyebrows and the figures,

01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:55.430
and two lines to
indicate the mouth.

01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:58.830
Gabriel, however, has taken
these features even further

01:09:58.830 --> 01:10:01.860
in his handling of bold lines.

01:10:07.050 --> 01:10:11.800
This manuscript, a complete
Bible, was produced in 1647

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:14.290
in Constantinople,
in a scriptorium

01:10:14.290 --> 01:10:17.550
under the jurisdiction
of St. Nicholas Church.

01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:19.880
This manuscript was
copied on parchment,

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:21.750
made from animal skin.

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:24.500
Done in what we're calling
"the classical style" with --

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:26.680
however with a lot
of unusual features.

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:30.440
This is the beginning of the
Psalms, with the repentant David

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:32.680
on the left traditionally
believed

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:35.030
to be the author of the Psalms.

01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:40.900
David kneels while looking
up at a chastising angel,

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:44.830
who holds a skull, three
switches and a sword.

01:10:44.830 --> 01:10:46.460
These represent the punishments

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:48.450
that God has demanded
David choose

01:10:48.450 --> 01:10:50.850
in retribution for his sins.

01:10:50.850 --> 01:10:54.350
Famine, war or plague.

01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:57.350
The skull represents the
ultimate outcome of any

01:10:57.350 --> 01:11:00.070
of these punishments, death.

01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:04.380
This iconography is not
Armenian, it has been borrowed

01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:06.420
from Western Europe
through the vehicle

01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:11.090
of an imported illustrated
printed book not yet identified.

01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:15.050
The facing, intricate page
includes a traditional Armenian

01:11:15.050 --> 01:11:17.960
back headpiece and
marginal decoration,

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:21.130
with traditional Armenian
decorative bird letters.

01:11:21.130 --> 01:11:24.830
So, the first letter of text
there is actually letters

01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:27.470
forming words made
of twisted birds,

01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:29.960
sometimes they also
like to use fish.

01:11:33.170 --> 01:11:36.470
However, the vase of
flowers under the arch

01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:39.960
of the headpiece is
something quite different.

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:45.510
The artist of this
manuscript seems

01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:49.030
to have been enamored
with flowers.

01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:51.790
Here is another example
of a vase of flowers

01:11:51.790 --> 01:11:54.400
under a traditional
headpiece and there are many,

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:57.250
many others in this manuscript,
I could do a whole lecture just

01:11:57.250 --> 01:12:00.750
on this manuscript, but I can't.

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:02.280
We're not allowed.

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:07.740
Not only are they -- the
flowers used in headpieces

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:11.330
as we just saw, but they are
also scattered throughout this

01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:15.290
Bible as a framing device for
the portrait busts of authors

01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:18.600
of various books of the
Bible, and there are dozens

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:22.390
of similar floral portraits
throughout this manuscript.

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.870
Another unusual characteristic

01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:31.240
of this Bible concerns
the decoration

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.180
of the book of Revelation.

01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:36.430
Before the 17th century,
Armenian manuscripts

01:12:36.430 --> 01:12:40.180
of the complete Bible -- which
were not very common anyway,

01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:43.500
they did not illustrate the
apocalypse with anything more

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:46.720
than perhaps an author
portrait of John.

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:49.980
After the 17th century,
through exposure

01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:53.840
to imported European printed
and illustrated books,

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:56.420
they began illustrating
the book of Revelation

01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:59.760
by copying European
woodcuts and engravings,

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.630
as there really was
no Armenian tradition

01:13:01.630 --> 01:13:02.930
of illustrating Revelation.

01:13:02.930 --> 01:13:05.580
In a few cases we have been able

01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:09.160
to identify the exact
printed source.

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:12.280
In this case I have found
the type of engraving used

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:16.070
as a model, ultimately
derive from Dirar.

01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:19.680
This etching and the Armenian
elimination depict a literal

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:23.680
illustration of Revelation
chapter ten, verses one to 11,

01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:25.920
and I'll read it
first two lines.

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:29.800
"And I saw another mighty
angel coming down from heaven,

01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:33.200
wrapped in a cloud, with
a rainbow over his head.

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:38.870
His face was like the sun and
his legs like pillars of fire.

01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:43.540
He held a little scroll, open in
his hand, setting his right foot

01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:45.830
on the sea and his
left on the land,

01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:49.120
he gave a great shout
like a lion roaring".

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:52.510
And in this case the left
and right legs were reversed

01:13:52.510 --> 01:13:55.330
in both the engraving and
the Armenian illumination

01:13:55.330 --> 01:13:57.110
shown here.

01:13:57.110 --> 01:14:01.730
Oops. I'm getting
ahead of myself.

01:14:01.730 --> 01:14:03.150
Exposure to all types

01:14:03.150 --> 01:14:05.810
of European printed books
had a great influence

01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:08.890
on Near Eastern artists
of the 17th century.

01:14:08.890 --> 01:14:12.700
Not only European religious
books, but also books

01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:15.550
like printed herbals, which
would have been replete

01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:17.970
with plant and floral images.

01:14:17.970 --> 01:14:21.340
And not just Armenian
artists, as we shall soon see.

01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:25.310
In the 18th century
when Christians, Muslims

01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:28.340
and Jews were still making
manuscripts, things start

01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:30.820
to change even more drastically.

01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:33.610
This exposure to new motifs
would have a strong effect

01:14:33.610 --> 01:14:37.380
on book decoration, as well as
other art forms, and would bring

01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:41.820
about important changes in taste
and style in the Ottoman Empire,

01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:45.740
as well as elsewhere in the
Near East including Iran.

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:49.180
Now, before I get to
18th-century manuscripts,

01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:51.740
I want to just first
show you the bindings

01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:53.740
of a couple Armenian
manuscripts and.

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:57.150
yes, these are two
Armenian manuscripts.

01:14:57.150 --> 01:14:59.720
The binding on the left
is typically Armenian

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:01.980
in both decoration
and technique,

01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:03.320
which were used for centuries.

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:06.600
So, I should just briefly
explain different cultures have

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:08.660
different ways of
making their books

01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:11.120
and have different
techniques of sewing

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:13.260
and making their
manuscripts, OK?

01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:15.390
So, the library -- this, the one

01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:18.840
on the left is a
typical Armenian example.

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:20.520
The Library of Congress example

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:23.510
on the right is an Armenian
Christian manuscript,

01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:26.820
but has been bound in a
typical Islamic binding,

01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:29.910
probably Turkish but
could possibly be Persian.

01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:34.150
It is Islamic in both decoration
and technique of binding.

01:15:34.150 --> 01:15:36.800
Now I'm going to discuss
this very interesting Library

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:39.850
of Congress manuscript
at length now.

01:15:39.850 --> 01:15:43.670
Upon opening the book with the
Islamic binding, we first note

01:15:43.670 --> 01:15:46.150
that it is handwritten
in Armenian,

01:15:46.150 --> 01:15:49.200
and also that the first
page is a title page.

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:52.460
Now, this is unusual because
title pages were common

01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:55.580
in printed books but
not in manuscripts.

01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:58.570
This book is an apocryphal
Christian text,

01:15:58.570 --> 01:16:01.720
the acts of St. John the
Evangelist, and we are provided

01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:05.570
with a date, 1214 in the
Armenian era but written

01:16:05.570 --> 01:16:09.370
with Arabic numerals, instead
of the Armenian alphabet used

01:16:09.370 --> 01:16:11.220
as numerals, which
would have been normal

01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:15.330
and which is how he gives
the date in the Colophon.

01:16:15.330 --> 01:16:23.150
This date, 1214, is equivalent
to 1214 plus 551 AD, 1765.

01:16:23.150 --> 01:16:29.520
The next page depicts a portrait
of St. John the Evangelist,

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.880
but the style is
much more European.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:34.600
Notice the gentle
modeling of the face

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:37.450
and there's a much better
understanding of perspective,

01:16:37.450 --> 01:16:41.470
especially evident in rendering
the checkerboard floor,

01:16:41.470 --> 01:16:46.340
something else not commonly
seen in Armenian manuscripts.

01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:49.430
The facing page of texts
includes bird letters,

01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:54.250
and a decorative headpiece
typical in Armenian manuscripts,

01:16:54.250 --> 01:16:57.140
but there is nothing typical
in its decorative scheme.

01:16:57.140 --> 01:17:00.320
It is filled with
naturalistic flowers instead

01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:03.940
of the usual Armenian
motifs, as we just saw,

01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:07.120
and a traditional marginal
design is placed on the right

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:10.410
but has been transformed
by using flowers.

01:17:10.410 --> 01:17:16.180
As we go through the book, we
note first that it is paginated,

01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:18.080
again, using Arabic numerals,

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:21.070
something not normally
done in a manuscript.

01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:24.020
It's possible that these numbers
could have been added later

01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:27.620
but the paleography appears
very similar to the numerals

01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:30.180
on the title page,
and I'm convinced

01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:33.020
that the scribe wrote
all of them.

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:37.710
They are carefully written on
each page within the gold box.

01:17:37.710 --> 01:17:40.450
More startling is
that the beginning

01:17:40.450 --> 01:17:44.590
of each chapter is embellished
with a naturalistic flower.

01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:46.170
LaVon Abdoyan has informed me

01:17:46.170 --> 01:17:49.250
that he had a botanist
colleague look at these images,

01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:52.260
who confirmed that not all
of them are real plants.

01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:55.140
There's often something
wrong, for example,

01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:57.920
certain flowers supposed to have
six petals and the artist did it

01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:01.190
with eight or something
like that.

01:18:01.190 --> 01:18:03.990
But they certainly were painted

01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:06.290
in an extremely naturalistic
manner.

01:18:06.290 --> 01:18:09.140
In spite of all these
unusual characteristics --

01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:11.830
and there are more, which I
don't have time to get into,

01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:14.220
the manuscript includes
a traditional

01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:17.410
and lengthy Armenian
colophon, from which we learned

01:18:17.410 --> 01:18:22.190
that it was completed in
1765 by the scribe artist,

01:18:22.190 --> 01:18:26.800
notary and flower
painter, Havanes of Becos,

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:29.230
son of Madeiro Simonian.

01:18:29.230 --> 01:18:32.820
Becos is a district
of Constantinople.

01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:34.590
The person who commissioned
and paid

01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:38.180
for this luxurious
manuscript was Bouhaus Amira,

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:44.070
son of Medeiros Jovian, grandson
of Mahtesi Harukun Amira.

01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:47.850
And Amira is an Armenian
honorific title for a group

01:18:47.850 --> 01:18:50.260
of wealthy people
who were leaders

01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:52.790
of the Armenian Ottoman
Millette and favored

01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:54.530
by the Ottoman government.

01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:58.960
The colophon does
not specifically say

01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:01.520
where the manuscript
was produced.

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:06.780
The scribe and artist just
tells us that he is of Becos,

01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:10.760
not specifically that
it was made in Becos.

01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:12.270
Theoretically this could mean

01:19:12.270 --> 01:19:15.260
that the manuscript could
have been produced elsewhere.

01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:20.610
But for reasons I will explain,
I believe that it was produced

01:19:20.610 --> 01:19:25.550
in Constantinople,
perhaps in Becos itself.

01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:29.290
So far, I have found one
other manuscript made

01:19:29.290 --> 01:19:32.520
by the same scribe an
artist Havanes of Bakos.

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:36.500
This 1762 copy of
the book of prayer

01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:39.490
by the beloved 10th-11th
century Armenian mystic

01:19:39.490 --> 01:19:42.490
and saint Gregory of Notic.

01:19:42.490 --> 01:19:47.320
It is extremely similar to the
Library of Congress manuscript.

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:50.260
This is the beginning of
the text, with a portrait

01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:52.560
of the author, St.
Gregory on the left,

01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:55.320
and the highly decorated
headpiece

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:59.140
and marginal decoration on the
facing page composed, again,

01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:26.040
of flowers, as we saw in the
Library of Congress manuscript.

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:28.470
And note again, the
checkerboard floor.

01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:34.400
The person who commissioned
this manuscript, as we're told

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:38.000
in the colophon was
Mahtesi Haruchun,

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.750
son of Mathesi Alexan
Amira, again,

01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:44.230
a wealthy Armenian
from Constantinople.

01:20:44.230 --> 01:20:48.040
This is the other full-page
illumination in this manuscript,

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:52.230
St. Gregory kneeling
before the Virgin and Child,

01:20:52.230 --> 01:20:54.010
who holds a tiny
book in his hands

01:20:54.010 --> 01:20:55.570
which had been symbolically
presented

01:20:55.570 --> 01:20:56.870
to Christ by the author.

01:20:56.870 --> 01:21:01.000
This the front cover of the
knotting manuscript with, again,

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.220
a Turkish style binding.

01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:08.270
And the manuscript also includes
the same type of flowers

01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:11.550
in the margins as we saw
in the previous example,

01:21:11.550 --> 01:21:13.560
and neither this
knotting manuscript

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:15.300
or in the previous
acts of Saint John,

01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:16.650
does the text discuss flowers.

01:21:16.650 --> 01:21:19.700
These flowers are placed here
simply for the visual pleasure

01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:24.330
of the viewer, not because
they are illustrating something

01:21:24.330 --> 01:21:25.880
discussed in the text.

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:29.700
Now Havanes of Becos was
not the only Armenian artist

01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:33.870
in 18th century Constantinople,
who was enamored with flowers.

01:21:33.870 --> 01:21:38.440
There are many examples of
late Armenian manuscripts

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:41.650
with this type of decoration.

01:21:41.650 --> 01:21:45.810
The artist of this 1770 missile

01:21:45.810 --> 01:21:50.140
from Constantinople has
filled the headpiece

01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:51.660
and marginal design
with flowers.

01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:54.210
This secular manuscript,

01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:58.690
a history by the 12th century
author Samuel of Unny was copied

01:21:58.690 --> 01:22:05.910
in Constantinople in 1777
by the scribe Nickohios.

01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:08.730
The artist is not named
but it's very probable

01:22:08.730 --> 01:22:10.090
that the flower painter was
Havanes of Bekos himself,

01:22:10.090 --> 01:22:11.390
as it is extremely
similar to those

01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:12.690
in the two manuscripts
we saw earlier

01:22:12.690 --> 01:22:13.990
that we know he produced,

01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:15.290
and we know for sure this
is from Constantinople.

01:22:15.290 --> 01:22:16.590
The floral decoration
has nothing to do

01:22:16.590 --> 01:22:17.890
with this historical text.

01:22:17.890 --> 01:22:19.190
Again, a decorative motif
used to embellish the text

01:22:19.190 --> 01:22:20.490
for the visual enjoyment
of the reader.

01:22:20.490 --> 01:22:21.790
This example is from a text
called "The city of Troy

01:22:21.790 --> 01:22:23.090
and it's Kings" by
Nicholaios Lucianos,

01:22:23.090 --> 01:22:24.390
copied in Constantinople
in 1779 by the scribe

01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:25.690
and translator Georg Dpir
Yovhannessian Palatetsi.

01:22:25.690 --> 01:22:26.990
The artist is not
named in the colophon.

01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:28.290
Note again the use of
decorative flowers,

01:22:28.290 --> 01:22:29.590
painted in a very Rococo style,

01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:32.050
especially as seen
in the headpiece.

01:22:32.050 --> 01:22:35.720
Traditional Armenian decorative
marginal motifs, still common

01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:38.680
in the mid-12th century,
have now been transformed

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:42.390
to a new floral concept
by the mid-18th century,

01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:46.280
reflecting a general change
in taste in the region.

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:49.590
And not just with
Armenians, this fascination

01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:52.890
with decorative flowers became
quite popular in the upper

01:22:52.890 --> 01:22:55.430
and ruling classes
of the Ottoman Empire

01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:57.890
in the 18th and 19th centuries.

01:22:57.890 --> 01:23:01.290
This was a period of increasing
contact with Europeans,

01:23:01.290 --> 01:23:03.270
as well as with their
material goods,

01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:04.570
which would have an effect

01:23:04.570 --> 01:23:08.220
on the artistic vocabulary
in the capital.

01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:11.730
We now see similar
floral motifs even used

01:23:11.730 --> 01:23:15.720
to embellish Turkish religious
manuscripts, such as this Quran

01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:21.280
of 1798 on the left, and a
pious text from 1848 to '49

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:28.170
on the right, this one with an
even more Rococo style to it.

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:30.370
One of the most famous
examples of the use

01:23:30.370 --> 01:23:34.100
of such ornamentation is
the so called "Fruit room"

01:23:34.100 --> 01:23:37.530
of the Sultan's harem or
private family quarters

01:23:37.530 --> 01:23:41.860
of the Topkapi Palace,
painted in 1705.

01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:44.690
The Sultan at this time
was Ahmed the Third,

01:23:44.690 --> 01:23:47.790
who reigned from 1703 to 1730

01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:50.320
and under whose rule
there was much contact

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.790
with France and French
diplomats.

01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:55.540
The walls and ceiling of
the fruit room are filled

01:23:55.540 --> 01:23:58.780
with Rococo vases of
flowers, bowls of fruit

01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:00.350
and floral sprays throughout.

01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:05.100
On the right is another of --
is an official Ottoman document,

01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:09.180
dated 1862 to 77,
the deed of endowment

01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:11.550
of a later Sultan's
mother, again,

01:24:11.550 --> 01:24:14.730
highly decorated
with floral motifs.

01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:21.230
Because of the late advent
of printing in the Near East,

01:24:21.230 --> 01:24:24.880
Armenian manuscripts were still
being produced in Constantinople

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:28.090
and elsewhere in the
17th and 18th centuries.

01:24:28.090 --> 01:24:32.040
Scribes, artists and
bookbinders continued centuries

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:35.070
of uninterrupted Armenian
book art traditions,

01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:38.250
even after books were
produced on a printing press.

01:24:38.250 --> 01:24:40.180
However, as we have seen,

01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:42.810
they also embraced new
developments derived

01:24:42.810 --> 01:24:45.850
from imported European
printed books,

01:24:45.850 --> 01:24:49.010
of which I only could speak
of a few, but they are --

01:24:49.010 --> 01:24:53.780
and they are also reflected --
they also reflected local taste,

01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:57.210
including new iconography,
increased interest

01:24:57.210 --> 01:25:00.400
in perspective and
new decorative motifs.

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:04.310
The floral motifs, for instance,
were probably first introduced

01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:08.560
through European printed
herbal or botanical books,

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:10.600
but were used in
manuscripts purely

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:12.610
for their decorative qualities.

01:25:12.610 --> 01:25:15.610
In fact, floral mania
became ubiquitous

01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:19.190
in the privileged strata
of the Ottoman Empire,

01:25:19.190 --> 01:25:22.450
and was also used to decorate
late Turkish manuscripts

01:25:22.450 --> 01:25:24.900
and even mural paintings
for the ruling class

01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:27.540
and the wealthy elite
in the Capitol.

01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:28.960
In Armenian 17th

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:32.310
and 18th-century manuscripts
we see continued reverence

01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:35.790
for their native traditions,
combined with an openness

01:25:35.790 --> 01:25:37.300
to borrowing, sharing

01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:40.970
and absorbing cross-cultural
stylistic vocabularies,

01:25:40.970 --> 01:25:44.250
resulting in these fascinating,
eclectic manuscripts.

01:25:44.250 --> 01:25:46.050
Thank you very much.

01:25:46.050 --> 01:25:55.190
[ Applause ]

01:25:55.190 --> 01:26:01.230
&gt;&gt; So, as a transition,
rapid transition

01:26:01.230 --> 01:26:05.220
from the late Middle Ages to the
modern age but still in the art,

01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:10.570
historical and sociological
sphere, is a good friend

01:26:10.570 --> 01:26:13.280
and a person who has
been active in archives,

01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:15.740
searching out some very
interesting material

01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:20.190
on little-known subject and
that is Vazken Khatchig Davidian

01:26:20.190 --> 01:26:23.770
from England, who is
finishing his dissertation

01:26:23.770 --> 01:26:27.110
on this subject, and he will
be speaking on the image

01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:30.550
of the migrant worker,
visualizing the Banduokh,

01:26:30.550 --> 01:26:36.510
from Ottoman Armenia in late
19th century Constantinople.

01:26:36.510 --> 01:26:40.450
[ Applause ]

01:26:40.450 --> 01:26:41.750
&gt;&gt; LaVon, thank you.

01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:44.140
I'm afraid I woke up
this morning and I'd sort

01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:46.200
of lost my voice so,
it's sort of comeback,

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:48.010
I've been drinking
lots of hot water.

01:26:48.010 --> 01:26:49.450
LaVon thank you so much

01:26:49.450 --> 01:26:52.320
for organizing this
amazing gathering,

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:53.970
and having all of us here.

01:26:53.970 --> 01:26:57.420
I thought with the first
three peoples I'd sort of died

01:26:57.420 --> 01:27:01.370
and gone to art historical
heaven, and it's amazing

01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:04.940
from wealth and patronage,
we're sort of moving to porters

01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:06.600
in 19th century Constantinople.

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:08.720
So, there you go.

01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:13.870
I just want to introduce
you to a few words just

01:27:13.870 --> 01:27:15.920
in case you're not
familiar with them.

01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:18.040
The first word is "Bantoukhd",

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:20.930
and I do use the Western
Armenian transliteration,

01:27:20.930 --> 01:27:23.140
I don't apologize for
it because we're dealing

01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:25.670
with late 19th century
Constantinople.

01:27:25.670 --> 01:27:29.010
So, a Bantoukhd is
a migrant worker.

01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:33.550
They're usually male young
men who basically leave family

01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:36.920
and homeland and moved to
Constantinople to work.

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:40.930
So, my paper is really about
the bantoukhd in Constantinople.

01:27:40.930 --> 01:27:44.220
"Bantkdoutioun" is a
phenomenon but it is also --

01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:47.940
it is a really charged word
because there's a sense

01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:49.890
of tragedy about
the whole thing.

01:27:49.890 --> 01:27:52.140
So, someone goes
on bantkdoutioun,

01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:55.290
it's all bad yearning
for home, etcetera.

01:27:55.290 --> 01:28:01.860
So, it has negative connotations
and there's a whole genre

01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:04.660
of bantoukhd songs as well
going back a few centuries.

01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:07.330
A lot of the heart of the
bantoukhds that I'm going

01:28:07.330 --> 01:28:10.060
to be dealing with
today, Hamals,

01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:12.130
and Hamal means "Porter".

01:28:12.130 --> 01:28:13.830
It comes from the
Arabic word "Hamala" I

01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:15.670
which means "to carry".

01:28:15.670 --> 01:28:17.190
The Armenian word
is "pairnagish".

01:28:17.190 --> 01:28:20.950
So, most of the images you
will be seeing today will be

01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:24.550
of porters, and the last word
I want to introduce you to --

01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:27.570
Mercer, you probably know
it, is "Hayasdantsi".

01:28:27.570 --> 01:28:30.620
But hayasdantsi, in the late --

01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:35.350
in its late 19th century
Constantinople serving carnation

01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:39.620
meant an Armenian who
came from Ottoman Armenia,

01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:43.690
and a hayasdantsi
was a native of Van,

01:28:43.690 --> 01:28:46.750
a native of Mush,
of Esroom, etcetera.

01:28:46.750 --> 01:28:50.440
So, we understand -- when
we talk about hayasdan,

01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:53.010
when I speak about Ottoman
Armenia or hayastan,

01:28:53.010 --> 01:28:57.670
I'll be meaning not the
Republic today, it is Armenia

01:28:57.670 --> 01:28:59.780
as it was understood
in those days.

01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:03.930
And "dantsi" is a suffix that
denotes from a particular place.

01:29:03.930 --> 01:29:06.090
So, a native form --
of Mush, for example,

01:29:06.090 --> 01:29:09.420
would be a "Mushetsi",
from Mush and "Tsi".

01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:10.720
So, there you go.

01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:12.020
So, here we go.

01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:15.540
See if this works.

01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:19.890
"Hamals on the bridge at
Karakoy", by the respected

01:29:19.890 --> 01:29:23.730
but now mostly forgotten Ottoman
Armenian artist Simon Hagopian,

01:29:23.730 --> 01:29:28.980
1857-1921 is a rendering
of an everyday scene,

01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:33.200
which sets for men instantly
identifiable as bantoukhds

01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:37.300
and Hamals by trait, mid
conversation while suppressed

01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:39.850
by an especially constructed
timber structure in the middle

01:29:39.850 --> 01:29:43.760
of the Galata bridge, that links
the old city of Constantinople

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.860
to the dynamic commercial
hub of Karakoy

01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:49.650
in the upscale quarter of Para.

01:29:49.650 --> 01:29:52.060
In this contemporary
and familiar scene,

01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:54.830
one that Hagopian would
have passed by daily,

01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:58.540
the artist has situated these
rural transplants into the heart

01:29:58.540 --> 01:30:01.150
of the urban megalopolis,
represented here

01:30:01.150 --> 01:30:04.460
as an ambivalent space,
conjured through a band

01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:05.760
of hazy brushstrokes

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:08.050
that rendered the unmistakable
outline of the Galata tower.

01:30:08.050 --> 01:30:11.660
You can -- you can't really
see it very well, but --

01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:14.940
I can see it here, but it's
just over the head of the

01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:17.190
of the man on his own.

01:30:17.190 --> 01:30:20.790
It's really hazy, and
the general skyline

01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:24.090
of the European part of
the city recognizable.

01:30:24.090 --> 01:30:27.730
Hagopian has utilized narrative
gesture with great care,

01:30:27.730 --> 01:30:30.240
to imbue tension and charge
into the conversation.

01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:34.290
To definitely communicate to the
viewer the unhappy state of mind

01:30:34.290 --> 01:30:35.590
of the central figure.

01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:38.500
At the right of the
image, conveying some form

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:42.740
of displeasure, to his three
fellow Hamals, who are listening

01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:45.940
to the man's words with
great concentration.

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:48.000
With deft use of brushstroke,

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.450
the artist has skillfully
marked the minutest details

01:30:51.450 --> 01:30:54.650
and captured movements, such
as the enquiring gestures

01:30:54.650 --> 01:30:58.850
of the man's hands with
their protruding networks

01:30:58.850 --> 01:31:05.640
of silver veins -- silver blue
wanes, and Callum's open palm.

01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:07.500
Meanwhile, the sweat on his brow

01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:10.950
and red sunburns neck evoke
years of relentless toil

01:31:10.950 --> 01:31:12.730
on the streets of
Constantinople,

01:31:12.730 --> 01:31:14.340
and the hard life
of the bekkiar.

01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:17.050
"Bekkiar" is a Turkish word,
which means "single men".

01:31:17.050 --> 01:31:19.940
A lot of these men were not
single, but they actually lived

01:31:19.940 --> 01:31:23.750
in Constantinople in groups,
having left all their wives

01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:25.850
and families back
in the old country.

01:31:25.850 --> 01:31:29.160
So, bekkiar is a collective term

01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:31.360
that actually denotes
these people.

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:33.300
And they lived in
hans, and a han --

01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:36.300
or a ham is as an inn where
many of these people lived

01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:40.460
in slum-like conditions,
separated from family

01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:42.420
and away from their homelands.

01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:45.960
The dirty rags, riddled with
holes and crudely patched

01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:49.760
in places, all told their
distinct stories of poverty,

01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:52.970
migration and hardship.

01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:55.420
This is a thoroughly
modern image.

01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:56.830
Its modernity explicit

01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:59.370
in the meticulously
rendered ornate ironwork

01:31:59.370 --> 01:32:00.930
of the bridges balustrade,

01:32:00.930 --> 01:32:02.530
signifying the latest
achievements

01:32:02.530 --> 01:32:05.380
of modern British engineering,
and further underlined

01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:09.320
by the consciously photographic
frame employed by the artist.

01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:12.060
Consider the striking
similarity of the frames adopted

01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:14.120
by Hagopian and the
British photographer

01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:18.160
and illustrator Wren Abel's
photographic image carriers

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:19.920
resting, reproduced

01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:22.250
in the London Illustrated
newspaper black and white

01:32:22.250 --> 01:32:25.600
on 2nd of January, 1897.

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:29.090
The published photograph further
confirms the meticulous care

01:32:29.090 --> 01:32:33.060
with which Hagopian has rendered
each detail of the bridge,

01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:37.050
the hamal's rest station and the
timber decking of its pavement.

01:32:37.050 --> 01:32:39.760
Irrespective of this
compositional affinities

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:42.550
of Hagopian's painting,
with a view as observed

01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:44.760
through the frame
of the camera lens,

01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:47.620
we do not know whether the
artist had introduced --

01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:50.040
had reproduced the
scene from a photograph,

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:53.000
a common practice employed by
several of his contemporaries,

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.040
or had sketched it in situ and
then executed in his studio.

01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:59.860
The gritty naturalism of
Hagopian's representation

01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:02.310
of a fleeting moment
on the bridge,

01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:04.640
rather than a mere picturesque
ethnographic depiction

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:08.050
of an exotic group -- one of
the most visible and emblematic

01:33:08.050 --> 01:33:11.390
of the imperial capital of
three types, the hamals,

01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:15.490
in a timeless, oriental setting,
suggests instead a desire

01:33:15.490 --> 01:33:18.100
for an honest artistic
engagement

01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:21.760
by a non-western artist with
his own immediate environment.

01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:26.130
This presentation will focus
on visual representations

01:33:26.130 --> 01:33:27.940
of the figure of the bantoukhd,

01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:31.130
by late 19th century
Constantinople Armenian artists

01:33:31.130 --> 01:33:32.680
by promoting two main ideas.

01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:36.830
Firstly, it will propose that
work such as Hagopian's "Hamals

01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:39.960
on the bridge" that
addressed contemporary themes

01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:43.350
of social concern and were
executed in a Western mode

01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:47.070
of visual art production,
oil on canvas painting,

01:33:47.070 --> 01:33:48.700
needs to be considered
within the milieu

01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:51.400
of a particular Ottoman
Armenian incarnation of realism,

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:54.220
the major preoccupations
of which included the life

01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:56.200
of the bantoukhd
in Constantinople

01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:59.320
and the implications of the
phenomenon or bantkhdouioun

01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:01.620
on -- from Ottoman Armenia.

01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:05.370
Realism was a dominant
intellectual philosophy among

01:34:05.370 --> 01:34:09.530
the city's reformist circles
during the final two decades

01:34:09.530 --> 01:34:12.310
of the 19th century, and
associated most notably

01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:14.510
with a group of journalists,
chroniclers

01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:16.320
and other writer activists,

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:18.880
assembled around the influential
editor Arpier Arpiarian,

01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:21.440
1851 -- 1908.

01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:25.190
And the popular dailies
Arabic orient from 1884

01:34:25.190 --> 01:34:31.490
in Hairenick Fatherland from
1891 to 1896, which he edited.

01:34:31.490 --> 01:34:33.890
Such a position challenges
accepted nations

01:34:33.890 --> 01:34:35.190
in Armenian historiography

01:34:35.190 --> 01:34:38.880
that have hitherto presented the
so-called Constantinople realist

01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:43.390
generation Bostahai Rabash
Sevunts a literary movement,

01:34:43.390 --> 01:34:47.780
the sole domain of novelists,
essays and journalists.

01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:50.120
Secondly, it will propose
that during the period

01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:51.990
under consideration,
characterized

01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:55.080
by the increasingly
stringent censorship controls

01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:57.110
of the Abdul Hameed
the Second regime --

01:34:57.110 --> 01:35:01.880
he reigned between 1876 and
1908-1909, and rising tensions

01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:04.640
between the state and the
empires Armenian population,

01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:07.900
where any articulation of
Armenian identity was perceived

01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:11.840
as a threat, artists often
utilized allegory cloaked

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:14.490
beneath the fashionable
ethnographic sensibilities

01:35:14.490 --> 01:35:18.340
of the day to convey messages,
which were often received

01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:20.900
or projected by some
viewers as such,

01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:24.290
in order to evade the scalpel
of the censor and represent

01:35:24.290 --> 01:35:28.470
on canvas what could not
be published in print.

01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:31.490
The phenomenon of bantkdoutioun
had already emerged

01:35:31.490 --> 01:35:33.680
as a prominent preoccupation

01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:36.120
of Ottoman army intellectuals
during the second half

01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:38.100
of the 19th century.

01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:40.900
For these intellectuals,
Ottoman Armenia

01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:43.170
and bantkdoutioun
represented the two faces

01:35:43.170 --> 01:35:45.320
of the same proverbial coin.

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:47.580
They believed economic
and structural improvement

01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:50.490
in Ottoman Armenia would
stem the flow of migration.

01:35:50.490 --> 01:35:55.350
To Mugarich Cremyan,
1820-1907, it was patriarch

01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:59.950
of Constantinople between 1869
and 1873, and he was catholicos

01:35:59.950 --> 01:36:02.840
after 1893 until his
death in Russian Armenia,

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:06.350
affectionately known as
Heinrich, "little father",

01:36:06.350 --> 01:36:09.030
his disciple the bishop
Kaerkin Servantsidean,

01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:12.400
1840-1892 both natives
of Ottoman Armenia --

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:15.220
they were both born in
Van, and a generation

01:36:15.220 --> 01:36:18.310
of mid-19th century
writers and ethnographers,

01:36:18.310 --> 01:36:23.430
bantkhdoutioun had meant the
tragic abandonment of the land.

01:36:23.430 --> 01:36:25.800
They espouse the economic
development of Ottoman Armenia,

01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:28.160
especially of its
agricultural sector,

01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:31.080
and called for the
establishment of infrastructure,

01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:34.090
the rule of law, security
of life and property

01:36:34.090 --> 01:36:37.040
within the Imperial
Ottoman framework.

01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:39.530
The editor and activist
Megerdich Portulalyan,

01:36:39.530 --> 01:36:44.530
1848 to 1921, considered
bantkhdoutioun as sin.

01:36:44.530 --> 01:36:46.870
The desertion of
homeland and denigration

01:36:46.870 --> 01:36:50.260
of the Armenian name, for him
being a Hama was an insult

01:36:50.260 --> 01:36:52.070
to being Armenian.

01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:53.710
These sentiments
are at the heart

01:36:53.710 --> 01:36:56.410
of the author Mardiros
Khatchmerian's "Life

01:36:56.410 --> 01:36:59.430
of the Armenian bantoukhd",
"Geangye bantachtats",

01:36:59.430 --> 01:37:04.180
published in 1876
in Constantinople.

01:37:04.180 --> 01:37:06.970
Khatchmerian urged all
bantoukhds to return

01:37:06.970 --> 01:37:09.880
to their half and
homes in Armenia,

01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:12.330
"till its soil and
make it blossom".

01:37:12.330 --> 01:37:14.560
Using romantic and
religious allegory,

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:18.510
Hachmeryan divided bantoukhd
into three categories, the good

01:37:18.510 --> 01:37:22.180
or fortunate, "bantoukhd
pachtavor",

01:37:22.180 --> 01:37:24.730
who diligently sent
money to their families

01:37:24.730 --> 01:37:26.860
and ultimately returned home.

01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:30.790
The wretched, "bantoukhd
tejvaj", who were exploited

01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:33.760
and were ultimately
unsuccessful,

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:35.580
and those who disappeared
without care,

01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:38.070
"bantoukhd anhop hiuhaireniats",

01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:39.810
leaving destitute
families behind.

01:37:39.810 --> 01:37:43.500
Unsurprisingly, it is a latter
category that is subjected

01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:47.100
to his greater attention and
for whom his unconcealed aya

01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:48.930
is reserved.

01:37:48.930 --> 01:37:52.880
Meanwhile, the allegorical
image on the cover, the original

01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:56.660
of which was conceived
in the 1840s in Paris

01:37:56.660 --> 01:37:59.880
by the paduan artists and
engraver Michele Fanoli --

01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:03.950
he was born in 1807,
he died in 1876,

01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:06.260
and he was actually a
teacher, he was an art teacher

01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:08.410
at the Muradian School in Paris.

01:38:08.410 --> 01:38:10.660
And he was asked to
come up with his image

01:38:10.660 --> 01:38:16.050
by Ivosovski's brother, the
archbishop Gabriel Ivosovski.

01:38:16.050 --> 01:38:19.830
So, the image depicts the
desolate figure of a woman,

01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:22.890
sitting for long among ruined
classical columns at the foot

01:38:22.890 --> 01:38:26.850
of Mount Ararat, which had
from the mid-19th century --

01:38:26.850 --> 01:38:29.240
this image has from the
mid-19th century onwards,

01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:31.260
become the ubiquitous
personification

01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:33.100
of the words of Armenia.

01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:35.570
Bantkhdouioun abandoned
ruination,

01:38:35.570 --> 01:38:37.880
abandonment ruination.

01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:41.420
While emigrating for work was
certainly not a solely Ottoman

01:38:41.420 --> 01:38:42.740
Armenian phenomenon, I mean,

01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:45.330
other groups migrated
as well for work.

01:38:45.330 --> 01:38:49.520
So, while this was not solely
an Armenian phenomenon,

01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:52.830
the specific perception
of the tragic abandonment

01:38:52.830 --> 01:38:55.120
of the homeland had an
especially powerful,

01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:57.200
emotional resonance among them.

01:38:57.200 --> 01:38:59.570
Similar artistic and
literary sponsors

01:38:59.570 --> 01:39:01.200
to similar phenomena are absent

01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:03.170
from the contemporary
artistic production

01:39:03.170 --> 01:39:04.900
of other neighboring
Ottoman populations,

01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:07.690
such as Kurds, Greeks and Turks.

01:39:07.690 --> 01:39:09.820
So, the period they were
actually looking, at the 1880s

01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:15.990
and the 1890s, if you go through
works by Ottoman Turkish,

01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:18.910
Kurdish, Greek Levantine
artists,

01:39:18.910 --> 01:39:22.960
you will never actually see this
kind of image, just like the one

01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:26.020
that I actually showed
you earlier.

01:39:26.020 --> 01:39:28.030
So, it is pretty unusual,

01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:30.680
and it's pretty unique
among Armenians.

01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:35.540
The two decades following the
Russo-Ottoman war of 1877-1878

01:39:35.540 --> 01:39:39.490
and the Great Famine of Van
and its aftermath in 1880-1881,

01:39:39.490 --> 01:39:41.950
as well as the Treaty of Berlin
and the toothless proposals

01:39:41.950 --> 01:39:45.250
for reform, had experienced
an increase in the outflow

01:39:45.250 --> 01:39:48.680
of migrants, mostly younger
able-bodied provincial males

01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:52.400
from Ottoman Armenia, fueled
by socio-economic, inter-ethnic

01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:53.700
and political tensions,

01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:58.180
facilitated by the increasingly
regular steamship connections

01:39:58.180 --> 01:40:01.170
between Trebizond and
other black sea ports,

01:40:01.170 --> 01:40:02.470
and Constantinople.

01:40:02.470 --> 01:40:05.020
So, before, they actually
walk from the villages

01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:06.510
of Mush all the way
to Constantinople.

01:40:06.510 --> 01:40:08.740
Now they only had to walk to
the Black Sea, catch a boat

01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:10.990
and go to Constantinople.

01:40:10.990 --> 01:40:13.700
The areas of Ottoman
Armenia from where emigration

01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:17.600
to the capital was highest,
was a region without roads

01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:19.080
and -- roads or railways.

01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:21.000
It lacked infrastructure,

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.890
where subsistence farming was a
major form of economic activity.

01:40:24.890 --> 01:40:27.520
The region was characterized
by economic stagnation,

01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:30.470
physical insecurity,
social disorder

01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:33.110
and the absence of
the rule of law.

01:40:33.110 --> 01:40:36.450
By 1890, the editorial, a
practical suggestion called

01:40:36.450 --> 01:40:41.030
"Zagan ara Charkma" published on
the 5th of May, 1890 in Arabelc,

01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:44.190
claim that it is an accepted
truth, and in comparison

01:40:44.190 --> 01:40:46.250
with the other peoples
of the Empire,

01:40:46.250 --> 01:40:47.900
Armenians have the
largest number

01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:50.670
of bantoukhds in Constantinople.

01:40:50.670 --> 01:40:55.370
While estimated at 15,000 in the
1860s, the numbers were believed

01:40:55.370 --> 01:40:59.220
to have exceeded 80,000 before
the 1894-1897 massacres.

01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:01.830
Now, in a city of 1 million
that's a pretty extraordinary

01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:04.710
number, it's a huge chunk
of the Armenian population.

01:41:04.710 --> 01:41:07.940
But, of course, I'm
not arguing that all

01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:09.980
of these people were actually
Hamals, is basically people

01:41:09.980 --> 01:41:15.380
who had actually migrated from
Ottoman Anatolia and elsewhere

01:41:15.380 --> 01:41:17.050
to Constantinople,
they were Armenian

01:41:17.050 --> 01:41:19.850
and they were basically
bantoukhds.

01:41:19.850 --> 01:41:24.560
In a really interesting article
recently I saw Robert Tatoian

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:27.880
had -- in Armenia it's
calculated about 15%

01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:30.110
of the population -- of
the of the male population

01:41:30.110 --> 01:41:32.600
of the Bitless Villi,
it actually had gone

01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:34.390
on bantkhdoutioun,
which is a really,

01:41:34.390 --> 01:41:38.110
really interesting figure.

01:41:38.110 --> 01:41:40.080
So, I'm not quite sure.

01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:43.810
Sort of, you know -- there's
a few sort of sources,

01:41:43.810 --> 01:41:45.450
whether they can be
trusted or not, but again,

01:41:45.450 --> 01:41:47.410
sort of if you actually
look at the source material,

01:41:47.410 --> 01:41:50.230
it really does show that a huge
number of people did migrate.

01:41:50.230 --> 01:41:52.970
And Constantinople was not the
only place they actually went

01:41:52.970 --> 01:41:54.270
there, for example
the Sussmansees,

01:41:54.270 --> 01:41:57.080
people from Sassoon, are known
to have particularly gone

01:41:57.080 --> 01:42:00.370
to Halep, where they
actually worked as bakers.

01:42:00.370 --> 01:42:03.710
So, among Aleppo
Armenians today,

01:42:03.710 --> 01:42:05.740
the surname "Khazakosian"
will immediately suggest

01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:09.060
that one's ancestors
actually came from Sassoon.

01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:13.250
But we're really concentrating
on Constantinople, I digress.

01:42:13.250 --> 01:42:15.670
To the urban Ottoman
army intellectual

01:42:15.670 --> 01:42:18.360
of the realist generation,
from a vantage point of mid

01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:22.100
to late 1880s and
1890s Constantinople,

01:42:22.100 --> 01:42:25.020
Ottoman Armenia was a
distant land in the East

01:42:25.020 --> 01:42:26.920
that most had never
seen or experienced,

01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:29.330
yet imagined vividly
and idealized.

01:42:29.330 --> 01:42:34.070
There was a huge, huge chunk of
literature, mostly ethnographic

01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:35.650
that was actually
available to these people so,

01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:39.930
they did imagine what
Armenia would have been like.

01:42:39.930 --> 01:42:42.000
But, of course, it's
-- Armenia lived

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:46.540
in their imagination rather
than the actual sort of poverty

01:42:46.540 --> 01:42:49.090
that was actually on the line.

01:42:49.090 --> 01:42:51.690
However, the presence of
thousands of bantoukhds

01:42:51.690 --> 01:42:54.560
on the streets of the imperial
capital provided a powerful

01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:56.080
material counterpart

01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:58.680
to any abstract notions
of Ottoman Armenia.

01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:01.400
A real flesh-and-blood, physical
manifestation of the streets

01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:02.710
of the imperial capital,

01:43:02.710 --> 01:43:06.700
personified in the recognizable
form of the provincial migrant.

01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:09.280
Most visible among the highest
Sansees were the thousands

01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:12.410
of Hamals, mainly peasants
from the villages of the plain

01:43:12.410 --> 01:43:15.170
of Mush, but also from
the province of Van,

01:43:15.170 --> 01:43:17.660
who for centuries past had
come to Constantinople to work,

01:43:17.660 --> 01:43:21.930
lived in slum-like, conditions
were organized into as esnaf.

01:43:21.930 --> 01:43:26.980
An esnaf is it's a kind of
guild, it's a kind of union,

01:43:26.980 --> 01:43:31.640
where people have a certain
profession group together,

01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:34.300
and the esnad actually
looked after them.

01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:37.090
It was it was a very
interesting organization.

01:43:37.090 --> 01:43:40.600
The word "esnaf" means different
things at different points

01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:44.370
in time, but you can sort of
imagine it as a kind of --

01:43:44.370 --> 01:43:46.220
sort of workers union.

01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:48.850
So, these migrants,
these bundles pass --

01:43:48.850 --> 01:43:50.520
these hamals passed
on their work

01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:52.100
from one generation to the next.

01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:53.820
So, the father would
come work for five years,

01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:56.020
go back home and send his son.

01:43:56.020 --> 01:43:59.630
So, you basically have the
same family, sort of members

01:43:59.630 --> 01:44:01.250
of the same families
sort of taking

01:44:01.250 --> 01:44:04.770
on the previous generation's
position.

01:44:04.770 --> 01:44:08.610
Hence, the surname Hamalian or
Hamalbashian is a pretty sort

01:44:08.610 --> 01:44:10.370
of popular surname
among Armenians

01:44:10.370 --> 01:44:12.910
from the Van region,
and the Mush region.

01:44:12.910 --> 01:44:15.980
They were really
proud to be Hamals.

01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:18.980
Being a being a Hamal was
actually being a porter,

01:44:18.980 --> 01:44:24.750
it was quite a, sort of honored
sort of profession for them.

01:44:24.750 --> 01:44:27.230
But, of course, Constantinople
Armenians looked at them

01:44:27.230 --> 01:44:30.410
in a completely different
way, but we'll get to that.

01:44:30.410 --> 01:44:33.280
The Armenian hold on the
profession in the city appears

01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:36.230
to have strengthened after
sultan Mahmud the Second,

01:44:36.230 --> 01:44:40.630
1808-1839, massacred and
expelled the Muslim Hamals

01:44:40.630 --> 01:44:45.880
of the port, following the
last Janissary revolt of 1826.

01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:48.400
The Armenian patriarch Garibay
the Third of Constantinople,

01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:52.440
1823-1831, was ordered
to provide 10,000 men

01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:56.430
as replacements for the killed
or expelled Muslim porters.

01:44:56.430 --> 01:44:57.900
Instantly recognizable,

01:44:57.900 --> 01:45:02.000
the Hamal of Constantinople had
already become an iconic figure.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.470
The subject of fascination for
writers and artists, visitors

01:45:05.470 --> 01:45:08.540
and locals throughout the 19th
century, there's a huge number

01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:11.130
of orientalist texts,
travel literature where --

01:45:11.130 --> 01:45:13.880
which would mythologize
the Armenian Hamal

01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:15.180
of Constantinople.

01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:17.170
They keep on repeating
the myth was sort of,

01:45:17.170 --> 01:45:20.270
they saw these Armenian Hamals
carrying enormous pianos

01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:23.270
on their backs up
mountains and, you know,

01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:24.710
it's all these stories.

01:45:24.710 --> 01:45:29.050
So, with the advent
of photography,

01:45:29.050 --> 01:45:31.320
they became popular -- they
became a popular subject

01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:32.870
for the photographic
lens as well.

01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:36.020
So, for example -- I just want

01:45:36.020 --> 01:45:39.830
to show you just a few examples
here, this is an albumen print,

01:45:39.830 --> 01:45:44.680
which was taken outdoors
and it's a Hamal.

01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:46.400
This is actually
another photograph,

01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:49.440
it's a famous photograph that's
actually been used numerous

01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:53.810
times in different
contexts across the decades,

01:45:53.810 --> 01:45:56.750
and it is from the
studio of the Armenian,

01:45:56.750 --> 01:46:00.590
the Ottoman Armenian
photographer Abdullah Phrese.

01:46:00.590 --> 01:46:03.750
And it's also been used
as a as a postcard.

01:46:03.750 --> 01:46:06.740
From the late 1890s, a lot of
these images were actually --

01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:10.310
some of the more popular ones
were actually used as postcards.

01:46:10.310 --> 01:46:13.090
And for example here you can
actually see four men arranged

01:46:13.090 --> 01:46:16.280
pleasingly around a
barrel and two poles.

01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:19.120
Of course, for every European
would actually receive this

01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:21.160
postcard -- I mean, it doesn't
really say anything what a Hamal

01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:24.210
is, but these are actually
the implements of their work.

01:46:24.210 --> 01:46:27.050
Since the poles and the
barrel, which four basic --

01:46:27.050 --> 01:46:30.040
four men, four men, six men or
eight men would actually carry.

01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:34.070
So, there are two types of
Hamals, the Hamals who worked

01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:39.610
as a group and Hamals who
basically carried the weights

01:46:39.610 --> 01:46:42.760
on their backs as
single workers.

01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:46.200
This is another interesting
photograph, and again,

01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:49.410
I really don't have much time
to go into it, but LaShienda

01:46:49.410 --> 01:46:52.540
who is -- it's really
encapsulate --

01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:53.940
I don't have time to go into it,

01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:56.240
but it really encapsulates
how a lot

01:46:56.240 --> 01:46:58.950
of Constantinople Armenians --

01:46:58.950 --> 01:47:02.690
but not just Constantinople
Armenians,

01:47:02.690 --> 01:47:05.680
urban Ottomans really
look down at the Hamals.

01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:09.310
And the street dogs were
also really, really common

01:47:09.310 --> 01:47:11.640
in the streets of
Constantinople.

01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:14.770
And so, you get lots of
images where the Hamals

01:47:14.770 --> 01:47:19.430
and the dogs are basically
posing next to one another.

01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:23.240
It really does -- it's a picture
that speaks a million words,

01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:26.440
really, but anyway, we
don't really have much time

01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:29.610
for photographer because we've
got paintings to look at.

01:47:29.610 --> 01:47:32.730
The bantoukhd in Constantinople
became the major preoccupation

01:47:32.730 --> 01:47:34.940
of the realists throughout
much of the 1880s

01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:37.190
and the early 1890s,
with hundreds

01:47:37.190 --> 01:47:40.130
of articles chronicling
every aspect of their lives

01:47:40.130 --> 01:47:42.400
and experience in the city.

01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:44.900
Yet no writer has looked
as closely as the bantoukhd

01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:47.410
and represented his
experience to the extent

01:47:47.410 --> 01:47:50.830
and with the sensitivity,
empathy and active employment

01:47:50.830 --> 01:47:52.880
and involvement, as the educator

01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:58.350
and noted chronicler
Melkon Grunyan, 1859-1915.

01:47:58.350 --> 01:48:00.320
Writing under the
pseudonym "Herrant",

01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:03.390
he represented the bantoukhd's
life in all its facets.

01:48:03.390 --> 01:48:06.090
In his letters of the bantoukhd,
"bantoukhdin amakhner",

01:48:06.090 --> 01:48:09.200
a series of 20 or so chronicles,
written in Constantinople

01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:13.010
and published in by the then
weekly newspaper "Masses"

01:48:13.010 --> 01:48:16.790
between 1888 and
1891 and "Highrenick"

01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:19.970
between 1891 and 1892.

01:48:19.970 --> 01:48:22.630
The letters, which according

01:48:22.630 --> 01:48:24.790
to the literary historian
James Atmeckjean had given

01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:28.130
unparalleled authenticity to the
literary realism of the time,

01:48:28.130 --> 01:48:29.840
were usually addressed
through Arpyarian,

01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:33.720
then editor of "Masses", at
whose request they were written,

01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:35.020
and by extension

01:48:35.020 --> 01:48:37.890
to a Constantinople
Armenian readership.

01:48:37.890 --> 01:48:40.190
Employing language
that is simple, direct,

01:48:40.190 --> 01:48:42.520
yet intensely visual, etfrastic,

01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:45.930
Herrnat closely described
the individual bantoukhd,

01:48:45.930 --> 01:48:49.150
painted being a man and probed
into the darkest little corners

01:48:49.150 --> 01:48:51.620
of his soul, revealing
his innermost thoughts

01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:52.920
and sufferings.

01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:55.850
Himself a bantoukhd, unlike
most of the other realists,

01:48:55.850 --> 01:48:58.300
Herrant knew his
subject intimately.

01:48:58.300 --> 01:49:01.600
He castigated the contempt
with which urban Armenians

01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:04.870
of Constantinople
denigrated and dismissed him,

01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:08.370
relentlessly advocating the
provincial bantoukhds dignity.

01:49:08.370 --> 01:49:11.300
Expressed concerned with a
luring of young men and boys

01:49:11.300 --> 01:49:13.900
into what he termed
"ignoble professions",

01:49:13.900 --> 01:49:15.230
such as male prostitution,

01:49:15.230 --> 01:49:17.980
practice within homo-social
spaces such as the hammam

01:49:17.980 --> 01:49:21.490
and other, has he termed
them, "abbatoirs of morals"

01:49:21.490 --> 01:49:24.390
such as mayhanesse
and coffee houses.

01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:27.280
Reproduced letters that he
himself had scribed on behalf

01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:29.200
of illiterate bantoukhds.

01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:32.180
In one such letter addressed
to a mother informing her

01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:35.540
of the death of her son, we
are provided with a glimpse

01:49:35.540 --> 01:49:38.880
of what he termed "a
black letter", seftaukhed,

01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:41.930
thousands of which crisscross
19th century Anatolia,

01:49:41.930 --> 01:49:45.120
carrying news of
death and sickness.

01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:48.360
Like Herrant, Constantinople
artists too often took a close

01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:51.230
and pathetic look
at the bantoukhd.

01:49:51.230 --> 01:49:53.100
The bantoukhd Hamal from Mush --

01:49:53.100 --> 01:50:00.000
its undated, but it was probably
painted in the late 1890s,

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.940
also by Simon Hagopian who
painted the earlier Hamals

01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:06.680
on the bridge, is an
intense study of a migrant

01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:07.980
where character

01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:09.280
and psychological depth
have taken center stage.

01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:13.790
Hagopian has skillfully captured
the likeness of an attractive,

01:50:13.790 --> 01:50:16.590
dignified man on the
cusp of middle age,

01:50:16.590 --> 01:50:19.320
where the empathy the artist
must have felt towards the

01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:21.410
sitter is clearly reflected.

01:50:21.410 --> 01:50:24.160
Here, the Hamal's direct
gaze breaches the gulf

01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:28.370
between the subject,
artist and us, the viewers.

01:50:28.370 --> 01:50:30.720
The neutral white background
avoids any distraction

01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:32.950
from the subject, with
a Hamal claiming our

01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:35.630
undivided attention.

01:50:35.630 --> 01:50:38.370
Meanwhile, Arpyarian rights
of another earlier portrait

01:50:38.370 --> 01:50:42.140
of a bantoukhd Hamal from Mush,
the painting "Manugahbarj",

01:50:42.140 --> 01:50:45.540
"brother", "Manugahbarj" means
"brother", the whereabouts

01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:47.330
of which are currently unknown,

01:50:47.330 --> 01:50:50.010
by the highly respected 19th
century Constantinople artist

01:50:50.010 --> 01:50:53.500
Petros Srabian, 1833-1898.

01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:56.510
Writing in the popular
daily Arabic orient,

01:50:56.510 --> 01:50:59.100
on the 25th of February
1884 under the pseudonym

01:50:59.100 --> 01:51:00.990
"Herraskhan", he recorded his

01:51:00.990 --> 01:51:03.800
and his friends responses
to the work.

01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:06.620
"With a few friends we
visited Petros Srabian's home.

01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:09.790
He had just completed
"Manuhagpbarj".

01:51:09.790 --> 01:51:13.110
That slight face and
its feelings of sadness,

01:51:13.110 --> 01:51:16.970
this faded eyes, skinny
fingers, the rags.

01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:20.780
And I don't know what noble wind
was waving on his entire face,

01:51:20.780 --> 01:51:23.820
turned us all towards
melancholy.

01:51:23.820 --> 01:51:27.140
'What an odd thing' said one of
our friends, 'were I to see him,

01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:30.030
the old man on the street, I
would certainly have passed him

01:51:30.030 --> 01:51:33.080
by without the slightest
care, whereas by looking

01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:34.960
at that painting, his eyes,

01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:37.990
as if magnets pull my
glance towards them'.

01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:42.380
The talented painter, by pulling
the old man's grief eroded" --

01:51:42.380 --> 01:51:45.990
he used the word "veshtamash",
"hard softest strings,

01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:49.350
had captured within his eyes
the most psychological".

01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:52.990
He uses the word "hokipanagan",
which translates directly

01:51:52.990 --> 01:51:55.540
as "psychology",
"psychological".

01:51:55.540 --> 01:51:57.640
So, it's the most
psychological moment

01:51:57.640 --> 01:52:00.490
and all the emotional
storms tormenting his heart

01:52:00.490 --> 01:52:03.270
for 70 years.

01:52:03.270 --> 01:52:07.600
Whilst Srabian's intentions are
not made explicit in the text,

01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:10.840
we don't really know what he
actually sort of meant to convey

01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:12.630
by sort of painting
Manugahbarj, and we don't know

01:52:12.630 --> 01:52:13.930
where the painting is.

01:52:13.930 --> 01:52:16.550
Despite the artist's
presence during the viewing

01:52:16.550 --> 01:52:19.200
of the work so, when Arpyarian
and his friends view the work,

01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:21.160
they were at the
artists atelier.

01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:22.460
So, there must have been privy

01:52:22.460 --> 01:52:26.000
to the artist's own
thoughts on the image.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.070
The reviewers words clearly
suggests an allegorical reading,

01:52:29.070 --> 01:52:33.490
which he notes, turned
him towards melancholy.

01:52:33.490 --> 01:52:36.220
Another reviewer records
a similar response

01:52:36.220 --> 01:52:38.780
to an earlier painting
by Srabian entitled

01:52:38.780 --> 01:52:41.630
"Armenian beggar from Van".

01:52:41.630 --> 01:52:43.220
And this is the image.

01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:46.130
Now, this is a much
admired work --

01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:49.280
and this is confirmed by
its election for exhibition

01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:52.350
at the prestigious 1882
exhibition of the artists

01:52:52.350 --> 01:52:55.570
of the Bosporus and
Constantinople, the ABC club,

01:52:55.570 --> 01:52:56.870
under the patronage

01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:58.460
of the British ambassador
Lord Dufferin,

01:52:58.460 --> 01:53:02.160
and the favorable reviews
of contemporary viewers.

01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:04.780
Fortunately for us, "Armenian
beggar from Van" is also one

01:53:04.780 --> 01:53:08.010
of the very few works by leading
19th century Constantinople

01:53:08.010 --> 01:53:10.890
artist, that is held by
a public institution,

01:53:10.890 --> 01:53:13.420
the National Gallery
of Armenia in Yerevan,

01:53:13.420 --> 01:53:16.020
where it is currently listed
as poor Armenian villager,

01:53:16.020 --> 01:53:18.300
"ahcat haithuratzi" and, hence,

01:53:18.300 --> 01:53:21.790
readily accessible
to art historians.

01:53:21.790 --> 01:53:23.420
Consider the following
review of the work

01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:25.340
by the prominent
Constantinople educator,

01:53:25.340 --> 01:53:28.450
author and later
politician Minas Ceras,

01:53:28.450 --> 01:53:30.640
in an article published
on the 28th of May,

01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:35.480
1882 in the influential
Constantinople Armenian language

01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:37.040
newspaper "Masses".

01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:40.700
Under the headline, painting
exhibition "Negara huntys".

01:53:40.700 --> 01:53:44.000
Writing under the pseudonym
"Ascazerj", which means "lover

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:47.440
of nation", he noted
-- and this is --

01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:52.770
this is basically the paragraph
where the translation's from.

01:53:52.770 --> 01:53:55.660
"The painting represents an
Armenian beggar from Van.

01:53:55.660 --> 01:53:58.950
With his colorful rugs
and dark blue headdress,

01:53:58.950 --> 01:54:00.710
who leaning towards
his stick looks

01:54:00.710 --> 01:54:03.190
at the viewer with
pitiful eyes".

01:54:03.190 --> 01:54:05.930
"The expression of this
painting is extremely tender

01:54:05.930 --> 01:54:09.440
and heart-rending,
"hus desaruch".

01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:12.240
The sensitive brush of
the author has succeeded

01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:15.360
in personifying the
emigration bantkhdouitioun,

01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:16.660
and plundering, [inaudible].

01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:20.450
He actually uses
these words in print,

01:54:20.450 --> 01:54:24.500
which is quite extraordinary
of our provincial brethren.

01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:27.160
"I sought foreigners who was
saddened before the site".

01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:30.370
He uses the word "yerevuit",
which translates to "site".

01:54:30.370 --> 01:54:33.920
"And perhaps wasn't it
natural that I should weep?

01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:36.690
I, who is not a connoisseur
of the Arts" --

01:54:36.690 --> 01:54:39.580
he uses the word arvestahket",
"but simply any" --

01:54:39.580 --> 01:54:42.730
and signs off "Ascazerj".

01:54:42.730 --> 01:54:46.450
Ceras' reaction betrays even
more explicitly the attribution

01:54:46.450 --> 01:54:49.410
of an allegorical interpretation
of -- to the image.

01:54:49.410 --> 01:54:52.430
"Rather than being a benign
depiction of a beggar,

01:54:52.430 --> 01:54:55.070
the image appears to have
conveyed certain troubling

01:54:55.070 --> 01:54:57.940
messages to contemporary
viewers".

01:54:57.940 --> 01:54:59.320
The concern trouble born artist

01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:03.530
and art historian Raphael
Shmanian, 1885 and 1959,

01:55:03.530 --> 01:55:07.060
notes that in the
1870s desperate battles

01:55:07.060 --> 01:55:10.240
from Ottoman Armenia dressed in
rags and in wretched conditions,

01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:13.670
nable to find work in the
city, would wander the streets

01:55:13.670 --> 01:55:17.280
of Armenian populated districts
begging, often attacked abused

01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:19.650
or chased away by
stone throwers.

01:55:19.650 --> 01:55:23.680
Shmanian, just as Ceras in
the opening accept, drew --

01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:26.850
in the above accepts,
drew a direct link

01:55:26.850 --> 01:55:28.580
between the phenomena of begging

01:55:28.580 --> 01:55:31.750
in at Constantinople
and bantkhdoutioun.

01:55:31.750 --> 01:55:33.050
Yet Srabian's reference

01:55:33.050 --> 01:55:36.520
to Van clearly signifies the
1881 famine, looming large

01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:39.650
on the artist's and
reviewer's consciousness.

01:55:39.650 --> 01:55:42.510
To Ceras, the painting
represented the personification

01:55:42.510 --> 01:55:46.220
of plunder and destitution,
which he incredibly,

01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:49.000
explicitly noted in print.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:52.730
But also crucially in 1882,
famine, a subtle allegory

01:55:52.730 --> 01:55:55.660
and the inability of Ottoman
Armenia to feed itself,

01:55:55.660 --> 01:55:58.690
meanwhile the censors of
the committee for inspection

01:55:58.690 --> 01:56:01.850
and controls, the authority
responsible for the approval

01:56:01.850 --> 01:56:06.890
of all publications that
also included the scrutiny

01:56:06.890 --> 01:56:10.860
of pictures, would have viewed
Srabian's beggar as a critique,

01:56:10.860 --> 01:56:13.660
would not have viewed
Srabian's beggar as a critique

01:56:13.660 --> 01:56:16.770
of the Ottoman state, but
instead regarded the painting

01:56:16.770 --> 01:56:19.820
as a harmless, ethnographic
representation,

01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:22.910
thus permitting its
uncensored exhibition.

01:56:22.910 --> 01:56:24.210
What is certain is

01:56:24.210 --> 01:56:26.520
that Srabian's beggar had
successfully bypassed any

01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:28.610
sensorial constraints
and under a cloak

01:56:28.610 --> 01:56:31.920
of seemingly benign ethnographic
naturalism, had conjured

01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:33.970
within the brush what the pen
might not have been allowed

01:56:33.970 --> 01:56:36.280
to express.

01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:38.350
Just like the figure
of the machete hamal,

01:56:38.350 --> 01:56:39.700
the beggar from Van appears

01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:42.590
as a recurring theme among
Constantinople artists,

01:56:42.590 --> 01:56:48.570
allowing them to engage through
such personification with

01:56:48.570 --> 01:56:50.880
and comment upon the
words of Ottoman Armenia.

01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:55.240
Let's consider two surviving
versions of Hagopian's beggar,

01:56:55.240 --> 01:56:56.540
also by -- again,

01:56:56.540 --> 01:56:58.800
Simone Hagopian's
beggar, a woman from Van.

01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:01.100
The two versions of this 18 --

01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:03.590
the first one, this one was
actually painted in 1889,

01:57:03.590 --> 01:57:06.000
the second one's
actually dated in 1908,

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.510
and it's another version of
this, which basically means

01:57:08.510 --> 01:57:10.090
that the artist kept
on producing

01:57:10.090 --> 01:57:12.190
and reproducing the same image.

01:57:12.190 --> 01:57:15.970
As in Srabian's beggar, nothing
detracts from the degeneration

01:57:15.970 --> 01:57:17.970
and poverty of the old woman.

01:57:17.970 --> 01:57:20.490
Hagopian's background
especially recalls the practice

01:57:20.490 --> 01:57:22.930
of late 19th century
photographic studios,

01:57:22.930 --> 01:57:26.830
of subjects being photographed
outdoors with a blank canvas

01:57:26.830 --> 01:57:30.350
of the wall with its cracks
serving to reinforce an aura

01:57:30.350 --> 01:57:33.780
of hopelessness, heightening
the realism of the scene.

01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:37.360
Her bare feet and outstretched
hand, her fingernails inked

01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:40.430
with black dirt evoke
the imploring fatalism

01:57:40.430 --> 01:57:44.600
of the posture and pathetic
gaze of Srabian's male beggar.

01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:47.780
The beggar woman's gender and
old age add further layers,

01:57:47.780 --> 01:57:50.880
her destitution,
loneliness, defenselessness

01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:55.180
and cruel abandonment in
a patriarchal society.

01:57:55.180 --> 01:57:57.380
Hagopian has utilized
the gritty naturalism

01:57:57.380 --> 01:57:59.120
and powerful realist
visual vocabulary

01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:02.540
to elicit the empathetic
response of the viewer,

01:58:02.540 --> 01:58:04.480
towards the poor and
dispossessed rural population

01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:08.780
of Ottoman Armenia two years,
after another famine in 1887,

01:58:08.780 --> 01:58:12.130
and the bundles on the streets
of the imperial capital.

01:58:12.130 --> 01:58:15.000
Yet through this representation
of a provincial woman,

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:18.260
Hagopian may have also been
seeking to draw attention to one

01:58:18.260 --> 01:58:21.230
of the most devastating
consequences of bantkhdouitioun.

01:58:21.230 --> 01:58:24.860
The wholesale desertion
of thousands of wives,

01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:28.360
or their abandonment altogether,
a major preoccupation

01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:30.380
of the Constantinople
patriarch age and depress

01:58:30.380 --> 01:58:32.910
in the late 19th century.

01:58:32.910 --> 01:58:36.350
Many bantoukhds married
young, often at 12 or 14,

01:58:36.350 --> 01:58:38.650
leaving their child
brides behind

01:58:38.650 --> 01:58:40.920
to seek work in Constantinople.

01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:43.880
Many of these men never
returned, abandoning their wives

01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:47.210
to a life of mistreatment
defined by rigid tradition.

01:58:47.210 --> 01:58:49.820
Following years of
brutality, slavery and abuse

01:58:49.820 --> 01:58:52.540
by their absent husbands'
families and blamed

01:58:52.540 --> 01:58:55.730
for the non-return of
the bantoukhd sons,

01:58:55.730 --> 01:58:57.760
these women were often
put out on the street

01:58:57.760 --> 01:59:00.150
with no options and no hope.

01:59:00.150 --> 01:59:02.270
Newspapers are replete
with reports of women

01:59:02.270 --> 01:59:04.540
who have been rejected
by their families,

01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:08.470
had been left homeless, forced
to beg in their villages

01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:10.210
or nearest and onerous towns,

01:59:10.210 --> 01:59:12.550
and some indeed turn
to prostitution.

01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:15.040
And others -- because the
Armenian Church would not allow

01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:17.460
divorce, even though the husband
would have been gone for 20

01:59:17.460 --> 01:59:21.250
or 30 years, they would convert
to Catholicism or Protestantism

01:59:21.250 --> 01:59:24.750
to say they were
actually able to remarry.

01:59:24.750 --> 01:59:28.610
Whether these works --
whether Hagopian's painting

01:59:28.610 --> 01:59:34.100
of the beggar woman from Van was
ever exhibited, was displayed

01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:36.820
in public or reviewed, I have
not been able to establish,

01:59:36.820 --> 01:59:38.690
I have not find any,
any references to it,

01:59:38.690 --> 01:59:42.250
with the exception that
the beggar woman from Van,

01:59:42.250 --> 01:59:43.960
alongside the Hamals
on the bridge --

01:59:43.960 --> 01:59:46.340
the first image that we
actually had look at,

01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:49.000
were listed in a
short, biographical note

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:54.200
on Simon Hagopian's biographical
note of suit of by --

01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:58.380
Simon Hagopian published
in Theotic's 1912 Almanac.

01:59:58.380 --> 02:00:00.920
that attests that these were
among the artist's finest

02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:02.790
and most renowned works.

02:00:02.790 --> 02:00:06.520
And this is also sort of shown
by the fact that the artist kept

02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:08.180
on reproducing the same work.

02:00:08.180 --> 02:00:10.380
People would probably go
to him and ask for him

02:00:10.380 --> 02:00:12.720
to actually repaint
the paintings so,

02:00:12.720 --> 02:00:14.810
he produced several examples.

02:00:14.810 --> 02:00:20.180
Now, there's one final work that
I'd like to sort of show you,

02:00:20.180 --> 02:00:25.500
and it's a painting by another
celebrated Ottoman Armenian.

02:00:25.500 --> 02:00:27.180
He's unfortunately
completely forgotten,

02:00:27.180 --> 02:00:29.620
but he was a major
figure in Constantinople

02:00:29.620 --> 02:00:33.430
in the 1880s and 1990s.

02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:35.700
He was a society
portrait painter.

02:00:35.700 --> 02:00:38.230
He was the Constantinople born

02:00:38.230 --> 02:00:42.990
and Naples educated artist
Garabed Nichanian, 1861-1950.

02:00:42.990 --> 02:00:46.700
Now, this painting of which
there are two versions,

02:00:46.700 --> 02:00:49.010
and this is probably
the original version

02:00:49.010 --> 02:00:53.590
that was painted in 1897
in Tiflis, and is, again,

02:00:53.590 --> 02:00:57.280
luckily for us at the National
Gallery of Armenia in Yerevan.

02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:00.420
The second one is a
smaller copy of it and it's

02:01:00.420 --> 02:01:02.780
in a private collection
in Istanbul.

02:01:02.780 --> 02:01:04.850
It's completely different
from the other --

02:01:04.850 --> 02:01:09.570
of from the other images because
it actually depicts these people

02:01:09.570 --> 02:01:13.150
in Ottoman Armenia.

02:01:13.150 --> 02:01:18.390
So, this is a second work
by Garabed Nichanian,

02:01:18.390 --> 02:01:20.610
who despite never having
been to Ottoman army aid,

02:01:20.610 --> 02:01:22.690
I don't think he actually
ever left Constantinople

02:01:22.690 --> 02:01:25.860
to go anywhere east,
outside Constantinople.

02:01:25.860 --> 02:01:29.730
He also produced this
this famous painting,

02:01:29.730 --> 02:01:31.030
which is now unfortunately lost.

02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:32.920
It's in somewhere in the United
States and I've been looking

02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:37.050
for it for the past three years
so, if anyone knows where it is,

02:01:37.050 --> 02:01:38.490
it's in a private collection.

02:01:38.490 --> 02:01:40.590
I had to show it just to
ask you if anyone knows

02:01:40.590 --> 02:01:42.070
where it is, to let me know.

02:01:42.070 --> 02:01:44.470
But luckily a photograph
exists of this.

02:01:44.470 --> 02:01:49.220
And he has created this sort
of quite theatrical painting

02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:54.330
of an Armenian wedding of Mush,
and again, he used bantoukhd

02:01:54.330 --> 02:01:56.240
from the streets
of Constantinople

02:01:56.240 --> 02:02:00.900
who basically confirmed his idea
of types of Ottoman Armenians

02:02:00.900 --> 02:02:04.250
from Mush, who he
basically took to his Atelier

02:02:04.250 --> 02:02:05.990
and he actually sketched them,

02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:07.840
and he produced this
massive painting.

02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:11.870
It's about two meters wide
and one half meters tall.

02:02:11.870 --> 02:02:16.710
So, by Ottoman standards,
it's a pretty massive work.

02:02:16.710 --> 02:02:22.090
But talking about this work,
I know that I'm out of time

02:02:22.090 --> 02:02:27.850
and this was exhibited
in in Tiflis of the 1897,

02:02:27.850 --> 02:02:30.010
Fifth Caucasian Art
Exhibit and it got really,

02:02:30.010 --> 02:02:31.590
really extraordinary reviews.

02:02:31.590 --> 02:02:34.800
And again, I won't go into it
but if anyone has any questions,

02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:37.070
you can come and
ask me afterwards.

02:02:37.070 --> 02:02:40.560
But I'd like to sort of point
out that it is a letter that is

02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:43.660
at the center of
over the painting.

02:02:43.660 --> 02:02:51.560
And the question is, is this
one of those black letters

02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:54.350
that Herrant wrote
so much about?

02:02:54.350 --> 02:02:57.380
Sort of, you know, taking
bad news from the Bantle son,

02:02:57.380 --> 02:03:00.350
or perhaps the army in
hospital in Constantinople

02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:01.800
or the patriarch
aid informing them

02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:03.740
that their son has
actually died.

02:03:03.740 --> 02:03:06.140
And the final point I
will actually make is

02:03:06.140 --> 02:03:08.280
that this painting was
actually made in --

02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:12.530
was actually executed in 1897.

02:03:12.530 --> 02:03:16.050
Nichanian, alongside Srabian
and several other artists,

02:03:16.050 --> 02:03:20.080
and lots of other Armenian
intellectuals actually left,

02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:21.780
they were exiled
from Constantinople.

02:03:21.780 --> 02:03:25.670
They escaped the 1894-1897
massacres, and some went

02:03:25.670 --> 02:03:28.370
to Europe, some went to
Russian Transcaucasia.

02:03:28.370 --> 02:03:32.070
And Nichanian ended up
in Russian Transcaucasia.

02:03:32.070 --> 02:03:33.370
So, the point I'm
actually making is

02:03:33.370 --> 02:03:37.290
that despite having
left Ottoman Armenia,

02:03:37.290 --> 02:03:40.300
this artist was still
engaging with a phenomenon

02:03:40.300 --> 02:03:42.850
of bantkhdouioun and
how important it was

02:03:42.850 --> 02:03:44.540
for Armenian realists.

02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:46.360
Thank you so much.

02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:48.510
I'm sorry I'd run
over my time but --

02:03:48.510 --> 02:03:53.840
[ Applause ]

02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:55.450
&gt;&gt; The beauty of
having a conference

02:03:55.450 --> 02:03:58.150
like this is you hear
so many new topics.

02:03:58.150 --> 02:04:01.490
The downside -- the downside
is you don't have the time

02:04:01.490 --> 02:04:06.760
to really delve into -- in
any depth, and all of them

02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:09.350
so far have been magnificent.

02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:13.530
And which leads us to the last
talk of the morning session,

02:04:13.530 --> 02:04:17.040
and by friend and
researcher at the Library

02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:18.930
of Congress while
working on his doctorate,

02:04:18.930 --> 02:04:22.440
and noted lecturer
Hashit Muradian,

02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:25.210
who is now at Columbia
university,

02:04:25.210 --> 02:04:28.510
and he will be speaking
on "Unarmed and dangerous,

02:04:28.510 --> 02:04:31.530
nonviolent resistance
from the Ottoman empire

02:04:31.530 --> 02:04:33.510
to the Third Reich".

02:04:33.510 --> 02:04:38.430
[ Applause ]

02:04:38.430 --> 02:04:42.430
&gt;&gt; Thank you, LaVon for
this phenomenal conference.

02:04:42.430 --> 02:04:47.010
I feel like after talking
about arts and wealth,

02:04:47.010 --> 02:04:51.530
talking about poverty
and art, you know,

02:04:51.530 --> 02:04:53.420
it's an Armenian conference so,

02:04:53.420 --> 02:04:55.260
there has to be the
great equalizer,

02:04:55.260 --> 02:04:57.380
death and destruction
[laughter].

02:04:57.380 --> 02:05:01.690
So, I'm here to deliver
that talk.

02:05:01.690 --> 02:05:07.170
But I will do, however,
is along the lines

02:05:07.170 --> 02:05:11.990
of LaVon's introduction where
he talked about how, you know --

02:05:11.990 --> 02:05:14.550
when we think about Armenian
history, it's not just

02:05:14.550 --> 02:05:18.100
about Armenians converting to
Christianity, the destruction

02:05:18.100 --> 02:05:21.140
of the Armenian Genocide
-- some of these, like,

02:05:21.140 --> 02:05:24.160
topics that we often really --

02:05:24.160 --> 02:05:30.660
occupies our historiography
and public discourse.

02:05:30.660 --> 02:05:33.980
But also even within
these histories,

02:05:33.980 --> 02:05:36.880
there are important
aspects that are neglected.

02:05:36.880 --> 02:05:39.410
Again, often for
reasons that have to do

02:05:39.410 --> 02:05:44.410
with often political
circumstances,

02:05:44.410 --> 02:05:49.000
other times because they are --
because of the unavailability

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:50.790
of archives, etcetera.

02:05:50.790 --> 02:05:53.330
And the topic that I'm going
to be dealing with here,

02:05:53.330 --> 02:05:57.400
in a comparative perspective,
is going to be the notion

02:05:57.400 --> 02:06:01.270
of unarmed resistance.

02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:08.130
This essentially constitutes
the focal point of my work,

02:06:08.130 --> 02:06:10.950
because when we think about
mass violence in general,

02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:12.570
what are we talking about?

02:06:12.570 --> 02:06:14.910
The Army and genocide, the
Holocaust or other cases

02:06:14.910 --> 02:06:22.030
of mass violence, the narrative
is typically one of asymmetry.

02:06:22.030 --> 02:06:24.080
Genocide itself is
a manifestation

02:06:24.080 --> 02:06:25.670
of the extreme asymmetry

02:06:25.670 --> 02:06:31.330
where you have a powerful
group attacking another group

02:06:31.330 --> 02:06:33.910
with the intent to
annihilate it.

02:06:33.910 --> 02:06:37.300
This asymmetry gives
the impression

02:06:37.300 --> 02:06:44.570
that the narrative have to flow
from one direction to the other,

02:06:44.570 --> 02:06:50.190
and there's very little
that can hold against it.

02:06:50.190 --> 02:06:54.850
This is important so, this
is like watching an avalanche

02:06:54.850 --> 02:06:56.150
from a distance, right?

02:06:56.150 --> 02:07:03.140
What we see is the Avalanche
taking everything in its way.

02:07:03.140 --> 02:07:08.330
This merciless, unstoppable,
you know,

02:07:08.330 --> 02:07:10.710
attack on everything in its way.

02:07:10.710 --> 02:07:17.060
But ultimately, if we look
closer, every little component,

02:07:17.060 --> 02:07:23.380
every little pebble, every tree
in its way is pushing back.

02:07:23.380 --> 02:07:26.700
And this is the point that I
would like to make in this talk.

02:07:26.700 --> 02:07:30.200
And I'm going to be focusing
on this idea of pushing back.

02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:36.630
And pushing back itself,
resisting, it's not conditional

02:07:36.630 --> 02:07:42.560
on the presence of weapons.

02:07:42.560 --> 02:07:44.600
We can't -- it's
difficult to argue

02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:48.890
that you need this machine,
this metallic machine

02:07:48.890 --> 02:07:54.250
that propels gunpowder
and little bits of metal,

02:07:54.250 --> 02:08:00.620
you need that to be present
for human beings to resist.

02:08:00.620 --> 02:08:02.240
Yet, if we look at
the historiography,

02:08:02.240 --> 02:08:08.140
up until very recently -- and in
general both in Armenian history

02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:13.460
and beyond, the focus,
the emphasis is very much

02:08:13.460 --> 02:08:18.810
on if any -- if there is
any, is on armed resistance.

02:08:18.810 --> 02:08:27.700
So, here's a quote from an
Armenian woman who lived

02:08:27.700 --> 02:08:33.800
in Aleppo during World War
I, talking about her husband

02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:37.880
and what he did as
Armenian deportees

02:08:37.880 --> 02:08:41.090
in the thousands were arriving
in what is today Syria,

02:08:41.090 --> 02:08:45.750
what was back then Ottoman
Syria, beginning in May 1915

02:08:45.750 --> 02:08:48.710
as a deportation and massacres
of Armenians are going on.

02:08:48.710 --> 02:08:52.440
So, she writes -- this is
after the death of her husband

02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:56.040
from disease that he
contracted from deportees.

02:08:56.040 --> 02:08:58.650
She writes in the letter,
"my dear Badveli --

02:08:58.650 --> 02:09:01.780
Reverend, barely out of
bed from his sickness,

02:09:01.780 --> 02:09:04.420
disregarding the personal
hardships and peril

02:09:04.420 --> 02:09:07.310
to his own life,
relentlessly labored day

02:09:07.310 --> 02:09:09.790
and night to save other lives.

02:09:09.790 --> 02:09:14.050
Together we pressed ourselves to
the very limit of our endurance.

02:09:14.050 --> 02:09:18.260
All our time, energy,
efforts, sleep, food, clothing

02:09:18.260 --> 02:09:22.370
and other material possessions
we put on the line on behalf

02:09:22.370 --> 02:09:29.360
of this wretched, miserable mass
of torn and battered humanity".

02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:34.900
Now, this is humanitarian work,

02:09:34.900 --> 02:09:42.370
and humanitarian work typically
does not necessarily come

02:09:42.370 --> 02:09:44.110
as resistance.

02:09:44.110 --> 02:09:48.210
We -- I will allude to
this a little bit later,

02:09:48.210 --> 02:09:51.570
but it's important to
note here that the work

02:09:51.570 --> 02:09:54.690
that these humanitarians
were doing in Aleppo,

02:09:54.690 --> 02:09:57.770
as the thousands of deportees
were arriving in a city

02:09:57.770 --> 02:10:01.500
and the region, actually
constituted resistance,

02:10:01.500 --> 02:10:03.040
what I refer to as
"humanitarian resistance".

02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:08.520
Because it was being done
eventually against the will

02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:14.850
of the authorities and by
essentially breaking the law.

02:10:14.850 --> 02:10:16.390
So, this is not humanitarianism
--

02:10:16.390 --> 02:10:20.560
an act of human tourism that's
being done under circumstances

02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:22.040
where you have the
support of the authorities

02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:24.280
or at least the neutrality
of the authorities,

02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:28.080
but actually activism,
humanitarianism that is done

02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:32.460
against their will,
by risking one's life,

02:10:32.460 --> 02:10:36.490
by risking one's
imprisonment, etcetera.

02:10:36.490 --> 02:10:42.050
So, it's important to highlight
this, this idea that any action

02:10:42.050 --> 02:10:47.270
that occurs as being
won at engaging in,

02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:52.280
in order to save a certain group
or individual, and in order

02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:58.290
to fight back against a
certain group does constitute a

02:10:58.290 --> 02:11:03.800
resistance, whether or not
there's a weapon involved.

02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:07.060
Now, as I said, this is this
is common in historiography.

02:11:07.060 --> 02:11:11.400
This is a quote from a scholar
who has written extensively

02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:12.930
on resilience and resistance.

02:11:12.930 --> 02:11:17.780
"By the 1950s and beyond,
historians who had examined

02:11:17.780 --> 02:11:19.320
of European Jewry concentrated

02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:22.720
on the perpetrators
rather than the victims".

02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:24.720
Also very true in
the Armenian case.

02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:27.070
"This inattention should
not come as a surprise,

02:11:27.070 --> 02:11:28.370
given that the enormity

02:11:28.370 --> 02:11:31.810
of the German crimes
overshadowed their victims.

02:11:31.810 --> 02:11:34.320
Perhaps, too, it should
not come as a surprise

02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:38.500
that early historians of the
period were primarily interested

02:11:38.500 --> 02:11:40.530
in learning about the
forces that caused

02:11:40.530 --> 02:11:43.220
such unprecedented destruction".

02:11:43.220 --> 02:11:45.390
These are two examples,

02:11:45.390 --> 02:11:50.390
one is that of the Warsaw Ghetto
Uprising which is, you know,

02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:52.750
when we talk about
Jewish resistance.

02:11:52.750 --> 02:11:57.120
You know, that is one typical
example that comes to mind,

02:11:57.120 --> 02:12:03.070
and the other is the example
of the Armenians fighting back

02:12:03.070 --> 02:12:07.660
on Musa Dagh, which has been
immortalized by Franz Werfel

02:12:07.660 --> 02:12:09.460
in the novel "The 40
days of Musa Dagh".

02:12:09.460 --> 02:12:17.640
Now, it's important to note that
in most cases of mass violence,

02:12:17.640 --> 02:12:23.850
the majority of the targeted
population does not have access

02:12:23.850 --> 02:12:27.570
to weapons, has no
training in weapons

02:12:27.570 --> 02:12:29.840
or has no interest
in using them.

02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:33.870
But this does not,
again, create a situation

02:12:33.870 --> 02:12:37.320
where one is unable to resist.

02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:43.310
"For decades, most scholars have
in fact shared the stereotype

02:12:43.310 --> 02:12:47.320
of the resistance, presenting
it almost exclusively

02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:51.890
as an armed action and
almost entirely masculine".

02:12:51.890 --> 02:12:54.840
"Later, references began to
appear to unarmed actions

02:12:54.840 --> 02:12:56.990
and those of women
but only rarely did

02:12:56.990 --> 02:13:00.130
such mention go beyond an
emotional homage", again,

02:13:00.130 --> 02:13:05.440
very typical of the
historiography

02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:08.010
on mass violence in general.

02:13:08.010 --> 02:13:10.980
Now, this is one of the
important problems here,

02:13:10.980 --> 02:13:14.700
is that once we focus -- as
we think about resistance,

02:13:14.700 --> 02:13:18.450
once we focus on armed
resistance, there are a lot

02:13:18.450 --> 02:13:21.940
of things that are being
forgotten and neglected,

02:13:21.940 --> 02:13:30.320
importantly women and the fact
that women also resisted in many

02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:31.620
of these circumstances.

02:13:31.620 --> 02:13:36.630
Most, however, did not
with weapons, right?

02:13:36.630 --> 02:13:40.220
And I'll come back
to this later on.

02:13:40.220 --> 02:13:46.550
Now, scholars have defined
resistance in a number of ways.

02:13:46.550 --> 02:13:48.790
I will be showing
you a few definitions

02:13:48.790 --> 02:13:53.140
from the Third Reich, World
War II and the Holocaust just

02:13:53.140 --> 02:13:56.150
to give you an idea about
the way these definitions

02:13:56.150 --> 02:13:57.670
are framed.

02:13:57.670 --> 02:14:02.430
One definition, "a set of
the activities motivated

02:14:02.430 --> 02:14:07.330
by the desire to thwart, limit,
undermine or end the exercise

02:14:07.330 --> 02:14:09.810
of oppression over
the oppressed".

02:14:09.810 --> 02:14:14.490
Notice how these more recent
definitions are a lot broader,

02:14:14.490 --> 02:14:15.790
right?

02:14:15.790 --> 02:14:18.180
There's no specific
reference to guns.

02:14:18.180 --> 02:14:21.610
"Any activity designed to thwart
German plans, or perceived

02:14:21.610 --> 02:14:24.990
by the occupiers as working
against their interest".

02:14:24.990 --> 02:14:29.850
"Any group action consciously
taken in opposition to known

02:14:29.850 --> 02:14:32.630
or surmise laws,
actions or intentions,

02:14:32.630 --> 02:14:36.800
directed against the Jews by the
Germans and their supporters".

02:14:36.800 --> 02:14:41.070
Now, the definition I use,
and I will be referring

02:14:41.070 --> 02:14:45.610
to as I discuss the Armenian
case is the following,

02:14:45.610 --> 02:14:48.760
"actions carried out illegally,

02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:50.980
or against the authorities'
will,

02:14:50.980 --> 02:14:54.870
to save Armenian deportees
from annihilation".

02:14:54.870 --> 02:14:56.430
Again, there's no
reference to weapons,

02:14:56.430 --> 02:14:58.280
it could be any kind of action.

02:14:58.280 --> 02:15:03.400
And I will be giving examples
of a number of effective forms

02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:07.650
of resistance that do
not employ weapons.

02:15:07.650 --> 02:15:11.680
Again, it does not
make a big, you know,

02:15:11.680 --> 02:15:12.980
Hollywood movie, right?

02:15:12.980 --> 02:15:16.570
When you're not, you know, just
shooting and blowing up people,

02:15:16.570 --> 02:15:20.830
but it's, again, it's important
to realize that what kind

02:15:20.830 --> 02:15:22.820
of like, you know, the
small, the tiny sliver

02:15:22.820 --> 02:15:25.360
of people have access
to weapons and the fact

02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:29.210
that we cannot dismiss everybody
else, as people who just went

02:15:29.210 --> 02:15:30.980
to their death like
sheep, right?

02:15:30.980 --> 02:15:34.290
Which is something that is
commonly used both in --

02:15:34.290 --> 02:15:39.580
by many in any reference to
genocide and mass violence.

02:15:39.580 --> 02:15:43.390
Now, this is one example.

02:15:43.390 --> 02:15:48.140
I started my talk by
referencing Reverend Ascijan,

02:15:48.140 --> 02:15:52.170
who was assisting Armenian
deportees in Aleppo

02:15:52.170 --> 02:15:53.960
as they started arriving
from all

02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:55.600
over the Ottoman Empire
during the deportations

02:15:55.600 --> 02:15:58.400
of the massacres.

02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:02.030
This was -- he was just
one example of out of many.

02:16:02.030 --> 02:16:04.280
The three Armenian
churches in Aleppo --

02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:07.710
the Armenian community in Aleppo
was not deported at this point,

02:16:07.710 --> 02:16:12.710
and only part of it would
eventually be deported later on.

02:16:12.710 --> 02:16:17.560
So, all three Armenian churches
formed there, formed committees

02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:20.670
to provide assistance and relief

02:16:20.670 --> 02:16:24.370
to the Armenian deportees
arriving in Aleppo.

02:16:24.370 --> 02:16:26.710
One of these committees
was headed

02:16:26.710 --> 02:16:29.020
by father Haroutyun Yessayan.

02:16:29.020 --> 02:16:34.260
This was a committee of the
Armenian prelisty of Aleppo,

02:16:34.260 --> 02:16:38.570
and it included a
number of dignitaries

02:16:38.570 --> 02:16:43.200
of the Aleppo Armenian
community.

02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:45.170
Now, what did this committee do?

02:16:45.170 --> 02:16:49.050
They mobilized tremendous
resources

02:16:49.050 --> 02:16:52.970
and prepared detailed
reports about the deportees

02:16:52.970 --> 02:16:56.540
who are arriving, in
order to best assist them.

02:16:56.540 --> 02:17:01.110
Initially, there was no
government opposition

02:17:01.110 --> 02:17:03.410
to what they were doing.

02:17:03.410 --> 02:17:06.600
The Ottoman authorities --
and I argue this in my work,

02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:13.000
we're dealing with other things,
and the local governor of Aleppo

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:14.960
who was very friendly
to Armenians

02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:17.090
and he was actually
supporting these efforts.

02:17:17.090 --> 02:17:21.900
Now, this committee met
every single day almost

02:17:21.900 --> 02:17:25.970
and we have the minutes of these
meetings, which is essentially

02:17:25.970 --> 02:17:29.410
like having a camera
in the city of Aleppo

02:17:29.410 --> 02:17:32.400
as these deportees are
arriving the degree of detail

02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:37.440
that you see here, these are
samples of a few of the minutes

02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:39.960
of the meetings, is tremendous.

02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:46.330
Now, what they did they
also prepared lists

02:17:46.330 --> 02:17:50.510
of every single item that
was purchased in order

02:17:50.510 --> 02:17:56.250
to assist these deportees
who are arriving in Syria.

02:17:56.250 --> 02:17:59.140
We're talking about wood, we're
talking about food supplies,

02:17:59.140 --> 02:18:02.480
bribes that were given
to Jandarmes and others.

02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:07.890
Every single, you know,
Turkish lira, every single dime

02:18:07.890 --> 02:18:12.370
that was spent is documented for
throughout the war in a couple

02:18:12.370 --> 02:18:15.960
of ledgers of, as I
said, tremendous detail.

02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:24.380
Not only that, but every single
receipt has been kept so,

02:18:24.380 --> 02:18:29.560
you can imagine this offers
us a universe of information

02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:31.640
and knowledge that really
allows us to look at this

02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:36.360
from the perspective of
the victims, mind you in --

02:18:36.360 --> 02:18:38.490
as the genocide is unfolding.

02:18:38.490 --> 02:18:42.730
Now, it's important to note

02:18:42.730 --> 02:18:47.030
that these efforts were
initially supported

02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:49.180
by the local authorities.

02:18:49.180 --> 02:18:51.390
Eventually this would
not be the case.

02:18:51.390 --> 02:18:52.690
So, these actions,

02:18:52.690 --> 02:18:56.490
these humanitarian
actions would soon morph --

02:18:56.490 --> 02:19:00.890
change into humanitarian
resistance, as the central

02:19:00.890 --> 02:19:03.110
and local authorities
start cracking

02:19:03.110 --> 02:19:06.560
down on this humanitarian
effort, start arresting some

02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:11.560
of its members and its leaders
and trying to stop these efforts

02:19:11.560 --> 02:19:14.640
to assist Armenian deportees.

02:19:14.640 --> 02:19:20.220
And notice, this is when I
argue this becomes resistance,

02:19:20.220 --> 02:19:22.310
because at this point
you are doing it

02:19:22.310 --> 02:19:26.320
against the will
of the authorities.

02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:31.690
Now, it's important to note
that since this is an effort

02:19:31.690 --> 02:19:35.730
that is unarmed resistance,
we see more

02:19:35.730 --> 02:19:40.910
and more women involved,
in important ways.

02:19:40.910 --> 02:19:44.630
This is one example
Nora Altoumyan was --

02:19:44.630 --> 02:19:48.180
helped administer an
orphanage in Aleppo

02:19:48.180 --> 02:19:52.710
and she played a key role in in
providing assistance and help

02:19:52.710 --> 02:19:55.230
to many old friends whose
parents were killed during the

02:19:55.230 --> 02:19:56.530
deportation massacres.

02:19:56.530 --> 02:19:59.100
And now so, this is -- she's

02:19:59.100 --> 02:20:02.040
in the picture here,
just see it center --

02:20:02.040 --> 02:20:05.480
But there are many
other examples.

02:20:05.480 --> 02:20:08.400
Another important fact
that I noticed in many

02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:16.240
of these documents accounts, is
that the farther away you went,

02:20:16.240 --> 02:20:19.170
one went from the
organized community,

02:20:19.170 --> 02:20:22.390
the greater the role
of women became.

02:20:22.390 --> 02:20:27.400
In many ways, as the Armenian
community itself was very

02:20:27.400 --> 02:20:30.380
patriarchal in structure,
these committees were headed

02:20:30.380 --> 02:20:33.230
by priests, and I mean
women could not --

02:20:33.230 --> 02:20:35.650
I mean, just as a basic
statement here, right?

02:20:35.650 --> 02:20:38.580
So, as you can imagine,
you know, again,

02:20:38.580 --> 02:20:40.860
still although Armenian
were very active in Aleppo

02:20:40.860 --> 02:20:42.930
and helping deportees.

02:20:42.930 --> 02:20:46.420
But the farther away one
went in Syria into places

02:20:46.420 --> 02:20:48.510
where the communities did not
have that kind of influence,

02:20:48.510 --> 02:20:51.540
or into places that the
community did not have that kind

02:20:51.540 --> 02:20:54.640
of access -- and I will
give an example of this,

02:20:54.640 --> 02:20:57.230
the more you saw women
playing a more important

02:20:57.230 --> 02:21:02.090
and prominent role in this
effort to resist, in this effort

02:21:02.090 --> 02:21:06.960
to engage in actions against
the world of the authorities.

02:21:06.960 --> 02:21:13.170
Now, humanitarian resistance
provided humanitarian assistance

02:21:13.170 --> 02:21:19.030
to deportees was not the only
way in which Armenians resisted.

02:21:19.030 --> 02:21:22.940
Another, a few other
important forms are have to do

02:21:22.940 --> 02:21:27.490
with information, with
communicating and communication.

02:21:27.490 --> 02:21:31.550
Communicating information
about what is going on,

02:21:31.550 --> 02:21:35.730
both among the Armenian
deportees themselves,

02:21:35.730 --> 02:21:40.250
and from the Armenian world
into the world at large,

02:21:40.250 --> 02:21:46.050
in order to inform
newspapers, diplomats, consuls

02:21:46.050 --> 02:21:49.310
and beyond the Ottoman Empire,
politicians and world leaders

02:21:49.310 --> 02:21:52.480
about the plight of the
Armenian population.

02:21:52.480 --> 02:21:55.910
And again, all of this
was done against the will

02:21:55.910 --> 02:22:01.000
of the authorities and
secretly as one can imagine,

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:04.070
and often those who were caught,

02:22:04.070 --> 02:22:09.140
arrested were imprisoned
or killed.

02:22:09.140 --> 02:22:13.030
Now, I will give two
examples of this.

02:22:13.030 --> 02:22:20.370
One is this image that you have
on the right, it is a photograph

02:22:20.370 --> 02:22:26.580
of a handwritten newspaper in
one of the concentration camps

02:22:26.580 --> 02:22:30.470
where Armenians were interned
during the Armenian side.

02:22:30.470 --> 02:22:36.700
It is from Messghana
where, you know, you have,

02:22:36.700 --> 02:22:40.060
at certain points, thousands
of the deportees crammed

02:22:40.060 --> 02:22:44.250
in this area, where
daily dozens --

02:22:44.250 --> 02:22:46.990
sometimes a few hundred people
are dying of starvation,

02:22:46.990 --> 02:22:49.360
disease and deprivation.

02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:54.530
And alongside food and
supplies and medicine,

02:22:54.530 --> 02:23:00.990
a very important need for a lot
of these people is information.

02:23:00.990 --> 02:23:03.790
They want to know
what is going on.

02:23:03.790 --> 02:23:06.040
They cannot really -- they
don't have the option of going

02:23:06.040 --> 02:23:09.110
out of these camps, these camps
are very well protected by --

02:23:09.110 --> 02:23:12.370
again, are guarded by
Jandarmes and guards

02:23:12.370 --> 02:23:14.410
in the inside, on the inside.

02:23:14.410 --> 02:23:20.870
Their only way of acquiring
information is new convoys

02:23:20.870 --> 02:23:25.320
that are arriving into the
camp a few times a week,

02:23:25.320 --> 02:23:28.750
sometimes daily, new
convoys of deportees.

02:23:28.750 --> 02:23:31.110
And there are these
individuals who would go

02:23:31.110 --> 02:23:34.530
and ask these people what
they saw, who has survived,

02:23:34.530 --> 02:23:35.950
what has happened in
the different parts

02:23:35.950 --> 02:23:37.250
of the Ottoman Empire,

02:23:37.250 --> 02:23:39.990
where they have been
and write them down.

02:23:39.990 --> 02:23:42.250
And these little
pieces of paper --

02:23:42.250 --> 02:23:46.840
and this is one surviving
sample of it, and then pass

02:23:46.840 --> 02:23:50.490
that around among the
camp's population.

02:23:50.490 --> 02:23:56.160
Now, the other example that
I would like to highlight has

02:23:56.160 --> 02:24:02.040
to do with providing the
West, particularly Europeans

02:24:02.040 --> 02:24:04.920
and Americans with
information about what is going

02:24:04.920 --> 02:24:07.140
on in the Ottoman
empire as the destruction

02:24:07.140 --> 02:24:09.570
of the Armenian population
is in progress.

02:24:09.570 --> 02:24:15.470
In the city of Istanbul
itself, there were most

02:24:15.470 --> 02:24:18.750
of the intellectuals as
we know were arrested,

02:24:18.750 --> 02:24:21.270
beginning in April, 1915.

02:24:21.270 --> 02:24:24.830
Some of those who were not
and managed to escape and went

02:24:24.830 --> 02:24:28.570
into hiding actually formed
a committee that was tasked

02:24:28.570 --> 02:24:32.830
with gathering the
information from the provinces

02:24:32.830 --> 02:24:38.650
of what is going on, and
smuggling this information,

02:24:38.650 --> 02:24:41.340
oftentimes on the sides
of printed newspapers

02:24:41.340 --> 02:24:46.590
with invisible ink, etcetera,
into Europe for publication

02:24:46.590 --> 02:24:49.920
in the newspapers there
and also for the diplomats

02:24:49.920 --> 02:24:51.760
and politicians to
have access to.

02:24:51.760 --> 02:24:57.460
This was a tremendous effort,
and a lot of these letters

02:24:57.460 --> 02:25:01.260
and texts have been recorded
and have been published,

02:25:01.260 --> 02:25:03.980
and it really indicates
the phenomenal work

02:25:03.980 --> 02:25:05.990
that was being done in
terms of information

02:25:05.990 --> 02:25:08.480
and communicating
what is going on,

02:25:08.480 --> 02:25:12.900
as a form of resisting
oppression and destruction.

02:25:12.900 --> 02:25:20.160
Now, an additional example of
resistance, unarmed resistance,

02:25:20.160 --> 02:25:26.690
was the effort to save
as many Armenian writers

02:25:26.690 --> 02:25:33.070
and intellectuals as possible,
particularly by two brothers,

02:25:33.070 --> 02:25:38.850
the Mazloumian brothers who
owned the famous Hotel Baron

02:25:38.850 --> 02:25:41.110
in the city of Aleppo.

02:25:41.110 --> 02:25:45.240
Hotel Baron is one of the
landmarks, historic landmarks

02:25:45.240 --> 02:25:50.520
of Aleppo it's a number
of prominent figures,

02:25:50.520 --> 02:25:53.630
prominent historical
events have taken place,

02:25:53.630 --> 02:25:57.910
prominent figures have
stayed there, and as I said,

02:25:57.910 --> 02:25:59.210
a significant landmark.

02:25:59.210 --> 02:26:03.320
And the two brothers who owned
the hotel actually use their

02:26:03.320 --> 02:26:06.900
connections and access
in order to help,

02:26:06.900 --> 02:26:11.520
save and assist Armenian
intellectuals

02:26:11.520 --> 02:26:15.440
with the realization that
since this was an onslaught

02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:17.060
on Armenian identity
and culture.

02:26:17.060 --> 02:26:20.900
One of the important
ways to fight back

02:26:20.900 --> 02:26:24.750
and keep the culture thriving is

02:26:24.750 --> 02:26:30.270
through assisting the
who are upholding it.

02:26:30.270 --> 02:26:35.240
Now, there are many ways,

02:26:35.240 --> 02:26:40.350
as I approach some
general concluding remarks,

02:26:40.350 --> 02:26:42.150
there are many ways
in which we can think

02:26:42.150 --> 02:26:44.540
about individual agency.

02:26:44.540 --> 02:26:50.130
It's important to note
that not every individual

02:26:50.130 --> 02:26:55.590
who is subjected to this
onslaught, this, you know,

02:26:55.590 --> 02:27:03.130
I used the image of an avalanche
earlier, will resist by taking

02:27:03.130 --> 02:27:06.700
up arms, or will resist at all.

02:27:06.700 --> 02:27:10.180
But most people will
exercise agency,

02:27:10.180 --> 02:27:15.410
most people if not all people
will do something to survive.

02:27:15.410 --> 02:27:18.270
And it's important
to highlight this.

02:27:18.270 --> 02:27:20.400
Whether it's through
humanitarian resistance,

02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:23.140
whether it's through medical
resistance, whether it's

02:27:23.140 --> 02:27:24.790
through trying to
figure out ways

02:27:24.790 --> 02:27:27.910
to survive one additional day,

02:27:27.910 --> 02:27:30.150
individuals will
exercise agency.

02:27:30.150 --> 02:27:34.830
And when we tell the
story of mass violence,

02:27:34.830 --> 02:27:38.560
when we tell the story of
genocide it is important

02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:41.400
to think about it
in the same manner.

02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:47.650
If we ask the average
individual, average person

02:27:47.650 --> 02:27:50.490
to describe what happened
during the Holocaust

02:27:50.490 --> 02:27:53.080
in a few sentences,

02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:56.490
the description will
probably go something like,

02:27:56.490 --> 02:28:01.060
"this many Jews were
killed by the Nazis"

02:28:01.060 --> 02:28:04.440
and make some references
to certain locations,

02:28:04.440 --> 02:28:06.800
concentration camps,
death by bullets

02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:08.740
and other important
salient aspects

02:28:08.740 --> 02:28:12.410
that we know about
the Holocaust.

02:28:12.410 --> 02:28:17.050
Very little will that
description have and hold

02:28:17.050 --> 02:28:20.570
about the resistance
of the victims.

02:28:20.570 --> 02:28:25.190
And in fact, almost -- there
will be almost no reference

02:28:25.190 --> 02:28:29.790
to any unarmed resistance
by the victims.

02:28:29.790 --> 02:28:35.750
Now, the very intention of
genocide perpetrators is

02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:38.700
to erase the agency
of the victims.

02:28:38.700 --> 02:28:41.160
It's the ultimate for of
you raising the agency

02:28:41.160 --> 02:28:43.100
of the victims.

02:28:43.100 --> 02:28:46.830
And inadvertently,
whether we are historians

02:28:46.830 --> 02:28:49.770
or anybody discussing
whether we're dealing

02:28:49.770 --> 02:28:52.830
in public discourse as
newspaper, as journalists,

02:28:52.830 --> 02:29:01.130
and as writers and as editors,
when we describe crimes

02:29:01.130 --> 02:29:04.230
and mass violence
in this manner,

02:29:04.230 --> 02:29:09.230
when we are inadvertently
emphasizing the very thing

02:29:09.230 --> 02:29:12.920
that the perpetrator
wanted to accomplish,

02:29:12.920 --> 02:29:17.250
which is erasing the agency
and the voice of the victims.

02:29:17.250 --> 02:29:22.800
It's important to
realize this asymmetry.

02:29:22.800 --> 02:29:24.910
It's important, yes,
to understand

02:29:24.910 --> 02:29:30.370
that the Nazis held tremendous
power, and no matter what kind

02:29:30.370 --> 02:29:33.970
of resistance one engaged in,
it was very unlikely for it

02:29:33.970 --> 02:29:39.060
to change things on a
tremendous, massive level as far

02:29:39.060 --> 02:29:41.780
as the targeted population
was concerned.

02:29:41.780 --> 02:29:46.850
Still, though, it's important
to think about these acts

02:29:46.850 --> 02:29:49.370
of resilience --
resistance and resilience.

02:29:49.370 --> 02:29:54.850
Not just in terms of success
rates, not just in terms

02:29:54.850 --> 02:29:57.870
of how many people were killed,
how many Nazis were killed,

02:29:57.870 --> 02:30:03.430
how many Jandarmes were killed,
but also to think about them

02:30:03.430 --> 02:30:08.470
in terms of upholding
the dignity of the people

02:30:08.470 --> 02:30:13.190
who are caught in this
avalanche, and in terms

02:30:13.190 --> 02:30:18.800
of really telling their story
as part of the narrative.

02:30:18.800 --> 02:30:21.280
And this I think
is an important --

02:30:21.280 --> 02:30:25.760
this goes to the core of how
we think about mass violence,

02:30:25.760 --> 02:30:31.500
violence and even violence
in our societies, emphasizing

02:30:31.500 --> 02:30:33.860
and focusing on the perpetrator

02:30:33.860 --> 02:30:38.820
and not really emphasizing
what the victim did often is

02:30:38.820 --> 02:30:40.250
well intentioned.

02:30:40.250 --> 02:30:45.000
It tries -- our attempt is to
show the victims as abject --

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:49.020
helpless, absolutely
helpless, and therefore as if

02:30:49.020 --> 02:30:51.530
to make the crime look worse

02:30:51.530 --> 02:30:54.910
and more horrendous
and more horrible.

02:30:54.910 --> 02:30:57.380
But as I said, we are
-- what we are engaging

02:30:57.380 --> 02:31:01.770
in is inadvertently
silencing the victims further.

02:31:01.770 --> 02:31:03.320
This is very true in
the Armenian case,

02:31:03.320 --> 02:31:04.680
as well as in a number of cases.

02:31:04.680 --> 02:31:08.840
Again, the narrative of
absolutely helpless victims,

02:31:08.840 --> 02:31:16.550
almost no agency and a state
that is using all the resources

02:31:16.550 --> 02:31:20.850
at its disposal to
annihilate them is one

02:31:20.850 --> 02:31:22.970
that compelling,
but it's not true.

02:31:22.970 --> 02:31:28.070
It's not true, it's ahistoric
and it defeats the purpose.

02:31:28.070 --> 02:31:31.000
The other aspect that's
important to notice that, again,

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:32.820
often because of in order

02:31:32.820 --> 02:31:36.980
to make certain narratives more
appealing to a broader audience,

02:31:36.980 --> 02:31:40.100
the emphasis on the
humanitarianism and the work

02:31:40.100 --> 02:31:43.070
and the resistance of
groups and individuals

02:31:43.070 --> 02:31:45.750
who are not members
of the victim group.

02:31:45.750 --> 02:31:48.720
For example, in the Armenian
case we talk about the role

02:31:48.720 --> 02:31:51.550
that the missionaries
played in helping

02:31:51.550 --> 02:31:54.150
and assisting the deportees.

02:31:54.150 --> 02:31:59.330
We talk about the role that
American diplomats played

02:31:59.330 --> 02:32:02.930
in the years of deportations
and in the years that followed,

02:32:02.930 --> 02:32:05.060
the huge amount of money that
were raised in this country

02:32:05.060 --> 02:32:08.240
to assist the deportees, and
the survivors of the genocide.

02:32:08.240 --> 02:32:10.240
Now, ultimately, though,

02:32:10.240 --> 02:32:17.990
as these massacres were taking
place, no American diplomat,

02:32:17.990 --> 02:32:25.330
no missionary was able to
access these deportees.

02:32:26.950 --> 02:32:32.010
So, yes, tremendous amounts
of funds were raised,

02:32:32.010 --> 02:32:34.580
but the individuals
were risking their lives

02:32:34.580 --> 02:32:41.110
on the ground were more often
than not Armenians themselves.

02:32:41.110 --> 02:32:45.870
More often than not
without weapons.

02:32:45.870 --> 02:32:50.880
Again, it is important as we
highlight the important elements

02:32:50.880 --> 02:32:54.300
of mass violence and the
importance of humanitarianism,

02:32:54.300 --> 02:32:58.570
global humanitarianism -- and
again, a lot of this has plenty

02:32:58.570 --> 02:33:01.630
of implications on
our day today.

02:33:01.630 --> 02:33:05.580
It's important to realize
that we are at best

02:33:05.580 --> 02:33:07.200
when we are supporting
and look --

02:33:07.200 --> 02:33:10.200
any group, any community
in any part of the world.

02:33:10.200 --> 02:33:13.850
At the best, no matter how much
assistance we're providing.

02:33:13.850 --> 02:33:15.890
What we are doing
is to complement

02:33:15.890 --> 02:33:18.540
and support the important
and significant role

02:33:18.540 --> 02:33:23.530
that the locals are playing on
the ground against all odds.

02:33:23.530 --> 02:33:25.480
So, I want to leave you
with a couple of thoughts.

02:33:25.480 --> 02:33:27.870
Can one define the resistance
simply by one's access

02:33:27.870 --> 02:33:31.400
to training in and
willingness to use guns?

02:33:31.400 --> 02:33:33.970
Is resistance ineffective, even
impossible without a machine

02:33:33.970 --> 02:33:36.940
that employs gunpowder to
propel pieces of metal?

02:33:36.940 --> 02:33:38.860
The study of resistance during
the Armenian Genocide leaves

02:33:38.860 --> 02:33:40.160
much to be desired.

02:33:40.160 --> 02:33:41.620
The struggle against
genocide denial has produced

02:33:41.620 --> 02:33:44.800
and perpetuated
perpetrator-centric narratives,

02:33:44.800 --> 02:33:47.810
it was genocide, here's
why, and the related drive

02:33:47.810 --> 02:33:49.110
for genocide recognition

02:33:49.110 --> 02:33:50.700
around the globe has
produced Western humanitarian

02:33:50.700 --> 02:33:52.190
centric narratives.

02:33:52.190 --> 02:33:54.590
Your ancestors witnessed
it, saved Armenians,

02:33:54.590 --> 02:33:55.890
now you should recognize it.

02:33:55.890 --> 02:33:59.050
Thus, the action is genocide,
the reaction is Western outrage

02:33:59.050 --> 02:34:04.410
and humanitarianism, while the
victims exercised no agency.

02:34:04.410 --> 02:34:06.030
Treating genocide
largely as an action

02:34:06.030 --> 02:34:08.330
of the perpetrator while
dismissing the reaction

02:34:08.330 --> 02:34:11.270
of the victim is not
only ahistorical,

02:34:11.270 --> 02:34:15.520
but inadvertently reinforces the
very attempt of the perpetrator

02:34:15.520 --> 02:34:19.800
to strip the victims of
their voice and agency.

02:34:19.800 --> 02:34:21.600
Thank you very much.

02:34:21.600 --> 02:34:27.070
[ Applause ]

02:34:27.070 --> 02:34:29.590
&gt;&gt; Thank You Patrick.

02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:33.590
It's been an enlightening
morning session --

02:34:33.590 --> 02:34:36.870
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
