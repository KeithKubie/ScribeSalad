00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.600
So, Charlie, what's your
greatest fear? 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.420
Well, Charlie, I'd have to say
that my greatest fear is death. 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.390
Oh...is that what you're
going to talk about? 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.870
Yeah, yeah it is. 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.090
Okay. I'll leave you to it. 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.290
It's not a particularly original fear,
sorry about that, 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.740
but, you know, that's not
really how it works, is it?

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.010
You don't pick the most interesting thing to--
I'm afraid of guacamole. Ohh! 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.400
Oh, you're so quirky you and your--
no I'm just afraid of what I'm afraid of. 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.690
For something like guacamole,
if you are genuinely afraid of guacamole, 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.870
by the way, I'm sorry for
making light of your fears, 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.850
but if you are afraid of guacamole,
it's not the worst thing in the world 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.640
because you can always just like, you know,
not go to Mexican restaurants. 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.370
Guacamole isn't inevitable.
It's not gonna take you in the night. 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.320
I don't know why the idea of a Guacamole
Grim Reaper is so funny to me, but it just is. 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.230
But death-- 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.930
(LAUGHTER)

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.770
Oh no! Guacamole--

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.980
Nobody else thinks that is as
funny as I do, I'm sure of it. 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.340
But death, right,
death is inevitable. 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.500
There's nothing that I can do about the fact
that one day I'm am gonna die.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.100
It would be useful if I believed
in any kind of afterlife, I don't, 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.440
so my fate, I think, is gonna
be the big nothing, 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:32.060
the big, black, dark void of
no consciousness, of no anything, 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.990
and that is what terrifies me. 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.190
That void is the only thing
in my life, at the moment, 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.070
that really makes me
want to poo my pants. 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.640
Given that I can't really help
how I feel, what do I do? 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.450
Honestly, the first
thing I go to is, 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.680
"Well, you never know. 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.770
Technology these days, in 20 or 30 years,
they could have done immortality. 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.610
We could all live forever.
Wouldn't that be lovely?" 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.350
No, it wouldn't. 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.540
For one thing, Earth is kind of
reaching capacity anyway right now, 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.230
and I'm pretty sure if some
scientist invented immortality, 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.310
most people would
want a piece of that, 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.310
and I think that might
result in too many humans, 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.660
which would be a
big problem. 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.050
And there's also the
factor of, at some point, 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.270
the universe is going
to end, so you will die. 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.720
Like you can't exist if there's
no place for you to exist in. 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.020
After that, I think, "Well if I am going
to die, at least I can live forever 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.700
in the memories of the
people who love me, right?"

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.520
No. Even if you did the coolest thing
that anyone has ever done ever, 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.150
the people who remember you,
they're gonna die as well. 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.620
Everyone is gonna die. 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.740
No one is gonna be around to remember
anyone eventually, so...(SIGH) 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.230
then what makes me feel
better, weirdly enough, 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.020
is thinking about my funeral,
my fantasy funeral. 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.800
I'm aware of the fact that
this is not gonna happen, 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.850
but, ideally, I'd kinda like my body
to be shot into the sun. 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.410
I don't know. I just really like idea of
all of my friends and family, you know, 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.760
sitting around, wearing black, being somber,
my mum with a little tear in her eye-- 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.180
I died before my mum did, oh! 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.800
But everyone, you know, just hanging out in a
graveyard, looking up at a giant rocket 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.610
and then seeing that rocket being shot
into a boiling hot ball of plasma. 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.950
That would just be
awesome, wouldn't it? 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.460
Realistically, though, what can
you do with a fear of death? 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.380
If there's one thing I've learned
about being scared over the years, 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.210
given that I am YouTube's
resident expert on the topic, 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.980
it's that if you are afraid of something,
it means that thing is pretty important.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.110
And what's important to me it's,
you know, it's obvious, really. 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.990
It's living the fullest and
best life I possibly can, 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.070
making the most of the time
I have left on this planet 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.270
so that when I finally am
on my deathbed, 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.790
I can look back at everything
I've done and be like, 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.980
"Yeah, pretty good job.
Well done, Charlie. That's it." 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.110
And then, you know, black
void of nothingness.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.000
Anyway...um...that's what I've
been thinking about recently.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.160
See you next week. Lol.
That's not going to happen.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.630
Don't even. I'll be around.
Don't you worry about me. 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.050
STEPHEN FRY VOICE: You've just had the almost
imponderable joy of watching charlieissocoollike,

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.780
which makes you, like, cool.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.670
TOY WINDING

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.010
NERF GUN BEING SHOT

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.690
NERF GUN STOPS SHOOTING

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.330
So worth it.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.490
The fear is probably
worse for me-- 

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.210
Jesus, I'm making another video
about something I'm scared of.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.540
Just, let's just get on
with it, shall we? 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.470
What's your greatest
fear, Charlie?

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.220
Uh...I guess my favorite-- 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.150
(LAUGHING) My favorite fear?
My favorite fear?

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.768
My all time favorite fear--
