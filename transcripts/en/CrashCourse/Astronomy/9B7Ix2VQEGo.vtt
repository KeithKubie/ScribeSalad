00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.680
What is the nature of the Universe?

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.030
How’s that for a question? For a long time
we humans had no idea what was going on in

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.589
the Universe. To help, we made up stories
to either help us explain what we saw, or

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.080
to make us feel better about what we didn’t
understand.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.640
But then science came along, and we started
to understand more. We could test our ideas,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.550
and as we got more confident in the process,
our ideas grew. The field of cosmology was

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.910
born, the study of the cosmos itself. And
now, after centuries of speculation and just-so-stories,

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.219
we’re starting to get a grasp on the biggest
ideas there are.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.420
What is the nature of the Universe? Let’s
find out.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.540
By the turn of the 20th century, scientists
knew the Earth was old. Darwin’s Theory

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.760
of Evolution strongly implied the Earth was
at least millions of years old, and Lord Kelvin,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.339
a hugely respected physicist and engineer,
confirmed the Earth was ancient, given that

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.480
it must have cooled from an initially molten
state. That takes a while, at least a million years.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.140
How old exactly, no one knew. As for the Universe
itself, it logically must be as old or older

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.860
than Earth. A popular model for the Universe
was that it was static: It is and always has

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.420
been as we see it now, and in general hasn’t
changed. Stars may be born and they may die,

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.950
but overall things pretty much stayed in balance.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.950
The Universe always existed, always will,
always had galaxies in it, and so on. There

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.700
are variations on this idea, but that’s it in a nutshell,
and it’s what many astronomers believed.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.360
This is important. When we try to understand
observations in astronomy, we fit them into

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.980
a framework of understanding, things we think
we already know. When something doesn’t

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.180
fit, it’s a problem. Maybe the observation
is wrong, or maybe we’re misinterpreting it.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.020
Or maybe the framework is wrong! That’s
a big step to undertake, and needs proper

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.560
contemplation and skepticism. Science is a
tapestry, and when you yank at one thread,

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.810
the whole thing may need reweaving.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.450
Sometimes – rarely, but sometimes – you
have to yank that thread.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.730
The thread that got pulled in this picture
was first uncovered in 1912. That was when

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.980
astronomer Vesto Slipher — who has the uncontested
coolest name for an astronomer ever — started

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.079
taking spectra of the so-called “spiral
nebulae”, hoping to get some insight on

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.800
their characteristics (remember, this was
before we understood what galaxies actually were).

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.239
It took him several years of observations,
but by 1917 he had observed 25 of them…

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.819
and he found something astonishing. When he
examined their spectra, he saw that almost

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.139
all of them were highly redshifted. In other
words, it looked like most of these objects

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.859
were rushing away from us at high speed, millions
of kilometers per hour!

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.000
What could that mean?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.579
At this point, two different lines of work
began to converge. One was by a Belgian theoretical

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.060
physicist named Georges Lemaître. In the
1920s he had been studying Albert Einstein’s

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.680
work, the equations dealing with the behavior
of the Universe as a whole. Einstein had concluded

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.409
that the Universe was static, unchanging,
but Lemaîtres disagreed. He found that an

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.739
expanding or contracting Universe fit the
equations better — and, given the redshifts

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.650
observed by Slipher, he proposed the the Universe
itself was getting bigger, which is why the

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.750
galaxies appeared to be moving away from us.
Another brilliant physicist, Alexander Friedmann,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.680
had also reached the same conclusion.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.939
At the same time, astronomers were trying
to determine the distances to the nebulae,

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.889
now understood to be galaxies in their own
right. As I mentioned in our first episode

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:32.730
about galaxies, Edwin Hubble and his assistant
Milton Humason were at the forefront of this.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.840
They observed variable stars in the Andromeda Galaxy
that allowed them to get the distance to the galaxy.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.359
They then observed some of the same galaxies
Slipher did, and measured their distances.

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.489
When they compared distances to the redshifts
Slipher observed, they found that the farther

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.919
away the galaxy was, the faster it was moving
away from us.

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:54.980
Let me repeat that, because it’s kind of
important: The farther away a galaxy was,

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.379
the FASTER it appeared to recede from us.

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.919
Some other astronomers had also found similar
results, but the work Hubble and Humason clinched

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:07.639
it. We now know it to be true for every distant
galaxy we observe: They are all redshifted,

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.220
all heading away from us.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.540
And this ties into what Lemaîtres had concluded:
the Universe is expanding.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.380
Wait, what? The Universe is getting bigger.
How can that be? What does that even mean?

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.410
There are lots of different ways of looking
at this. Lemaîtres himself suggested imagining

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.569
the cosmic clock running backwards. Right
now, as time inexorably marches on, all the

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:31.060
galaxies in the sky are getting farther and
farther away from us. But that means that

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.750
in the past they were closer together. Run
the clock back far enough, and they get closer

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.530
and closer together until at some point in
the past everything in the entire universe

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.090
was crammed together into an über-dense…thing.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.710
That is a really, really weird thought. It’s
hard to imagine everything in the whole cosmos

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.490
– every star, nebula, galaxy; every atom,
electron, and proton – all squeezed together

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.280
into one infinitely dense blob. But that’s
what the observations are telling us.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.980
Lemaîtres called this a “primeval atom,” or, more
colorfully, the “cosmic egg.” Fair enough.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.960
But this has implications. If you squeeze
all the energy everywhere into one place,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.919
that place is going to be HOT. When the Universe
was a tiny dot it would’ve been unimaginably,

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:21.419
hellishly hot. Then, for some reason, it suddenly
expanded violently and started cooling.

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:26.389
This sounds an awful lot like an explosion
– BANG! - involving the entire Universe,

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:31.050
which is big. What else would you call this
but “the Big Bang”? In fact, the term

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.819
became popular when astronomer Fred Hoyle
used it on a radio show, and later in a widely-read

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:40.419
magazine article. Ironically, he meant it
somewhat disparagingly, since he didn’t

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.799
think the Big Bang model was correct. To his,
and many other astronomers’, chagrin, the name stuck.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.389
I like it. It’s not perfectly accurate,
but it’s succinct.

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:54.210
Again, this is all pretty strange, and astronomers
had a hard time accepting it. After all, it

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.599
went against everything they thought was true
at the time!

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:00.620
In science, though, a hypothesis needs to
make testable predictions before it can be

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.700
taken seriously. What predictions could the
Big Bang model of the Universe make that we

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.099
can observe today?

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:11.980
The speed of light is fast: 300,000 kilometers
per second, or about a billion kilometers per hour.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.720
Like I said, fast.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.460
But not infinitely fast.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.409
The Sun is 150 million kilometers away. It
takes light about 8 minutes to reach the Earth,

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:24.319
so in a sense you’re seeing the Sun as it
was 8 minutes ago. The nearest star system

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:30.139
to us is Alpha Centauri, 4.3 light years away,
so we see it as it was 4.3 years ago.

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:35.009
The Andromeda galaxy is about 2.5 million
light years away. The light we see from it

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:38.689
now left that galaxy when Australopithecus
walked the Earth.

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:42.870
The farther away something is, the farther
in the past we see it. This is called the

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.330
“lookback time”, and it’s a crucial
tool for cosmology: By observing very distant

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.270
objects, we can see the Universe when it was
young!

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.169
You might think that we could see all the
way back to the moment of the Big Bang, but

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:58.430
there’s a problem. At some point back in
time, the Universe was so hot and dense that

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.890
it was the same temperature as the surface
of a star. It would’ve been very luminous,

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.360
but also opaque!

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:09.330
As it expanded, it cooled, and became transparent.
If we look back far enough, that moment in

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.280
time when it cleared up is as far back as
we can see. What does that moment look like?

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.500
By looking at the physics of the Big Bang
— the math that describes how matter, energy,

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.560
space, and time behave — astronomers could
predict when this moment happened in the lifetime

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:28.099
of the Universe: a few hundred thousand years
after the bang itself.

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:32.259
Using the idea of lookback time, they could
predict how far away it would be from us,

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:36.990
and therefore calculate its redshift. Remember,
redshift stretches the wavelength of light.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.110
The light the Universe emitted at the time
would’ve been like a star, in the visible

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:45.240
part of the electromagnetic spectrum, but
the light that reaches us billions of years

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.400
later — now —should be redshifted into
microwave wavelengths.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.689
In 1965, a pair of radio astronomers announced
they had found a signal in their radio telescope

00:07:54.689 --> 00:07:59.479
that was like a background noise, coming from
everywhere in the sky. They tried everything

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:04.169
they could to explain it — including scraping
out the bird poop inside their radio telescope,

00:08:04.169 --> 00:08:08.090
in case that might be causing it — but the
only thing that made sense was that this was

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:12.699
indeed the redshifted light from the early
Universe. They had discovered the glow of

00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:16.289
the fireball leftover from the birth of the
cosmos.

00:08:16.289 --> 00:08:21.330
Later, in the 1990s, satellite observations
further refined the measurements of this cosmic

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:26.400
microwave background, and now it’s essentially
confirmed. This glow was successfully predicted

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.920
by the Big Bang model, and now we see it
in exquisite detail. Its discovery was a

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.620
huge step in cosmology.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:37.250
The redshift of distant galaxies and the cosmic
background are not the only confirmations

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.479
we have that the Big Bang model is correct.

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:43.639
For example, the model also makes predictions
about the elements we see in the Universe.

00:08:43.639 --> 00:08:48.139
At first, when the Universe was dense and
hot, only subatomic particles could exist.

00:08:48.139 --> 00:08:52.560
But as the Universe cooled, for a brief time,
they could fuse and form heavier elements.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.829
The Big Bang model predicts certain abundances
of elements — ratios of them, compared to

00:08:56.829 --> 00:09:00.019
hydrogen — and that’s just what we see
in the Universe at large.

00:09:00.019 --> 00:09:04.620
Also, the size and shapes of large structures
in the cosmos are in line with what a Big

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.709
Bang model predicts. There’s lots of other
observational evidence as well. Pretty much

00:09:08.709 --> 00:09:12.839
every modern astronomer on Earth understands
that the Big Bang model of how the Universe

00:09:12.839 --> 00:09:14.769
got its start is the correct one.

00:09:14.769 --> 00:09:16.649
But what does it mean? I mean, physically?

00:09:16.649 --> 00:09:21.610
It’s a very common misconception that the
Big Bang was an explosion in space, with everything

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:25.389
rushing away from some point. But that’s
not what’s really happening.

00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:30.300
Remember, I’ve talked about space being
a THING, in which matter and energy exist.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.389
Space can be warped, bent, by mass, creating
what we think of as gravity.

00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:39.110
When we talk about the Universe expanding,
we mean space itself is expanding, and when

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:44.029
it does it carries galaxies along with it.
In a sense, it’s like having a rubber ruler.

00:09:44.029 --> 00:09:48.480
When you pull on it, it gets longer, and the
distance between the tick marks gets wider.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.370
When the ruler doubles in length, the tick
marks that started out a millimeter apart

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:58.990
are now TWO mm apart. But tick marks that
were ten centimeters apart are now 20 cm apart!

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:04.030
In other words, the farther away a tick mark
is, the faster it appears to move away.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:09.200
Sound familiar? That’s just what galaxy
redshifts are telling us. It also means that,

00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:13.339
really, the galaxies aren’t actually doing
any moving, it’s that space between them

00:10:13.339 --> 00:10:18.920
is expanding. This may seem like a nitpicky
semantic point, but it’s physically true.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:24.320
The galaxies are, for all intents and purposes,
standing still. The space in between them

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.660
is where all the action is.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:30.320
And it gets even weirder: This is true no
matter where you are in the Universe. From

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:35.010
any galaxy, it looks like all the others are
rushing away from you. Look back at that ruler:

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:39.540
No matter what tick mark you start with, when
the ruler stretches, from that spot it looks

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.060
like the tick marks are all moving away from
you.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:47.350
This is what Einstein’s equations showed,
and what Lemaîtres saw in them. Space is

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:51.949
expanding! But that means the Big Bang wasn’t
an explosion in some pre-existing space, it

00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:57.800
was the initial exploding expansion of space
itself. The Universe isn’t expanding into

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:02.620
anything, because it’s all there is. There’s
nothing outside the Universe for it to expand into.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:07.800
This also means the Universe has no center,
no point of origin. Imagine the ruler is now

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.540
a circle, and the diameter is expanding. No
tick mark is the actual center, yet no matter

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:17.220
where you are, on the ruler, every tick mark
appears to move away from you. In a similar

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:22.949
way, every spot in the Universe appears like
the center, which means…none is. No place

00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:26.880
in the Universe is more special than any place
else. We’re all in this together.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.380
It can be hard to grasp, and I’ll admit
we all have some difficulty with these concepts.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:36.420
But the math bears them out, and so do essentially
all the observations we make of the distant Universe.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:41.900
And in all this weirdness, don’t lose sight
of the big picture: The Universe had a beginning.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.760
And we can see evidence of it!

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.899
Not only that, but by measuring how quickly
it’s expanding, we can use math to run the

00:11:47.899 --> 00:11:51.980
clock backwards and determine the age of the
Universe. Currently, the best measurement

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.540
we have of the age of the Universe is 13.82
billion years.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:00.750
Or perhaps I should say: 13.82 billion years!

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:06.540
That’s an amazing number. It’s a long,
long time — three times older than the Earth

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:09.880
— but what gets me is that we can figure
it out at all.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.529
Pretty smart, us apes.

00:12:11.529 --> 00:12:15.540
Today you learned that distant galaxies show
a redshift in their spectra, which means they’re

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:20.470
moving away from us. The Universe is expanding!
This means it used to be hot and dense, then

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:24.990
it started expanding and cooling. This model
of the Universe’s early behavior is called

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:29.490
the Big Bang, and it was confirmed when the
background radiation — the glow of the fireball

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:34.720
— was detected in the 1960s. Other lines
of evidence support it as well. Using this

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:39.279
information, we have measured that the Universe
is nearly 14 billion years old.

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:43.630
Crash Course Astronomy is produced in association
with PBS Digital Studios. Head over to their

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:48.459
YouTube channel to catch even more awesome
videos. This episode was written by me, Phil

00:12:48.459 --> 00:12:52.670
Plait. The script was edited by Blake de Pastino,
and our consultant is Dr. Michelle Thaller.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:57.190
It was directed by Nicholas Jenkins, edited
