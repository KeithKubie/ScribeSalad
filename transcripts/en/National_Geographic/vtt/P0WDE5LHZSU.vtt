00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:01.166
[music playing]

00:00:03.667 --> 00:00:07.600
RON HOWARD: We began thinking
about how we would tell

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.400
the story of Albert Einstein,
and Geoffrey Rush instantly

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.133
was at the top of our list.

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:17.033
GIGI PRITZGER: The thing that
has been so gratifying to watch

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:19.400
in Geoffrey's
performance of Einstein

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.967
is the different shadings that
he brings to the character--

00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:25.467
A lot to consider, I know.

00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:27.767
GIGI PRITZGER: --and the
mischievous, humorous

00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:29.567
side of Einstein without--

00:00:29.567 --> 00:00:30.200
I know.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.533
[laughter]

00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.433
GIGI PRITZGER: --jeopardizing
the seriousness

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:36.367
and the weightiness
of the material.

00:00:36.367 --> 00:00:38.333
RON HOWARD: Once we found
Geoffrey would be interested,

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.166
then the question
was, well who can we

00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.633
find, who can we
match him up with,

00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:44.400
because that had
to be remarkable.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.633
KEN BILLER: Johnny
Flynn read for the part

00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:49.967
and was put on tape in
London, and I looked at Ron,

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:55.633
and he looked at me, and we both
knew that this guy was so much

00:00:55.633 --> 00:00:58.166
more interesting
than any other actor

00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.533
that we had seen for the role.

00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.767
GEOFFREY RUSH: Johnny and
I then met up in London

00:01:01.767 --> 00:01:05.633
before the shoot started,
and he suggested,

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:09.066
he had a mentor at Central
School of Speech and Drama

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:11.467
that he went to, and he said
it would be really great to get

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:15.133
together and just muck around
with, you know, how do we walk,

00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:19.133
how do we-- where's our center
of gravity, how much changes,

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:22.867
looking at how his
behavior manifested

00:01:22.867 --> 00:01:24.266
pre-fame and post-fame.

00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:26.033
--is not absolute.

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:27.300
JOHNNY FLYNN: How
fast are his thoughts,

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.867
what's his relationship
to the future,

00:01:28.867 --> 00:01:31.700
to tomorrow, like how often does
he think about eating lunch?

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.667
You know, those are the sorts
of things that you think about.

00:01:34.667 --> 00:01:38.467
And then we thought of
a series of characters.

00:01:38.467 --> 00:01:40.600
We had a lot of
fun bringing in--

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.900
oh, there's a twinkle
of Harper Marx,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.600
so there's a tiny bit of Charlie
Chaplin, there's a tiny bit--

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.567
these kind of quite sweet and
cheesy kind of situations,

00:01:51.567 --> 00:01:53.166
but they were really helpful.

00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:56.800
--blind regurgitation
and rote memorization

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.333
is not an education.

00:01:58.333 --> 00:02:01.367
GEOFFREY RUSH: Well, I noticed
in the very early footage

00:02:01.367 --> 00:02:04.600
in the teenage years,
he was very rebellious

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.667
and very
anti-authoritarian, hated

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:10.400
the German militaristic
sensibility.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.300
I'm not a communist.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.800
I'm an internationalist.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.133
GEOFFREY RUSH: And was quite
outspoken and forthright,

00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:18.767
but sometimes lacking
in confidence.

00:02:18.767 --> 00:02:20.600
And I noticed in some
of the early footage

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.767
where Johnny would kind
of be licking his lips

00:02:24.767 --> 00:02:30.367
and just that hadn't yet
found assurance and authority.

00:02:30.367 --> 00:02:32.300
RON HOWARD: The work they've
done together and now

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.834
separately is
absolutely stunning.

00:02:34.834 --> 00:02:36.433
It's remarkable to direct.

00:02:36.433 --> 00:02:38.033
It's exciting to watch.

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:42.867
I think people are really going
to be entertained, fascinated,

00:02:42.867 --> 00:02:46.233
moved, and really excited
by the performances

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:48.767
both the these men are doing.
