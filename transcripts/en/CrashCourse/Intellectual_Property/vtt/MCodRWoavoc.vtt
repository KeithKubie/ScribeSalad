Hi, I'm Stan Muller, and this is the final
episode of Crash Course Intellectual Property.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.050
Tackling such a huge subject in only seven
episodes has meant that we can't go into quite

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.390
as much detail as we'd like, but hopefully
we've given you a pretty good overview of

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.369
the basics of Intellectual Property. We spent
the last six episodes talking about copyright,

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.909
patent, and trademark laws as they currently
exist, but we keep running into a roadblock.

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:24.049
Intellectual Property law is slow to change, and we're living in a world that's changing pretty rapidly.

00:00:24.049 --> 00:00:27.840
As we've noted again and again, our new digital
world has raised challenges for both consumers

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.400
and producers of IP. So today, we're going
to look at some of the problems that have

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.780
developed in recent years with Intellectual
Property. We're also going to talk about IP

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.230
as it applies to everyone's favorite internet
media hub, YouTube, and we're even going to

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.140
look into the future. I mean, we've got this
liquid-filled dye agitator containing a dye

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.580
with raised indicia on the facets thereof.
This thing tells the future, right?

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.840
It is certain!

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:58.740
[Theme Music]

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.100
So YouTube's kind of a big deal. It has over
a billion users watching hundreds of millions

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.909
of hours of video and generates billions and
billions of views. At the time we made this,

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.679
over 300 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube's
servers every minute, and in its ten year

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:17.279
history, YouTube has become the audiovisual wing in Google's attempt to build its archive of everything.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.479
YouTube is truly vast, and it'll continue
to grow. It's arguably the most important

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.459
tool for speech and entertainment on the internet,
and we think it's probably the world's greatest and

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.000
most transformative teaching and learning tool. But as great as YouTube is, in a lot of ways, it's kind of a mess.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.700
When over 300 hours of video are uploaded
every minute, 24 hours a day, some of it's

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.959
not going to be that great. While it's kind
of amazing and radically democratic that individual

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:43.759
vloggers and makers of cat videos and those
videos where they just open the toys and look

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.349
at them get to publish their videos side by
side with huge media companies, some creators

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:51.419
are concerned that their creative work is
cheapened and becomes just another piece of

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:55.979
content that gets lost amidst the junk, and
people aren't just uploading their own content.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.480
Very often, people use this service to share
material they didn't create, so for pretty

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:02.929
much the entirety of YouTube's 10 year existence,
it's been getting sued.

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.840
In early 2007, Viacom opened the floodgates,
served over 100,000 take down notices, and

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.439
sued YouTube for $1 billion. Sports leagues,
music publishers, and other copyright owners

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:16.530
all filed class action suits based on the
same theory: YouTube and Google should be

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.370
held liable for the copyright infringements
committed by YouTube users. The issue here

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.150
was whether YouTube complied with Section
512 of The Copyright Act, which was added

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.430
in 1998 as part of the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act, or DMCA. The DMCA sets out

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.650
safe harbors to protect Internet Service Providers
or ISPs from unreasonable liability. Basically,

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.020
certain ISPs have to block or remove infringing content that it's aware of, or for which it receives a valid notice.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.400
DMCA safe harbors protect Internet Service
Providers that comply with certain conditions

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.819
when they're engaged in one of four covered
activities. The first activity is when they're

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.519
acting as 'mere conduits', like the pipes
of the internet, for example, Comcast, Verizon

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.599
Fios, or Google Fiber. The second activity
is caching content, like Google does. The

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.959
third activity is hosting user-generated content,
like YouTube, and the fourth is acting as

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.739
an information location tool or search engine,
like Google or Bing.

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.780
The problem is, Congress came up with these
categories in 1998, which is like 80 years

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.950
ago in internet years. The DMCA doesn't fit
neatly with new categories of online services

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.060
including peer-to-peer sharing, torrents, and
cloud storage. The DMCA is due for an upgrade.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.040
Let's take a closer look at the notice and takedown provision of the DMCA in the Thought Bubble.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.180
So ISPs don't have to actively monitor for
infringement, but they do have to act if they

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.379
know about infringing content. ISPs know there's
infringing content on their system when they

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.579
receive a takedown notice or when they're
independently aware of it through either actual

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.639
knowledge or where it's obvious infringing activity
is going on. This is called 'red flag knowledge.'

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.190
Copyright owners and ISPs complain that the
notice and takedown system isn't working.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.099
Rights holders complain that the system only
works for large corporate entities. Individuals

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.999
and small businesses can't afford to constantly
monitor for infringement and send thousands

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:57.159
of notices. Also the DMCA requires that content
be taken down only from the specific location

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:02.599
or URL identified in the notice. Once infringing
content, like Interstellar posted on YouTube,

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.180
is taken down, it just gets reposted in a
different location. Copyright owners call

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.400
it the whack-a-mole problem. ISPs complain
that the volume of takedown notices is overwhelming.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.959
Google started keeping track of the take down
notices over the past several years. The number

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:21.810
has increased from about a 130,000 URLs per
week in 2011 to nearly 10 million per week

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.090
in 2015. Lots of these notices are sent using
automated systems, which sometimes leads to

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.169
erroneously removed content that doesn't and
can't take into account the fact that the

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.470
use might be fair. Also, there is some evidence
that the take down system is being abused

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.180
as a censorship tool, as in the case where
some candidates' political advertisements

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.690
have been targeted for removal during the
days leading up to a campaign, or as in the

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.760
case of video game companies flagging unfavorable
reviews as infringing content. Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.720
Now to get back to the Viacom v YouTube case,
the issue really centered around whether YouTube

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.089
had knowledge that infringing content
was being posted to the site,

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:58.749
and whether it induced users
to post such content.

00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:03.180
In 2012, the second circuit court of appeals
held that in order for YouTube to lose its

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.970
safe harbor protections, it must have knowledge
or awareness of specific infringing activity.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.720
So although YouTube was probably generally
aware that infringing content was being uploaded

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.229
because of the sheer volume of video being
posted and the fact they were being sued by

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.069
a lot of people who were loudly pointing out
that a lot of this content was infringing,

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:23.749
Viacom couldn't show that YouTube knew about
specific infringing content and ignored it.

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:28.520
After yet another appeal, Viacom and YouTube
settled the case in March of 2014. One big

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.160
reason for that settlement may have been YouTube's
2012 development of the content I.D. system.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.280
With content I.D., YouTube allows certain
copyright owners to upload their content into

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.919
a database of protected material. YouTube
scans the uploaded content looking for a match

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.069
in the database. When there is a match, rights
holders can elect to either block or remove

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:49.609
the offending material, or monetize the video
by running ads against it.

00:05:49.609 --> 00:05:53.460
Though content I.D. seems to have slowed all
the litigation, it's kind of really upset

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.050
the YouTube user community. Critics point
out that the automated system can censor fair

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.750
uses of protected content and sometimes unfairly
flag certain videos. Others claim that the

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.169
system doesn't go far enough, arguing that
YouTube gamed the DMCA in rapidly evolving

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:10.740
markets to turn a billion dollar lawsuit into
a lucrative business deal, and that YouTube

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.659
should be more proactive in ferreting out
infringing content.

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:17.449
In any case, it appears that content I.D.
is here to stay into the foreseeable future,

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.979
and there are probably several settlement
agreements that require its existence anyway.

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:25.430
For the time being, content I.D. will continue
to chip away at some YouTubers incomes, which

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.640
leads us to the issue of monetizing YouTube
videos. It's not an incredibly easy thing to do.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.900
The difficulties inherent in generating income on YouTube become more complex when you talk about

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.300
freebooting, which is the unauthorized copying of online content and rehosting it on another website.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.080
Unlike linking, sharing, or embedding the
file where the original creator is credited

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:45.970
and paid for any views that take place, the
freebooted file is actually downloaded and

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.909
reposted on another site where it generates
revenue. Our friend Destin at Smarter Every

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:52.490
Day made an excellent video about it that
you should watch.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.050
Freebooting is kind of interesting; the companies
that are hosting these infringing videos have

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.570
something of a perverse incentive to slow
down the DMCA takedown process.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:05.020
The longer the video is up of their site, the more views
and revenues it generates. While they're observing

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.530
the letter of the law and eventually taking
the stuff down, it seems a little fishy to me.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.380
In any case, the compensation structure of
YouTube is often at odds with the incentive

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:18.159
structure of copyright law. Authors are granted
exclusive rights for a limited time so they

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:22.099
may financially benefit from their creation
either through sale of copies or licensing

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:26.220
access to the work. But this limited grant
of exclusive rights becomes less limited all

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.360
the time as copyright term is extended and
extended further into the future.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.939
Speaking of the future, let's wrap things
up with a little futurism.

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:36.129
We're gonna look at a few problems with current
intellectual property law, and we're gonna

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:40.229
talk a bit about what the future might look
like. We painted a pretty rosy picture of

00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:44.539
trademark law, and at its core it is a consumer
protection measure that really does function

00:07:44.539 --> 00:07:48.509
pretty well. We all have to buy things, but
trademark law makes sure we can more easily

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:53.540
locate and buy the things we actually want and need, but owners sometimes overreach and abuse the system.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.960
Trademarks are everywhere, and for better
or worse, they've taken on such a level of

00:07:56.969 --> 00:08:01.060
importance to our day-to-day lives that it's
impossible to Photoshop out every soda bottle

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:05.139
or shirt logo in our videos. And by the way,
Photoshop is a registered trademark of Adobe

00:08:05.139 --> 00:08:08.379
Systems Incorporated, not a generic term for
digital photo editing.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.699
And even if our old friend T-Swizzie registers
phrases like "this sick beat" and other lines

00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:16.669
from her songs, it's not that worrisome. Trademark
registrations don't give owners the right

00:08:16.669 --> 00:08:21.139
to dictate how a phrase or mark is used. Trademarks
become problematic when owners try to use

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:25.099
them to restrain speech, like where a restaurant
threatens the author of a bad Yelp review

00:08:25.099 --> 00:08:26.629
with trademark infringement.

00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:30.319
So, patents are a little more of a mess. A
lot of recently issued patents are for inventions

00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:34.840
that are unoriginal, vague, over-broad, or
so unclear that bad actors can easily use

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.750
them to threaten innovation. For example,
patents have been issued to basic technologies

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.770
like sending and receiving of streaming audio
and video over the internet, voice over IP

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:47.240
systems, and real-time multiplayer games.
To me, all of these seem like basic building

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.370
blocks for other products. These bad patents
seem to serve no function besides generating

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:55.210
license fees and curbing innovation. This
is really the case with software patents,

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:59.230
where inventions can be as abstract as a single
click to purchase a book or the idea of sorting

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.010
your Facebook friends into groups.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:04.140
Patent trolls are non-practicing entities
that take advantage of these vague patents

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:08.350
by filing vague legal complaints. Even if
you've closely read the patent and you know

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:12.520
your stuff, it's kind of hard to figure out
how you've infringed the thing. There is patent

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.800
troll legislation currently pending in the
House that would require companies bringing

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.780
lawsuits to use greater detail in their documents,
and there's actually a good chance that this

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.750
patent troll legislation is going to pass
next year.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.270
Okay, so we spend a lot of time on copyright
in this series because we encounter it so

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:30.450
often in our day-to-day lives. It's simply
inescapable, and judging from the comments

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:34.810
you posted, a lot of you really hate it. Law
professor Jane Ginsburg has an idea of how

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:40.090
copyright lost it, and got a bad name. She
attributes it to "Greed. Corporate greed and

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:44.100
consumer greed." Corporate owners trying to
increase earnings have lobbied for and gotten

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.440
more protective legislation that extends the term of
copyright and interferes with the development

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.920
of consumer-friendly copying technologies.
Consumers want to share content and get stuff

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.820
for free, and they feel that any law or enforcement
mechanism that gets in the way of what they

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.450
can do with their own equipment in their own
homes is illegitimate, and it's a threat to

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:05.080
the public interest. Copyright owners argue
that there are now so many creators that strong

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.940
exclusive rights are the best way to promote
the public interest.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.750
So one thing I've noticed in the comments
is that you guys think copyright term is way

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:17.270
too long. Well, there's evidence to back this
belief up. Fewer than 11% of copyrights registered

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:22.270
between 1883 and 1964 were renewed at the
end of their 28-year term. Even though renewing

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:26.170
didn't cost very much. So back when stuff
could move to the public domain, copyright

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:31.470
owners let 89% of their works lapse, because
the works no longer had any economic value,

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.770
or the authors just didn't care anymore. In
our current system, the copyright term is

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:39.930
automatically life plus 70 years with no renewal
requirement. But a similar percentage of today's

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:44.040
copyright-protected works will likely be neglected
and forgotten about within a few decades,

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.450
or even a few years of their creation. The
only difference is that they're still protected

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:51.010
by copyright. This creates a huge body of
work that's under protection, but where the

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:55.340
author or owner often can't be found to grant
permission for use. There are called "orphan

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:59.060
works." Good-faith users that want to make
use of these works can't find the owner, can't

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.750
get permission, and therefore face the risk
that they'll be sued if the owner does eventually

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:06.750
step forward. The copyright office is advocating
for legislation that will limit liability

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:10.970
for good-faith users of orphan works who've
at least made some attempt to find the owner.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.920
This legislation also might create a framework
for the private sector to develop rights clearance

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:19.340
mechanisms that will make it easier for creators
to use copyrighted work. It's possible that

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:22.900
Congress may consider introducing legislation
along these lines in the coming years,

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.520
but you know how Congress is.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.900
There are also some really interesting private
initiatives that have tried to address the

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:32.590
super-long copyright term. Organizations like
Creative Commons and copyleft have attempted

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:36.150
to let creators choose how their work can
be used by others, and these movements have

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.580
gained some traction. It's hard not to just
argue that the term should be shorter, but

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:43.860
that's really hard to do. Changing US law
requires the revision and maybe renegotiation

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:48.210
of all these international treaties that further
entrench the life-plus-70 term, and the US

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:53.880
is signing more of these treaties all the time,
so unfortunately, the life-plus-70 term is here to stay.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.960
So I may have given the impression here that
intellectual property law is a stinking cesspool

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.960
of greed and confusion, but I'm going to argue
that there is some value here. The basic notions--that

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.460
individual authors should be rewarded for
their creative efforts, that inventors should

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.510
profit from their inventions, and that manufacturers
of goods should be able to market their products

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:15.050
without fear that knockoffs will appear on
supermarket shelves--these are all good ideas.

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:19.760
Maybe you think they're not, but I believe
that we as a society can't neglect our creators

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:24.540
and innovators. We also can't allow outdated
laws to prevent technological innovation and

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.200
progress. The trick, as always, is striking
a balance, a combination of strong exclusive

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.720
rights for authors and inventors, and equally
strong exceptions and limitations that allow

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:40.550
for creators to build on work that came before.
Is this possible? "Reply hazy. Ask again later."

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:44.770
Well, there you have it. As usual on Crash
Course, there are no answers, only more questions.

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:47.640
Next week, we're going to start looking at
questions around the world economy with Crash

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.930
Course: Economics. Thanks for watching.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:53.160
Crash Course: Intellectual Property is filmed
at the Chad and Stacey Emigholz Studio in

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.070
Indianapolis, Indiana; it's made by all of
these nice workers-for-hire. If you'd like

00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.890
to keep Crash Course freely available for
everyone forever, you can support the series

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:05.470
at Patreon, a crowdfunding platform that allows
you to support the content you love. Speaking

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:08.910
of Patreon, we'd like to thank all of our
supporters in general, and specifically thank

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:12.870
our Headmaster of Learning, Thomas Frank,
and our Vice Principals, Kathy and Tim Philip,

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:16.620
and Linnea Boyev. You can get awesome material
awards for your support, but I know that's

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.590
not why you're in this thing, you're in it
for the greatest reward of all, which is helping

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:23.310
people learn. Thanks for watching. We'll see
you next week.
