00:12:00.279 --> 00:12:03.299 align:start position:0%
compensation in a few cases but I think

00:12:03.299 --> 00:12:03.309 align:start position:0%
the more generic problem is not that

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:24.100 align:start position:0%
should be setting compensation i think
 

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.850 align:start position:0%
should be setting compensation i think
