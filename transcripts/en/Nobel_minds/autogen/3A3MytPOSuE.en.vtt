if you're the first person to do or see

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250
if you're the first person to do or see
 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.370
if you're the first person to do or see
something you're going to make a lot of

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380
something you're going to make a lot of
 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.759
something you're going to make a lot of
mistakes there's going to be a lot of

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769
mistakes there's going to be a lot of
 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.320
mistakes there's going to be a lot of
failure because we're pushing to

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330
failure because we're pushing to
 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.089
failure because we're pushing to
something that nobody knows about and

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099
something that nobody knows about and
 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.799
something that nobody knows about and
we're trying to gain some understanding

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809
we're trying to gain some understanding
 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.390
we're trying to gain some understanding
of it I think that that means that

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400
of it I think that that means that
 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.179
of it I think that that means that
failure is inevitable important that

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189
failure is inevitable important that
 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.910
failure is inevitable important that
does happen I'm not really sure what the

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920
does happen I'm not really sure what the
 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.800
does happen I'm not really sure what the
prescription is to get over the failure

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810
prescription is to get over the failure
 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.349
prescription is to get over the failure
other than try to do the experiments in

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359
other than try to do the experiments in
 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.269
other than try to do the experiments in
different ways it's clear that there are

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279
different ways it's clear that there are
 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.229
different ways it's clear that there are
some things that you can't solve I don't

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239
some things that you can't solve I don't
 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.470
some things that you can't solve I don't
work on one problem we work on many

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480
work on one problem we work on many
 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.350
work on one problem we work on many
problems and so when one doesn't work I

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360
problems and so when one doesn't work I
 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.340
problems and so when one doesn't work I
work on another one

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350
work on another one
 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.149
work on another one
