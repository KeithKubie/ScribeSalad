Vsauce!

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.080
Kevin here.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.840
Welcoming you to The Create Unknown -- my
brand new podcast ripe and ready for consumption

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.460
in your earholes and brain folds.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.790
There are two episodes up already, one where
I speak with Destin from SmarterEveryday.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.910
We discuss the engineering complexity of putting
sprinkles on snack cakes and he tells me his

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.480
real dream job which you'd never guess in
a googol years…

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.989
In the second episode I speak with meme lord
generals Dr. Grandayy and Dolan Dark.

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.800
I discover a secret about Dr Grandayy that
blows my mind and I ask Dolan Dark about the

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.909
origin of making Vsauce memes.

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:47.859
And then I bring them together for their first
ever conversation using their voices.

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.739
I made my first YouTube account in 2006 and
since then I’ve always found it fascinating

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.100
how people get into being YouTubers.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.889
How they start, how they survive, how they
develop and grow.

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:03.510
Like, I was living above a hot dog shack,
working at a chicken wing joint and making

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.619
videos on a laptop when I first started.

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:13.159
You’ll get to hear those stories about me
-- and those types of stories from your favorite

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:14.159
creators.

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.590
And this podcast is finally my opportunity
to pick the brains of the biggest YouTubers

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.270
and allow them to talk about their incredibly
unique journeys.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.810
Joining me is longtime Vsauce2 contributor
and friend, Matthew Tabor.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.659
He’s able to lend his globe-trotting, interdisciplinary
outsider’s perspective on the business of

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.380
being an online creator.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.280
I’ve actually brought together a ton of
talent for this.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.299
BloodyChrome did the branding, Eric Langley
created an incredible animation, the custom

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.140
music was produced by Mega Drive, and each
guest getting a hand drawn illustration from

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.659
Tim Webster.

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.799
And that’s not even getting into the actual
guest list.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.229
All of your favorite YouTubers -- and you
get to hear me crack open their creative minds

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.469
