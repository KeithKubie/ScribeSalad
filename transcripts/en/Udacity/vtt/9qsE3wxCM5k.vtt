00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.916
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What's really interesting about the last set of equations is that you can

00:00:03.916 --> 00:00:08.125
tell they are parallel just by looking at them. Remember, in standard form, we

00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:12.163
get the slope by finding negative A over B. So, we only need to look at the left

00:00:12.163 --> 00:00:16.245
side of the equation. Since these two equations have the same left side, that

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:20.846
means, their slopes have to be equal. Equations with equal slopes are either the

00:00:20.846 --> 00:00:25.346
same line or they're parallel lines. We know these two lines can't be the same,

00:00:25.346 --> 00:00:29.757
because the right-hand side is different, so these lines must be parallel.
