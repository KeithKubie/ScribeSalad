00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.670
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: David
Bromburg, it's always great

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.680
to have you back here at
the Library of Congress,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.980
thank you so much for coming.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.280
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.580
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
you're here to talk

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.740
about your American
violin collection.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.200
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: Yes,
I brought a violin today

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.790
that was made in Baltimore.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:43.310
And I think the idea today is to
contrast the way that fiddlers

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.710
and classical violinists
use the instrument.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.910
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yes,
because people use those

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.400
terms interchangeably.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.750
In fact, what was the story
you were telling me before?

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.050
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: Well,

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.540
Itzhak Perlman always called
his instrument his fiddle,

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.100
and Vassar Clements who was one

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.100
of the world's greatest fiddlers
always called his his violin.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.400
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And--

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.700
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: So go figure.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.000
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So is
it the same instrument?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.440
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: When people
ask me what the difference

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.450
between a fiddle and a violin
is I usually say around $10,000.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.210
It is the same instrument.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.730
It's what you can
afford and what you like.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.680
Although, fiddlers and
violinists, fortunately,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.540
like different kinds of sounds.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.560
There's also different sys--

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.090
violinists like something
that will cut

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.660
through a 40 piece orchestra.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.650
The first overtones you use
when you're playing with a bunch

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.960
of other musicians
are the lower ones.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.860
So violinists gravitate
towards things

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.020
with a strong upper-sound,
a penetrating trebly--

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.320
more penetrating trebly sound.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.300
And the only instruments
that have both

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:06.540
that in a warm quality are
Guarneri Del Gesu violins.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.720
And this is a copy
of a Del Gesu,

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.300
that doesn't mean it's going to
have that, but this one does.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.140
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And what do
fiddlers-- what do they like?

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.440
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg:
They like a warm sound.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.160
They like a warm sound and
if they want to be louder,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.790
they'll use a microphone.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.030
And also, fiddlers
don't care who made it

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.210
or how broken it's been.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.390
If it works for them,
it's enough.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.930
Which seems to me,
pretty sensible.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.400
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Now, you
study to be a violin maker

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.130
and you have a very
important violin shop

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.050
and you're acquired a
very important collection.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.590
And I know you came by a
while ago with a number

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.270
of violins made just in Chicago,

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.390
but today you've brought
something closer to Washington,

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.090
you have a Baltimore instrument?

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.130
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: Well,
Luther Heiges was born

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.340
in York, Pennsylvania and--

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.420
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: He was a fiddle
maker that made this fiddle?

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.840
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: He was a
good violin maker who made this,

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.150
and people-- there's
been a lot of speculation

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.400
and incorrect information
about him.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.230
People thought maybe
he was born in Germany

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.520
because his name is kind
of German; H-E-I-G-E-S,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.330
and nobody knows how
it's really pronounced,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.540
I just assume it's Heiges.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:33.050
And his father was a
machinist and he was born--

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.570
well, some sources
say he was born

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:43.640
in 1900, he was born in 1867.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:51.300
And he went to the
Maryland Institute--

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.910
I don't think I'll
get the name right,

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.580
but it was the famous
Maryland art school.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.470
And he graduated in 1900.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.770
And the--

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.190
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And he
graduated as a musician?

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.520
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: No, in I
think as a mechanical designer

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.960
as a-- his father
being a machinist,

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.750
I think it had to
do with machines.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.050
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Oh, okay.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.350
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg:
He was fascinated

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.650
with machines his whole life.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.870
I think along with violins,
like many machinists

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.630
and mechanically oriented
people, he was fascinated

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.630
in the machinery of a pistol.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.820
And he was a member
of a pistol club

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:32.300
and was actually the
president in 1924 of a club

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.900
that graduated an
Olympic medalist.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.290
So he had an interesting life.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.330
1900 was a very significant
year for him,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.540
because he graduated--
no, I was incorrect.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.000
He graduated from
the school in 1893.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.300
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Okay.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.070
And when did he start
making violins?

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.900
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg:
He was first working

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.940
in different violin shops
in 1900 that we know of.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.020
But also 1900 the census listed
him as a foreman in a foundry.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.770
But evidently, at some point

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.060
in 1900 he began working
in different shops.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.230
And I do know through anecdotal
information that he used

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.250
to frequent the shop of Alberto
Molier [phonetic] in D.C.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.550
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Oh.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.620
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: And I
think that he received a lot

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.920
of information from Molier.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.220
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
you know the Library

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.170
of Congress had a long
relationship with Molier

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.360
with our instrument
collection here also.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.420
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg:
What a brilliant maker.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.060
He was one of America's best.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.820
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
you've brought one

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.230
of the Baltimore maker's.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.530
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: Yeah.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.830
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Can we
start by just seeing?

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.270
Explain to us what
we're looking at here.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.210
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: Well,
it's built along the pattern

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.040
of a Guarneri Del Gesu.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.160
The workmanship was really good.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.820
He was especially good at
inserting the purfling,

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.810
which are the-- people don't
know exactly what they are,

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.520
I'll tell you, it's
three strips of wood;

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.150
a black, a white and a black.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.820
And it's not the easiest thing
to do to put this without lots

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.310
of gaps and especially
on the tops.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.640
But he was quite
skilled at that.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.960
And the purpose of this
stuff, for one thing,

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.120
violins look really
crazy without them

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.420
and there are some without it.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:29.890
But the other is, if
the wood is broken here,

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.580
it'll break at the purfling

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.030
and the break won't
go inside any farther.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.330
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So
it's to protect the--

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.630
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: To protect.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.510
The back is strong enough
so you don't really need it,

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.260
but it's also purfled.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.950
And on some violins, especially
hedges because he did a lot

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.720
of fancy purfling,
you'll find designs.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.180
On this one he was a little more
subtle, he did his last initial

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.740
down at the bottom in purfling--

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.040
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Aw, yes.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.340
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg:
There's a little H there.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.640
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Oh,
that's beautiful.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.610
And the back is beautiful,
what kind of wood is that?

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.820
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: This is
slab cut maple and I believe it

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.830
to be American wood
from the markings.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.800
The other really wonderful
thing about his violins,

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.650
I think his varnish
is just beautiful.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.100
You can see there's a
very fine crackle to it,

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.600
which usually indicates
the presence of a lot

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.170
of oil in the varnish.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.720
And such a good varnish,
this is not something

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.650
that he would've gotten
from Molier because although

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.110
in the classic period,
Stradivarius

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.640
and all his contemporaries
bought their varnish;

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.940
they had to.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.530
They were members of the
guild and the first law

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.600
of the guild is you have to
patronize the other guilds.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.980
And before this was really
brooded about I figured

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:48.140
that they had to have bought
it because one of the ways

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:53.080
to identify what city a violin
was made in from that period

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.320
in Italy was the varnish.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.620
The varnish of all

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.290
of the violins has a
certain similarity--

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.230
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So there's
been a lot of mysticism

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.140
about violins and the--

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.700
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: And varnish,
you know, but the secret

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.630
to the old varnish was lost.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:15.690
Because around the late 19th
century they discovered lacquer

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.760
from Japan.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.280
And it was so much
easier to apply,

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.830
that everybody started
doing that

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.410
and didn't patronize the
apothecaries who used

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.590
to make the old varnish, and
so the recipes were lost.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:29.890
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Now,
tell me more

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.520
about violin making
in Baltimore.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.530
Were there a lot
of violin makers?

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:35.830
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: There were.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:40.480
However, I have not been able
to identify a school of making.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.220
In other words, I--

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:47.600
In Pittsburgh you had
a guy named Francois,

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.280
GM [phonetic] Francois, and
he influenced all the makers

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.060
in Pittsburgh, and Chicago
was John Hornsteiner.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.820
But most places there was
not one dominant maker,

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.550
there were quite a few very
good ones in Baltimore.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.030
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Do we know how
many violins this maker made?

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.640
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: I
believe, if my memory served,

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.150
that he made somewhere
around 130.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.630
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And so
you've seen other ones

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.990
or do you have other ones?

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.120
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: Oh yes, I've
seen quite a few other ones,

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.770
that's how I know that he
used to do fancy purfling.

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:23.600
And the point I was trying
to make about the varnish,

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.640
by the way, is he couldn't
have learned that from Molier

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.380
Because in modern times, in the
19th century and 20th century,

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.550
anybody with a good varnish
wouldn't tell anybody else how

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:32.850
to make it.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:34.240
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Oh, so it
went from being a guild secret

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.890
to being a personal secret?

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.190
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg:
I don't think it was

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.290
at all a secret in
the 19th century.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:44.690
There are letters
from Lupot to one

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:50.060
of his colleagues saying
I ran out of varnish

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.160
if you could send me some.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.610
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Really?

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:54.910
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: Yeah.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.500
Yeah, but it became a
secret after a while.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.410
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Now, what
year was this violin made?

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:04.820
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: This was made
in 1917, so it's 100 years old.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.590
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And was it in
good shape when you acquired it?

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:08.900
Did it need much work?

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.510
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: No, no,
it was in pretty good shape.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:16.410
And I used to see quite a
few of them around Baltimore.

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:20.390
Now they are, thankfully,
very much sought after.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:24.480
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Now, at one time
American violins weren't valued

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.780
very highly.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.730
Could you talk a
little bit about that?

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:32.010
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: Well, I
think it's probably embarrassing

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:38.290
to the violin dealers
of the before the 90's.

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:39.590
0

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:41.380
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: The 1991's?

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:42.960
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: The 1990's.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.100
Because when I started
collecting American violins I

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:50.240
was told there were
no good ones.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:55.270
And I can't understand, those
guys had eyes, they could see,

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:58.110
and they should have seen that
these are beautiful things.

00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:59.410
And they didn't!

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:02.990
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So you started
to acquire American violins?

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:04.290
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: Yeah.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.420
I started-- every time-- I
make my living as a musician,

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:11.210
and every town I would visit I
would visit the violin makers

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.380
and ask them if they had
any good American violins,

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:18.140
and they'd say something like
oh, no, there aren't any.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.450
Oh, you know, there was a guy
around here, he wasn't too bad,

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:24.210
but I got one in the back, it's
not worth my while to fix it.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:25.960
And so that's how it started.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.430
And when I started lecturing
some of the American societies

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.250
and showing what American
violins looked like,

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.370
people who had even had them

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.000
in their shops sometimes
never really looked at them,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.300
they just looked at the label,

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.500
saw that it was American
and who cares.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.840
And it was interesting to run
into players who would say oh,

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.870
my second violin is an
American violin, and you know,

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.220
it sounds really good.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.750
Well, Americans are not
genetically inferior

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.160
to Europeans.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.570
The usual excuse after
"oh, they're all German"

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:02.800
or they're all something else,
which doesn't fly, was "well,

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.980
we don't have the
apprentice system here,

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.820
and they have that in Europe."

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:11.550
And well, actually, most
makers did begin to learn

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.020
from someone else but
it wasn't official.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:20.200
But the real kicker is in Europe
there were tens of thousands

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:25.470
of people who were
apprentices and then journeymen

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:26.780
and then had their own shops.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.450
How many of them
were really good?

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:29.900
Tiny percentage.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.060
So that's not what
makes you good.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.740
And it's my theory that what
makes a good violin maker is a

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.190
combination of natural talent,
lots of natural talents,

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:43.570
not just skill with your
hands but skill with observing

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:45.780
and figuring our what's good.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.440
But then the other
thing is you have

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.520
to have seen iconic instruments.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.660
If you don't ever see
a really good violin,

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.950
you'll never be able
to make one.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:58.530
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Because
it's so much tradition

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:04.620
and copying the excellent
fiddle makers,

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.750
violin makers, from before?

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.300
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: Also, there
are mathematical principles.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.830
The makers of the
17th and 8th century

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:17.780
when the world's greatest
violins were made,

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:20.650
were very interested
in mathematics,

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.560
the ones who could design
violins, and there were very few

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.370
who designed their violins.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.980
Stradivari was one.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:33.130
They were very interested
in the golden section;

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:36.920
the idea of two-thirds which
is dominant throughout nature.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:41.580
If you look at a sunflower
or any seeded thing,

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:48.270
you'll find that every circle
of seeds in a sunflower,

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:52.690
the inside one is two
to three on the outside.

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:56.140
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: That goes back
to Pythagoras, doesn't it?

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.440
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: Yes.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.740
Yeah, yeah.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:04.760
And also the scrolls are
based on the Nautilus.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:09.140
And again, in the
beginning you do see the two

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:12.410
to three relationship but it's
very important of the structure

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:17.040
of the body, and there're
measurements that work better,

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.390
you know, they just do.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:23.070
And if you have never
studied one--

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.820
Bob Bine, who unfortunately
we've lost,

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.340
was a great violin expert.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:34.350
And he used to tell
me that when he'd look

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.360
at an old Italian violin,
he immediately put it

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.510
into one of three categories.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:43.340
It was either made by one of
the very few violin makers

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.800
who could design a violin
from scratch, or it was made

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.190
by someone who worked in
their shop and knew how

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:53.930
to use the templates and forms
and tools, or it was made

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.000
by somebody who only saw one of
those violins and got some of it

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.580
and missed some of it.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.430
So I thought that that
was a very instructive way

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.140
to look at violins.

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.900
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Now, you have
acquired the largest collection

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.500
of American violins
over the years.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.180
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: I think
there have been larger ones,

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:18.100
but they were not
guided necessarily

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:23.160
by a knowledge of violin-making.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.140
My collection is of
prime examples of some

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.910
of the best makers, as
many of the best makers

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:31.210
that I could assemble.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:32.530
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So you've
curated it very closely

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:33.830
over the years?

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:35.130
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:37.850
Yeah, you know, I mean, as I
learned more, my taste improved

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.130
and the collection would
change in character.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.330
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And how
many violins do you have no

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:43.630
in this collection?

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:46.500
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg:
Right now it's 263.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.430
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: That's
very impressive.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:49.730
Well, what I'd like to do,

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:52.660
I know you've brought two
very talented violinists

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.090
with you today, one
that's classically trained

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:58.820
and one traditional player who
plays with you in your band.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.120
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: Yeah.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.860
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And what I'd
like to do is have them come

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:07.620
and show us what this
particular violin sounds like.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:08.920
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: I
think that's a good idea,

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.090
I picked this one--
one of the reasons is

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:13.030
because it has those qualities

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:17.800
that both classical
players and fiddlers like.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.190
And that's a rare
violin, usually they're

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:22.320
over to one side or the other.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.710
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So it's like
a continuum and some people--

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.010
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg:
Yeah, kind of, yeah.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.560
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: But this is
a good all-around instrument?

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.940
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: This is a
fine all-around instrument.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.460
I think they would
both tell you that.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.830
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Well, let's
hear what they have to say.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:36.130
Thank you so much.

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:37.430
&gt;&gt; David Bromburg: Sure.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:38.730
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Good morning!

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.030
Thank you so much for coming
to the Library of Congress.

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:44.690
I want to welcome Kenneth
Naito and Nate Growler,

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:49.330
both of whom play violin,
different types of violin

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:50.700
and we're going to discuss that.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:54.290
And we have an example from
the David Bromburg collection

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:58.950
of a Baltimore violin that
both Kenneth and Nate are going

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:03.020
to play on, and we'll just
maybe discuss the difference

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.160
between fiddles and violins.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.460
&gt;&gt; Nate Growler: Alright.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:10.350
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And today we
have a Luther Heiges violin.

00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:13.390
Is it important what kind of
instrument that you play on?

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:14.810
&gt;&gt; Nate Growler: Ah, yeah,
it's definitely important.

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:20.500
I mean, as a fiddle player,
I gravitate towards fiddles

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:24.800
that are a little
bit darker sounding.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.100
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Like deeper?

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:28.350
When you say darker
what do you mean?

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:29.650
&gt;&gt; Nate Growler: Darker--

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:31.580
deeper is probably a
good way to put it.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:35.920
I guess maybe one thing
that I tend to shy away

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.930
from is something
that's really bright.

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:40.750
I think maybe classical players

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:42.520
like a little bit
brighter sound, but I--

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:47.490
fiddle players, you know, we
always play in a mic, typically,

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:50.590
so we want something that's
kind of warmer, darker,

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:52.430
and we can just put a mic on
it and we don't really have

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:55.220
to worry about reaching the
back of the room so much.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.520
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Does
that blend better

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.290
with the ensembles
you play with?

00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:00.240
&gt;&gt; Nate Growler: Yeah, I
definitely think it does,

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.790
in bluegrass music with lots
of mid-range kind of things;

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:06.840
guitar and banjo, I
think it kind of fits

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.890
into the sound a little better.

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:10.190
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
Kenneth, what about you?

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:14.140
What's your ideal violins.

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:18.410
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Naito: Well,
as a classical violinist,

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:22.060
when I go search for a violin
I tend to go for a violin that,

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.640
for example, on the G
string which is the--

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.080
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Which
one's that?

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.380
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Naito:
This one right here.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.460
It's the one that has
the lowest pitch, right.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:33.800
Tends to have a more
deeper, more darker I guess

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.410
in a sense sound,
and more brighter

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:40.340
on the high pitched string
known as the E string.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.280
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Which
is the one on this side?

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.690
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Naito: This
one on this side, yeah.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:46.310
And so I like to
also have a violin

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:50.140
that has a very smooth sound
as well, something that--

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.900
because when you're on a
stage, the violin needs

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:58.440
to project very well because we
don't use a mic when we play.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.460
I also like to go for a violin
that has a very nice sound

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.300
that can project
through in a big hall.

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:10.250
And also has a nice
ringing tone to it as well.

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:11.550
So, yeah.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:12.850
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So--

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:14.150
&gt;&gt; Nate Growler: I think
this is a great balance

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:15.450
of those two things.

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:16.750
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Naito: Definitely:

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:19.030
&gt;&gt; Nate Growler: It's
got the darker qualities

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:22.040
but it has a really nice
focused kind of punch

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.640
to it where it projects.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.770
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Naito: Yeah,
I really want to--

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:28.980
this violin also has a
really nice smoothness to it

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.950
that is really hard to find
when looking for a violin.

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:35.000
Like, the tone when you
play, it doesn't break,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.670
it doesn't like jitter, it's
just when you put the bow on,

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.880
just very smooth sound, yeah.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.350
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Well, David's
point was that there are a lot

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:45.350
of great violins, fiddles,

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.670
whatever you call
them, made in America.

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:52.300
So, maybe if we could hear both
of you play a little bit on it,

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:57.030
people can get an idea of
this particular instrument

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.240
and the differences
in your styles.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.270
So who wants to go first?

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:03.230
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Naito: Well, you're
the one holding the violin, so--

the one on the end, actually.

Maybe--

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:10.450
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Naito: Okay.

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:11.750
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: We might do more
than one, so let's start with--

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.050
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Naito: Of course!

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:14.350
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: With Kenneth.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.790
Now, explain what you're doing
here because this is a part

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.840
of violin playing that
mostly audience doesn't see.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.140
What are you putting on?

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.440
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Naito: Of course,

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.540
so I'll be playing Johann
Sebastian Bach's solo sonata

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.600
for violin in G minor, I'll
be playing the first movement,

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.900
the adagio.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.200
So this--

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.030
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And you're
putting on a shoulder rest?

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.580
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Naito: Correct,
yes, this is a shoulder rest.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:40.870
This is to allow-- because
the violin is pretty thin,

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:44.600
so not necessarily it will
fit to a person's neck,

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.620
and so the shoulder rest
allows for the violin

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:51.740
to have a comfortable way
of placing the violin it.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.690
Because without it, it could be
quite wobbly, and so it can move

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:55.990
around while you play.

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:57.490
But with the shoulder rest,
it allows the violinist

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:00.710
to be comfortable and
also when they play not

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:02.120
to have the violin move around.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.570

you're playing what?

something completely different.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:39.930
Would you like to--

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:43.750
oh, so you're going to
take off your shoulder rest

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:47.400
and Nate you're going to put
on yours, so it's individual.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.820
&gt;&gt; Nate Growler: Yeah, they're
usually pretty individual.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.450
There's all kinds of varieties.

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:54.210
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Naito: Because people
will have different neck sizes

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:57.720
and shoulder width as well,
so you want to find the one

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.600
that best fits for you.

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.370
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah, originally
violinists did not play with--

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:03.740
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Naito: Correct, yeah.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:06.600
Well, yeah, the shoulder
rest wasn't invented

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.040
until much later, yeah.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.380
I mean, one side
effect to having one is

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.410
that sometimes the sound
can get a little more muted.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:16.010
Because when you
put it on it kind

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:18.880
of blocks the sound
from the violin.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.790
But ultimately you really
want to be comfortable

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.170
when you play the violin,

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:27.010
so that's why people
use the shoulder rest.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:30.770
&gt;&gt; Nate Growler: Yeah, I special
order an extra-long foot piece,

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:33.900

long neck so I try to fill

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:35.560

&gt;&gt; Kenneth Naito:
Well, actually,

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:05.460
since you mentioned
styles, and it's--

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:08.850
well, what you define
as classical,

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:13.600
there are many different eras of
music that define a classical.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.700
So like the piece
I played, the Bach,

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:17.040
that is a baroque style piece

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:22.790
because it was written during
the 1600's when Bach was alive.

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:26.600
And so there's Baroque, there's
also classical which is defined

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:30.590
as like Mozart, Mozart was a
classical, there's romantic,

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:35.550
just much more-- as the title
suggests, gets more romantic

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:36.850
in that it's, there's--

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:38.870
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Mid
to late 19th century.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.640

then there's 20th century music

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.350
which is the 1900's, and
then we have modern music.

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:48.640
So it's not just--
classical is a very broad term

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:52.790
for the different types of music
that are in the classical--

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:56.730
So, but sorry, going back
to your question, yeah,

00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:58.290
this violin is really good.

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:00.700
It was really good
for the Bach I think.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:07.230
Because as Nate said, the dark
tones help the mood of the piece

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:10.440
which is kind of somber,

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:14.790
but at the same time there's
a glimpse of hope and peace.

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:19.300
So I think this violin
really helped to make

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:20.920
that the mood of the piece.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.430

when I was just playing the tune
Garfield's Blackberry Blossom,

it's old time tune.

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:35.750
And there's kind of like a
rawness in old time music,

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:38.350
and this violin has
that sort of raw quality

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:40.710
to it, in a really good way.

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:44.880
Because it's a beautiful sound
it makes, but you're able

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:49.440
to kind of draw out this sort of
dark raw tone that I think fits

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:53.210
that style really really well.

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:58.860
Anyway, the Irish, it sounded
great, I mean-- it's sort of a--

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:03.110
I see Irish players kin of
really be able to draw a lot

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:06.010
of sound without using much bow,

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:08.470
and you can play the
strings really softly

00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:11.090
and get a nice sound.

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:14.480

create that dynamic thing well.

&gt;&gt; Nate Growler: I
think so, definitely.

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:26.410
Yeah.

00:34:26.410 --> 00:34:28.980
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Do either of
you play an American fiddle now?

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:30.370
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Naito:
Actually I do, yes.

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:33.200
The violin I'm currently
playing on is

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.610
by the maker named Jeff Philips.

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:38.540
It's a beautiful violin.

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:41.970
It was actually made
I think two years ago,

00:34:41.970 --> 00:34:44.430
so it's a very recent
violin, but he made it here--

00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:47.970
he lives in America
and he made the violin,

00:34:47.970 --> 00:34:50.030
it's a beautiful modern violin.

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:52.300
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So, he's
continuing the tradition

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:56.900
that David was talking about
of fine American violin-making.

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:58.200
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Naito: Oh yeah.

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.820
There are many amazing,
wonderful modern violins.

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:05.580
If you ask me this question ten
years ago I would be a little

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:07.550
bit questionable because I feel

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:11.890
like the violins made ten years
ago were still a little bit iffy

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:15.340
in terms of the quality,
but now the art

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:19.240
of violin making has really
gone up in quality and--

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.170
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: But this
was made 100 years ago.

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:25.550
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Naito: Oh, well, age
also helps to a violin as well.

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:27.740
As a violin gets
older, it also--

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.040
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: It matures.

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.610
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Naito: Yeah, the
sound also becomes much--

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:35.440
it changes as well and I think
this violin has very well.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.580
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Is there
anything else you'd like to say

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:40.040
about this particular violin?

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.840
&gt;&gt; Nate Growler: Can I have it?

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:45.310
[ Laughter ]

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:46.610
I'd love to own it.

00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:48.930
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: It's
a lovely instrument.

I want to thank you both
for coming down here.

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:54.090
Maybe since you played two
piece, maybe we can close

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:58.000
by asking Kenneth-- would you
mind playing one romantic piece,

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.300
perhaps?

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:00.600
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Naito: Of course!

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:05.460
Yeah, I'll play like a little
bit, excerpt from Carmen.

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.520
Carmen Fantasy by Waxman.

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:08.820
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Okay.

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.120
&gt;&gt; Kenneth Naito: I think

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:11.420
that would be a great
way to end this, so.

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:13.720
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Okay.
