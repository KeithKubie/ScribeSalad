00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.180
&gt;&gt; So for A or not B, I got that if A is ever true, then this has to be true,

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:13.260
because it's A or not B. When A is false the negation flips the value of B,

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.420
so it makes it true when B is false, but keeps it false when B is true.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.340
For not A and not B, that means that any time either A or

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.020
B is true, then this is all false. So when A is true, this is false.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.370
When B is true, this is false. When both are false, this becomes true,

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.770
because those negations flip the values of both A and B.
