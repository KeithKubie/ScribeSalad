00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.020
Good evening.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.940
My name is Francis Ma,
and I'm a Product Manager

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.930
in the Developers product group.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.900
There are many ingredients
in building a successful app.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.800
And one of these is
having a great design.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.310
Deign shapes your users'
experiences and motions

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.270
when using your app.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.530
And having great design not only
helps them utilize and navigate

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.370
through your app, but
it also delights them,

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.990
and provides a great experience
across different platforms

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.274
and form factors.

00:00:43.274 --> 00:00:44.690
Now, these were
some of the things

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.650
that we want as well from
our own apps from Google.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.940
And so we've created
Material Design.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.820
Material Design
is a design system

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.460
that governs interaction,
visual, and motion design

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.460
principles.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.620
And that means it guides
how your app should look,

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.340
feel, move, and adapt
across different platforms,

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.160
providing a
consistent experience.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.040
There are four principles to
building a Material Design app.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.990
First is about
tangible services,

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.130
where your interaction
cues are based

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.470
on how physical objects
work in the real world.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.230
Second is about
print like design,

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.650
where your content and
colors are bold, graphic,

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.110
and intentional.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.770
[INAUDIBLE] refined to fit the
look and feel of your brand.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.930
Third is about using
meaningful motion

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.220
to draw the user's
attention, and provide

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.080
a sense of continuity as
they move from one screen

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.080
to the next.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.420
And fourth is about
an adaptive design

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.760
that can scale and
have a consistent look

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.340
and feel across
different form factors,

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.240
whether you're building
for a phone, a tablet,

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.630
or even for a TV.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.500
And for your users,
that also means

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.710
that they don't have to
relearn your app as they

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.585
switch from devices.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.600
And through these
four principles,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.960
Material Design helps
you express your brand

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.980
through the use of these
bold and graphic colors.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.120
It also helps you
delight your users

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.590
with motion and a
sense of consistency

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.450
across different platforms.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.310
And most importantly, it helps
you increase user engagement

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.820
and drive growth, as we've
seen from many examples of apps

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.880
who've switched to
using Material Design.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.280
Here is a before and
after of Snapdeal

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.110
after going through
Material Design.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.610
And there are many
great examples

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.318
we've seen from
different developers that

00:02:47.318 --> 00:02:50.480
have seen great success
by going Material Design.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.580
For example, Trello is an app
that lets you organize things

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.240
by creating boards.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.740
And by going Material
Design they've

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.280
seen an increase in user
interaction and engagement.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.685
Another example is Pocket
Cast, a great podcast

00:03:06.685 --> 00:03:09.260
app that has seen
an increase in sales

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.680
after going Material Design.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.780
And those are just
some of the examples,

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.790
and we have many
more that we have

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.380
seen since the past
year and a half

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.180
introducing Material Design.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.710
There are over
hundreds of thousands

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.270
of apps that have
updated their design.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.370
And you can see some
of these great examples

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:33.060
at g.co/MaterialShowcase.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.540
And in addition, we've
been working hard

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.340
to help you implement
Material Design with resources

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.971
available on design.google.com.

00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:47.600
From there you'll find things
like the latest design specs.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.210
An icon assets library that
you can just take and put them

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.850
in your app.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.590
Also a devices tool that
provides the latest device

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.960
specs and metrics for things
like screen densities and sizes

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.259
for the most popular devices.

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:03.550
And for those of you who are
into interactive learning,

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.990
we have a Udacity course
on Material Design as well.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.570
And of course, for all the
developers in the room,

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.650
most importantly is
implementing this in code.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.220
And that's where we have
the Android Support Library,

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.779
with reusable UI components
that you can just drop in.

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.430
And with using the
support library,

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.960
it also means that
your app will work

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.210
on older versions of Android.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.393
So be sure to check
out design.google.com

00:04:30.393 --> 00:04:32.710
and learn more about
Material Design.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.520
So going beyond
design, I also want

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.940
to share with you some of
the tools and services that

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.680
can help you develop your app,
grow and engage an audience,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.400
and earn more money.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.760
Let's start with develop.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.320
These are tools and services to
help you build your app easier,

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.570
faster, and better.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.150
Android Studio.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.560
We've introduced Android Studio
2.0 just a few weeks ago.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.300
And this is a massive
update from the version 1.0

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.580
that we made a year ago.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.400
Specifically, we worked
really hard to improve

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.750
the speed and productivity
of using Android Studio.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.500
We've taken your
feedback on this.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.510
One of the notable
features is Instant Run.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.850
Instant Run lets you
take code and deploy that

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.000
into a running app, whether
it's a connected physical device

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.400
on an emulator.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.110
Here is an example of what
Instant Run looks like.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.780
As you make changes, you
can see that reflected

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.950
in your running app
in just seconds.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.740
So this is a great way to
really refine and iterate

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.580
your design UI, and to do that
in a very productive manner.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.060
In addition to
having Instant Run

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.010
we've also worked hard
to improve the end

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.580
to end full build
and deploy cycle.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.610
It used to take a minute.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.635
Now it takes only 20 seconds.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.730
And other great features
that we've been working on

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.280
is revamping our emulator.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.070
Again, we've heard your
feedback on the emulator,

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.990
and we've been working hard
to make this much faster

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.220
than before.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.790
With this new emulator,
it now runs faster

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.560
than most physical
Android devices.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.670
And we've also improved
the UI to make it easier

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:28.960
for you to emulate things
like device locations,

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.550
or to do things like
device orientation,

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.350
and even emulating phone calls.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.770
Another great addition
to Android Studio 2.0

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.082
is a new GPU profiler.

00:06:43.082 --> 00:06:45.040
Now, for those of you
who are building graphics

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.480
intensive apps, like games,
performance is critical.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.340
And oftentimes, debugging
your graphics code

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.110
is very time consuming.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.910
And so with this new GPU
profiler and debugger,

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.270
it records your
entire GPU stream,

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.370
and lets you play
that back, saving you

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.510
countless hours of debugging.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.530
It's a great thing to check out.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.260
And since Android Studio was
built on top of IntelliJ,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.470
their advancements
and enhancements

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.480
propels us even faster.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.510
And with the latest
version of Android Studio,

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.780
we've updated to
the IntelliJ 15,

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.492
which was just released
several weeks ago as well.

00:07:20.492 --> 00:07:22.450
And through this update
you'll see improvements

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.690
on usability and testing.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.250
So there are lots of great
features with Android Studio

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.620
2.0 updates.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.660
And for those rare developers
in this room who may be still

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.600
on our old deprecated
Eclipse tool,

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.520
now is a really good time
to check out Android Studio.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:46.020
This is all available through
our Canary channel today.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.120
In addition to
providing tools, we also

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.990
have cloud services to help
you build your app easier.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:55.330
Firebase is a mobile
back-end as a service that

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.610
provides a real
time database that

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.550
lets you easily store
data, and also synchronizes

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.110
across devices in real time.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:07.572
Also, it includes offline
handling automatically.

00:08:07.572 --> 00:08:09.030
Another great
feature with Firebase

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.610
is user authentication, which
lets you integrate things

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.410
like Google sign-in, Facebook
login, or your own custom email

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:18.340
and password login,
so that you don't

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.040
have to reinvent the wheel
of creating your own user

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.550
authentication.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:26.520
Another great feature is static
hosting, which is CDN backed

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.360
and SSL enabled static
hosting that lets you quickly

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.100
spin up a mobile web page, or
even surf your image assets.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.320
Through Firebase Google
provides us infrastructure

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.460
so that you don't have to worry
about that, or the scaling,

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.299
and you can really
focus on building

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:45.480
differentiated
features for your app.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.110
In addition to helping you
build easier and faster,

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.920
we also have tools to
help you build better.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.170
And this is where Cloud
Test Lab comes in.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:09:04.160
We know that over 44% of
bugs are discovered by users

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.000
after an app is launched,
and that 84% of users

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.430
would just abandon the
app after experiencing

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.450
an error for the second time.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.770
So ensuring your app is of high
quality before it is released

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:18.940
is very important.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:23.570
And with Cloud Test Lab, we help
you run automated and custom

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:27.080
tests through virtual
or physical devices

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.150
that are hosted in the
Google data centers.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:34.230
We provide access to the
most popular Android devices,

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.970
and also let you run
these tests in parallel.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.190
So you can test things in
different languages, device

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:43.120
orientations, or even in
different Android versions,

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.550
all in parallel.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:45.940
And doing this is very easy.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.210
All you have to do
is upload your APK.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.470
And with our robo
tests that means,

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.110
even if you have not
written any test case,

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.220
we automatically
crawl through the app

00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:00.250
and capture screenshots,
videos, and crash logs for you.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.030
And we also worked
hard to integrate this

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:05.480
into your product-- into
your development workflow,

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.100
and made it accessible through
Google Play in Android Studio.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.290
So when you publish an app
through the alpha or beta

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.450
channel of Google Play, we
will automatically run your APK

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.070
through the Cloud
Test Lab to help

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.200
you catch those errors
early, before it

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.090
gets broadly distributed.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.290
This feature is now in beta,
and we're continuing our roll

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.400
out in the coming months.

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:31.079
So I've talked about some tools
that help you develop your app.

00:10:31.079 --> 00:10:32.620
Let's switch gears
to talk about ways

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.500
to help you grow and
engage your audience.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.890
For those of you who are
building for the mobile web,

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:42.040
we've heard your feedback
and the challenges you

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.502
face in re-engaging your users.

00:10:44.502 --> 00:10:46.460
So we've been working
hard to extend the Chrome

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:50.220
platform to bring native like
capabilities to help you drive

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.670
re-engagement, with things
like push notifications even

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.030
if the browser is
closed, the ability

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.490
to add your app to the home
screen as if it was installed,

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:03.810
and let users quickly re-access
that from their home screen.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.950
And also the ability to
work offline, and 2G support

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.160
with service workers.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.940
Flipkart is a great
example of a company that

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.340
has taken advantage of
some of these capabilities

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.760
and created Flipkart Lite.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.450
We're going to have another
session later on today

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.940
to go more in depth and
talk about these features.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.910
So be sure to stay
tuned for that.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.930
Another great example
of re-engagement

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.570
is using push notifications.

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.760
And this where Google
Cloud Messaging comes in.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.760
Google Cloud Messaging
lets you send messages

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.620
from the cloud over
to your devices.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.890
And we've seen
incredible traction

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:42.680
of developers using this.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.700
Today there over
150 billion messages

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.940
that are processed each day
through Google Cloud Messaging.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.120
And there are over
750,000 apps using it.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.900
We're working really
hard to continue

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.880
to improve the
scalability of this

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.960
so that you don't have
to worry about managing

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.120
your own infrastructure.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.890
And over the past months,
we've expanded the capabilities

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.860
of Google Cloud Messaging
to not only work on Android,

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.360
but also work on Chrome and iOS.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.480
And we've introduced a feature
called Topic Messaging, which

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.320
lets you subscribe to multiple
devices to a specific topic

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.900
and send a message specifically
targeting to those devices.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.440
For example, if you're
building a news app,

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.670
you can send a
notification only to users

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:29.610
that are interested in
sports and not in finance.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.460
Google handles this fan out
for and the scaling for you

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.160
so you don't have to.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.500
Using Google Cloud
Messaging is free.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.040
And starting today
with Topic Messaging,

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.895
we've also made this unlimited.

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.510
Another great way to
drive re-engagement

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.820
is by making your content
available through Google

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:50.500
Search.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.660
And this is where app
indexing comes in.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:56.800
App indexing lets you index
your native app contents

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.680
and make that discoverable
through Google Search.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.720
We see over $100 billion queries
per day in Google Search.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.710
So this is a really
great way to get

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:11.260
in front of the users and drive
re-engagement of your app.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.790
So in addition to
your organic campaigns

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:16.830
to drive re-engagement, another
great way to expand your reach

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:18.070
is by using Google AdWords.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:24.290
With universal app campaigns
through Google AdWords,

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:28.620
we help you reach users
across Google Search, YouTube,

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.620
the Google Display
Network, and Google Play.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.630
Setting this up is very easy.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.910
You just have to create one
campaign, specify your budget,

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.420
the amount you want to
pay to drive and install.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.400
And we would automatically
handle this for you

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.800
to reach the most relevant users
across all of these channels.

00:13:49.351 --> 00:13:50.850
So I've talked about
some tools that

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.760
can help you develop your
app, services that can

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.490
help you grow your audience.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:58.970
So now let's switch gears to
talk about earning more money.

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:01.770
Now, many of you are building
apps not just for fun.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.065
And it's important to be
able to earn money and grow

00:14:04.065 --> 00:14:05.770
a successful business.

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:08.980
One of these ways to do
that is by using display ads

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.190
through AdMob.

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:15.480
There are over 650,000 apps
integrated with AdMob today.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.800
And we've seen
incredible traction here

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.450
from Indian developers
using AdMob,

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:24.140
with over 100,000
apps integrated.

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:29.050
We've been working hard to
make this platform smarter,

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:32.960
and the ability to provide a
more customized and tailored

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.390
experience for your users.

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:40.570
For example, for folks who
may have in-app purchases,

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:44.440
we help you figure out which
ones are likely buyers,

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:49.420
and be able to tailor the
experience to the buyers.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:53.630
So an example of that is through
the in-app purchase house ads.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:55.220
So when you offer
an in-app purchase,

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:59.310
some users may decide to buy,
and some of them may not.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:02.280
AdMob would automatically
figure out which ones of these

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.300
are likely buyers, and
only show these buyers

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:10.420
your in-app purchase offers,
so that you can continue

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.200
to monetize and keep them
retained in your app,

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.960
while for the rest
of the users you can

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.180
monetize through display ads.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.070
Another example of
AdMob is Mediation,

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:24.460
which means you can run ads
across multiple ad networks

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.760
through AdMob without
having to manage

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.820
the complexities of
these multiple networks

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.740
or having to integrate
multiple SDKs in your app.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:36.820
And we also have ad network
optimization features,

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.530
which we would
check in real time,

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:42.860
from all of these ad networks,
which of those is the highest

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.030
paying, every ad request.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:46.830
And we only then
show the highest

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:51.020
paying one in your app to help
you maximize your earnings.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:54.410
We're also investing
heavily into providing

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:58.120
ad formats that provide
great experiences on mobile,

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.770
with things like native ads that
can be integrated into your app

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.525
experience, or lightbox
ads that are interactive,

00:16:04.525 --> 00:16:07.260
or video ads where
users only need to watch

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:08.710
the videos if they choose to.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.355
Beyond ads another
great way to monetize

00:16:13.355 --> 00:16:16.110
is through in-app purchases.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.910
Now, we've heard
feedback in wanting

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:22.200
to have more flexible
pricing options,

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.970
especially to tailor that for
more of the local user needs.

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.990
And so a few months ago
we've introduced the ability

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:33.880
to lower your price points on
Google Play and make your app,

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:38.120
or your in-app content
for as low as 10 rupees.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.740
We've also been working hard
to expand additional payment

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:45.320
options, with prepaid
vouchers and gift cards.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.490
These are available in
over 500 retail stores

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:51.160
across 22 cities in India.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.320
And they're also available
on e-commerce sites

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.680
like Snapdeal and Amazon.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.445
And they can also be purchased
with cash on delivery.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.300
So we're super excited
about the opportunity

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.910
in working with all of you to
provide tools and products that

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:11.780
can help you develop great apps,
grow and engage your user base,

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.397
and to help you earn more money.

00:17:13.397 --> 00:17:15.480
You can check out the
things that I've just talked

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.771
about at developers.google.com.

00:17:20.396 --> 00:17:23.207
And now, I'd like
to introduce Kunal

00:17:23.207 --> 00:17:24.290
to talk about [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:26.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:27.940
Thank you.
