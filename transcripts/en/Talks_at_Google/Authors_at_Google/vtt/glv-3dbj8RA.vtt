00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:08.520
DARRYL JONES: Thank you very
much, thank you very much,

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.190
everybody.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.950
Thank you for coming and
thank you for inviting me.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.060
My name is Darryl Jones and
I'm interested in horror.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:21.360
And I did indeed spend
far too much of my young

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.050
and probably far too much of
my middle aged life, as well,

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.490
reading and watching horror.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.720
And one of the things
that those of us who

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.370
are interested in
horror, as scholars

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.690
like myself, as practitioners,
or as fans often

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.850
find ourselves having
to do is to defend

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.550
our chosen or beloved
area of interests.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.550
Defend it against those
who think that somehow

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:02.930
an interest in horror is
suspicious, is bad for you,

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.080
that anybody who is too
interested in watching

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.640
horror movies must be a sick
person in search of ideas.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.840
And I've noticed people in
the past sort of backing away

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.230
from me when I tell them
what I'm interested in

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.420
and what I work on.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.690
So one of the reasons I
wrote this book is as--

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.650
not a defense of horror
because I don't really think it

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.870
needs defending, as I
don't feel defensive

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:37.380
about it, but as an explanation
of the enduring and continuing

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.210
appeal of horror, of its
centrality to culture,

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.950
that civilization is
inconceivable without some idea

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.480
of horror, that many of our
religious rituals and religions

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.970
are founded on ideas which
resembling their interest

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.300
in blood sacrifice, for example,
in torture, in cannibalism,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.620
in subjects which we would
recognize from watching

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.540
and reading horror.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.650
It's part of what we are.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.620
It's part of what we do.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.840
It's also-- and this is what
I want to talk about today--

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.790
an explanatory mechanism for
the world in which we live.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.000
It helps us think
through the world,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.430
it's a response to the world,
particularly its anxieties,

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.700
the anxieties of a given
culture at a given time.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.630
So these are some
of the things that I

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.890
want to talk about today.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.160
Just a quick show of hands.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.170
Do we have any horror fans in
the congregation, first of all?

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.210
All right.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.040
There's a small amount.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.570
Do we have any people in the
audience that that find horror

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.000
difficult and are either, well,
frightened-- that's the point,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.110
I suppose--

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.160
or repulsed by it?

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.540
A couple, at least.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.860
OK.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.570
I want to try and convince
you, not that you've been wrong

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.055
all along, I will
try to convince you

00:03:23.055 --> 00:03:28.770
at least that I haven't
been wrong all along.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.360
So, yeah.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.940
This is a talk, then,
called Horror Today.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.407
And it arises out
of the book and it's

00:03:38.407 --> 00:03:39.990
a part of the last
section of the book

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.130
with some further extrapolation.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.299
So the talk is divided
into two parts.

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:45.840
And in the first
part, I want to look

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.480
in general terms at the
location of horror today,

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.530
at least where I think
it is, where we are.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.550
I'll end with a few pointers
to the future, a very dangerous

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.890
and very rash thing to do.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.840
And in the second
part, I want to look

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.600
at one particular subgenre which
is climate change horror, eco

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.890
horror.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.460
This is horror at its most
urgent and its most relevant.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.809
If, as I believe,
we look to horror,

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:14.850
it can tell us things
about the world in which we

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.190
live as a means of interpreting
the world in which we live,

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.490
we would expect,
given that this is

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.710
our major contemporary anxiety.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.040
I believe we would
expect that to be

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.220
quite a lot of eco horror.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.550
So it offers for me a
powerful contemporary example

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.310
of the importance of horror
as a means of approaching

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.570
contemporary anxieties.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.460
And more generally,
I think, as a way

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.000
of asking serious intellectual
and political questions.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.540
So another thing I
believe is that horror

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.210
is-- as well as being
a visceral medium,

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.940
it is also an intellectual one.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.400
So where is horror today?

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.770
This is the first
part of my talk.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.000
The location of horror, I
think, moves with culture.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.180
We may be seeing signs,
we are seeing signs

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.180
that it is moving
with geopolitics,

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.300
away from an American axis,
important Hispanic horror,

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.600
important Asian horror
in this century.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.670
It may also be that
in my, at least,

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.550
concentration of horrors,
traditional media, fiction

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.760
and film, that we may not
be looking-- if we're not

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.830
looking in the wrong
places, we might be looking

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.890
in all the right places either.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.180
A viewer of mainstream
Hollywood cinema

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.210
in the early 21st
century might well

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.770
have concluded that the genre
in this manifestation at least

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.150
was creatively moribund,
dead, or undead.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.300
Cinematically, the
US film industry

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.350
appeared content to
allow younger directors

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.950
to plunder its back
catalog of horror films

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.680
in what seems like an endless
recycle of sequels, remakes,

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:10.510
and reboots, a corporate
production line, a wasteland.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.490
And most particularly,
American cinematic horror

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.540
revisited landmark
films of the 1970s.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.680
And the 70s does seem to be the
key decade for american horror.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:28.880
In a 2016 Time Out experts poll
of the 100 best horror films,

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.300
6 of the top 10 films were from
the 1970s, and a further three

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.040
from 1968, 1980, and 1982.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:47.130
68 was Rosemary's Baby, 80 was
The Shining, 82 was The Thing.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.140
So around the 70s.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.170
The only one outside of
that that orbit, I suppose,

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.095
was from the early
60s, was Psycho.

00:06:54.095 --> 00:07:00.300
But apart from that, the top
10 was in a sort of long 1970s.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.820
So they were, for example--

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.440
or they have been in this
century-- for example,

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.590
remakes of the Texas
Chainsaw Massacre,

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:13.380
1984, remade in 2003 with
subsequent sequels, as well.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.640
Wes Craven's The Hills Have
Eyes, originally from 1977,

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:22.250
remade in 2006.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:29.570
Carrie, 1976, the great Brian
de Palma movie remade in 2013.

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.140
This one starring people
you've actually heard of,

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.160
Chloe Grace Moretz,
Julianne Moore, and others.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.500
And even, unbelievably,
unbelievably to me, at least,

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.490
two of the most notorious films
in the ultra controversial rape

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:50.830
revenge cycle of the 1970s,
Wes Craven's Last House

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.020
On The Left.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.680
Keep telling yourself,
it's only a movie, only

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.070
a movie, only a movie.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:03.460
And the first came out
in 1972, remade in 2009.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.660
And-- oh, this is
Gaylord St. James,

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:12.340
the star of Lost House
On The Left in 1972.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.490
I just put him in because I
want to draw your attention

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.950
to the fact that there is
an actor out there called

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:21.680
Gaylord St. James, so
Gaylord St. James, everybody.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.800
So this Lost House On The Left.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.360
And even I Spit On Your
Grave, originally from 1978,

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.970
remade in 2010.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:36.340
Now, some of these 1970s films,
in and around their original

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:40.450
release, I think, particularly
Last House On The Left, Texas

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.520
Chainsaw Massacre, and
I Spit On Your Grave

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:50.730
were viewed as genuinely
dangerous cultural artifacts,

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:58.380
drawing the horrifying gaze of
legislators, judges, censors,

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.072
cultural commentators,
and the media.

00:09:01.072 --> 00:09:01.780
They were banned.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:05.520
These were amongst the
original video nasties

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.880
banned by the Video
Recordings Act of the 1980s

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.670
on the grounds
that simply viewing

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:17.400
these films could incite
viewers to go and commit

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.630
acts of violence.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:22.600
Horror has always had
an uneasy relationship,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.900
and sometimes quite a creative
relationship, with censors.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.000
And I would regret--

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.340
and I think many
people would regret

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.750
if that relationship
wasn't there

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.560
because there is a
creative edginess to it.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.530
Amd the history of
horror has always also

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:40.950
been the history of outraged
responses to horror.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.300
Won't somebody think
of the children?

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.030
You know?

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:48.300
But the point that
I want to make now

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:53.130
with these remakes
of the 21st century,

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.320
their post-millennial
counterparts

00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:03.360
tend to come and go unnoticed
because they don't matter.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.260
We've lost something.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.300
We've really lost something.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.220
What have we got instead?

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:14.290
In terms of American horror,
well, Oren Peli's Paranormal

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:19.220
Activity from 2007, which
many of you will have seen,

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:23.050
I'm sure, was the most
successful horror film,

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:27.460
American horror film of the 21st
century, if not of all time,

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:31.210
until the release
of It last year.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:34.060
In profit and budget
terms, Paranormal Activity

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:38.270
may be the most successful
movie ever released.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.620
And viewed in
isolation, this film

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.590
is an exemplar of
post-millennial kind

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:47.550
of unhorrific horror.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.550
It relies firstly on a
found footage technique,

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.850
which following the success of
the Blair Witch Project in 1999

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:58.840
has been overused in horror
films to the point of cliche.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.850
And Blair Witch
itself, I should note,

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.340
although undeniably
brilliant, had

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.950
adapted his own found
footage technique

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:08.830
from the great Cannibal
Holocaust, the most notorious

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:12.700
of all the video nasties.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:17.200
Paranormal Activity began a
self-recycling franchise which

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.380
has produced six films to date.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.870
And there's nothing
distinctively contemporary

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:27.790
about this, nor is it
inherently problematic.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.540
There's the element
of repetition,

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.350
of seeing the same thing
over and over again,

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:36.070
is an important concept,
an important aspect

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.990
of the pleasure we get
from watching horror.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:42.020
One of the points I've
made before is that nobody,

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:47.470
and I mean nobody, went to
see Friday the 13th Part

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:51.970
9 or Saw 6 expecting
a completely different

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.220
cinematic experience
from the one that

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:59.400
got when they went to see
Friday the 13th part 8 or Saw 5.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.470
What people want is to see
the same thing but slightly

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.130
different.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.900
And the notion of a
cinematic horror franchise

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.380
goes back, at least as far as
universal horror, in the 1930s,

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.080
but viewed in the context
of a horror cinema, which

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.800
seems to have run out of
ideas, this repetition

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:25.450
may be just another sign
of creative bankruptcy.

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:30.410
And Paranormal Activity is
also the foremost exponent,

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:33.890
foremost modern exponent, of
the cinematic technique which

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:37.700
is most characteristic of
post-millennial American

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:43.430
horror, the jump shock or jump
scare, long periods of silence,

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:47.760
tense silence punctuated
by loud noises.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.710
What film critic
Mark Kermode has

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:54.850
termed the
quiet-quiet-bang technique,

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.890
and sometimes known in
cinematic parlance as the bus,

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:03.270
in honor of a celebrated film
scene in the 1941 Val Lewton,

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.450
Jacques Tourneur "Cat
People," in which

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:08.540
a scene of great tension is
broken by the loud hissing

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.770
of buses' breaks.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:14.580
Now, the jump shock is
undeniably effective,

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:19.110
but as a dominant technique it's
not horror or terror in the way

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:21.990
that these terms have
come to be understood.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:29.040
Anyone can sneak up behind
you, shout boo very loudly,

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.560
and make you drop
your ice cream.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.440
But this says nothing about
the state of your soul,

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:38.400
your place in the universe, the
social function of violence,

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.560
the evils of
political inequality,

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.370
nor any of the other
serious questions

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.785
that horror is
accustomed to asking.

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:52.440
So we shouldn't be looking
in American cinema,

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.190
but we might want to
look in Asian cinema.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:55.565
We shouldn't be
looking primarily

00:13:55.565 --> 00:13:57.490
in mainstream American
cinema, but there

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:58.960
are other places to look.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.760
And here, obviously,
is one of them.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:07.180
One that was released in
1992, Fran Rubel Kuzui's film

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:12.280
Buffy the Vampire Slayer
received mixed reviews

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:17.040
and passed without much notice.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:21.480
Unsatisfied with both the
film and its reception,

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.080
it's right that Joss
Whedon tried again,

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.480
adapting it for television.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.760
The first episode of Buffy the
Vampire Slayer was broadcast

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.320
on March the 10th, 1997--

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.500
Can it really be that long ago?

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:40.100
21 years ago-- with
Sarah Michelle Geller.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.100
There she is, of course.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:45.050
An authentic 90s scream
queen in the title role.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:49.280
In that very same year, 97,
she also appeared in the neo

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:55.400
slasher films I Know What You
Did Last Summer and Scream 2.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.620
So looking back from the
perspective of 21 years,

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.720
it's tempting to
view these moments

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:05.150
as marking a tectonic
shift in american horror.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:12.960
Playing over seven
seasons from 97 to 2003,

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.770
Buffy developed into
a work and a world

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:21.210
of considerable complexity,
intelligence, and imagination.

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:26.700
The very antithesis of the
risk-averse, compromised,

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:30.600
moribund condition
of much mainstream

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.060
American cinematic horror
around the millennium,

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:36.990
which seemed incapable of
ever surprising its audience

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:38.670
or delighting them.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:42.900
Buffy, of course, also came
into being with the internet

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.420
and so its success
was partly augmented

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:49.620
by the rise of the blogosphere
and by the online culture

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.760
of fandom.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:57.030
It also captured the
academic imagination.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:59.490
The subdiscipline
of Buffy studies,

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:03.510
combining institutional
academic criticism and theory

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:07.020
with fandom and unlicensed
criticism in the public sphere,

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:11.790
has produced a small library
of often very sophisticated

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:14.110
cultural and textual analysis.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:23.130
Buffy was one of the early signs
that the millennial generation

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:25.920
was experiencing what
is often characterized

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.910
as a or the golden
age of television,

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:35.190
capital G, capital A,
capital T. From the Sopranos,

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:40.290
1990 to 2007, to The
Wire, 2002 to 2008,

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:48.050
to Breaking Bad, 2008 to 13,
to Game of Thrones, 2011 to 18.

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:50.520
The medium, television,
has shed much

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:54.750
of its cultural inferiority
complex relative to film.

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:01.120
First broadcast
in 2013, Hannibal

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.690
took the continuing story
of our great modern demon

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:08.500
to creative heights
seemingly foreclose the film

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.609
after Brett Ratner's
unforgivably lampoon 2002

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:16.240
adaptation of Red Dragon.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.109
With seasons entitled Murder
House, Asylum, Coven, Freak

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:24.710
Show, Hotel, Roanoke,
Cult, and others,

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:28.460
American Horror Story,
first broadcast in 2011,

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.520
engages with the
satisfyingly familiar tropes

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.600
and locations of horror.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.750
We like it because we know it.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:42.710
The Louisiana-set first season
of True Detective, 2014,

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:47.739
drew explicitly on the history
of American weird fiction,

00:17:47.739 --> 00:17:49.280
most particularly
with its references

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.010
to the Lost Land of
Carcosa, originally

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:55.100
to be found in Robert W Chambers
book, the King in Yellow,

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:56.600
and in the works
of Ambrose Bierce.

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:06.960
However, from a
historical perspective,

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.170
this golden age of
television might come

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:13.310
to be viewed as a last gasp.

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:15.350
It's a product of
a moment in which

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.320
the dominant cultural
medium of the second half

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.470
of the 20th century,
television, began

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:24.380
to be subsumed within the
dominant cultural medium

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.375
of the 21st, the internet.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:35.750
So what might authentic
internet horror look like?

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:38.990
This might be a place to
look for horror today.

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:41.090
Well, one place to
look, for example,

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:45.680
might be in podcasts, such as
the hugely enjoyable fake radio

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.350
show, Welcome to Night Vale,
or the riotously inventive Down

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.800
Below the Reservoir.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.580
But the brilliance
of these podcasts

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:58.090
rests on the actually
rather 20th century notion

00:18:58.090 --> 00:18:59.890
that they are produced
and controlled

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:04.490
by highly creative auteurs,
Joseph Kink and Jeffrey

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:09.600
Cranor for Night Vale, Graham
Tuckwell for Reservoir.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.830
Another distinctive internet
product, meme culture,

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:16.380
has the potential to
be all together more

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:22.680
dissented and anarchic, and
it may be uncontrollable.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.630
Here is one example,
a famous one.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.900
On June the 10th, 2009,
as many of you will--

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.650
I know-- be aware,
a pair of photo

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:38.820
shopped images appeared on
Something Awful, a comedy

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:42.540
website and online forum.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.550
Credited to Victor
Surge, the photographs

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:47.850
showed two groups of
children photographed

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:49.960
in black and white.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.920
In the background,
blurred and indistinct,

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.350
was a tall figure
dressed in black

00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:00.480
and seemingly with
tentacles for arms.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.150
This was, of course,
the Slender Man.

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:06.920
And beneath the images
with these captions,

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:13.080
beneath the image on your left
here, "We didn't want to go,

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:17.610
we didn't want to kill them,
but its persistent silence

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:22.200
and outstretched arms
comforted us and surrounded us

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.010
at the same time."

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:27.380
And for the image on
the right, "One of two

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.870
recovered photographs from
the Sterling City library

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:32.540
blaze, notable for being
taken the day which

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.910
14 children vanished
and for what is

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.520
referred to as the Slender Man.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:41.150
Deformity cited as film
defects by originals.

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:43.850
Fire at library
occurred one week later.

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:47.510
Actual photograph
confiscated as evidence.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:54.690
1986 photographer Mary Thomas
missing since June 13th, 1986."

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:58.230
And you can just see the figure
in the back of both photographs

00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.730
there.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:10.150
Lacking any kind of central
controlling narrative

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:16.280
beyond a vague but palpable
sense of menace and threats,

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.720
particularly to
children, the Slender Man

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:26.740
took on a life of its own as
a self-replicating evolving

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:31.510
internet meme recurring first
in user-generated creepy

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:35.970
pasta, online fiction, and
art, and in YouTube videos,

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:40.240
video games, and more generally
as an elusive cultural

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.100
reference.

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:48.230
On May the 31st, 2014,
as you may well know,

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:51.320
two 12-year-old
girls from Wisconsin

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:57.110
stabbed a classmate 19
times after a night reading

00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:00.074
online Slender Man creepy pasta.

00:22:00.074 --> 00:22:01.490
They did this,
they said, in order

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:04.290
to become the Slender
Man's servants,

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:07.160
to become his proxies.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.550
Fears, real fears,
that the Slender Man

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:17.710
seems capable of infecting
reality and transforming it

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:21.850
have led to the most recent
of horror's ongoing series

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:24.310
of moral panics.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:29.370
The case went to trial
in September 2017.

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:32.850
And the defense attorney claimed
that the girls-- and I quote--

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:36.540
"swirled down into
madness together."

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:39.690
The defendants, Morgan
Geyser and Anissa Weier

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:42.450
were sentenced to 40
years and 25 years

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:44.760
respectively in
mental hospitals,

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:51.030
the maximum sentences possible
for their respective crimes.

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:53.550
So it falls on each
generation then

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:57.360
to create its own
monsters, or at least

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:01.290
its own unique iterations
of monstrosity.

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:06.150
There's a good reason why
vampires cast no reflections

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:12.440
in the mirror, it's because what
looks back at us is ourselves.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.900
We invest in monsters,
our own anxieties,

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.200
but sometimes also
our own desires

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.690
inarticulable in respectable
social discourse.

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:25.970
Monsters are the body for our
dreams and our nightmares.

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:29.780
But the internet is
too vast and too fast

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:33.330
for a talk of this length
or for a book of any size.

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:39.170
It's given horror an infinite
library in which to play,

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:43.010
an endless labyrinth
in which to hide.

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:47.870
The Slender Man is its most
distinctive monster thus far,

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:51.380
he's the scariest thing in
ages, but there will be others.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:58.750
Part 2.

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:09.130
The world is dying.

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:14.400
It's our fault. And unless
we take radical action now,

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.630
it will be too late to
do anything about it.

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:20.320
The United Nations
Intergovernmental Panel

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.960
on Climate Change
report produced

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.850
this month, a
couple of weeks ago,

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:28.730
made for terrifying reading.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:33.030
We are looking into
an apocalyptic future

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:37.750
of blistering summers, melting
ice caps, drowned cities,

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:42.860
whole portions of the planet
left effectively uninhabitable.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:49.120
The death of coral, the
decimation of insect life,

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:53.590
dramatic resource scarcity,
unprecedented political

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:57.010
upheaval, population
migration on a scale we've

00:24:57.010 --> 00:25:01.790
never seen before,
food and water wars,

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:06.910
the potential breakdown
of any social order.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:10.390
Increasingly, many
of us have the sense

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:14.680
that we're living
through a horror movie.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:20.100
The Walking Dead are
everywhere, on our screens

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:24.360
and at our ports, on our
streets and in our homes.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.970
There's a widespread
sense of helplessness,

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:30.800
a wholesale lack of agency.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.040
Horror, in fact, is the cultural
mode, as I've suggested,

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:38.570
uniquely suited to
articulating popular anxieties

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:40.860
in an understandable form.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.900
And these are uniquely
anxious times.

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.480
Those of us who
watch and read horror

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:50.230
know that it is not
escapism for sickos,

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:53.950
as I suggested, but an
urgent explanatory mechanism

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:57.290
for the world around us.

00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:00.440
President Donald
Trump's decision in 2017

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.380
to withdraw America
from the Paris Agreement

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:08.120
on Climate Change Action
followed a sustained campaign

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:13.360
of climate change denial
by the American right,

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.310
which brought together
the economic interests

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:17.470
of certain parts of
corporate America

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:20.770
with the cultural anti-modernity
of the evangelical religious

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:21.940
right.

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:26.330
While some media
outlets, such as the BBC,

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:30.200
have worked hard-- and in a way
which has often been terribly

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.580
self-damaging to
maintain a balanced view,

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:39.170
the response to global
warming in horror fiction film

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:41.480
and television over
the past two decades

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.700
has been virtually univocal.

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:47.120
Climate change is real,
the Earth is warming,

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.060
this is a man-made
disaster, our survival

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:53.140
is under severe threat.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:58.210
Thus, for example, in M Night
Shyamalan's The Happening,

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:02.260
in 2008, plants begin
to release toxins

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:05.500
which are deadly to humanity.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.560
Construction worker Curtis,
played by Michael Shannon,

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:12.250
begins to have apocalyptic
visions of a coming storm which

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:17.420
will decimate humanity in Jeff
Nichols' Take Shelter in 2011.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:22.300
And the film closes with drops
of black rain, maybe oil, maybe

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:25.230
something altogether more
uncanny, falling from the sky.

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:33.170
Steroid-laden excrement
dumped into Chesapeake Bay

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:35.630
from an industrial
chicken rearing plant

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:39.320
creates a mutated strain
of flesh eating parasites

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:43.790
in Barry Levinson's genuinely
disturbing The Bay from 2012.

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:47.390
And the film is an extrapolation
of real-life environmental

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:51.860
concerns that manure runoff
from intensive poultry farms

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:55.610
was contributing to a number
of ecological dead zones

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:58.450
in Chesapeake Bay.

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:02.530
In Jeff Vandermeer's novel,
Annihilation, from 2014,

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:04.720
a team of scientists
investigates

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:08.590
the mysterious Area
X, a sealed-off area

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:10.830
of unknowable nature.

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:12.820
Vandermeer's novel
has been compared

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:15.520
to the work of the
great American ruralist,

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:19.210
philosophical ruralist, Henry
David Thoreau, whose 1851

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:23.500
book Walden is the great
American literary meditation

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:29.260
on the relationship between
humanity and the natural world.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.840
Given widespread anxieties about
the melting of the polar ice

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.950
caps, it's not surprising
that the 21st century

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:40.690
has produced a good deal of
arctic and Antarctic horror.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:45.460
Polar gothic is a recurring
subgenre of horror,

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:50.170
drawing on the long unexplored,
and thus fundamentally

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:53.920
imaginary, geography
of the polar regions.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:57.070
A number of books of
horror and also a fantasy

00:28:57.070 --> 00:29:00.070
have been set in the far
northern and far southern

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:01.310
latitudes.

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:03.100
Veneration of
Frankenstein, celebrating

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:06.430
its 200th anniversary this
year, takes place on board

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:10.510
the ship of the polar
explorer Robert Walton.

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:13.660
At the close of the
novel, Victor Frankenstein

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:17.110
heads out onto the
ice towards the pole

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:19.710
in pursuit of his monster.

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:22.270
Edgar Allan Poe's only
novel, The Narrative

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:24.520
of Arthur Gordon
Pym of Nantucket

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:29.110
follows its protagonist on
his inexorable journey south

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:32.980
towards its Antarctic climax.

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.680
Fresh out of medical
school, Arthur Conan Doyle

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.230
served for a time
as a ship's doctor

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:40.930
on a Greenland whaling voyage.

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:43.330
His story, The Captain
of the Pole Star,

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:46.690
is an imaginative
response to this voyage.

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:51.220
Heavily influenced by Poe,
HP Lovecraft's great novella,

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:53.710
At The Mountains
Of Madness, charts

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:59.560
the terrifying discoveries
of an Antarctic expedition.

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:03.540
All three film
versions of The Thing,

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:06.910
1951, there in the
middle, 1982, 2011,

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:11.710
so another contemporary remake
based on John W Campbell's 1938

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:13.490
novella, Who Goes There?

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:15.670
are set in polar latitudes.

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:23.710
Antarctica in 1938, 1982, and
2011, northern Alaska in 1951.

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:27.310
So polar horror, then,
is not a new phenomenon,

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:30.760
but it has gained
exponentially in intensity

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:35.110
in the last decades
Roland Emmerich's The Day

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:39.030
After Tomorrow opens
in the Antarctic,

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:43.990
where a slice of the ice shelf,
quote, the size of Rhode Island

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:45.730
breaks off due to
global warming.

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:47.950
A harbinger of the
climatic disaster

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:52.270
to follow in which the northern
USA becomes uninhabitable

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:56.290
and Mexico gives shelter
to American refugees.

00:30:56.290 --> 00:31:01.180
This was the film which spurred
former Vice president Al

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:05.230
Gore to make his own influential
climate change documentary

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:09.220
film, An Inconvenient
Truth, in 2006.

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:15.070
And in 2017, a slice of the
Antarctic Larsen C ice shelf

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:17.080
did break off.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.770
It was larger than Delaware,
which is half as big, again,

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:21.880
as Rhode Island.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:26.950
So we've out-distanced our
fantasy already in 10 years.

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:32.260
In Larry Fesseden's film,
The Last Winter, from 2006,

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.950
an eco horror reimagining
of Algernon Blackwood's

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:39.340
classic work of Canadian
horror, The Wendigo.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:42.970
In the last winter, the
melting of the permafrost

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:45.970
releases supernatural
entities, first

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:49.120
into a remote oil drilling
camp on the northern slope

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:53.830
of Alaska, and then it
is implied worldwide.

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:56.530
When Abby, played by
Connie Salas, the camp's

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:58.960
only survivor, wakes
up in hospital,

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:03.440
she hears news reports
about widespread disaster.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.390
A doctor in the
room next door has

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:08.330
hanged himself
stepping outside, she

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:11.980
walks through puddles of
water, the snow has melted.

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:18.520
The hospital in which Abby wakes
at the end of The Last Winter

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:23.130
is presumably in Barrow,
Alaska, the northernmost city

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:25.450
in the US.

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:30.670
Barrow's isolation, cut off
from the world for long periods,

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:34.420
is what makes it vulnerable
to a vampire attack in 30

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:38.730
Days of Night in 2007.

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:42.090
The Last Winter's trope
of the melting polar ice

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:47.490
releasing forces inimical to
humanity recurs in The Thaw,

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:51.720
2009, with Val Kilmer
as a climate scientist.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:56.580
The world is safe with Val
Kilmer as a climate scientist.

00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:03.850
And also in the TV series
Fortitude, of 2015.

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:08.620
Fortitude was set in the
Svalbard archipelago,

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:12.660
the northernmost inhabited
place in the world.

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:16.870
And Svalbard is also the setting
for parts of Philip Pullman's

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:21.540
young adult fantasy
Northern Lights in 1995,

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:24.490
and for Michelle Pfeiffer's
remarkable retro ghost story

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:25.810
Dark Matter in 2010.

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:29.320
And there's me in
Svalbard last year.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:35.290
Svalbard is also the home
of the Global Seed Vault,

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:38.590
protected there in
the permafrost in case

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:41.500
we ever need to
reseed the planet

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:46.450
in the wake of an
environmental catastrophe.

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:50.550
In 2016, unusually
high temperatures,

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:53.050
those same ones that
are causing the icecaps

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:58.210
to melt around Svalbard,
caused a flood of melt water

00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:02.560
in to the vault's tunnels.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:10.300
Meanwhile, back at
home, on our screens,

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:14.699
in Game of Thrones
the Night King

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:20.460
and his zombie army sweep
down from the frozen North

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:26.010
marching relentlessly towards
the Ice Wall that has kept them

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:29.340
at bay for millennia
and threatening

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:32.940
to wipe out humanity.

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:37.710
At the end of the last episode,
as many of you I'm sure

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:43.745
will know, an undead dragon
laid waste to the wall.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.714
We are all holding our breath
to see what happens next.

00:34:56.139 --> 00:34:58.052
Thank you very much.

00:34:58.052 --> 00:35:01.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:05.155 --> 00:35:06.030
SPEAKER 2: Excellent.

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:06.530
Thank you.

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:09.599
I think we have some time for
questions, about 20 minutes.

00:35:09.599 --> 00:35:11.890
If you'd like to ask a
question, just put your hand up.

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:14.009
I'll come around and
get you a microphone.

00:35:14.009 --> 00:35:14.800
AUDIENCE: You know?

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.350
Maybe it's just me, but I've
noticed that lately there's

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:20.920
been a trend in
horror to go for more

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.740
atmospheric kind of horror.

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:26.350
So I'm thinking of
movies like Hush,

00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:28.930
the adaptation of Gerald's
Game, and most notably, I

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:30.730
think, The Haunting
of Hill House, which

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:32.050
is absolutely incredible.

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:32.800
DARRYL JONES: Don't
tell me about it

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.590
cause I haven't watched it yet.

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:34.465
AUDIENCE: You should.

00:35:34.465 --> 00:35:35.220
It is incredible.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:35.890
But, yeah.

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:37.540
Anyway, so I was
wondering, where

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:38.890
do you think this comes from?

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:42.880
The shift towards atmospheric
horror rather than gore?

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:47.770
DARRYL JONES: And I would say
it's there in fiction as well.

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:52.330
The old-fashioned
ghost story is back.

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:55.630
There was a time,
maybe a decade ago,

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:59.380
when the horror sections
had pretty much disappeared

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:03.580
from Waterstones and other
commercial bookstores,

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:04.660
but now they're back.

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:08.760
And old-fashioned ghost stories
have made a real comeback.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:13.000
And you're absolutely right
about that this is something

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.230
that relies on the creation
of an unsettling mood

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:18.665
or atmosphere.

00:36:18.665 --> 00:36:20.540
There's a couple of
things to say about this.

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:22.720
I think the first
thing to say is,

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:30.160
I think we've realized that
the jump tropfest is overdone,

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.040
it's a dead end, it
has nothing-- there's

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.360
no surprise left in that one.

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:43.890
Ultraviolence and
gore is many things,

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:48.630
but it's not generally scary.

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:53.720
It's shocking, it's
sometimes funny,

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:57.230
but it's rarely frightening.

00:36:57.230 --> 00:37:01.580
I think the supernatural tale--

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:05.960
and, you know, although
I've been saving Hill House,

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:13.222
in fact, for the time when
I have a spare few days.

00:37:13.222 --> 00:37:17.940
But I certainly know Shirley
Jackson's original novel

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:18.930
very well.

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:25.200
And these are tried
and tested narratives.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.260
We know they work,
we know they work

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:31.680
in a strangely old fashioned
way because the sense

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:36.240
of the uncanny, of feeling
not at home with ourselves,

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:40.410
of not knowing whether the
foundations on which we base

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:42.876
our perception are real or not.

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:50.310
This is unsettling and
that's frightening.

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:52.280
And I think one of
the things we're doing

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:59.990
is rediscovering our sense of
this kind of unsettling fear.

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:05.550
So I think that's what
it is, that it works.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:08.320
AUDIENCE: So climate change is
announcing itself for a while,

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:14.550
so there has been some time
to adapt this for horror.

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:17.790
Do you see any other
trends in horror

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:23.670
that are based on the current
developments in the world?

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:25.770
DARRYL JONES: Yes, I do.

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:29.460
There's quite a few of them.

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:42.490
We've seen interesting and very
kind of pointed development

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:48.160
of particularly american
horror arising out

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.890
of racial tensions
and inequality,

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:52.600
from Get Out to Detroit.

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:54.390
And Detroit is
definitely a horror film.

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:55.660
I don't know whether
you've seen--

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:57.160
I mean, it's a
Kathryn Bigelow film,

00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:00.520
and Kathryn Bigelow is used to
mixing different kinds of modes

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.690
and genres in her
film, as anybody

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:06.230
who's ever seen Point Break will
know what kind of film is it.

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:10.120
And so Detroit is partly
a historical drama, partly

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:13.240
a cop movie, but very
largely a horror film.

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:16.560
I think a kind of home
invasion horror film.

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:23.710
So there's a new strain
of american racial horror,

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:25.750
I suppose we could call it.

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:29.800
The most obvious one to
me is-- and, again, this

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.920
is going over the
last decade or so,

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:35.900
since the global financial
crash of a decade ago.

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.810
It's no accident, I
don't think, that we

00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:42.760
have seen a resurgence of
interest in Zombie culture.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:43.940
What are zombies?

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:47.200
They are mindless,
undifferentiated, lumpen

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:51.100
proletarian mass completely
without any kind of control

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:54.700
or agency over their own lives,
they are completely powerless.

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.370
And many of us
have felt that way

00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:59.980
in the wake of all of
the financial crises,

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:06.280
that we are enthralled to powers
beyond our comprehension which

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.020
we have absolutely no control.

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:13.300
So the feeling of being
the undead, or the living

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:18.610
dead, or the Walking Dead is
a very pressing one, I think.

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:23.230
So from Max Brooks' World War
Z, which slightly predates

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:26.320
the global financial crash, to
things like The Walking Dead

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.900
itself on television, to
films like The Girl With All

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:32.920
The Gifts, there's a lot of it
to the proliferation of zombie

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:36.430
walks in cities, something
I'm kind of interested

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:41.770
in, to online adverts
for zombie-proof homes.

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:43.280
All these kinds of things.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:48.320
There's a real sense that the
zombie apocalypse is upon us,

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:51.520
because in some ways it kind
of is, as a way of thinking

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:54.460
about what's happening
to the world.

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:56.860
There's a famous
quotation that's

00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:02.320
been ascribed to a number
of different thinkers,

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:06.460
to the effect that it is easier
to imagine the end of the world

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.890
than the end of capitalism.

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:13.810
Capitalism has suffered this
enormous existential shock.

00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:16.120
It is as though the end
of the world has happened.

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:19.060
So all of these apocalyptic
zombie narratives,

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.220
that's another one.

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:26.110
I'm expecting a wave of
Donald Trump horrors,

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:29.290
if we aren't there already.

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:31.550
And I suspect they will be
of the King Kong, Godzilla

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:32.050
variety.

00:41:34.065 --> 00:41:35.440
AUDIENCE: This is
not a question,

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.606
it's just to add on to that.

00:41:36.606 --> 00:41:41.050
I think another trend that
I've noticed is tech horror,

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:45.790
so Black Mirror-esque
kind of shows, Ex Machina

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:47.290
comes to mind.

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:49.240
I think it's just
people are freaking out

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:52.120
about what's going on in terms
of artificial intelligence

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.080
and security, and
all sorts of things.

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.039
So maybe that's relevant.

00:41:56.039 --> 00:41:56.830
DARRYL JONES: Yeah.

00:41:56.830 --> 00:42:01.750
I'm a bit nervous to say
this in front of you, guys,

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:04.230
but I think that this
is absolutely right.

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:08.530
And I think that the
developments of the internet,

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:09.030
which--

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:12.790
I mean, I'm of a
generation that is too--

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:16.195
I can't really go there,
my daughter's generation

00:42:16.195 --> 00:42:20.530
[INAUDIBLE] but, you know, the
developments of the internet,

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:23.640
particularly of social media
within less than a generation,

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:27.580
half a generation,
incredibly quickly,

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:32.490
has proven
psychologically almost

00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:36.000
impossible to assimilate with
the speed that it's happening.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.190
And that's my grandkids.

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:38.880
And it may destroy us all.

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:43.050
I mean, we may be about to
witness the end of democracy

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:45.630
as a consequence of the fact
that we cannot assimilate

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:51.059
the implications of social media
quickly enough at the speed,

00:42:51.059 --> 00:42:51.850
which is happening.

00:42:51.850 --> 00:43:00.070
So I'm not surprised to see
a swave of techno horror.

00:43:00.070 --> 00:43:04.350
I mean, mad science of various
kinds has always been--

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:08.914
there have always been anxieties
about scientific advancements

00:43:08.914 --> 00:43:09.580
and discoveries.

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:15.390
And, as I said, the 200th
anniversary of Frankenstein.

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:20.290
And I think the link or the
line from things like Ex Machina

00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:23.390
is a very, very real one.

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:29.580
And it's interesting that
the Victor Frankenstein,

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:35.320
the demiurge, the creator, the
mad scientist of Ex Machina

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:41.860
is, of course, a search
engine tech wizard.

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:44.360
AUDIENCE: I've also
noticed in recent horror

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:49.120
the trend to focus
on human connection

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.670
sometimes, like in
Stranger Things, and even

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:53.050
The Haunting on Hill House.

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:56.000
And there is this
game, the simulacra,

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.600
that discourages
use of social media

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:03.980
by turning social media
into a monster of sorts.

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:08.050
Do you think this is like
a general trend in society

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:11.050
of encouraging genuine
human connection,

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:15.940
or is this an expression of
our fear of disconnecting,

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:18.460
or is this just
something to encourage

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.770
people to get into horror?

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:21.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:23.586
DARRYL JONES: I don't
know the answer to that.

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:32.299
Oh, I'm having a middle-aged
person's senior moment now.

00:44:32.299 --> 00:44:34.340
What was the name of the
social media horror film

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:36.690
that came out a few years ago?

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:37.920
Ugh.

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:38.420
Anyway--

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:39.709
AUDIENCE: Unfriended.

00:44:39.709 --> 00:44:40.750
DARRYL JONES: Unfriended.

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:41.860
Unfriended.

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:42.910
That's the one.

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:43.705
Yes.

00:44:43.705 --> 00:44:49.540
And one of the things that
that film, which in many ways

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:54.400
is a very conventionally
structured teens in peril

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:58.990
sort of movie that we've
seen from Halloween to Final

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:01.360
Destination, know to,
I suppose, even things

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:07.460
like Ring, but with
an online difference.

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:13.670
One of the things that
viewers and critics

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:16.190
of a certain age asked
about Unfriended is,

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:20.021
why not just turn the
bloody internet off?

00:45:20.021 --> 00:45:20.520
You know?

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:24.890
Why not just disengage
with social media?

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:27.710
And, clearly, one of the
points that this has to make

00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:32.410
is of the impossibility of
a meaningful life offline.

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:34.880
That there's a whole
generation for whom this is--

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:37.940
you might as well
say, stop breathing.

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:39.260
And this is disturbing.

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:41.720
But one of the things that
it's also worth saying

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:46.170
is that horror is a
generational thing.

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:50.150
And so each generation
finds its own monsters.

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:52.610
And each generation
is rendered obsolete

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:54.600
by the monsters of
the next generation.

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:59.250
So it may well be that in saying
these things, I am simply--

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:02.740
what I'm saying is that this
is no longer-- you know,

00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:05.440
I'm very comfortable talking
about 1970s and 1980s horror

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:09.006
because that's what
I grew up with.

00:46:09.006 --> 00:46:10.630
It may well be that
what I'm saying is,

00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:13.062
I don't understand
the modern world

00:46:13.062 --> 00:46:15.520
and this is frightening to me
because it means I'm obsolete

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.950
and about to die.

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:19.420
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the talk.

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:23.560
Given the strong connection
between horror and culture,

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:27.310
what do you think that
makes a good movie that

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:29.920
is, like, scary,
like everywhere,

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:32.195
like The Shining is scary.

00:46:32.195 --> 00:46:34.680
It doesn't matter if
you're from anywhere,

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.360
it's kind of good in any case.

00:46:44.292 --> 00:46:45.250
DARRYL JONES: You know?

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:49.750
I think the answer
to this is in part

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:53.740
a very old fashioned
answer that--

00:46:56.970 --> 00:47:00.744
and it's there in the
theory of classical drama.

00:47:00.744 --> 00:47:01.410
It's been there.

00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:04.710
It's the way we've
understood art since we've

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:06.180
had art to understand.

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:09.090
The way we understand
narrative is

00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:13.950
in the classical unities,
unities of time, of place,

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:16.584
of action.

00:47:16.584 --> 00:47:23.510
Now, what this means for
a film like The Shining

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:30.980
is one location, one series of
events, one winter, at least.

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:35.090
There are films like Rec, the
Spanish zombie movie which

00:47:35.090 --> 00:47:37.400
narrows it down even further.

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:42.530
One apartment building
in Barcelona, one night,

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:47.570
one attack of zombification
or whatever it is.

00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:58.140
So the concentration on the
effective, tried and tested

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:02.000
narrative forms
works really well.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.520
There's a reason why these
narratives and these ways

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:07.290
of telling the
story have survived

00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:10.930
through centuries and millennia,
and it's because they work.

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:16.930
The building of an
unsettling atmosphere

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:20.890
is genuinely important.

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:25.630
There's a debate amongst
practitioners of horror

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:33.827
as to how much should
you show and whether that

00:48:33.827 --> 00:48:35.410
what is truly
horrifying is that which

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:38.500
we create in our own
imaginations or that

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:40.030
which the screen shows us.

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:44.980
And at different times there
have been different answers

00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:46.130
to that.

00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:50.600
So with technological
advancements,

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:55.930
sometimes horror tends to
get more spectacularly gory.

00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:58.810
You want somebody
reaching down their throat

00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:00.500
and turning
themselves inside out.

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:01.840
You could probably do that now.

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:04.960
You couldn't do that two
generations ago at least,

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:05.980
you know?

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:07.910
So these kinds of things.

00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:13.000
So there's a debate going on
as to how much we should show,

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.260
what's most effective.

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:19.330
But my feeling about it is--
and maybe I tend to be kind

00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:21.250
of old-fashioned in this--

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:27.870
that the things that
work we've known

00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:33.066
that they worked for centuries
and millennia, we update them,

00:49:33.066 --> 00:49:36.940
we modify them.

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:38.606
So that's the answer, I think.

00:49:41.275 --> 00:49:43.150
SPEAKER 2: Thank you
very much, Darryl Jones.

00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:46.200
