00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,840
You are listening to radio lab radio lab

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,470
from W. N y.

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,820
S. T. E. N. N. P. R. Yay. I'm Jad
Abumrad. This is radio lab, the podcast.

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,310
It's just me today. Robert
is, uh, traveling. So, um,

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,630
but I do have a short
little story for you.

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,270
The actually actually
it's two stories, uh,

7
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:28,310
that I've been thinking
about for quite awhile. Um,

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,230
it's about the mysteries of creativity,

9
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:35,231
any piece of music and a neurological
condition that unite to people across

10
00:00:35,391 --> 00:00:36,224
space and time.

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,193
[inaudible].

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,270
Okay. The first story begins in
the early 1980s in Vancouver,

13
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:49,590
British Columbia with a woman named
Anne Adams who was a brilliant cell

14
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:54,330
biologist and was highly articulate.
That's her husband Robert Adams,

15
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,830
extremely capable with language.
She did cancer research.

16
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,780
He actually developed a cell line.
Really I believe still exists. Wow.

17
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,380
So she was very sharp as a
scientist. She was a natural,

18
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,890
but then rather suddenly at the age of 46

19
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,340
and kind of does a one 80 something
happened in 86 which changed the course of

20
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:20,040
her life. It all started
when their third son, Alex,

21
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:21,900
gets into a really bad car accident.

22
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,660
And we were told that he would probably
never ever walk again and decided she's

23
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,130
going to take some time off to
help them recover. And he does.

24
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:33,420
He does learn to walk again. But while
at home she just decides to quit,

25
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,320
quit science and become a painter. Yeah.

26
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,530
And made up her mind then and there that
she was gonna take up art full time.

27
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,090
Had she ever painted before? Well,

28
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,660
she did a fair amount of it
when she was in high school,

29
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,400
which was a very long time ago.

30
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,920
So the whole thing struck him
as kind of out of the blue,

31
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:55,100
but he rolled with it and uh,

32
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,170
within a short period of time she had
converted a room in their house into a

33
00:01:58,171 --> 00:02:01,440
studio and she was painting
houses and buildings,

34
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,600
little churches simple at first,

35
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:08,601
but then after that brightly
colored versions of what
you see when you look down

36
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:13,320
the barrel of a microscope, you know,
cells, bacteria after that, strawberries,

37
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,640
a series of paintings involving these
blazing red strawberries, for instance,

38
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,500
a water faucet. And out of what would
becoming a scream of strawberries.

39
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,910
There was things called Strawberry
Universe where the strawberries had rings

40
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:29,040
around them like Saturn and so on.

41
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:33,080
I think there was something like
35 or 36 strawberry painting. Wow.

42
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,930
But then she would switch to something
else even after their son had fully

43
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:37,440
recovered,

44
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,090
even threw away his crutches and went
back to school and kept on painting.

45
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,060
And she would work all
day long, 10 hours a day,

46
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:48,240
making these paintings as it got
bigger and bigger and more abstract.

47
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:51,120
And there were times he
says when he was like, wow,

48
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,080
because for someone who hadn't
painted since high school,

49
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,930
she was suddenly so prolific

50
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,483
[inaudible]

51
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,920
and it's entirely possible that
something was happening to her.

52
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:09,010
Even then way below the surface. I mean,

53
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:11,080
on the surface she was just
painting and it was working.

54
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,600
People were buying the painting,
she was having solo shows,

55
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:18,250
she was becoming a successful
artist. But then in 1994,

56
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,660
she decided, I don't know what
gave her this idea of big,

57
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,750
I never knew what gave her
any of her ideas, but um,

58
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,740
she decided she was going to
do a painting of, well, this

59
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:33,810
[inaudible]

60
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,030
Bolero Bolero. Yes. Yeah.

61
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,240
We'll arrow rabbit says he's
not quite sure how it happened,

62
00:03:39,241 --> 00:03:43,710
but at some point that year and heard
this famous piece by Maurice Ravel became

63
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:48,690
obsessed, couldn't stop listening to it,
then playing it on the piano, the play.

64
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,980
Then deconstructing it,

65
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:54,380
mapping every pitch and the melody
and the bass to a color. Here's a, uh,

66
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,750
here's one page which isn't very
long. This is from her notes.

67
00:03:57,751 --> 00:04:02,670
She's got a silver, a flat copper, B leaf,

68
00:04:02,671 --> 00:04:05,190
green, B flat, metallic green.

69
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,420
Eventually the painting was quite a
large work, two panels side by side,

70
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:14,220
very electric colors, a blizzard
of symbols and triangles,

71
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,440
little tooth type things
with marks on them.

72
00:04:16,441 --> 00:04:19,770
That all mean something and
rectangles marching back and forth.

73
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:21,060
Across the first panel,

74
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:26,040
there was a triangle in the bottom of
each one of the rectangle and the height

75
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,430
of the rectangle represented the loudness.

76
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,260
It's an incredibly obsessive translation
of the music into visual language and

77
00:04:34,261 --> 00:04:38,520
just like the melody in Bolero, the
symbols repeat and repeat and repeat,

78
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,000
obsessively getting bigger and bigger
and bigger until at the very end of the

79
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:42,834
second panel,

80
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,170
things unraveled. By the way,

81
00:04:49,171 --> 00:04:53,820
her title for the painting
was unraveling Bolero.

82
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,620
And here's where things start to get
a little spooky and did this at a time

83
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,100
when, um, she knew nothing about rebel.

84
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,350
She called her piece unraveling Bolero,

85
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,550
having no idea that that's exactly what
would happen to ravel right after he

86
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,653
wrote Bolero

87
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:12,650
[inaudible]

88
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,830
which brings us to story number two.
Well, okay. Should we jump in? Yeah,

89
00:05:15,831 --> 00:05:16,664
please.

90
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,900
This is RB Orenstein professor of music
at the Aaron Copeland School of Music at

91
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:21,770
Queens College.

92
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,080
He's written about Revelle perform
rebel talk to anyone who ever knew rebel

93
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,250
[inaudible]. He kind of
is a much, shall I say,

94
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,340
kind of a living presence
inside my head too. Okay.

95
00:05:31,341 --> 00:05:36,170
Maurice Ravel is composer obviously
one of the greats born at 1875.

96
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,790
Papa was an engineer.

97
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:42,680
Mother was from an old busk
family as in she was Spanish. Yes.

98
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,280
Which is why, uh, some of his music
Lake Valera does sound a bit Spanish.

99
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,500
In any case, mom encouraged
them to study music.

100
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:51,920
He goes off to Paris in
the 1890s meets Claude WC,

101
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,430
and together they sort of
invent this style of music,

102
00:05:55,431 --> 00:05:59,600
which we now call impressionism,
which was this kind of free floating,

103
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,130
almost dreamlike,
sensuous, a lot of colors.

104
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,690
The Flower, yes.

105
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,110
[inaudible]

106
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,500
but then like an ravel
makes a kind of shift.

107
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,520
1928 when he was 53 about the same age
Anne was when she did the painting.

108
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,020
Oh l is having an absolutely phenomenal
year. Just toured the United States,

109
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,340
performed for thousands.

110
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:27,630
You set the zenith of his creativity
and he's back in France at a beach house

111
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,010
wearing a pink bathing suit.

112
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,470
The story goes right before
he steps out onto the beach.

113
00:06:34,471 --> 00:06:38,190
This melody swoops into his
head. He runs over to the piano,

114
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,200
takes his index finger,
and he goes, Duh, Duh de de

115
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,270
[inaudible]. There it was. It just
came to him fully formed. Well, he,

116
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,620
I don't know if he played the whole
melody, but he at least started it off.

117
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,410
But here's the shift. When he sat
down to flush the whole thing out,

118
00:06:55,411 --> 00:06:59,340
instead of developing the melody, making
it super flowery, like his other stuff,

119
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,290
you said, no, I'm not gonna do that.

120
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,370
I'm going to take this melody and
repeat it again and again and again,

121
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:12,500
and then again, some more and then
some more. The theme never changes.

122
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:13,334
One note,

123
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,480
the only thing that does change is the
orchestration which grows around the

124
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:18,310
melody.

125
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,910
Terry slowly, bit by
bit gets bigger, bigger,

126
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,660
more company meant more
instruments play the melody,

127
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,490
the melody itself

128
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,210
for 340 bars never varied.

129
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,773
Yes.

130
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:41,250
When he says where the performers,
they're ready to see a psychiatrist.

131
00:07:41,251 --> 00:07:45,060
By the time they're done playing this
piece and reveal at the first performance

132
00:07:45,061 --> 00:07:48,420
in Paris, some woman
screamed out these crazy,

133
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,110
which turned out to be,
well not exactly true,

134
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:58,010
but in the neighborhood six
years after he wrote Bolero,

135
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,370
this is 1933 Revelle
begins to forget words.

136
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,410
He'd always been forgetful. So
no one really noticed at first.

137
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,120
But then one day at dinner he grabs the
knife by the wrong side and he doesn't

138
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:10,954
realize it.

139
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,830
And he continues to try to eat holding
the shop side of the knife and tried to

140
00:08:14,831 --> 00:08:18,700
cut with the handle. Then
he visits a friend, leaves,

141
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:22,330
not two hours go by, knock on
the door. It's ravel again.

142
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,980
He didn't remember that he'd been
there before just two hours earlier.

143
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:31,930
Eventually by 1935 he could
not ride anymore or speak.

144
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,030
His language had evaporated.

145
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,900
RB says there are documents where you
can see Revelle desperately trying to

146
00:08:37,901 --> 00:08:38,720
relearn the alpha.

147
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,590
A a a a

148
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,250
over and over again.

149
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,650
Wow. B B

150
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:51,170
with a kind of a shaking
hand, very small. It's very,

151
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:52,430
very painful to see

152
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:58,810
[inaudible]

153
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,470
whatever it was that was
wrong was getting worse.

154
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,350
Here's the weird
symmetry, just like ravel,

155
00:09:05,351 --> 00:09:09,430
six years after finishing herbal
Arrow by 2000 I would say,

156
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:14,560
and also begins to forget words. She
would try to say things and couldn't.

157
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,350
She would try to find words and couldn't.

158
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,120
So how are you today? Fine.

159
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,710
Eventually an ends up at the University
of California, San Francisco,

160
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,680
and this was in 2002 when they
gave her a bunch of tests.

161
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,070
Can you tell me your,
your full name, please.

162
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,640
Am Teresa Adams.

163
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,720
There's a video of one
of these tests in it.

164
00:09:37,721 --> 00:09:42,640
You can see Anne sitting at a table
in a black sweater, gray hair glasses.

165
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,700
Very composed. Can you
tell me your address?

166
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,350
Like someone who's used to knowing the
answers to questions people ask her.

167
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,163
Four

168
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,340
23 which town?

169
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,863
Um,

170
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,470
which town? Vancouver. Great.

171
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,690
By the time Anne had come to see us, uh,

172
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,970
her communication abilities
were markedly diminished.

173
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,380
That's Dr. Bruce Miller.
He's a neurologist.

174
00:10:21,381 --> 00:10:24,040
He runs the memory and
Aging Center at UCF.

175
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,150
Example, we asked her a to describe. Okay.

176
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,810
Otherwise you used to take a look
at this picture, a very complex,

177
00:10:30,811 --> 00:10:35,250
rich picture with take your
time children with a kite,

178
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:40,110
with a sailboat on the ocean. And
please tell me what you see. Any,

179
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:45,111
if you can please try to
speak in sentences and would
it be able to say single

180
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:48,750
words with no grammar. She'd go sailboat,

181
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,030
tree boy,

182
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,780
water people, kite tight

183
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,293
flag.

184
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:07,430
And uh, that four or five words would
come out over about a minutes time.

185
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,760
She was very frustrated.

186
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,810
Both Ann Adams and Merissa val were
unraveling in the exact same way,

187
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,650
at the exact same speed to the
same soundtrack you might say,

188
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,170
but just roughly 60 years apart.

189
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,200
We think he and Anne down to the very
molecular process had the exact same

190
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:32,980
disease and he thinks Bolero the music
and then the painting in both their cases

191
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,930
was the first symptom of that disease.

192
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,790
This takes a couple of steps to
explain, so bear with me, but to start,

193
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,430
the disease is called
frontotemporal dementia.

194
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:48,910
That's Jonah Lehrer author regular on
our show and it begins when spindly cells

195
00:11:49,131 --> 00:11:50,360
in your frontal cortex.

196
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,040
This part kind of right above your
forehead start to wither and until your

197
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,490
frontal cortex is puck mark
with sometimes visible holes.

198
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,010
We know this about an from
tests and brain scans.

199
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,950
We suspected about rebel
because according to Arby,

200
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:06,310
just before he died on December 28th,

201
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,810
1937 the French surgeon opened up his
skull and saw that one of the lobes of the

202
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,470
two lobes of the brain had sunk
because it was disintegrating.

203
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,970
Now in both their cases,
the part of the brain,

204
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:22,000
the part of their cortex
that got hit was on the left,

205
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,290
which is the part that does a lot of
things, memory, recalling, memories,

206
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,120
finding memories. And most importantly
for our story, it governs language.

207
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,420
What happens is as the frontal
cortex starts to fall apart,

208
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,960
you lose the ability to access language.

209
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,450
Now here's the thing
about losing language.

210
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,070
Our brains quickly debriefs are basically
a series of circuits that are all

211
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:45,600
tightly connected with progressive.

212
00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:48,390
And when a dominant circuit
like language turns on,

213
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,010
it's basically wired to turn a bunch
of other circuits off, basically go,

214
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,330
shh, six years, other parts of the brain,

215
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:01,410
we have this constant dance where one
circuit or many circuits turn on and then

216
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,570
they're obligatory. Les
Turning off other circuits.

217
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:09,340
So language acts as a kind of break. Um,
other things that brain could be doing,

218
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:11,800
like daydreaming, thinking
in images and pictures,

219
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:15,700
but when the language is no
longer there to hold things back,

220
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,930
often what can happen is that those
other parts like say the visual parts can

221
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:22,790
just rush forward and suddenly
the mind is, is flooded

222
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:26,570
with images that all of a sudden
people have these rich, rich,

223
00:13:26,571 --> 00:13:30,830
intense sensations. The world is so
beautiful and they need to express it.

224
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,120
This is very common.

225
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,990
We see a number of patients who become
visually obsessed from every possible

226
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:39,320
walk of life investment bankers who have
never been interested in art before and

227
00:13:39,321 --> 00:13:42,920
never even walked into an art museum and
all of a sudden they decide at the age

228
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:46,010
of 55 to move into a
loft, become an artist.

229
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:50,390
One of the first glimmers of their
illness is this insatiable need to create.

230
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:54,320
That's right. How many of these
cases have you seen 50 60. Wow.

231
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:58,070
Manifest itself in as many different
kinds of art as there are people,

232
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,470
but at the end of the day, what
all of these people have in common?

233
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,710
Is it this explosion of
creativity in their heads? Well,

234
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:07,070
it's not a free flowing,
loosey-goosey kind of creativity.

235
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,100
It's quite mechanical.
The repetition obsession,

236
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,210
they get stuck in a kind of loop taking
one thing and just doing it again and

237
00:14:14,211 --> 00:14:16,580
again like an Adams painting or

238
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,150
like Bolero.

239
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:25,510
This drive to repeat happens very early
on the course of this illness till he

240
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:30,380
says what can seem like a simple creative
choice to repeat a melody may actually

241
00:14:30,381 --> 00:14:34,640
be driven by a condition that you
won't even know you have for six years.

242
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:39,670
We think that this had something to do
with the very unusual rhythmic repetitive

243
00:14:40,221 --> 00:14:43,280
sorts of music that ravel produced.

244
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:49,640
And why the repetition?
Where does it come from? Um,

245
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,290
I think this is the release of a of a,

246
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,830
Bruce says, we don't really know,

247
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,800
but he offered up a theory
which I find fascinating,

248
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,930
which may get to the root of
creative obsession of any kind.

249
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:09,110
He says there might be several parts
of the brain that are held back by the

250
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:13,400
language circuit and one of them is
this very ancient part of our brains

251
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:13,520
[inaudible]

252
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,880
Basal Ganglia. The part
of the brain we move with,

253
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,590
you can call our reptile brain. This
is the part of us that uh, governs,

254
00:15:19,591 --> 00:15:22,100
you know, basic behaviors
like eating, running

255
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:26,870
motor programs that uh, we,
uh, do repetitively every day.

256
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,860
That's all it does. It sends command
saying move, move, eat, eat, run, run.

257
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:35,600
Birds and snakes get by with basically
just this part of the brain keeps them

258
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:40,460
alive. Now normally he thinks the
language part of us inhibits these habits,

259
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:44,900
these repetitive motor programs that
when the language part is not there to do

260
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:47,540
the shushing, these motor
commands filter up to.

261
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,250
So imagine you're one of these people,

262
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,590
your mind is suddenly
flooded with pictures,

263
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:56,030
maybe sounds and it's also flooded with
these kinetic repetitive instructions,

264
00:15:56,031 --> 00:16:00,500
move, move, move, do it again. And
in the early stages of the illness,

265
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,900
you still have enough brain
to make sense of it all.

266
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:07,930
There's still a lot of cortex that is
still available to act upon this desire to

267
00:16:08,211 --> 00:16:08,810
repeat.

268
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:12,170
And so you get art that is
obsessive and repetitive. Yes,

269
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:16,040
but also beautiful and abstract,
like unraveling Bolero.

270
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
But then as the disease progresses and
more of that front human part fades away,

271
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,960
the repetition becomes much
simpler and not creative at all.

272
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,110
In the latter stages
of a disease. He says,

273
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,520
you'll often see patients [inaudible]

274
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,900
pouring water into a cup
a hundred times in a day,

275
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,390
a squishing ants over and over again.

276
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:42,520
The complexity of the behaviors are
diminishing as as we're losing these parts

277
00:16:42,521 --> 00:16:44,110
of the brain that make us so human.

278
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,250
Sort of what you see in answer
work or painting startled, simple,

279
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,760
explode into abstraction
and then get simple again.

280
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,530
But what's unusual compared to the
other patients is that she kept painting

281
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,960
almost all the way to the end until
literally it was not possible for her to,

282
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:04,850
to hold and direct a, uh, a brush or a
pen. That's her husband, Robert Again,

283
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,930
and became progressively paralyzed
on the right side of her body.

284
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,530
She lost the ability to, to

285
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,453
paint

286
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,790
2005 early and that, that,

287
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,420
that was sad towards the end.

288
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,920
He says he would go into her studio
and I would see her there in front of a

289
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:27,080
blank canvas and she
wouldn't be doing anything.

290
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,240
She would just be looking at it.

291
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,920
And I'd come back a couple of hours
later and she still wouldn't have done

292
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:38,270
anything. She had lost
the ability to do the art,

293
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,010
but she hadn't lost the drive.

294
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,970
And that to me is one of the
beautiful parts of Ann's story.

295
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,440
But the drive to create can be as primal
as the drive to eat that even after she

296
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:54,270
couldn't move, could barely
swallow. She still sat there trying.

297
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,740
She had gone down hill so
far by that time that, uh,

298
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:04,170
that, uh, she was hardly recognizable as,

299
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,110
as herself at some point in the
disease. And you can see this in that,

300
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,930
that early tape painting
was all she had left.

301
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:15,800
I don't have the memories of this

302
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,940
painting had become literally all she was.

303
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:24,350
Can you tell me what your job is
or are you, are you still working?

304
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,100
Uh, I do art.

305
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:41,460
She died in 2007. Yes. In January of 2007
