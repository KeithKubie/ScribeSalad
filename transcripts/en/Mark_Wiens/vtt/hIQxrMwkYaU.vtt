00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.780
- Hey everyone, I hope you
are having an amazing day.

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:02.613
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:02.613 --> 00:00:04.450
I'm in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
and tonight for dinner,

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.490
we are going to a Brazilian
steakhouse barbecue

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.277
and this is gonna be my very first time

00:00:09.277 --> 00:00:11.560
to ever go to a Brazilian steakhouse,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.640
so I'm glad that my first
experience will be in Brazil.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.130
There's a lot of culture that
surrounds Brazilian barbecue

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.270
and I know it's gonna
be all-you-can-eat meat

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.900
and the juices are gonna flow

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.690
and I know there's a
whole salad bar as well.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.080
We're gonna find out and I'm gonna share

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.409
all the meat with you in this video.

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:30.992
(upbeat Latin style music)

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:36.670
(train roars)

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.503
- How are you, man?

00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:38.980
- [Guilherme] Good, good,
welcome to Rio, man!

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.040
- [Mark] Thank you, thank you!

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.677
What's the name of the
restaurant that we're going to?

00:00:41.677 --> 00:00:43.670
- [Guilherme] Churrascaria Palace.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.763
- [Mark] Churrascaria Palace.

00:00:44.763 --> 00:00:47.880
- Yeah, churrascaria means
steakhouse in Portuguese

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.270
and the name of the
churrascaria is palace.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.630
- Awesome, and then we
decided to take the metro

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.500
because traffic is bad
and it was just one stop.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.910
Get ready for some serious meat!

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:59.743
- [Guilherme] Yes.

00:00:59.743 --> 00:01:01.090
- [Mark] We walked over to Copacabana,

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.290
the area of Copacabana,

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.350
and this is where the
steak is, the Churrascaria.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.979
Oh man, I cannot wait to eat some meat.

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.476
(people chatter animatedly)

00:01:09.476 --> 00:01:12.559
(piano plays loudly)

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.050
And already, it's pretty
full this evening,

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.770
but then yeah, the meat aroma

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.680
and then Guilherme has arranged a room

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.840
in the back here, I think.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.150
So, it's quieter back here,

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.690
we're going to be able to film,

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.050
they're gonna come around with the meat.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.120
Oh man, yeah, immediately
as you step in here,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.003
you can smell the roasted
aroma of the meat.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.633
We just met with Head Chef, Silva.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:47.955
Head Chef Silva, right?

00:01:47.955 --> 00:01:48.788
- [Silva] Yeah!

00:01:48.788 --> 00:01:49.950
- [Mark] Head chef Silva is
bringing us into the kitchen,

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.713
to see where they're
grilling, roasting the meat.

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:55.202
- [Silva] Busy, busy.

00:01:55.202 --> 00:01:56.410
- [Mark] Okay, great, great.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.713
- [Silva] These are the grills.

00:01:59.713 --> 00:02:02.110
(Mark laughs in awe)

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.777
(staff talk, plates rattle)

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.430
- [Mark] All of the meat are on spits.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.090
They're all on stakes,
they're all rotating

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.270
and what's really interesting
are the different cuts of meat

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.690
which are different, specific to Brazil.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.590
The different parts of
the meat that they use

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.570
and how they cut it and one of the,

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.663
I don't remember the name,

00:02:24.663 --> 00:02:28.221
what's the cut of meat from the hump?

00:02:28.221 --> 00:02:31.284
(Chef Silva talks in Portuguese)

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:32.117
- Cupim.

00:02:32.117 --> 00:02:33.367
- Cupim, cupim.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.318
This is from the hump of the--

00:02:37.318 --> 00:02:38.660
- [Silva] Hump of the back.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.640
- [Mark] This is one of the special meats.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.502
- [Guilherme] When you
come to Brazil, eat cupim!

00:02:42.502 --> 00:02:44.014
Cupim!

00:02:44.014 --> 00:02:49.014
(Guilherme and Chef Silva
speak in Portuguese)

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.550
- Guilherme was telling
me that meat lovers,

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.320
they love it because of the mix of fat

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.700
and the flavor, the tenderness,

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.099
and so what they do, all of the meat

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.300
apart from the ribs, which are marinated,

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.700
I think most of the meat
is not really marinated,

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.140
but it's just salted, it's roasted

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.160
and then when they take it off the grill,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.680
they use their knife and
just add a little bit

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.530
of that rock salt onto the meat

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.280
and then it goes back on the grill.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.226
It's beef ribs?

00:03:21.226 --> 00:03:22.893
- [Silva] Beef ribs.

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:25.642
(Mark laughs)

00:03:25.642 --> 00:03:28.380
- The beef ribs cabinet. (laughs)

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.963
They are huge and they're
cooked for 12 hours.

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:34.869
- Two days marination.

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:38.350
- Two days marination and
then 12 hours cooking,

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.250
and you can see you can probably

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.713
just pull out that bone and
it would just slide out.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.033
- He knows your channel.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.833
- [Mark] How are you, man?

00:03:46.833 --> 00:03:47.666
- He's saying "Nice to meet you."

00:03:47.666 --> 00:03:48.499
- Nice to meet you!

00:03:50.344 --> 00:03:52.010
(speaks in Portuguese)

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.330
- I cannot take the meat sweats

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.660
or my mouth watering any longer,

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.464
we're going back to the
table to start eating.

00:03:57.464 --> 00:03:58.297
Obrigado.

00:03:58.297 --> 00:04:01.630
- [Restaurant Staff] Obrigado, obrigado!

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.400
- You have the translation in English.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.990
- [Mark] Cool.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.290
So then this is coming for a churrascaria,

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.590
do you always have a buffet as well?

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.423
- Exactly.

00:04:10.423 --> 00:04:11.256
- [Mark] With salad.

00:04:11.256 --> 00:04:12.790
- With salad and it is good also,

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.210
heart of palms, artichokes,
oysters, salmon.

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.540
- Their condiment section
is out of control!

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.140
The dressings, the mustards,

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.020
the barbecue sauce, the ketchup.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.960
Look at this selection of olive oils,

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.100
the sriracha, the chili
sauces, the Tabasco,

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.170
but then along with churrascaria,
along with your meat,

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.260
there's always a salad bar,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.210
so there's vegetables,
there's different salads,

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.800
there's tomatoes, there's heart of palm,

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.040
there's some asparagus, and
there's even some seafood.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.263
There's some oysters, there's
some squid and some stews.

00:04:46.182 --> 00:04:48.464
It's good to balance meat with vegetables.

00:04:48.464 --> 00:04:51.547
(upbeat Latin music)

00:04:53.633 --> 00:04:57.216
(people chatter and laugh)

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:04.980
- So the first meat has arrived.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.550
This is the hump, and
normally you can start

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.700
with the salad bar, but
that meat was too tempting,

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.010
we have to start immediately.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.380
Chef Silva has brought it to our table

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.660
and so the custom practice
is you take the tongs, right?

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.050
And he slices off...

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.670
just look at it, it's flaking apart!

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.850
And then you grab it.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:26.683
Oh, the steam.

00:05:27.777 --> 00:05:29.540
Look at it, you can just see the strings

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.210
of that meat, the flakes of it. (laughs)

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.550
Oh wow!

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.600
Wow, that is amazing.

00:05:36.474 --> 00:05:39.557
(upbeat Latin music)

00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:46.930
- It's one of my favorite cut.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:47.840
- [Mark] He knows it.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.798
- It's amazing! (she and Mark laugh)

00:05:50.798 --> 00:05:52.767
- [Mark] Oh the ribs, the beef ribs!

00:05:52.767 --> 00:05:54.301
Oh my.

00:05:54.301 --> 00:05:57.884
(people chatter and laugh)

00:05:59.035 --> 00:05:59.868
Oh wow.

00:06:01.607 --> 00:06:03.058
Oh my goodness.

00:06:03.058 --> 00:06:06.141
(upbeat Latin music)

00:06:08.921 --> 00:06:10.567
Obrigado.

00:06:10.567 --> 00:06:13.650
(upbeat Latin music)

00:06:18.743 --> 00:06:20.326
It's just like, oh!

00:06:28.945 --> 00:06:30.620
- [Chef Silva] Costela prime, prime rib.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.287
- [Mark] Prime ribs.

00:06:33.636 --> 00:06:34.469
Thank you, Guilherme.

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:35.353
- You're welcome.

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:37.853
(Mark laughs)

00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:42.401
(they talk in Portuguese)

00:06:44.211 --> 00:06:45.443
- [Mark] Obrigado, Chef Silva.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.993
- [Waiter] Fried banana, french fries.

00:06:53.833 --> 00:06:55.410
- That's unbelievable.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.810
They just started coming around the meat,

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.961
coming around with the meat like a storm.

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:03.190
I don't even know how to react! (laughs)

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.680
It's just unbelievable.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.520
He brought out the beef ribs.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.420
The beef ribs are massive!

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.780
And you could just see
the meat wobbling around,

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.590
and he lifted the layer,
like the cap of fat,

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.340
he took out a slice of that meat,

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:21.340
and then his technique of
slicing it, of cutting it;

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:22.870
the tenderness just shines.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.530
You can tell it's just
gonna melt in your mouth.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:25.517
I haven't even tasted the meat,

00:07:25.517 --> 00:07:29.520
but we already got three
types of their primest,

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.750
best, most well-known meats.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.950
This is plate number one and
it just looks... (laughs)

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.760
it's just dripping with juices
and glistening with fat.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.060
We should go back to that
first meat that he served,

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.068
which is the (stumbles over pronunciation)

00:07:44.068 --> 00:07:44.901
- [Guilherme] Cupim.

00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:45.734
- Cupim, cupim.

00:07:45.734 --> 00:07:48.470
And you can see how this is
the layer that is roasted

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.437
and then underneath, that's the underside.

00:07:51.437 --> 00:07:53.410
But yeah, you know I already said

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.013
it is just unbelievably good.

00:07:55.975 --> 00:08:00.308
(people chatter and cutlery clinks)

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.053
Wow!

00:08:04.053 --> 00:08:07.760
The mix of fat and it's almost so tender

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.623
it's almost like stringy,
it just strings apart.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.020
And I love how the outer edge

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.560
is kind of crispy from being roasted,

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:20.560
but it's so soft and yeah,
that is pure wow meat.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.783
You have to pace yourself
otherwise you can go crazy here.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.650
- [Guilherme] We call
like an adult playground.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:28.840
- [Mark] It is!

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.960
Okay, next up I gotta try the beef ribs.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:31.980
Oh, man.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.040
You definitely do not
need a knife for that.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:34.943
- [Together] Cheers!

00:08:37.412 --> 00:08:38.280
(Mark laughs)

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:43.110
The ribs are so, so tender and
so stringy and so flavorful.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:46.585
This one is the sirloin, or the prime rib.

00:08:46.585 --> 00:08:47.418
- [Guilherme] That's the prime rib.

00:08:47.418 --> 00:08:48.506
- [Mark] Yeah.

00:08:48.506 --> 00:08:51.066
(cutlery clinks)

00:08:51.066 --> 00:08:53.816
(people chatter)

00:09:00.087 --> 00:09:00.920
Oh wow!

00:09:04.123 --> 00:09:05.960
That prime rib is unbelievable!

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.400
The juiciness, and I like my
meat rare so that is like,

00:09:11.107 --> 00:09:13.260
like the pure saltiness of it.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.270
Wow!

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:15.863
Oh, lamb, yes!

00:09:17.978 --> 00:09:18.943
Obrigado.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.570
Yeah, seriously, just after
being here for only 10 minutes,

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:27.850
the meat comes around so fast.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.689
You can already tell you
just need to pace yourself

00:09:29.689 --> 00:09:32.960
or you could just go meat crazy

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.730
and be stuffed in 30 minutes,

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.290
but you wanna pace
yourself, you wanna relax,

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:41.148
you wanna keep on eating
for as long as possible.

00:09:41.148 --> 00:09:44.700
(people chatter and laugh)

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.330
Okay, got some chile;
some of the preserved

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.600
kind of pickled oiled chiles
to go with the meat next.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.630
Let's try another bite of the,
let's go back to the hump.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.720
And yeah, you don't even need a knife,

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.420
you can just fork cut it.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.263
And then I'll try it with a
Scotch Bonnet chile on top.

00:10:07.967 --> 00:10:10.651
As I was taking that bite,

00:10:10.651 --> 00:10:12.120
it has a little heat to it,

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.120
he brought some of the
Carolina Reaper chile sauce.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.320
We immediately have to
change our course of eating

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.420
and try some of the Carolina Reaper sauce.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.223
Is that too much for one bite?

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.723
That's a good amount, let's try it!

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.014
Carolina Reaper sauce on, yes.

00:10:38.014 --> 00:10:39.931
- [Man] Oh man, stoked.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.440
- Oh, the flavor is amazing!

00:10:51.262 --> 00:10:53.340
It's not too spicy,

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.540
but the flavor's like a,

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.678
it's like a very overly
pronounced Habanero.

00:10:59.678 --> 00:11:02.899
Kind of like going up
your nose a little bit.

00:11:02.899 --> 00:11:04.710
- That has some flavor to it, though,

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:06.223
that is some flavorful chile.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.103
- You can feel the burn, but very good.

00:11:11.534 --> 00:11:12.367
Obrigado.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:16.785
This is one of the national
drinks of Brazil, a caipirinha.

00:11:16.785 --> 00:11:17.618
Saúde.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.280
It's sweet and sour and refreshing.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.290
That does taste very good after a bunch

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.450
of Carolina Reaper chile sauce.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:34.750
Oh, man!

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:38.090
That is, it's addictive spicy.

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:38.960
It's so good!

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.405
- [Guilherme] Okay, that's
the top sirloin steak.

00:11:40.405 --> 00:11:42.478
- Top sirloin steak.

00:11:42.478 --> 00:11:44.115
- Wow, look how that just comes away.

00:11:44.115 --> 00:11:44.948
Oh yes.

00:11:47.811 --> 00:11:50.894
(upbeat Latin music)

00:11:56.984 --> 00:11:58.325
(Mark laughs)

00:11:58.325 --> 00:12:00.958
Oh, it's too tender! (laughs)

00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.700
We haven't even had the
chance to get salads

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.200
because the meat just comes
around and it's so good!

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.133
This one is the top sirloin.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.633
And that fat cap is just unbelievable.

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:13.923
Look at that cut!

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.603
I just have to add a
little scoop of the Reaper.

00:12:23.397 --> 00:12:25.480
(laughs)

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.646
That Carolina Reaper sauce,
it's addictive spicy!

00:12:31.646 --> 00:12:34.333
Once you start eating it, you can't stop.

00:12:36.177 --> 00:12:38.020
And that fat cap, it's melting,

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.712
it's melting on my tongue right now!

00:12:39.712 --> 00:12:43.710
(Chef Silva speaks in Portuguese)

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.390
1985, Chef Silva.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.740
He is a meat master.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.620
He has been working
with meat, carving meat,

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.470
cooking meat, for over 35 years.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:53.423
The beef shoulder.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:55.976
Oh, the juiciness!

00:12:55.976 --> 00:12:58.788
(laughs)

00:12:58.788 --> 00:13:00.400
Oh, look at that.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.423
Oh, wonderful.

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:07.360
Oh, the strings of that,
the grains of that,

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.623
the juiciness of that.

00:13:12.128 --> 00:13:13.653
(laughs)

00:13:13.653 --> 00:13:15.555
I just bit down and it squirted!

00:13:15.555 --> 00:13:16.510
(laughs)

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:17.613
This shoulder is amazing.

00:13:17.613 --> 00:13:21.130
This one is the lamb loin or something,

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.190
with that fat, that fat cap.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:24.750
What another beauty.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.550
It's kind of curled up a little bit.

00:13:28.424 --> 00:13:31.063
That ratio of 50% fat!

00:13:36.043 --> 00:13:38.030
That is so fatty

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:39.193
and so tender.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:41.950
Okay, Chef Silva just brought around

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.900
the lamb chops with mint sauce.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.700
Oh wow, the meat, it never stops,

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:48.990
but I am gonna take a break,

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:51.010
because I need to try the heart of palm

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.810
to break up the fatty meats.

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:55.540
This is the heart of palm.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:59.127
Oh that just slices, it's
so soft, like cheese.

00:13:59.127 --> 00:14:02.210
(upbeat Latin music)

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:05.513
Oh, that's wonderful!

00:14:05.513 --> 00:14:06.790
It's kind of like bamboo shoot.

00:14:08.992 --> 00:14:10.460
It's really juicy.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.460
Okay, this one is the next,

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.423
the sweet palm.

00:14:14.292 --> 00:14:16.739
(people chatter)

00:14:16.739 --> 00:14:20.477
(upbeat Latin music)

00:14:20.477 --> 00:14:22.700
Wow, that almost has a honey taste to it,

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.500
but again, it has that bamboo
shoot kind of consistency.

00:14:26.933 --> 00:14:27.924
- [Guilherme] Another for you

00:14:27.924 --> 00:14:28.757
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:14:28.757 --> 00:14:29.590
- [Guilherme] You're welcome.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:34.523
- Back to the meat and he just
served me an ostrich steak.

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:41.113
It's really lean!

00:14:44.231 --> 00:14:45.931
It's similar to beef but even with

00:14:46.893 --> 00:14:48.730
a more pronounced flavor to it.

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:50.230
And really lean and flavorful.

00:14:51.374 --> 00:14:53.313
(people chatter)

00:14:53.313 --> 00:14:56.396
(upbeat Latin music)

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:05.180
Chef Silva just does not, he
just does not let up on us.

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.140
He just keeps coming around
with the steaks of meat.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:12.200
This one is like a veal steak.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.840
I have not even seen the bottom
of my plate yet, this meal.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.383
And again, that fat cap.

00:15:17.328 --> 00:15:18.161
(laughs)

00:15:18.161 --> 00:15:19.503
It's so juicy.

00:15:22.144 --> 00:15:23.227
Look at that!

00:15:26.663 --> 00:15:30.034
It's like a fat helmet on this piece.

00:15:30.034 --> 00:15:33.550
- [Guilherme] Rafaela is
doing the Web checking.

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:35.423
Okay.

00:15:38.717 --> 00:15:39.550
Wow!

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:40.860
That might be the juiciest piece yet.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.718
- Everything you bring,
there's no way to refuse.

00:15:43.718 --> 00:15:46.301
(meat sizzles)

00:15:52.921 --> 00:15:54.040
- I'm starting to get a serious case

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.240
of the meat sweats.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.123
And Chef Silva, he just does not let up.

00:15:59.261 --> 00:16:01.530
No breaks for Chef Silva.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:05.373
The meat is flowing and we
have not repeated anything.

00:16:06.404 --> 00:16:07.743
Thank you.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.963
This is Chef Silva's creation.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.840
It's the chorizo meat and
then also another type,

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.863
but that is juicy and he
cooked it on that hot plate.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:23.103
It's hot, fresh, extraordinary juicy.

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:27.803
Wow!

00:16:27.803 --> 00:16:30.323
The difference is it's more
firm, but it's so juicy.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:37.513
I almost forgot about the
lamb ribs, lamb chops.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.460
Whoa!

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.870
I think I just got an entire
cap of fat in that bite.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:46.713
Oh, salad!

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:50.730
Time for some vegetables.

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:53.830
This is the owner's salad
that Guilherme ordered.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:56.353
There's lettuce, there's
tomatoes, there's onions.

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:02.604
Oh, those tomatoes in that salad

00:17:02.604 --> 00:17:05.054
taste extra good right
now, after that much meat.

00:17:08.813 --> 00:17:10.130
- [Group] Saude!

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:11.203
- [Guilherme] Chin chin!

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:16.168
- Oh, that's refreshing!

00:17:16.168 --> 00:17:20.251
(Guilherme speaks in Portuguese)

00:17:24.347 --> 00:17:26.550
We are definitely slowing down.

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:29.600
The meat, the meat is hitting us hard,

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.760
but he came around with a skewer.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.610
This is a fresh water Amazon fish,

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:36.093
which, yeah, we gotta try.

00:17:37.368 --> 00:17:38.427
- Pirarucu.

00:17:38.427 --> 00:17:39.260
- Pirarucu?

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.120
- Pirarucu.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.170
- It's so firm, it's almost like chicken.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:45.093
Really good.

00:17:47.061 --> 00:17:48.260
I got the ribs of the fish.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.870
(Guilherme and Chef Silva
speak in Portuguese)

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:52.133
Also Amazon fish.

00:17:54.173 --> 00:17:56.540
Then we've got one more; this
is the last of the meats.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:00.380
And this is another Amazon
fish, the ribs of the fish.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:03.500
Chef Silva, the man, the hero.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.833
The hero of the night.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.833
This is a serious protein overdose.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:20.548
It could be the jet lag,
could be the caprinha,

00:18:20.548 --> 00:18:23.480
could be just the straight up meat sweats,

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:28.150
but I don't know if I can get
off this sofa seat right now.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:32.103
Physically, physically I
don't think I can. (laughs)

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.353
That's great.

00:18:40.448 --> 00:18:41.281
Wow.

00:18:42.123 --> 00:18:44.680
I am almost to the brim
with meat right now.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.230
Chef Silva insisted that we have the ribs.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.470
These are straight fish ribs.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:51.470
It looks like a pork rib, but it's fish.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:19:00.670
And that literally is like the
texture of pork and chicken.

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:01.982
Wow!

00:19:01.982 --> 00:19:04.800
That's crazy and amazing.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.880
You would not believe that's fish.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.900
Yeah, that's like straight chicken.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.070
Like chicken ribs.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:12.300
Chef Silva, what a man.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.910
What a man.

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:15.150
What a chef.

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:17.060
The hero, the hero of the night.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:17.893
Chef Silva

00:19:17.893 --> 00:19:18.726
- Thank you very much.

00:19:18.726 --> 00:19:21.470
- He took care of us; his service,

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:23.900
and the way he served us
and carved us the meat,

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.338
that was phenomenal!

00:19:25.338 --> 00:19:26.374
- Thank you.

00:19:26.374 --> 00:19:27.439
- Thank you.

00:19:27.439 --> 00:19:28.272
Obrigado.

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:31.050
We've moved on to dessert.

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:32.240
This is one of their house desserts.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.440
It's called Cat's Egg.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.350
It's ice cream with a
variety of different,

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.540
oh thank you, a variety
of different chocolates

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.727
and then you drizzle it on.

00:19:40.727 --> 00:19:41.560
Obrigado.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:42.873
- [Guilherme] That's their creation.

00:19:44.375 --> 00:19:45.208
- Whoa!

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.520
Oh, that chocolate sauce!

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.150
I'm not that huge on desserts,

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.730
but after eating that much salty meat,

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.863
a few bites of sweet dessert
tastes really good, actually.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.660
And that completes this churrascaria,

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.640
Brazilian steakhouse barbecue experience.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.023
Man, at this stage,

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:06.217
what's up man?

00:20:06.217 --> 00:20:07.050
- [Man] Obrigado.

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:07.967
- Obrigado.

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:14.550
At this stage in the Brazilian
steakhouse experience,

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:17.140
it's just hard to walk,
it's hard to think.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.660
It's, wow!

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:22.411
That was a meat experience of your dreams!

00:20:22.411 --> 00:20:23.244
Obrigado.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.110
You know that feeling of
coming out of a movie theater,

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.880
like after you've been sitting
in a theater for three hours?

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.070
That's like the exact same
feeling I'm getting right now.

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.886
It's like a different world out here.

00:20:34.886 --> 00:20:36.160
(laughs)

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:41.100
That really was the Brazilian
meat of your dreams.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.338
That was like every dream,

00:20:43.338 --> 00:20:47.090
every thought I had about Brazilian meat

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:48.453
is now in my stomach.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:52.700
My first time to have a
Brazilian steakhouse experience,

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.080
and yeah, that exceeded my expectations.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.360
The different cuts of meat;
everything was different!

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.330
Everything tasted different.

00:20:58.330 --> 00:20:59.850
The textures, the varieties,

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:02.470
the different wellnesses of the meat.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.360
Huge thank you to
Guilherme and to Rafaela.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.570
And, by the way, Guilherme,
he was also making a video,

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:10.640
Rio For Fun, Rio For Food;

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.090
I'll have his links in
the description box below.

00:21:13.997 --> 00:21:15.760
That was so much fun to hang out.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.290
It's such a social,

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:20.960
one tip is that you want to pace yourself.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.680
Don't take too much meat too fast at once

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.826
or you will just be stuffed in 10 minutes,

00:21:26.826 --> 00:21:29.910
'cause the meat, it just doesn't stop.

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:32.700
Okay, that was an
amazing, an amazing meal.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:35.000
