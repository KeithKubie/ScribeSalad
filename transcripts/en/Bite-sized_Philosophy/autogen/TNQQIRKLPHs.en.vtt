the first being borderline personality
disorder so two lectures ago somebody

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540
disorder so two lectures ago somebody
 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.419
disorder so two lectures ago somebody
asked you about it and you gave a very

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429
asked you about it and you gave a very
 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.060
asked you about it and you gave a very
sparse answer I can't remember exactly

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070
sparse answer I can't remember exactly
 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.790
sparse answer I can't remember exactly
what you said but it seemed like it was

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800
what you said but it seemed like it was
 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.450
what you said but it seemed like it was
a it way there was too much complexity

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460
a it way there was too much complexity
 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.429
a it way there was too much complexity
to just answer it right there and then

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439
to just answer it right there and then
 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.890
to just answer it right there and then
and then somebody else also Acts asked

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900
and then somebody else also Acts asked
 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.349
and then somebody else also Acts asked
you about the same disorder in your

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359
you about the same disorder in your
 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.080
you about the same disorder in your
patreon livestream recently and when

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090
patreon livestream recently and when
 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.850
patreon livestream recently and when
they when they asked you that you kind

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860
they when they asked you that you kind
 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.450
they when they asked you that you kind
of you kind of solved for a moment and

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460
of you kind of solved for a moment and
 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.770
of you kind of solved for a moment and
something I don't know something kind of

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780
something I don't know something kind of
 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.049
something I don't know something kind of
flicked on in your head it seemed like

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059
flicked on in your head it seemed like
 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.180
flicked on in your head it seemed like
and you and you thought for a couple

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190
and you and you thought for a couple
 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.709
and you and you thought for a couple
seconds and then you said you know what

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719
seconds and then you said you know what
 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.750
seconds and then you said you know what
I don't think that I can answer that

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760
I don't think that I can answer that
 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.360
I don't think that I can answer that
right now because just to it's just too

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370
right now because just to it's just too
 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.510
right now because just to it's just too
bloody complex and I was wondering just

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520
bloody complex and I was wondering just
 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.410
bloody complex and I was wondering just
like many young men have gravitated

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420
like many young men have gravitated
 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.090
like many young men have gravitated
towards your lectures do you think that

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100
towards your lectures do you think that
 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.830
towards your lectures do you think that
there's something about this particular

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840
there's something about this particular
 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.090
there's something about this particular
disorder that there's something about

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100
disorder that there's something about
 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.740
disorder that there's something about
people with this particular disorder

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750
people with this particular disorder
 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.810
people with this particular disorder
that might gravitate to your insights

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820
that might gravitate to your insights
 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.020
that might gravitate to your insights
and your lectures okay okay so no I

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030
and your lectures okay okay so no I
 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.240
and your lectures okay okay so no I
would say probably no to the second one

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250
would say probably no to the second one
 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.920
would say probably no to the second one
but I could comment more about

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930
but I could comment more about
 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.630
but I could comment more about
borderline personality disorder I think

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640
borderline personality disorder I think
 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.219
borderline personality disorder I think
I have enough mental energy to do that

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229
I have enough mental energy to do that
 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.840
I have enough mental energy to do that
tonight so technically speaking it's

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850
tonight so technically speaking it's
 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.420
tonight so technically speaking it's
often considered the female variant of

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430
often considered the female variant of
 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.690
often considered the female variant of
antisocial personality disorder so it's

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700
antisocial personality disorder so it's
 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.630
antisocial personality disorder so it's
it's it's it's classified or it's

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640
it's it's it's classified or it's
 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.850
it's it's it's classified or it's
classified in in in the domain of

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860
classified in in in the domain of
 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.740
classified in in in the domain of
externalizing disorders acting out

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
externalizing disorders acting out
 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.030
externalizing disorders acting out
disorders and I think what happens we

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040
disorders and I think what happens we
 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.649
disorders and I think what happens we
don't understand borderline personality

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659
don't understand borderline personality
 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.210
don't understand borderline personality
disorder very well and it's

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220
disorder very well and it's
 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.740
disorder very well and it's
characterized by tremendous impulsivity

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750
 
 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.160
 
radical confusion of identity and then

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170
radical confusion of identity and then
 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.690
radical confusion of identity and then
this pattern of idealization of people

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700
this pattern of idealization of people
 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.359
this pattern of idealization of people
with whom the person afflicted with the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369
with whom the person afflicted with the
 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.209
with whom the person afflicted with the
disorder is associating with radical

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219
disorder is associating with radical
 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.039
disorder is associating with radical
idealization of those people and then

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049
idealization of those people and then
 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.830
idealization of those people and then
radical devaluation of them and then

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840
radical devaluation of them and then
 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.029
radical devaluation of them and then
there's another theme that sort of

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039
there's another theme that sort of
 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.240
there's another theme that sort of
weaves along with it which is

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250
weaves along with it which is
 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.240
weaves along with it which is
the proclivity of people with borderline

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250
the proclivity of people with borderline
 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.160
the proclivity of people with borderline
personality disorder to presume that

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170
personality disorder to presume that
 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.400
personality disorder to presume that
they will be abandoned and then to act

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410
they will be abandoned and then to act
 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.380
they will be abandoned and then to act
in a manner that makes such abandonment

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390
in a manner that makes such abandonment
 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.370
in a manner that makes such abandonment
virtually certain and so it's a very

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380
virtually certain and so it's a very
 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.960
virtually certain and so it's a very
complicated disorder but that I think

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970
complicated disorder but that I think
 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.930
complicated disorder but that I think
gets at the crux of it one of the things

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940
gets at the crux of it one of the things
 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.970
gets at the crux of it one of the things
that's interesting about people with

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980
that's interesting about people with
 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.650
that's interesting about people with
borderline personality disorder in my

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660
borderline personality disorder in my
 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.080
borderline personality disorder in my
experience is that they're often quite

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090
experience is that they're often quite
 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.190
experience is that they're often quite
intelligent and you you see in the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200
intelligent and you you see in the
 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.900
intelligent and you you see in the
person with borderline personality

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910
person with borderline personality
 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.600
person with borderline personality
disorder something like the waist or the

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610
disorder something like the waist or the
 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.990
disorder something like the waist or the
squandering of tremendous potential they

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000
squandering of tremendous potential they
 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.110
squandering of tremendous potential they
seem capable of thinking through the

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120
seem capable of thinking through the
 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.449
seem capable of thinking through the
nature of their problems and analyzing

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459
nature of their problems and analyzing
 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.370
nature of their problems and analyzing
it and discussing it but not capable

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380
it and discussing it but not capable
 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.830
it and discussing it but not capable
whatsoever of implementing any solutions

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840
whatsoever of implementing any solutions
 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:15.430
whatsoever of implementing any solutions
and technically there's no relationship

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440
and technically there's no relationship
 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.240
and technically there's no relationship
between I I Q and conscientiousness it's

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250
between I I Q and conscientiousness it's
 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.699
between I I Q and conscientiousness it's
very weird because if you read the

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709
very weird because if you read the
 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.270
very weird because if you read the
neuropsychological literature and you

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280
neuropsychological literature and you
 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.380
neuropsychological literature and you
read about the functions of the

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390
read about the functions of the
 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.580
read about the functions of the
prefrontal cortex they're usually

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590
prefrontal cortex they're usually
 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.880
prefrontal cortex they're usually
conceptualized in intellectual terms and

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890
conceptualized in intellectual terms and
 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.229
conceptualized in intellectual terms and
they're associated with planning and

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239
they're associated with planning and
 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.630
they're associated with planning and
strategizing and so forth and that's

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640
strategizing and so forth and that's
 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.430
strategizing and so forth and that's
what conscientiousness is is planning

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440
what conscientiousness is is planning
 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.710
what conscientiousness is is planning
and strategizing in implementation but

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720
and strategizing in implementation but
 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.360
and strategizing in implementation but
the correlation between IQ and

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370
the correlation between IQ and
 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.850
the correlation between IQ and
conscientiousness is zero and so as the

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860
conscientiousness is zero and so as the
 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.039
conscientiousness is zero and so as the
correlation between working memory and

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049
correlation between working memory and
 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.220
correlation between working memory and
conscientiousness zero and zero is a

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230
conscientiousness zero and zero is a
 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.979
conscientiousness zero and zero is a
very low correlation right I mean really

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989
very low correlation right I mean really
 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.840
very low correlation right I mean really
it's hard to find things in psychology

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850
it's hard to find things in psychology
 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.110
it's hard to find things in psychology
that are correlated at zero things tend

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120
that are correlated at zero things tend
 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.699
that are correlated at zero things tend
to be correlated to some degree they

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709
to be correlated to some degree they
 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.960
to be correlated to some degree they
tend to be interrelated the borderline

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970
tend to be interrelated the borderline
 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.870
tend to be interrelated the borderline
seems to be able to strategize and to

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880
seems to be able to strategize and to
 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.030
seems to be able to strategize and to
abstract but not to be able to implement

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040
abstract but not to be able to implement
 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.770
abstract but not to be able to implement
and and so this the intellect per se

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780
and and so this the intellect per se
 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.610
and and so this the intellect per se
seems to be functional but it's not

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620
seems to be functional but it's not
 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.880

impressive feat you should try that

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700
impressive feat you should try that
 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.940

right it's really hard did you really

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950
right it's really hard did you really

right it's really hard did you really
have to work at it and you see that in

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980
have to work at it and you see that in
 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.740
have to work at it and you see that in
adult borderlines they'll have temper

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750
adult borderlines they'll have temper
 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.390
adult borderlines they'll have temper
tantrums and the funny thing is when a

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400
tantrums and the funny thing is when a
 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.040
tantrums and the funny thing is when a
two-year-old does it it's like it's you

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050
two-year-old does it it's like it's you

know it's little off-putting but when an
 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.040
know it's little off-putting but when an
adult does it it's completely bloody

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050
adult does it it's completely bloody
 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.500
adult does it it's completely bloody
terrifying and it happens very

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510
terrifying and it happens very
 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.360
terrifying and it happens very
frequently with borderlines and so I

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370
frequently with borderlines and so I
 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.880
frequently with borderlines and so I
