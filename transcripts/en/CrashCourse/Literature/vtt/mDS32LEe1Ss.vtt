00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Hi, I’m John Green, this is
Crash Course Literature,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.540
and today we continue our discussion
of To Kill a Mockingbird.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.100
So the takeaway from last week’s video about
Mockingbird was this: “You never really

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.730
understand a person until you consider things
from his point of view--until you climb into

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.480
his skin and walk around in it.” And for
me, at least, that’s one of the great pleasures

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.260
of reading. We get to escape the strictures
of our narrow lives and travel through time

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.170
and space, imagine the world from other people’s
perspectives. And by accessing this wide range

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.600
of human experience, we can understand that
other people are really real and isn’t that

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.329
an amazing thing to be able to do while you’re
also eating Cheetos?!?

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.469
Downside, you stain all your books with Cheeto
fingers, but it’s worth it!

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:47.180
[Theme Music]

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.780
So some people argue that the empathy and
understanding that we can get from reading

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.339
is in fact, like, the point of all culture.
In 1875, the English poet and critic Matthew

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.839
Arnold argued that culture: "…seeks to do
away with classes; to make the best that has

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:05.640
been thought and known in the world current
everywhere; to make all men live in an atmosphere

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.780
of sweetness and light." If that’s the point of
culture, I’m not sure that we’ve done that well,

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.979
especially since in that quote, Matthew Arnold said,
“men” when I presume he meant, you know, people.

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.270
So To Kill a Mockingbird didn’t “do away”
with class structure, but it does critique

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.310
social and racial divisions in the American
South. And like Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.340
Apart, To Kill a Mockingbird is a story about
the past, but it is also very much a product

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.940
of the time in which it was written. All right,
let’s go straight to the Thought Bubble today.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.479
So Lee wrote To Kill a Mockingbird in the
1950s—a decade of huge changes in the social

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.539
landscape of the United States: Rosa Parks
refused to give up her seat on a bus (precipitating

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.109
the Montgomery Bus Boycott). Riots broke out
after two African-Americans were admitted

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:48.289
into the University of Alabama. And that was
just in Lee’s home state! In Mississippi,

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.100
Emmett Till, a 14 year old African-American
boy, was killed for allegedly whistling at

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.950
a white woman, and the Supreme Court decided
that “separate but equal” schools are

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.810
inherently unequal in the Brown v. Board of
Education case in 1954. Congress passed a

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.640
Civil Rights Act in 1957 to support the integration
of schools. In Arkansas, the governor used

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.990
the National Guard to prevent nine African-American
students from entering Little Rock High School,

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.470
and President Eisenhower sent federal troops
to integrate that school.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.750
Lee reflects on her 1930s childhood from the
perspective of the conflict-ridden 1950s.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.370
So yes, Lee is nostalgic for the sweetness
and light of her youth, for summer days playing

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.340
outdoors, lemonade on front porches, reading
on a father’s lap, but she’s also unflinching

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.000
in her critiques of the bitterness and ignorance
that characterized social and race relations.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.200
That combination of nostalgia and criticism
makes Mockingbird both endearing and enduring.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.740
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So our hero and narrator,
Scout, is confused by the hatred and violence

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.100
she witnesses in her town. At the start of
Mockingbird, Jem explains the social order

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.620
of Maycomb: “The thing about it is, our
kind of folks don’t like the Cunninghams,

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.250
the Cunninghams don’t like the Ewells, and
the Ewells hate and despise the colored folks.”

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.140
Scout doesn’t like this, she argues that
there is, “just one kind of folks. Folks.”

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.300
Scout, I don’t wanna cast aspersions, but
that’s literally the definition of communism.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.360
But class is deeply entrenched in Maycomb;
like, when Scout asks her Aunt Alexandra if

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.600
she can invite a poor classmate named Walter
Cunningham home, Alexandra tells her: “…you

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.600
should be gracious to everybody, dear. But
you don’t have to invite him home.” And

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.870
when Scout pressures further, Alexandra finally
says: “… he—is—trash, that’s why

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.920
you can’t play with him. I’ll not have
you around him, picking up his habits and

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.700
learning Lord-knows-what.” But in the logic
of the novel, Alexandra’s thinking isn’t

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.900
just mean-spirited, it’s flat-out dangerous, because
Scout and Jem have actually already hosted

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.340
Walter Cunningham—a fact that saves Atticus from
a beating and (briefly) saves the life of Tom Robinson.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.830
Because, remember when a mob converges on
the jail to lynch Tom, they find Atticus waiting

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.680
outside, right? Scout and Jem then arrive
on the scene and when Scout innocently mentions

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.390
to Mr. Cunningham, a leader of the group that
wants to lynch Tom, that his son is “a real

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.730
nice boy,” a humbled Mr. Cunningham tells
the mob to disperse. So it’s by not honoring

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.220
the class structure of Maycomb that Scout
is able to achieve a small measure of justice.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.730
It’s also telling that it’s not Atticus, or any
other member of their white upper middle

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.270
class social order, who taught Scout how to
pay young Walter Cunningham proper respect.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.310
It’s the family’s African-American housekeeper,
Calpurnia, because in fact, Scout’s really

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.510
rude to Walter when he eats at her house.
She asks Walter “what the sam hill he was

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.690
doing” after he pours syrup all over his
food, and then Calpurnia summons Scout to

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.220
the kitchen and lets her have it. Calpurnia
explains that guests, no matter who they are,

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.630
must be treated well and then tells Scout
that if she is not going to behave, she won’t

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.280
eat at the table, she has to eat in the kitchen.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.470
And Scout really respects Calpurnia, who,
by the way, is a fascinating character. Unlike

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.260
most African Americans in 1930s Alabama, Calpurnia
reads, writes, she has excellent grammar.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.510
And Scout notices that Calpurnia chooses to
speak differently with white people than she

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.650
does with African-Americans. When Scout asks
her about this, Calpurnia replies, “….Now

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.180
what if I talked white-folks’ talk at church,
and with my neighbors? They’d think I was

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.240
puttin‘ on airs to beat Moses.” And Scout’s
awestruck by the notion that Calpurnia “led

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.240
a modest double life… The idea that she
had a separate existence outside our household

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.450
was a novel one, to say nothing of her having
command of two languages.” This is again

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.030
a moment of Scout learning to imagine others
complexly, which, after all, is her real education.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.500
So Calpurnia’s “double life” is a textbook example of what W.E.B. Du Bois called a “double-consciousness”

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.460
in his famous book The Souls of Black Folk (published in 1903). Du Bois describes “double-consciousness”

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.410
as the “sense…of always looking at one’s
self through the eyes of others, of measuring

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.740
one’s soul by the tape of a world that looks
on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:36.380
his two-ness,—an American, a Negro; two
souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings;

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:42.740
two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged
strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.”

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.580
And Calpurnia is acutely aware of how she
looks in the eyes of others. She has internalized

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.610
the racism of whites as well as the classism
inside her own community, and she treads carefully

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.930
in both worlds. And she’s also a woman,
so she has to navigate gender expectations.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.200
Like although Calpurnia usually allows Scout
to wear overalls, she dresses her up for church.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.820
And I think that gesture represents more than
professional pride. It also demonstrates how

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.650
deeply ingrained ideals of Southern femininity
are in Calpurnia’s life: it’s one thing,

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.290
and certainly this heroism shouldn’t be
dismissed, to allow a girl to “act like

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.710
a boy” at home. But when it comes to her
church and her community, Calpurnia ultimately

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.990
forces Scout to conform to the gender roles
that we discussed last week.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.600
So that’s one way that race and gender discrimination
manifested itself in Maycomb. Another is the

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.680
experience of Tom Robinson. Despite being proven
innocent beyond a shadow of a doubt, Tom is

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.880
sentenced to death. So how is Scout supposed to make
sense of that? Well for this, we turn to Atticus Finch.

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:38.720
He’s sort of a Gregory Peck -- oooh. It’s
time for the open letter.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.669
Oh, look at that, it’s the movie tie-in
edition of my own book, The Fault in Our Stars.

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:47.389
An open letter to movie adaptations. I just
want to state, for the record, that this was

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:50.520
Meredith’s idea. It’s not like I need
Crash Course to inform you that the paperback

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.280
edition of my book is now available for just
$12.99.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.100
Dear Movie Adaptations,
Why are you so often so bad?

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.949
The standard narrative is that movie adaptations
are bad because you can’t fit a whole novel

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:05.710
into a movie. But one, that doesn’t explain
Where the Wild Things Are, which is, like,

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:11.220
32 pages long. And two, you will rarely in
American literature come across a more interesting

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:17.280
and complex book than To Kill a Mockingbird, which
had, like, the greatest movie adaptation of all time!

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.460
I think it’s ultimately because movie people
know that they need to make something that

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.760
will appeal to millions and millions of people,
whereas books don’t have to have that broad

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.870
of an audience. Because let’s face it, not
that many people read them.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.860
But, Movie Adaptations, when you’re good,
and I think I’ve been lucky enough to get

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.150
a good one, you’re not obsessed with getting
the broadest possible audience, you’re obsessed

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.880
with trying to make a good movie. So more
of that, and less pandering with gratuitous

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.820
sex scenes and explosions.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.600
Oh Stan, always pandering with explosions.
Best Wishes, John Green.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.700
Right, but Atticus is magnanimous. I mean,
he waves at old Mrs. Dubose, the morphine

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:56.280
addict who screams insults at Jem and Scout.
Like although Atticus knows that Mrs. Dubose

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:02.030
doesn’t approve of his own actions, he still recognizes that she has, quote, “real courage”—something

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:06.770
he defines as, “…when you know you’re
licked before you begin but you begin anyway

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:10.610
and you see it through no matter what.”
Real courage, seeing it through even when

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:15.110
you know you’re doomed, like the Demi Moore
Scarlet Letter adaptation. They knew it was

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:19.620
gonna suck, but they just kept going. No one
knows who Demi Moore is anymore, Stan. We

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:23.600
gotta update our references. Did Mila Kunis
make any terrible movie adaptations?

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.940
Meredith has informed me that Mila Kunis is also old.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.949
But this is precisely the kind of courage
that Atticus displays when defending Tom Robinson.

00:08:30.949 --> 00:08:35.589
Like before the trial, Atticus tells his brother
that he knows he is already “licked”:

00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:39.740
“You know what’s going to happen as well
as I do.” But Atticus still defends Tom

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.529
passionately, although to be fair, it’s
not that difficult to argue in court that

00:08:43.529 --> 00:08:47.339
a man with a damaged left arm would have had
a difficult time punching someone on the right

00:08:47.339 --> 00:08:51.459
side of their face. Now that was his job,
but outside the courtroom, he also holds an

00:08:51.459 --> 00:08:55.850
all-night vigil near Tom’s cell. Atticus
is fighting for more than abstract principles

00:08:55.850 --> 00:09:00.899
of social justice. He wants to serve as an
example that will prevent his children from,

00:09:00.899 --> 00:09:04.939
quote, “catching” racism, which he calls,
“Maycomb’s usual disease.”

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:09.240
Astoundingly, Atticus even has compassion
for Bob Ewell, the drunkard who beat (and

00:09:09.249 --> 00:09:13.550
likely raped) his own daughter, Mayella. I
mean, Ewell successfully pinned this on Tom

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:17.569
Robinson, knowing full well that a conviction
would lead to the death penalty. And Ewell

00:09:17.569 --> 00:09:23.360
stalked Tom’s wife, spit in Atticus’ face, and
threatened, then later attacked, Jem and Scout.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.320
And when Jem’s a little incredulous
that Atticus is able to empathize with Ewell,

00:09:27.329 --> 00:09:32.519
Atticus replies, “Jem, see if you can stand
in Bob Ewell’s shoes for a minute. I destroyed

00:09:32.519 --> 00:09:36.709
his last shred of credibility at that trial,
if he had any to begin with. [….] So if

00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:41.619
spitting in my face and threatening me saved
Mayella Ewell one extra beating, that’s

00:09:41.619 --> 00:09:45.550
something I’ll gladly take. He had to take
it out on somebody and I’d rather it be

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:49.610
me than that houseful of children out there.”
That may seem like almost over-the-top in

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:53.999
terms of heroism, but let’s remember this is a
Southern Gothic novel. It has to have its knight.

00:09:53.999 --> 00:09:58.309
All right, let’s close today with Atticus’
line that gives the novel its title: “it’s

00:09:58.309 --> 00:10:03.439
a sin to kill a mockingbird.” When Scout
asks Miss Maudie why, she learns: “Mockingbirds

00:10:03.439 --> 00:10:08.319
don’t do one thing but make music for us
to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens,

00:10:08.319 --> 00:10:12.980
don’t nest in corncribs, they don’t do
one thing but sing their hearts out for us.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:17.029
That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.”
So who’s the mockingbird in this novel?

00:10:17.029 --> 00:10:21.689
Is it the elusive Boo Radley, confined to
the nest of his home, but generous in his

00:10:21.689 --> 00:10:26.629
love for the Finch children? Is it Tom Robinson,
whose kindness to Mayella Ewell was literally

00:10:26.629 --> 00:10:30.649
the death of him? Is it the author herself,
singing her heart out about the imperfect

00:10:30.649 --> 00:10:35.759
gardens of her youth? Or is it Scout herself,
whose education in empathy is also an education

00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:39.629
in race, class, and gender oppression? (It
could also be Katniss Everdeen.)

00:10:39.629 --> 00:10:43.319
But regardless of how you answer that question,
To Kill a Mockingbird leaves us with a timeless

00:10:43.319 --> 00:10:47.689
takeaway: it requires courage to try on the
proverbial shoes of others, to try to walk

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:52.329
around in their skin. It’s difficult but
important to listen to other peoples’ voices

00:10:52.329 --> 00:10:57.019
and to try to empathize across the barriers
of sex and class and race. And ultimately,

00:10:57.019 --> 00:11:02.499
that’s the great heroism of Atticus Finch. He’s able
to seek and find the essential humanity of others.

00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:04.779
