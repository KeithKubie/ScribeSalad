00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.640
Where I left off in the last
video, my buddies and I, we

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.480
had a business plan.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.660
We had a great idea to
sell socks online.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.870
We went to an angel investor.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.960
He had originally given
us $5 million.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.350
He valued what we already had
at $5 million dollars.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.180
So, since he was giving us $5
million and we had $5 million,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.890
he got 50% of the company.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.320
And we have the other 50%.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.060
We have two million
total shares.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.560
And we took four of that
million, let's say six months

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.980
have passed.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.440
We hired 50 people, and we
finally built a working

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.400
version of our website.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.210
But we now are about
to run out of cash.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.060
We still haven't started selling
things, and we'll

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.910
actually have to start selling a
lot of things before we have

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.470
enough money to support
ourselves.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.010
So we need to go start
raising money again.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.750
And we also want to spend money
marketing and all the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.170
rest. So we go to some
professional investors.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.630
We'll go to seed venture
capitalists, and we're going

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.530
to do our Series A
round of funding.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.670
Which just means our first kind
of professional venture

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.500
capital round of funding.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.520
We finally-- some guy finds
a team that, they like us.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.270
And we start getting
to the negotiation.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.000
They say, you know what?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.100
You guys say you need
$10 million.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.820
We believe you.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.680
We know that that's what it
takes and we think you have a

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.740
good business.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.155
So, let's see, let me say that
we need to raise $10 million.

00:01:06.155 --> 00:01:08.450
Just so I make that clear.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.035
We need it for ongoing
expenses.

00:01:13.035 --> 00:01:15.410
And of course we'll have a big
business plan and everything

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.280
that further fleshes this out.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.210
And we also have need-- we're
going to do some marketing, et

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.430
cetera, et cetera.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.670
So they say, you know, we have
$10 million and we think this

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.820
is a hot space, because we know
those other VC's across

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.310
the street also invested in an
online undergarment play.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.400
And we know that that's the
hot thing right now.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.830
So we're also going to do it.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.430
So the question now is,
what do they get

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.630
for their $10 million.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.630
So once again we get into
this what is the

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.880
company worth right now?

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.840
So once again, they're going to
do a pre-money valuation.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.520
So what is this whole thing
worth right now?

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.870
So they'll say, the
idea's good.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.500
They won't break down.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.940
They won't say oh, the idea
is worth $5 million.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.130
But the general idea is,
hopefully, from that stage

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.730
where the post-money valuation
was $10 million, right?

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.090
Back here it was $10 million.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.100
Then we did a bunch of work.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.510
We used some of this
$5 million.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.580
We did a bunch of work.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.220
Hopefully we added value.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.640
If we added value, our value of
this stuff now, this-- we

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.910
turned this cash into other
types of assets like a website

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.640
and other things, and knowledge
in our firm, and

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.080
expertise, and all that stuff.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.880
Hopefully now, what we have here
is worth more than $10

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.110
million, right?

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.420
Otherwise we kind of
destroyed wealth.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.510
And all of this is
very intangible.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.980
It's very hard for someone to
really place a value on things

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.940
at this point.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.090
A lot of VC's, they kind of
swing for the fences.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.890
They're like, you know what,
these guys have a 10% chance

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.380
of being worth a billion
dollars, and a 90%

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.760
of being worth 0.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.460
If I make 10 of these bets, at
least one of them is going to

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.990
pay off and make
my whole fund.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.100
And so that's how they
kind of think.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.220
So at this level, they'll do
some hard negotiating.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.010
But it often times is going to--
not at this level, this

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.340
is where we are right now-- it's
kind of what other people

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.150
got for this stage
of a company.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.120
They say oh, you know,
you have a pretty

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.460
good built-up website.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.080
Those other guys who had a
pretty good built-up website

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.430
at this point, those guys across
the street, they had to

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.280
pay-- they had to give a $20
million pre-money valuation.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.530
But you know, you guys are a
little bit-- your market isn't

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.240
quite as big as the broader
undergarments market.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.520
You're just socks.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.580
So the opportunity
isn't as big.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:45.290
So we'll give you a $15 million
pre-money valuation.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.580
So they're saying that what
we have right now

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.400
is worth $15 million.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.910
And that's pretty good.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.300
If that were reality, if it
really is worth $15 million,

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.660
then what are our shares
worth right now?

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.830
Notice, they haven't
given us any money.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.790
This is the pre-money
valuation.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.770
So $15 million divided by two
million shares, right?

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:05.990
That's how many we
have right now.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.080
So what is the value
per share?

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:15.790
15 million divided by 2
is $7.50 per share.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.010
That's pretty good.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.180
Because back here-- remember,
this is kind of a scenario

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.500
that didn't happen, that was
kind of a negative scenario--

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.590
but back here when the pre-money
was $5 million for a

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.340
million shares, it
was $5 per share.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.140
Then it became $10 million
for two million shares,

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.560
still $5 per share.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.340
But before and after this round,
that angel said oh,

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.940
your shares are worth
about $5 per share.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.070
Now this VC, who is a
professional investor and has

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.670
teams of MBA's making
spreadsheets for him, says

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.515
that actually, what we
have right here is

00:04:44.515 --> 00:04:45.540
worth $7.50 a share.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.640
So just over those six months
we actually got a 50% return

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.340
on our shares, if you
believe that.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.990
And the angel investor's
happy.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.120
He feels good about it.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.220
This was vindication
for his bet on us.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.040
So we feel good.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.620
We feel like we've given
him, at least in the

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.160
short term, a return.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.370
So anyway, we get a $15 million
pre-money valuation.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.670
And I'll let you think
about this one.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.460
What's the post-money
valuation?

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.070
What happens when you layer on
the $10 million from this

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.320
venture firm?

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.970
Actually, just to make the math
simple, let's say that

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.580
we're raising 7.5 million.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.960
Let's say that we wanted 10
million, but we were hoping

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.250
for 20 million pre-money
valuation, because that's what

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.530
the other guys got.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.830
And since they're only giving us
a $15 million pre-money, we

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.570
just don't want to take as many
shares from them, because

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.100
we don't want to give as much
of the company away.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.000
So we're just going to take $7.5
million, because we think

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.120
that's just enough that
we need to keep going.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.200
So we do that.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:55.200
We take $7.5 million from this
seed venture capitalist. And

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.450
he essentially valued our old
shares at $7.50 per share.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.820
So, for $7.5 million at $7.50
per share, he should get

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.890
another million shares.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.760
So what we're going to do--
this angel investor is

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.970
probably sitting on our board
now because he owns so many of

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:11.700
the shares.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.440
The board of directors of a firm
is essentially elected by

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.490
the shareholders.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.660
So if you have 50% of the
shares, you can put yourself

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:19.190
on the board.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.950
You could probably put some
other people on the board of

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.660
directors as well.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.390
So, we had two million.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.360
These guys get a million.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.770
How many shares do
we have now?

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.160
We now will have three
million shares.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.960
So we had to issue another
million shares.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.000
And what is our post-money
valuation?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.680
Pre-money was 15.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.050
We have $7.5 million now.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:46.730
Our post-money valuation
is $22.5 million.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.290
And now, what percentage
do each of us own?

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.230
So the angel investor owns one
million, not out of two

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.740
million shares like
he used to.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.540
He now owns one million out
of three million shares.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.520
So now he owns 30%.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:08.960
The seed VC, he has a million
out of three million, so he

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.930
owns-- well this is 33
and 1/3%-- the seed

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.700
VC owns 33 and 1/3%.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.170
And then me and my buddies, we
collectively own 33 and 1/3%,

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:23.560
and I have 1/5 of that, so
I have a little over 5%.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.610
So the founders, that's us, we
still have about a third of

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:28.390
the company.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.740
And now we have the $7.5 million
we just raised, plus

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.440
we have the million dollars
in cash we had before.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:38.480
We have $8.5 million to keep
on going with our business.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.190
Fair enough.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.020
So let's say another
six months go by.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:49.556
So our old balance sheet-- let
me draw all of the shares-- I

00:07:49.556 --> 00:07:52.370
want to do a couple of more
rounds of financing before I

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:53.620
take the company public.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.010
So this is my slice down
here, $200,000.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.690
This is the angel investor.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:09.110
This is the seed VC.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.480
And then, of course, let's say
after, I don't know, another

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.480
six months we burn
through the cash.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:20.360
We've marketed the website, we
have only $1 million left.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.830
And that's usually our trigger
point for when we want to

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:23.580
raise more money.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.720
In fact we probably would have
to do it at $2 million because

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.500
we've raised more employees, and
we're burning more cash.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.060
Your cash burn is essentially
how much cash is going out of

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.230
the door every month, because
your business still isn't

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.200
making money.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.750
And of course you have all of
the assets of the firm, which

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.549
essentially, it's a website,
and offices, and the

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:42.020
knowledge, some of
it intangible.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.800
So, website, and everything
that comes with it.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.220
Your brand now, you probably
have, because you've marketed.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:53.070
So people recognize
socksonline.com.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:56.030
I don't know if that already
exists so forgive me if I'm

00:08:56.030 --> 00:09:00.530
actually somehow insulting a
real business out there.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:03.480
But you have a brand now.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.320
And so you're almost ready.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.650
You're actually generating
revenue.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.990
But you're still kind of
cash flow negative.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.600
You're burning less money
because people are actually

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.750
going to your site.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:13.830
They're buying stuff.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:16.740
But you just need a little bit
more money, you think, to get

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.180
profitable, right?

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.340
Once you get this amount of
money, you're ready to go.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.810
So you go to another VC.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.190
Once again, a lot of
them turn you away.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.140
But one guy finally says OK,
I'll give you some money.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.500
And you say, you know
I need $5 million.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.400
He says, fair enough.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:34.310
I'm going to value your business
at-- let's say we're

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.290
in an optimistic world, so
we're doing up rounds.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.670
Up rounds are when your
pre-money valuation of this

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:43.100
round is more than the
post-money valuation of the

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.430
last round.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:45.780
So the value is going up.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.260
You are creating value.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.700
It would be a down round-- like
here, they valued us at

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.970
$15 million.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:57.360
While the post-money of our last
round was $10 million.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.870
So that was an up round.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:01.460
If these guys said no way,
the world has changed.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.445
We're only going to value all
of this stuff at $8 million,

00:10:03.445 --> 00:10:05.720
then that would be a down round,
and no one's happy

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.220
about that.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.660
We'll talk about the
repercussions of that in the

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.830
future, why down rounds
aren't good.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.770
So often times, you actually
don't want to get too good of

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:13.530
a valuation.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.310
Because if you get too good of a
valuation, in the next round

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.900
it might be hard to get people
who are going to give you a

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:19.910
better valuation.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.650
You might be forced to take
a down round, which

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:24.260
has negative aspects.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.520
But just quick and dirty, you're
a prominent brand now.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.390
It's a little easier for
you to raise money.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.970
You go to some VC who
specializes in kind of helping

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.260
people get to that profitability
stage.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.620
And what you do is you
raise your Series B.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.690
And just to put it simply,
it's an up round.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.830
Your post-money from your last
round was $22.5 million,

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.930
right? $22.5 million.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:47.540
You've generated some value.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.140
So now they say,
you know what?

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.310
Your business is worth
$30 million.

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:53.860
And you need another
$10 million to

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.110
really pump up the marketing.

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.000
How many shares do they get?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.490
Well the pre-money was $30
million, we had three million

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:13.610
shares, so they're assigning us
a value of essentially $10

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:14.540
a share, which is great.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.950
Remember the first round, the
angel gave us $5 per share?

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:19.950
Second round we got
$7.50 per share.

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.020
And now we're getting
$10 per share.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.300
So if we're selling him shares
at $10 per share, we just have

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.800
to issue another million shares
to get $10 million.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.820
It's another million shares,
and this goes to

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.530
VC2, the second VC.

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.300
And that's our Series B.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.170
We raised $10 million.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:36.870
Fair enough.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.500
So we've done one round
of angel investing.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.880
And then we've got
our Series A that

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.760
gave us the $7.5 million.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.960
Then we did our Series B that
gave us $10 million.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.610
And we could keep doing this,
Series C, Series D, and so on

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:50.410
and so forth.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:53.610
And I'll continue this
in the next video.
