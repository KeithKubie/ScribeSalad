00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:07.629
Connie: I am quite confident that China can
pull us out of the economic crisis. China,

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:16.100
being the largest producer as well as the
consumer, I think that with a very good system

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:24.080
of regulation of singling the regulatory control
of products and services. I think that will

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.180
restore better consumer confidence. So I think
through this we will be able to help ourself.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.700
Thank you.
