00:00:00.237 --> 00:00:01.810
- [Voiceover] Hello
grammarians, hello Rosie.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:02.804
- [Voiceover] Hi Paige.

00:00:02.804 --> 00:00:04.643
- [Voiceover] So in this
video we're gonna talk about

00:00:04.643 --> 00:00:07.138
something called a dangling modifier.

00:00:07.138 --> 00:00:09.928
So, before we get in to
what a dangling modifier is,

00:00:09.928 --> 00:00:13.041
we can sort of talk about
just what a modifier is.

00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:15.634
Rosie, do want to tell
us what the definition

00:00:15.634 --> 00:00:16.933
of a modifier is?

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.769
- [Voiceover] Sure, so,
well one major modifier that

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.302
you think of is an adjective.

00:00:21.302 --> 00:00:25.128
So a lot of times a modifier is describing

00:00:25.128 --> 00:00:27.209
something else in the sentence.

00:00:27.209 --> 00:00:28.042
- [Voiceover] Right, okay.

00:00:28.042 --> 00:00:29.568
So it can be an adjective or

00:00:29.568 --> 00:00:30.788
like a,
- [Voiceover] An adverb

00:00:30.788 --> 00:00:32.249
- [Voiceover] A phrase,
yeah an adverb too.

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:34.939
So a modifier is always
supposed to come right before

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:37.504
the word or phrase that it's modifying.

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:38.945
But when it doesn't do that,

00:00:38.945 --> 00:00:41.737
that's what's called a dangling modifier.

00:00:41.737 --> 00:00:43.676
- [Voiceover] So this
can look something like,

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:46.236
Flashing lightning and thunder,

00:00:46.236 --> 00:00:50.225
the little bunny struggled
through the storm.

00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:52.280
- [Voiceover] So this sentence
has a dangling modifier,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.716
and the modifier in question is,

00:00:53.716 --> 00:00:56.651
flashing lightning and thunder.

00:00:56.651 --> 00:01:00.301
So the phrase that this
comes right before is,

00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:01.834
the little bunny.

00:01:01.834 --> 00:01:04.880
And flashing lightning and
thunder is not describing

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.245
the little bunny, right.

00:01:06.245 --> 00:01:08.227
I don't think I've ever seen a bunny

00:01:08.227 --> 00:01:11.066
with like, lightning coming
out of it or anything.

00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.424
- [Voiceover] Rosie what
is this modifier actually

00:01:12.424 --> 00:01:14.639
supposed to be modifying?

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:17.033
- [Voiceover] So, the
modifier is actually supposed

00:01:17.033 --> 00:01:19.385
to be modifying the storm.

00:01:19.385 --> 00:01:22.438
Because we've got lightning
and thunder, flashing,

00:01:22.438 --> 00:01:25.685
all of those things describe the storm.

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:27.704
- [Voiceover] Right, okay, so,

00:01:27.704 --> 00:01:30.034
we're really not supposed
to have a dangling modifier

00:01:30.034 --> 00:01:32.328
like this so we need to fix this sentence.

00:01:32.328 --> 00:01:34.780
- [Voiceover] Flashing
lightning and thunder, the storm

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.280
raged as the bunny struggled.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.375
- [Voiceover] So this is all better,

00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:44.117
the modifier, flashing
lightning and thunder,

00:01:44.117 --> 00:01:46.161
comes right before the storm, now.

00:01:46.161 --> 00:01:47.220
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.377
- [Voiceover] So, this makes more sense.

00:01:49.377 --> 00:01:51.148
We got rid of the dangling modifier,

00:01:51.148 --> 00:01:53.157
it's not you know, hanging out,

00:01:53.157 --> 00:01:55.915
looking like it's
modifying the wrong noun.

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:57.728
- [Voiceover] So if you're doing editing,

00:01:57.728 --> 00:01:59.743
or you're looking at a sentence,

00:01:59.743 --> 00:02:01.957
when you take a look at a sentence,

00:02:01.957 --> 00:02:04.968
see if you can spot what it is that

00:02:04.968 --> 00:02:07.802
that modifier is supposed
to be describing.

00:02:07.802 --> 00:02:11.870
And then just make sure
that that noun or phrase

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.272
comes right after the modifier.

00:02:15.272 --> 00:02:17.697
[Voiceover] Right, like
in this example we had to

00:02:17.697 --> 00:02:19.443
pretty much completely
rewrite this sentence.

00:02:19.443 --> 00:02:20.902
It still gets across the same idea,

00:02:20.902 --> 00:02:22.954
but we had to put the
nouns in a different order

00:02:22.954 --> 00:02:24.993
so the modifier wasn't dangling any more.

00:02:24.993 --> 00:02:29.156
- [Voiceover] Running around
on his little hamster wheel,

00:02:29.156 --> 00:02:32.501
Albert watched his pet exercise.

00:02:32.501 --> 00:02:33.714
(laughing)

00:02:33.714 --> 00:02:34.547
- [Voiceover] This whole part,

00:02:34.547 --> 00:02:35.427
running around on his
little hamster wheel,

00:02:35.427 --> 00:02:37.210
is the modifier in the sentence,

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.393
but what comes right after it, is Albert,

00:02:39.393 --> 00:02:42.244
which I don't think he's
the one running around

00:02:42.244 --> 00:02:43.852
on a little hamster wheel.

00:02:43.852 --> 00:02:45.318
- [Voiceover] Right so,

00:02:45.318 --> 00:02:46.894
this is something you
want to look out for,

00:02:46.894 --> 00:02:49.879
and maybe rewrite your sentence
so that doesn't happen.

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.373
- [Voiceover] Right
and we have a clue that

00:02:51.373 --> 00:02:55.088
Albert is not the name of
the hamster or the pet,

00:02:55.088 --> 00:02:58.404
because it says Albert
watched his pet exercise.

00:02:58.404 --> 00:03:03.172
So we have a good clue that
Albert is probably a human,

00:03:03.172 --> 00:03:05.869
and he's probably not
running on a hamster wheel.

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:06.702
(laughing)
- [Voiceover] Right?

00:03:06.702 --> 00:03:07.914
- [Voiceover] So he shouldn't
be coming right after that,

00:03:07.914 --> 00:03:09.007
that modifier.

00:03:09.007 --> 00:03:09.851
- [Voiceover] Yeah, exactly.

00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:11.857
- [Voiceover] Running around
on his little hamster wheel,

00:03:11.857 --> 00:03:14.968
the critter exercised
while Albert watched.

00:03:14.968 --> 00:03:17.160
- [Voiceover] Right, so this
is how we made our change.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.269
We still have running around
on his little hamster wheel

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.362
at the beginning,

00:03:20.362 --> 00:03:23.433
but then we sort of,
switched around the order of

00:03:23.433 --> 00:03:25.039
Albert and his pet.

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:28.957
So now we have the critter
following the modifier

00:03:28.957 --> 00:03:32.043
that it's supposed to be modified by.

00:03:32.043 --> 00:03:33.213
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.953
- [Voiceover] Yeah so like,
that is dangling modifiers,

00:03:35.953 --> 00:03:37.478
and how you get rid of them.

00:03:37.478 --> 00:03:40.049
They're words or phrases that describe

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.443
another word or phrase,

00:03:41.443 --> 00:03:44.044
and when they're dangling
they're like in the wrong place,

00:03:44.044 --> 00:03:45.334
they're in front of the wrong noun.

00:03:45.334 --> 00:03:47.321
- [Voiceover] So, when you have a modifier

00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:48.789
at the beginning of your sentence,

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:52.729
and it's set off with a
comma, like all of these are,

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:54.330
that's when you have to pay attention,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.563
and make sure that the noun or phrase

00:03:57.563 --> 00:04:01.361
coming right after the modifier is

00:04:01.361 --> 00:04:04.988
matched up with the modifier,

00:04:04.988 --> 00:04:06.688
so that it's describing the right thing.

00:04:06.688 --> 00:04:08.701
- [Voiceover] Right.
You can get some crazy

00:04:08.701 --> 00:04:10.689
meanings out of your sentences otherwise.

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:12.428
Like the bunny, with lightning.

00:04:12.428 --> 00:04:14.341
So that's dangling modifiers.

00:04:14.341 --> 00:04:15.632
You can learn anything.

00:04:15.632 --> 00:04:16.465
Paige out.

00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:18.155
- [Voiceover] Rosie out.
