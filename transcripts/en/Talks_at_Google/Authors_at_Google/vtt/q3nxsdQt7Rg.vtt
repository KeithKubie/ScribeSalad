00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.916
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:00.916 --> 00:00:02.041
GINA BARNETT: Thanks, Alan.

00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:03.670
Thanks a lot.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.070
Thanks for coming, everybody.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.580
It's wonderful to be here.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.012
It has been a two-year
process, and initially Alan

00:00:10.012 --> 00:00:10.720
asked me to come.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.485
And we got something
on the calendar,

00:00:12.485 --> 00:00:14.610
and then because I hadn't
written a book they said,

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.640
nope, you can't come.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.462
So I actually wrote the book so
I could come talk to you guys.

00:00:18.462 --> 00:00:19.295
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:00:19.295 --> 00:00:21.150
GINA BARNETT: Oh,
you're welcome.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.040
And interestingly, I do
this communications coaching

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.010
and I have been
telling my clients

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:33.870
for the past several years,
you have 30 to 45 seconds

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.640
to make an impression.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.640
And just last week
I read an article

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.730
actually analyzing TED Talks
and what made some of them

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.230
more successful than the others.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.300
And that article said you
actually have seven seconds.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.655
Seven seconds.

00:00:47.655 --> 00:00:49.030
So I've either
blown it with you,

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.190
or you think I have some
credibility at this point.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.710
It's cooked.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.870
It's done at this point.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.040
Anyway, I want to focus
on something today

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.760
that I think you're all
intimately involved with,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.920
but I suspect not very aware of.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.890
And that is this,
your body, your body

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.090
as an instrument of
communication-- highly complex,

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.790
very effective.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.030
But if you think of
a musical instrument,

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.530
for example-- a piano or
a clarinet or a violin--

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.920
if there's a broken key or
a valve that's not working

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.660
or a string on the violin
that's not well-tuned,

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.800
it's almost impossible
to listen to the music

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.310
no matter how well
it's being played,

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.800
because our ears go
to those distractions.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.290
You can work around it.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.140
And a musician can certainly
work around that dent, right?

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.720
But bodies as instruments,
we take a lot of abuse

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.430
over the course of a lifetime.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.670
And we have our own
little places of denting,

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.610
and that can really interrupt
the flow of exchange,

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.840
the connection that ensues.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.660
And one of the things that
I tell all my clients--

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.230
and I work with very, very
interesting people everywhere--

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.160
is that I don't want
you to not be you.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.855
You should be you, absolutely.

00:02:07.855 --> 00:02:08.690
It's gorgeous.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.470
Be you.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.510
But let's find the problem,
or the interruption,

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.430
to the connection,
because often what happens

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.800
with me is I'm called in to
work with people who are highly

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.060
successful who are being groomed
for even greater success,

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.730
but HR calls or a
manager calls and says,

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.490
there's something going on
here with this individual.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.980
And if we can unlock that and
figure out a way around it,

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.240
they can really grow.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.640
So that's something I want
to hit off right at the top,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.000
is that my goal is always
to have you be absolutely

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.910
authentically yourself.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.400
The five things I'm going
to cover with you today--

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.740
the first is how you
communicate ultimately

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.130
becomes what you communicate.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.072
How you do it.

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:56.250
So I'll demonstrate
that right now.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.910
So, um, so I really want
to talk to you today about,

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.550
like, how you
communicate and how

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.415
that's sort of like
what you communicate.

00:03:05.415 --> 00:03:05.915
Thanks.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.610
Point made.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.936
Or, I want to discuss
how you communicate

00:03:11.936 --> 00:03:12.935
is what you communicate.

00:03:15.391 --> 00:03:15.890
Right?

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.370
Just changed your blood pressure
a little bit there, right?

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.000
Tone, the instrument, defines
often what gets taken in.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.650
So how you do it becomes
the what, because if the how

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.720
is really out of balance
with the situation,

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.330
we can't take in the what.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.960
The second thing I
want to talk about

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.930
is the stories that
our bodies tell,

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.260
because our bodies
are influenced deeply

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.590
by their history and
where we grew up--

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.600
accidents, emotional
trauma, a lot

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.380
of things go into this
thing that is ever-changing.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.975
It's not constant.

00:03:47.975 --> 00:03:49.600
You are not what you
were 10 years ago.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.750
You will not be what you are in
10 years from now in this body.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.480
So the story that it tells is
also very interesting to me

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.040
and is very culturally
influenced as well.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.100
I then want to focus a
little bit on the fact

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.920
that we're all communicating
all the time in multiple ways,

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.760
but are we connecting?

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.690
Connecting is kind of a mystery
and kind of fascinating,

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.620
and my personal of obsession.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.600
What makes us connect
to each other?

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.120
How do we do that?

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.459
And what are the blocks to that?

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.480
Then I want to, for you
Googlers specifically,

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.040
want to talk about
the data mining

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.440
that our bodies do, because
they are drawing information

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.180
from ourselves constantly, all
the time, and from each other.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.970
And how you tune into
that data and how

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.370
you make use of
that data's very,

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.750
very-- do you say
dat-ah or day-ta here?

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.020
Which is it?

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.150
Its there an either/or?

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.180
Either one?

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.760
OK, I'll switch back and forth.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.380
And lastly, I want to talk about
embodiment itself-- what it is,

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.540
and how our bodies influence
our thinking and our emotions,

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.210
and then how our bodies
influence each other.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.550
And I'm going to tell you
many stories, because I have

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.190
wonderful ones for my
clients, and they all sort of

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.360
embody these concepts.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.790
So how you communicate.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.280
I was reached out
to by an HR person.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.750
There was a woman in a very
global corporation, very

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.420
sophisticated, very, very
smart, knew her stuff.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.450
They wanted to bring
her into the C-suite.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.000
And they said, you
need to meet her.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.570
She's obviously a subject
expert, but again, something

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:29.290
going on.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.960
So I met this person, who
was as they said-- smart,

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.710
really knew her stuff.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.090
She also had a metabolism that
was like the Energizer bunny.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.180
I mean, she was
super, super fast.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.149
She spoke very quickly.

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:42.940
She was an athlete.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:43.760
She ran.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.140
She was skinny.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.450
But she was one of these people
who never walked anywhere.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.220
She just [WHOOSH], flew.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.060
One of those, down the hall.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.150
And people who knew her
well said, oh, that's her.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.990
We know that.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.610
She would leave
her immediate area

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.490
and people would see
her flying down the hall

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.380
and go, oh, what's the crisis?

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.870
What's going on?

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.270
Or, the other
thing they thought,

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.510
as was projected
by this body, was

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.740
that she was out of control,
which was not the case at all.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.520
But her way of literally
moving in space and time

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.610
impacted what she communicated,
and also how she was perceived.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.950
And you all know about this.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.160
If I said to you, who's
the Energizer bunny

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.920
in your department?

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.200
You're laughing already, right?

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.750
So these have
become meta-messages

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.375
that are communicated
through the body.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.039
A second client was
what I call a stomper.

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:43.580
Should never walked
anywhere, either.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.820
She stomped.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.960
Her heels hit the
floor so hard that you

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:55.040
could hear her coming 30, 40
seconds before she got there.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.210
Her walk also for me became
kind of a metaphor for how

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.040
she treated herself.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.440
She was very hard on herself.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.150
She was very hard on her people.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.270
And that also became sort of an
interesting way to look at it,

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.520
through both changing
the body and making

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.050
her aware of how she treated
herself and treated others.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.320
And trust me, changing
the pace of your walk,

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.590
changing a habit that's deeply
ingrained, is very difficult.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.540
But when it's aligned
with an aspiration,

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.600
interestingly, people do it.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.300
And she did change her walk.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.940
And only after she
changed her walk did

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.160
she learn that people
did hear her coming

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.290
and would buckle down
because they were so

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.810
intimidated by this sort of
marching sound that came.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.960
So these are just
two examples of a

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.760
how that supersedes the what.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.620
And I have another one
I want to tell you,

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.270
which I think is even
more fascinating.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.030
This is a gentleman who
began in the mail room

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.410
at his organization.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:51.510
He was there for 20 years.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:55.380
He moved up through
every operational level.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.460
He was brilliant.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:57.640
He was talented.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.630
And then they put
them into management.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:04.440
And it was fascinating, because
he had these beautiful hands.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:09.260
And I'll never forget, when he
would speak, he did this a lot.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.090
All up here.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:10.910
I put him on video.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.080
He had no idea he did it.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:12.940
He saw it on video.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:13.660
He was like, wow.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.368
They're not here.

00:08:14.368 --> 00:08:18.370
And I said, are you hiding or
are you protecting yourself?

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.120
Because that was felt
the metaphor for me.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.100
You could not see his face.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.200
And he said, you know, I feel
insecure coming from the mail

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.780
room into management.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.600
And you're right, busted.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.500
I've been hiding.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:36.760
So these how's really impact if
we can indeed connect or not.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.330
And they really do
derive also, aside

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.940
from our history and our
position, from our culture.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.810
So that's the story part that
I think is really fascinating.

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.582
I have just the
incredible luxury

00:08:49.582 --> 00:08:51.790
of working in many different
places around the world,

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.230
and I will tell you-- and
I'm sure any of you who've

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:57.500
traveled-- people do not move
the same in every country.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:01.010
Go to Russia, they do not walk
the way they walk in Thailand.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.670
These are deeply
embedded stories

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.950
that we inherit, just the
way we learn language.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.910
We learn language from
mimicry, and we learn movement

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.080
from mimicry.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.260
And we absorb that, and
that becomes muscle memory.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.670
The woman who was most
interesting for me

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:21.990
in that category
was a woman who was

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.730
an expert in Chinese
banking, which is very

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.960
different from Western banking.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.200
Her role was to go to
treasurers of large companies

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.950
or actually heads of state
and explain the intricacies

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:35.440
of Chinese banking.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.710
And she said to me, I show up
to these gigs and they say, oh,

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.700
are you the MBA intern?

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.030
And she's mid-40s
with two teenage kids.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.340
She's like, what is going on?

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.020
I don't get it.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.060
And meanwhile, as I'm watching
her body and her voice-- which

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.360
was very high,
had no resonance--

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.860
her head was tucked down.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.640
Her hands were not visible.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:01.960
And she presented in a body
that was not of a mature expert.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:06.400
And we worked hard on that
as well to change that.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.010
And what was fascinating to me,
she said, if I go back to China

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.810
and I move the way you're
getting me to move now,

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:17.480
my mother will be furious.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.620
Because this is the language
of my body and my home.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.040
But the other point about
that is we are plastic.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:25.910
We can change.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:26.730
We can adapt.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.400
We do all the time,
and we need to.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.500
And we need to understand
when we don't adapt.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.560
Again, that's another
place where perhaps we're

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.300
not connecting.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.150
Another history.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:39.350
I had a client who did this
all the time-- also very

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.920
knowledgeable, knew her stuff.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.980
Whenever she stood up to present
she did this, all the time.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.211
No awareness she did it.

00:10:47.211 --> 00:10:47.710
None.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:48.770
No clue.

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.699
She was also six one.

00:10:51.699 --> 00:10:53.990
So I said, so what was it,
sixth, seventh, eighth grade

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:55.657
when you shot up
like a beanstalk

00:10:55.657 --> 00:10:57.490
and were taller than
everyone in your class?

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.450
She says, how did you know?

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.200
I said, because you're
trying to be short.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.870
You're six one.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:02.969
She didn't feel it.

00:11:02.969 --> 00:11:04.510
She didn't even know
she had done it,

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.230
because that's the other
thing about repetition.

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.650
It goes into these
deep neural paths,

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.040
and we do not even notice it.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.110
We do not even feel it.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:19.130
And the final one
I'll tell you is I'm

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:20.955
working with a
gentleman from Pakistan.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.570
He's been transferred
by his company

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:28.660
to work here in the States.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:33.691
He said to me, in Pakistan,
we stand like this.

00:11:33.691 --> 00:11:36.470
This is our go-to,
comfortable position.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.180
It's totally fine.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:41.310
I've been told, now that
I'm in the United States,

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:45.590
that this is defensive,
it's cut-off, it's blocked,

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:49.110
and I shouldn't be like this.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.530
He said, I'm really
trying to let it go.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:56.750
He says, I open my arms, and
the problem is when I do,

00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:00.480
I lose my train of thought.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.900
He finds that shift
so destabilizing

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:07.630
that he literally the brain
can't find where he is.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:11.940
Because this stuff
is also a dielectric.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:12.980
It's a relationship.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:17.250
Body-mind, body-emotion,
movement-thought-- these things

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:21.620
are all deeply intertwined.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.430
And they have implications,
because then they

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:25.180
impact others.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.850
So I'm coming into a meeting,
I'm standing like this.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.580
Even if it's just my
comfortable position

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.340
from where I came
from, you're going

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.160
to make a decision about me.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:33.830
Are you not?

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:35.255
She already has.

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:36.065
Right?

00:12:36.065 --> 00:12:38.852
I have one client
who's so interesting.

00:12:38.852 --> 00:12:39.810
He said, it's so weird.

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.179
I have these 35 reporters,
and I love them.

00:12:42.179 --> 00:12:43.720
We have great
relationships, he said.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.810
But they come into my
office and they're just

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.161
flying through their stuff.

00:12:48.161 --> 00:12:50.410
It seems like they can't get
out of there fast enough,

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.572
and I don't know if
I'm intimidating them.

00:12:52.572 --> 00:12:53.780
I don't know what's going on.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.780
And I said, look at your thumb.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:58.440
He was doing this the entire
time we were talking, just

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.450
like that.

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:00.000
Super-fast.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.190
Had no idea did it, none.

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:04.510
And as I said, well, yeah.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:05.930
That has meaning to people.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.670
Hurry up, I'm bored-- whatever.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.110
So these little tiny
things read out,

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:13.120
and the how becomes the what.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.610
The story impacts the
ability to connect,

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:20.010
which leads me to this third
component, which is connection.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:24.360
So we communicate constantly in
so many complicated and subtle

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:28.760
ways, but do we impact somebody?

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.921
Do we connect?

00:13:29.921 --> 00:13:31.670
When I say it's been
kind of my obsession,

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.990
I really, really mean it.

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:35.810
I've been curious about
this my whole life.

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:38.414
Why are some people
so effective?

00:13:38.414 --> 00:13:40.580
I don't know if any of you
saw-- literally yesterday

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.920
there was an
article about Obama,

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.660
and that he's become
much more emotional,

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.230
and he's showing his feelings.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.040
And some senator said-- I
can't remember who he was;

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.325
maybe you remember who
said it-- God, if he'd

00:13:50.325 --> 00:13:51.950
been like this six years.

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:54.660
Anyway, I don't want
to get into that.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.490
But the point is, we
are moved by emotion.

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:58.490
We think we're rational?

00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:59.290
We're not.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:00.610
I mean, yes, we have reason.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.850
We can use it occasionally,
but essentially we're animals

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.280
and we are deeply
affected by feeling.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.460
And we can make each other feel.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.092
And so connection to me is
how do you move somebody?

00:14:12.092 --> 00:14:13.050
How do you tickle them?

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.400
How do you move them?

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.490
How do you engage them
with heart and passion?

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:21.410
And part of that is
knowing a, what is

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:23.617
the objective of the exchange?

00:14:23.617 --> 00:14:24.450
What is the purpose?

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.570
What's the intention
of the communication?

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:28.701
So many things-- I've
been to so many meetings

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:30.950
where it's like your 10
minutes into it and it's like,

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:32.690
why are we here?

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:35.240
And that's not an
agenda problem.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.730
You keep nodding like you
get everything I'm saying.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:38.820
I really appreciate that.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.574
It's like staring in the
fridge late at night, ugh,

00:14:45.574 --> 00:14:46.490
you know that feeling?

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:47.840
It's like, why?

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:51.830
And that loss of
intention of that lack

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:55.250
of clarity of intention
already impacts your ability

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:55.805
to connect.

00:14:55.805 --> 00:14:58.502
So you need to have
a clear intention.

00:14:58.502 --> 00:15:00.460
And then you have to
figure out, based on that,

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.340
what style do you want to use?

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:03.940
There are different
styles that we

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.910
embed and employ all the time.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.270
We do this organically.

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:10.560
When you're out with a bunch
of friends at a party on Friday

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.960
night, you're going to move
and speak and use your body

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.720
completely differently than
if on Saturday morning you

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.740
go visit someone in a hospital.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.960
You'll completely change
your way of moving.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.219
So we do this organically.

00:15:25.219 --> 00:15:26.260
We do this instinctively.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.090
If you didn't know this stuff
by kindergarten or first grade,

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:30.990
you were pretty much
out of luck, right?

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:33.870
So this is a natural
human trait, but how

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.739
do you get it to mastery?

00:15:35.739 --> 00:15:37.780
How do you know what the
intention of the meeting

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.300
is and set your
style accordingly,

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.680
and then be incredibly present?

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.900
Which is, I think, the most
critical aspect of connection,

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:48.510
is presence.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:51.550
And that's a word that
gets bandied around a lot,

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:53.860
and it's also kind
of mysterious.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.280
Some people think
it's charisma, energy,

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.480
you're born with it or not.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.910
I totally disagree completely.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:02.670
It's a trainable thing.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:06.990
Presence is about aligning
the body and the voice

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:09.890
with the intention and the
style and the expectation,

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:15.080
and it's also being completely
here, right here, right now.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:15.986
Hard to do.

00:16:15.986 --> 00:16:17.110
A lot of competing agendas.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:20.520
A lot of competing things
pulling on our head.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.150
I was at a training
a little while ago,

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:28.112
and the chief legal officer got
up to introduce some people.

00:16:28.112 --> 00:16:29.570
And she told this
incredible story.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:32.860
She said she had called
a headhunter, because she

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.420
wanted to fill a position.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:38.850
And she said, I want this person
to have this skill set legally

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.860
and this managerial
skill, and this and this,

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.820
and I want them
to have presence.

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.510
And the headhunter
said, oh, presence.

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.680
Well, that's going
to cost you more.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.180
Right?

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.850
So it's even a
commodity at this point.

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:50.880
It's a skill set.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.130
It's a commodity.

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:55.010
But it's about that
aligning with the now.

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:57.790
How do you get in the now?

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:01.800
And part of that,
from my perspective,

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.720
there's a wonderful term
in the theater, in improv,

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.190
called the rule of the yes.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:08.900
Have any of you ever
heard this term?

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:09.740
Yes.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.710
It's a beautiful
thing, isn't it?

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:13.790
So the rule of the
yes basically says,

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:17.666
whatever your colleague in
an improvisation gives you,

00:17:17.666 --> 00:17:20.789
you have to take in and
absorb and say yes to.

00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:25.547
So if I were to say, here
are my keys-- thank you.

00:17:25.547 --> 00:17:26.130
She took them.

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:27.000
Thank you.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.600
So if she'd said, there
are no keys there.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.100
What?

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.600
That's the end of
the improv, right?

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.570
And so my question to everyone
is, how is life any different?

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:37.070
I mean, none of us
know what's going

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:38.970
to happen 15 minutes
or 10 minutes from now.

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:39.840
This is an improv.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.400
We're on the edge of
time all the time,

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.440
and we can either say
yes to what's coming,

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.120
and that leads to
presence in my opinion,

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.820
to the being in the now
fully and completely.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:56.020
Or we can, due to these
other things I've described,

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:59.810
unable to keep one's thinking
process together, habit,

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:01.360
defenses, all kinds
of things that

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.430
prevent us from being on the
edge of time, being open.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:07.750
So presence, to me,
is absolutely a skill.

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:11.475
It's essential, and it really
enables effective, deeply

00:18:11.475 --> 00:18:12.475
effective communication.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:16.068
Where am I?

00:18:18.936 --> 00:18:20.150
Whoo, I'm already here.

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:21.190
How great.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:23.020
So let me tell you a
little bit about-- let

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.025
me take a sip, actually.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:32.060
I'll tell you something a
little bit about my past.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:35.010
I became fascinated by
this stuff as a kid,

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.840
and it's always been
fascinating to me.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.594
Some kids it's butterflies
or it's astronomy.

00:18:41.594 --> 00:18:42.510
For me, it was bodies.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:43.380
It was people.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.370
And I started
studying very young.

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:48.660
Started going to acting
school at nine every Saturday,

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.220
and I went to the same school
all the way through college.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.136
And then through college
I continued studying,

00:18:53.136 --> 00:18:55.680
and then at the same time
I took professional classes

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.000
in the city, graduated, got
my union card, started acting,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.460
kept studying, kept studying,
and started teaching myself

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:03.810
at 28 or 29.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.700
And so if you look
at, what is it,

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.890
Gladwell's 10,000
hours for an outlier?

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:12.700
I don't even know where to
start with how many hours I have

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:16.100
spent in a dark room watching
to see if someone's believable

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.300
or not.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.390
And when they're not, why.

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:22.190
And when I first
started teaching,

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:25.240
I used to get sleepy sometimes.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.790
Not all the time.

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:29.439
And at first I thought,
nn-nn, I'm a bad teacher.

00:19:29.439 --> 00:19:30.730
I didn't sleep well last night.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:33.069
I don't have focus muscle.

00:19:33.069 --> 00:19:34.860
But then I began to
realize, you know what?

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:35.693
That's not the case.

00:19:35.693 --> 00:19:40.210
I'm getting sleepy
when they're faking it.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:43.040
I'm getting sleepy when
they're pushing, when they're

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:47.910
hiding, when they're indicating,
when they're not engaging me

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:48.800
for some reason.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.920
And this is not a
special skill set.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.640
I do these trainings with
groups of people a lot,

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.800
and someone will
get up to present.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.680
And not always-- not
always-- but sometimes I

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:06.360
will say to the group,
did anybody's mind wander?

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:11.170
And a hand will come up, and at
some point a lot of people go,

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:12.270
[MAKES A NOISE].

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:13.670
And I'll go, when?

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:15.897
And they'll go, slide four.

00:20:15.897 --> 00:20:16.730
Just like, [SWOOSH].

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.770
I was gone.

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:21.740
And the speaker will
often say at that moment,

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.700
I hate that slide.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.950
Or, I was totally
board at that section.

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:27.640
I didn't want to even do it.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.780
It's fascinating, because
we pick this stuff up.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:31.520
We really do.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.140
We're incredibly attuned,
which leads me to this antenna

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:38.640
that we have, which goes
back to the data part.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.485
This antenna is amazing.

00:20:41.485 --> 00:20:43.206
And when I said in
the beginning you

00:20:43.206 --> 00:20:44.830
have this body that
you live with but I

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:47.510
don't know that you're
that aware of it,

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:51.260
think about your antenna and how
incredibly sophisticated it is.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:55.030
And how often do
you truly use it?

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:59.980
Now, I know when we're on a dark
street by ourselves at night,

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.810
everybody's antenna reaches
at least 400, 500 feet ahead.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:05.810
Am I safe or am I in danger?

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:07.220
Who's coming?

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.160
And this is hardwired.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:12.920
This is old limbic
brain on the savanna.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.915
Is this something coming to give
me something to eat or eat me?

00:21:15.915 --> 00:21:17.590
And obviously, we
wouldn't have survived

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.381
if we didn't make that
decision, because we

00:21:19.381 --> 00:21:21.850
would have been dinner
early on in our evolution.

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:24.170
So this is deep in all of us.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:27.390
The question is, how much do
you really, really use it?

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.920
So in terms of connecting
with an audience,

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.980
you need to have a very
acute antenna so that you're

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.490
reading from them all the
time, being in that present

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:39.869
with them, moving together,
reading the micro signals

00:21:39.869 --> 00:21:41.410
that you're getting
from an audience.

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.550
I'm getting a lot of
little nods and all kinds

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:46.270
of signals from you right
now, which is great.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:46.850
Thank you.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:48.990
Love that one.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:52.880
But also, there's the
antenna for the self.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.100
And this is what I really,
really focused on deeply

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.004
in the book.

00:21:59.004 --> 00:22:01.170
I don't think we listen to
this thing nearly enough.

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:03.550
I mean, absolutely, we
listen when we're hungry.

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:04.710
We listen when we're tired.

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:06.084
We listen when we
got a headache.

00:22:06.084 --> 00:22:10.230
When there's some gross
signal, we listen.

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.330
But the deep
listening that we need

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:16.180
to do on a regular basis to tune
in to the moment to the body

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.140
is a muscle, and
we need to grow it.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.890
So for example, you're
heading into a meeting

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:24.610
and you stop for a second
and you notice, whoa.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:26.530
My jaw is a vice.

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.304
I'm just, whoa.

00:22:28.304 --> 00:22:30.470
And then you sit with your
sense of what's going on.

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:31.219
Oh, you know what?

00:22:31.219 --> 00:22:33.990
Three days ago I had a
meeting with those guys,

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:35.980
and two of them really
made me feel this big.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:39.994
And I'm pissed off,
and that's right here.

00:22:39.994 --> 00:22:41.785
And I'm not going to
speak at this meeting.

00:22:41.785 --> 00:22:44.285
I'm just going to come in and
I'm not going to say anything,

00:22:44.285 --> 00:22:45.610
or whatever you decide to do.

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:48.170
Right?

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:52.390
There's information
all the time.

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:53.580
Am I excited?

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:54.400
Am I nervous?

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.440
Where does that go in my body?

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.330
How do I work with that?

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.700
So if you notice
that, for example,

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.143
then you have a choice.

00:23:02.143 --> 00:23:06.520
Ah, OK, I'm still holding
on to three days ago,

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.640
and that's living in my jaw.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.320
And I've already made
an unconscious decision

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.110
not to communicate in
this meeting-- not good.

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:16.024
How do I get present?

00:23:16.024 --> 00:23:17.440
What is my goal
with this meeting?

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.830
What do I want to connect about?

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:20.860
How do I open this
up, and how do I

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.430
walk in and be in
today's meeting,

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:26.830
not carry the meeting
from three days ago here?

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.800
Does that make sense?

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.460
And it's tricky,
and it's an art,

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:33.740
and it's not something
that we all can't do.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:37.060
We just have to do it more
than we ever realized.

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.810
And of course, one
of the challenges

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:43.330
is, with signals
as well and data,

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:47.490
is we can misread the data-- not
necessarily from ourselves all

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:49.660
the time, but from others.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:55.140
So this one was misread
by all his people.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.890
It was just a habit.

00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:00.300
But people projected onto it.

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:02.180
I was running a program
a few years ago.

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:04.550
And I video people
occasionally, and my camera

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:07.120
broke in the middle
of this event.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.770
And I did not realize what
I was doing with my face.

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:13.940
Anyway, it ended and
the presenter said,

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.720
why are you so angry at me?

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.980
She had completely
assumed I was furious

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.030
at her, because
obviously I was furious.

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:22.420
But I was angry at
my camera, not her.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.070
But she didn't know that.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:26.680
So that's the other thing
about how we read the data.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:29.770
How do we figure out
what the truth is?

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:32.660
So we have to have this
incredible antenna.

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:34.730
We have to trust it.

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:37.200
But then we have to question it.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.820
And we have to have the
vocabulary to question it.

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.320
We have to have a robust,
robust vocabulary so that we

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:48.000
can read the signals and
find out in the moment,

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.750
are we together on this?

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:51.700
And that's hard to do.

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.950
I will grant you, that is
really, really hard to do,

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:56.960
especially if you're feeling
somewhat threatened or uptight.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.860
But for example,
rather than racing out

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:00.610
of his room when his
thumb was doing this

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:03.270
all the time, if somebody had
just said, is this a good time,

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:05.540
or do you want me to come back?

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.280
And he might have said, why?

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:11.490
And they'd say, well, ugh,
you're doing this thing.

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:13.500
And that might have
stopped this way earlier.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.160
But it's hard, especially
in power positions

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.050
and relationships.

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:18.391
It's hard to do that.

00:25:18.391 --> 00:25:20.390
It's hard to bring that
stuff up to the surface.

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:24.860
But when you have an openness,
when you have a curiosity, when

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.150
you allow yourself to read
these signals in the moment

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:31.070
and take them in
and trust-- which

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:33.880
leads me to another
complication,

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:38.710
which is trust and gut instinct.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:40.530
What I did in the
book was I went

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:43.280
through different sectors
of the body, both literally,

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.620
physically, metaphorically,
I'd go through the head,

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:47.910
I'd go through the
heart, arms, and chest,

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:50.650
and literally how
this can affect

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:54.160
his thinking process, the
gut, the hips, and the legs.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.177
And we all know
about gut instinct,

00:25:57.177 --> 00:25:59.010
and it's an important
part of our skill set.

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:01.980
It's very aligned
with that antenna.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:04.980
But it's tricky, because
we have what I think

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:08.350
are three very different ways
of assessing a situation.

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:12.102
First of all, we have feelings.

00:26:12.102 --> 00:26:13.810
And feelings are
different than emotions,

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:15.101
and they're different than gut.

00:26:15.101 --> 00:26:17.110
Feelings are body-related.

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:19.280
They are, I'm cold.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:19.840
I'm hungry.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.310
They are from the senses, and
we can recognize feelings,

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:24.170
obviously.

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:27.800
Emotions are feelings that
are aligned with emotions, as

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.460
in happiness, sadness.

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.040
And they're very
fleeting, right?

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.630
You wake up grumpy, you
don't want to go to work.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:35.260
Alan sees his kid smile.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.060
Suddenly everything's
better, right?

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:41.320
So these things come
and go very quickly.

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.915
But gut sticks.

00:26:42.915 --> 00:26:44.220
It doesn't go away.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.090
It's got a sense
about something.

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:48.230
And it's rooted both
to that antenna,

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:52.840
but it also can be connected
to a very early memory that's

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:54.770
lodged back here.

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:56.650
So for example,
you're two-years-old

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:59.430
and you get bitten
by big white dog.

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:02.472
No matter how many years
have gone by and you're 40,

00:27:02.472 --> 00:27:04.680
you're still going to see
a big white dog coming down

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:08.610
the street and that limbic
brain is going to go, [SHOCK].

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:11.800
And your reason, your
neocortex, will say,

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.010
that was way back when.

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:15.090
I've seen 500 big
white dogs since then.

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:16.666
No problem.

00:27:16.666 --> 00:27:17.790
And you'll move through it.

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:18.980
But it's there.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:20.830
But on the other
hand-- this goes back

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:23.560
to really listening,
listening to the body.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:28.120
You've got a new manager or
you have a client meeting,

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:31.240
and your gut says,
don't trust them.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.560
Don't trust them.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.680
Why?

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.940
Is it in the moment?

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.710
Is it something
that they're doing?

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:40.297
Or do you realize upon
reflection that night lying

00:27:40.297 --> 00:27:41.380
in bed, oh, you know what?

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.240
His chin looks just
like this friend I

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.650
had years ago who betrayed me.

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.430
So this assignment of
meaning-- reading bodies,

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:54.190
listening to your own-- these
are all really, really deep

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:59.780
subjects that require, as I
said, an ability to tune in,

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.000
to attune.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.650
So you want both
your instrument to be

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:06.020
tuned and attuned to
itself and everyone else.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.650
Because finally, the fifth
thing I want to cover,

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:15.420
is embodiment, which is, we
are not alone in these bodies.

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:18.910
Our bodies impact each
other and ourselves.

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:20.700
And that's just the truth.

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:27.110
Now, one thing that we all
know is when you're sad,

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.986
you look said.

00:28:28.986 --> 00:28:29.485
Right?

00:28:29.485 --> 00:28:30.660
It just happens.

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:34.060
And when you're
happy, you look happy.

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:37.610
What actors now, and what's
increasingly becoming known,

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:42.910
is you can use your body
to change how you feel.

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:45.670
You can use your body
to change how you feel.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:50.090
You can align that changed
body with a different thought

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:54.840
process, and you can actually
completely shift not only

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:58.880
how you feel, but
how you're perceived.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.126
This is not magic.

00:29:01.126 --> 00:29:01.625
Watch.

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:14.526
I'm not doing a lot, but I
don't feel very happy right now.

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:20.035
All I did was drop my shoulders.

00:29:20.035 --> 00:29:20.930
Was that funny?

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:24.010
Did you like that?

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:25.787
What did I do?

00:29:25.787 --> 00:29:26.745
I dropped my shoulders.

00:29:26.745 --> 00:29:28.740
I didn't make eye contact.

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.870
I lowered my volume.

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:32.340
And I actually
began in that moment

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.700
to feel a little bit sad.

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.560
So it's a dynamic.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.170
The body impacts
the self as much

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:42.090
as the self and the
emotions impact the body,

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:46.040
and it impacts other bodies,
as I demonstrated earlier

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:51.200
when I yelled at you,
or with his thumb.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.190
I want to read you this
absolutely gorgeous quote.

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:55.950
This is by a guy named
Guy Claxton, who's

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:57.380
a cognitive scientist.

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:00.780
I love this quote.
"Through the body,

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:04.890
I am deeply
ecological, profoundly

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:10.080
and ceaselessly in conversation
with the physical and social

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:15.780
milieu in which I am
embedded, and from which

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.650
I am continually emerging."

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:19.500
So there's that other piece.

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:20.620
We're not static here.

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.560
This is a process.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.500
And it's changing.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:24.660
This is my favorite.

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:27.575
"Like the wave, I am made up.

00:30:27.575 --> 00:30:31.880
I am concocted by
the world around me.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:37.230
Like a mobile phone, I may
look like a lump of stuff,

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:41.610
but I am actually
acquiver with information,

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:47.000
whether or not I'm checking
myself for messages."

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.170
And then he says, so says
the science of embodiment.

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:52.060
And that checking
oneself for messages

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.400
is something we can all do.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.600
You can all do it.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.960
It's not hard.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.070
It's a matter of just tuning
in and making the choice

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:01.470
to be in the present
with your body,

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:04.810
interpreting the messages
your body is sending,

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:06.800
asking yourself if
they're true or if there's

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:11.280
some kind of leftover stuff,
having a clear intention so

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.390
that you go into a meeting
or any conversation

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:16.470
with an objective so that
you can hopefully connect,

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:18.870
understanding the story
that your body is indeed

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:22.230
telling so that it tells a
story you want it to tell.

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:24.480
So if you go back home
after you've changed,

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.910
you can still talk to your
mother and not get yelled at.

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:29.920
And ultimately, so
that your how and your

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:35.170
what are not dissonant, going
back to the musical analogy--

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:38.680
are not dissonant, but are
in tune with each other.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.320
And that's my obsession.

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:44.340
That's what I think we should
all actually aim towards.

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:47.430
This is not something left
just for gurus and masters.

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:49.040
Anybody can do this.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:53.750
The book itself is
called "Play the Part",

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:55.560
Because I don't
think we play enough.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:56.290
Maybe at Google.

00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:59.010
I just saw your ping pong
tables as I was walking here,

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:00.670
so I know you guys play.

00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:02.330
So that's good,
because many places

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:04.210
I work there is just no play.

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:08.220
And it just breaks my heart,
because we need to play.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:11.620
And what I want in the book
for people to do and hopefully

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:15.680
experience is how to engage with
your body in a very different

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.150
way than we typically do,
because what we all tend to do

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:21.410
is move in the same routine
gestures over and over

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:23.390
and over and over
and over again,

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:26.000
and then become sort
of locked in by them.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.974
And so experiencing yourself
in some sort of, I don't know,

00:32:28.974 --> 00:32:31.390
funky way-- I don't know, I'm
having an impulse right now.

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:32.010
Why not?

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:33.030
What's the harm?

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:34.310
It's yours.

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:36.930
One of my favorite things to
do is to go to a playground

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:39.210
and just watch kids move.

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:43.250
They move without any
sense of restriction.

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:46.750
And they do incredible
things with their bodies.

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:50.400
And then we just sort of
get smaller and smaller,

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.510
and now this is what
I see everywhere.

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:57.200
That's really unfortunate.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.650
Look what it does to the voice.

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:03.916
That whole thing is becoming
12, 14 hours in that position.

00:33:03.916 --> 00:33:05.640
[SHIVERS] Right?

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:10.600
So my goal is, hopefully
I've got some thoughts

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.880
into your head that are a little
bit different than the usual.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.520
I'll leave you with one
other image of that.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:22.060
Think about getting on a
plane-- taking your body,

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:23.770
putting it in a
steel tube that's

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:27.740
going to go 38,000 feet in the
air, you never see the pilot.

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:32.530
If he got on that intercom
and said, uh, uh, hi, oh, hi.

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:35.885
Oh, I hope we get there
where we're going.

00:33:35.885 --> 00:33:38.990
You'd be off that plane.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:40.480
Pilots study this stuff.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:44.620
They know that 95% of the
time, you will never see them.

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:47.289
They know that you have to
trust that you're putting

00:33:47.289 --> 00:33:48.330
your life in their hands.

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:50.690
And they-- good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:51.960
This is your pilot speaking.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:57.740
They use their voice, just
their voice, to calm you down.

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.370
So voice is powerful.

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:00.800
This is powerful.

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.160
Thought is powerful.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:05.150
We're all in this
bowl of soup together.

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:07.480
If you think of a pond
with a rock, the ripples,

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.790
think about all those
rocks and all those ripples

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:12.260
impacting each
other all the time.

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:15.520
To have that awareness
of that is really, as far

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.949
as I'm concerned, crucial.

00:34:16.949 --> 00:34:20.580
Our world is getting
incredibly complex,

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:24.610
where colliding othernesses are
bumping up against each other

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:25.889
all the time.

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:27.909
And we need to be curious.

00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:29.090
We need to be open.

00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:31.570
We need to observe
bodies, see the signals

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:32.739
that they're sending.

00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:35.600
Alan and I were talking at
lunch about people standing

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.690
on street corners
or in the elevator

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:44.320
like this, clueless that people
have to get out of that door.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.489
Come on.

00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:46.310
It's brief.

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.929
Enjoy it.

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:47.600
Love it.

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.949
If any of you guys are
open, I have two exercises,

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:53.096
one that we can do all
together right now.

00:34:53.096 --> 00:34:54.679
No big whoop, just
stay in your chair.

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:55.130
We can do that.

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:55.630
Yes?

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:56.199
Open?

00:34:56.199 --> 00:34:58.573
And then I have another one
that's kind of wacky and fun.

00:34:58.573 --> 00:35:03.160
If I have five game volunteers,
we'll do that one afterwards.

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.975
You can think about it
while we do the first one.

00:35:06.975 --> 00:35:09.330
OK, so just get
comfortable for a sec.

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:10.355
Sit back in your seat.

00:35:10.355 --> 00:35:14.140
Make sure your tush is
nice and back in the seat,

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:18.390
as opposed to forward and
you're all crunched here.

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:19.990
And just close your
eyes for a second.

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.250
So take just one nice breath.

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:29.220
And what I'd like you
to do, very simply,

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:34.940
is just let all the muscles in
your abdomen in your belly go.

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:38.750
Just let the belly
get completely soft

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:40.725
and open and floppy.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:50.649
We all tend to hold there a lot,
which is important for posture

00:35:50.649 --> 00:35:51.190
and standing.

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:57.570
But sometimes just completely
letting it flub out

00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:59.030
is a wonderful feeling.

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:01.680
I'm seeing a lot of smiles
all around the room.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.280
OK, good.

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.790
You can open your eyes.

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:04.332
How was that?

00:36:04.332 --> 00:36:05.998
Anybody want to say
anything about that?

00:36:05.998 --> 00:36:06.735
Wasn't that cool?

00:36:06.735 --> 00:36:08.495
That's kind of
extraordinary, isn't it?

00:36:08.495 --> 00:36:09.370
I didn't invent that.

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:10.900
That's from yoga, It's
called soft belly.

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:11.860
But it's beautiful.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:12.770
It's so simple.

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:15.770
You can do that at
your desk, any time.

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:18.800
You can do a before
challenging meeting.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.900
It can just open your
heart a little bit.

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.310
Thoughts, questions, anything?

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.740
I worked with
actors for so long.

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:33.340
I taught acting
for over 20 years,

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:36.870
and worked with all
professional actors, actually.

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:37.820
And I loved it.

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:41.980
But I'm one of these people
I have about a 10-year cycle.

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:43.550
I get bored.

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:44.670
And I got bored.

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:46.350
What can I say?

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:48.650
But on a deeper
level, I really feel

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:51.650
that the tools and the
techniques that actors use

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:54.210
should be available to everyone.

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:56.110
They're incredible,
and they are about

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:58.954
moving people and engaging
people and persuading people.

00:36:58.954 --> 00:37:00.120
Why do we go to the theater?

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:04.660
We go to see ourselves up there
and be moved and be affected.

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:06.830
So I really, for
many years, even

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:08.920
while I was teaching
acting, was thinking a lot

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:13.310
about how can I bring this to
non-actors so that other people

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:14.260
can be affected?

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:18.051
And we're all in
roles all the time.

00:37:18.051 --> 00:37:19.300
We're playing different roles.

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.250
We shift our styles all
the time accordingly,

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:22.875
and it's really nice
to have an ability

00:37:22.875 --> 00:37:25.180
to check in with this
instrument and see

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:27.370
if it's in tune with
this particular role,

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:28.640
this particular engagement.

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.360
How do I have to shift my style?

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.790
Really important.

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:34.132
When I work, for
example, in Russia,

00:37:34.132 --> 00:37:35.590
there's a lot of
pushback in Russia

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:37.300
and I have to be
really like this,

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.610
like that, because they
won't take me seriously

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:41.810
unless I'm really like that.

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:43.650
And yet when I've
worked in Thailand,

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:45.530
it's a very different culture.

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:46.640
I change my voice.

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:49.850
I change my walk, if
I'm going to connect.

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:52.090
And that's not
being inauthentic.

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:53.960
It's knowing that
we are very plastic.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:54.730
We can change.

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:58.700
And how do I get to you and you?

00:37:58.700 --> 00:37:59.260
Right?

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.889
And that's something that
is available to all of us.

00:38:01.889 --> 00:38:03.680
And as I said earlier,
we do instinctively.

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.940
But to have some mastery
over it, I think,

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:08.800
is really critical, especially
as the world gets so,

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.839
so, so complex
and we are meeting

00:38:10.839 --> 00:38:12.130
so many people from everywhere.

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:22.740
So what I love about this
book, the book has over 100

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:24.260
"Try This."

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:27.360
And they are everything,
from ways to move,

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.720
ways to use the body,
ways to affect posture,

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:31.460
ways to impact your face.

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.630
So I go through the
body sector by sector,

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:38.480
so in addition to discussing the
implications of various things,

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.511
there's an index which says,
this is for confidence.

00:38:41.511 --> 00:38:42.510
This is for preparation.

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:47.930
So there's 100 ways that
you can practice and engage

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:50.330
with yourself differently
that I think are incredibly--

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:51.470
and that's also why I wrote it.

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:53.011
I wanted to get this
information out.

00:38:53.011 --> 00:38:56.690
And by the way, if any of
you-- any of you-- have kids,

00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:59.124
I have no problem with
competitive sports

00:38:59.124 --> 00:38:59.790
and all of that.

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:00.760
It's fantastic.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:02.280
You learn so much from that.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.472
Put them in an acting class.

00:39:04.472 --> 00:39:06.340
Nine years old?

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.450
Put them in acting
class, even if they have

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:10.320
no aspirations to be an actor.

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.670
They will learn to listen.

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:13.290
They will learn to
play differently.

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:14.850
They will learn to collaborate.

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:16.180
They'll use their imagination.

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:19.750
They'll learn to fail, and
they'll learn to get back up.

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:22.880
I can't tell you what you can
learn in that environment.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:25.890
And I think there's a reason
why many schools have a class

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:27.560
play, because there's
so much that is

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.410
learned in that environment.

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:30.939
So yes, there's
many, many things,

00:39:30.939 --> 00:39:32.230
so you have to go buy the book.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.920
Very simple.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.120
Part of the challenge
is to-- I mean, even

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.910
to define authenticity.

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:49.792
As in, we can smell
it when somebody's

00:39:49.792 --> 00:39:51.250
a phony, in general,
unless they're

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:52.676
super, super good at it.

00:39:52.676 --> 00:39:53.800
Unless they're a sociopath.

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.320
Those are hard to
smell, and even police

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.819
have said it's hard to smell
out a sociopath because they're

00:39:57.819 --> 00:39:58.670
so good.

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:03.580
But most of us have a sense that
when someone is really being

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:06.349
truthful and being authentic,
that that inner part

00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:08.140
of the head going, oh,
I've got to do this,

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.400
I've got to do that,
how can I do this,

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.066
dat-dat-dit-dat-dat-dat,
back and forth.

00:40:11.066 --> 00:40:14.760
And then you're not
in the moment, right?

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.260
Part of it has to
do with encourage.

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:18.530
Part of it has to be really
listening to what's going on.

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:19.305
You don't want to be a phony.

00:40:19.305 --> 00:40:21.263
You don't want to suddenly
stand there, oh, I'm

00:40:21.263 --> 00:40:25.210
going to be like this at this
meeting, and that's the style.

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:31.460
No, that's-- I was going to say
another word, but I held back.

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:34.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.940
Somebody hired me recently
and said, be prepared.

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:37.980
She drops the f-bomb.

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:39.563
It's almost impossible
for her not to.

00:40:45.429 --> 00:40:46.970
I have a number of
responses to that.

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:50.750
One is, if you know what
your intention is-- again,

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:53.822
if you know what you want--
what do I want right now?

00:40:53.822 --> 00:40:54.780
So you're in a meeting.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:55.404
What do I want?

00:40:55.404 --> 00:40:57.490
I want this person to trust me.

00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:58.570
That's what I want.

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:00.653
If she trusts me, then
we'll do business together.

00:41:00.653 --> 00:41:04.230
If she doesn't trust me, we
won't do business together.

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:05.830
How do you get
somebody to trust you?

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:07.560
You have to listen to them.

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.070
When you're stuck in
your head thinking

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:13.720
about how do you have to behave,
you're focused on yourself.

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:17.130
You're not focused on the other.

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:19.192
And that is one of the
great destabilizers--

00:41:19.192 --> 00:41:21.400
how should I be, what should
I do, how should I move?

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:22.430
No, forget it.

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:25.630
Focus out.

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:27.250
Somebody said to
me recently, oh, I

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:29.220
know how to move my arms
when I'm presenting,

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:31.389
but when I'm in an
informal conversation,

00:41:31.389 --> 00:41:32.930
I don't know what
to do with my arms.

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:34.970
I said, because when you're
informal cocktail party,

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:36.030
you're just thinking
about yourself

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:38.110
and how cool you can
be, versus who's there.

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:39.750
Who are you talking to?

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:42.660
Curiosity, to me,
is the greatest gift

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:44.720
we have about each other.

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:48.360
And if you actually take
the time to look and listen,

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.180
it will happen organically.

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:51.710
I believe that.

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:54.060
On the other hand, if
it's something more formal

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:57.315
where you need practice and
it's a more formal presentation,

00:41:57.315 --> 00:41:59.290
you have to practice.

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:01.714
My new meme-- and
you can all tweet it.

00:42:01.714 --> 00:42:02.630
I give you permission.

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:05.340
I joined Twitter a
couple weeks ago.

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:08.640
I've got 60 followers, OK?

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:11.340
Hashtag-- I can't remember--
play the part book.

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:15.670
Anyway, practice does
not make perfect.

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:20.190
Practice makes
imperfection livable.

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:21.740
I hate that practice
makes perfect.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:22.890
Nothing's perfect.

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:24.060
Nothing's perfect, ever.

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:25.450
We mess up all the time.

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:27.080
It's how you roll with it.

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.882
It's how you're honest with it.

00:42:28.882 --> 00:42:31.090
It's how you say, I don't
know what to say right now.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:33.630
I have so many people
say to me in meetings,

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:38.590
I wanted to say something and I
got stuck in my head thinking,

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:41.050
oh, it's not a good idea.

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:43.730
Two minutes later,
somebody else said it.

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:45.980
Then I spent the rest of the
meeting beating myself up

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:47.300
because I never said it.

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:47.800
Right?

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.930
Because you're in your
head versus really engaged

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:52.710
and trusting that
you may mess up.

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:54.310
It's OK.

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:55.895
You'll be forgiven.

00:42:55.895 --> 00:42:57.020
You've got to roll with it.

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:06.230
I guess it's the root
of what is correct.

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:07.730
I mean, if the
political correctness

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:10.966
is to not offend people
and to, again, connect,

00:43:10.966 --> 00:43:13.090
then yes, sometimes we may
have to hold our tongue.

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:14.860
We may have to say things
slightly differently

00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:17.140
to not offend someone,
because once they're offended,

00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:18.280
their defenses come up.

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.860
The conversation's over.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:22.750
Again, the mystery
of connection's deep.

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:24.416
I'm not going to say
this is easy stuff.

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.050
Personally, I think you can.

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:35.480
I am still myself Gina
when I go to Russia

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:38.016
and I change my vocal
style and delivery

00:43:38.016 --> 00:43:39.140
than when I go to Thailand.

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:39.723
It's still me.

00:43:39.723 --> 00:43:41.072
It's still my values.

00:43:41.072 --> 00:43:42.280
It's still what I care about.

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:44.230
It's still the same teaching.

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:48.560
But I shift, because I
want to make the bond.

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:52.220
The bond is what
matters for me, always.

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:53.060
It's still me.

00:43:59.737 --> 00:44:00.945
I throw that out to the room.

00:44:00.945 --> 00:44:02.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:05.360
What do you guys
think authenticity is?

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.620
AUDIENCE: Being yourself.

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:07.828
GINA BARNETT: Being yourself.

00:44:07.828 --> 00:44:09.050
AUDIENCE: Being self-aware--

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:09.940
GINA BARNETT: Self-aware.

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:11.190
AUDIENCE: --in your best self.

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:14.039
Being honest with yourself.

00:44:14.039 --> 00:44:14.830
GINA BARNETT: Yeah.

00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:18.590
When I mentioned having
tension in your jaw,

00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:21.034
you're already at
war with yourself.

00:44:21.034 --> 00:44:22.700
So you're going to
go into that meeting,

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:24.460
you're not going to really
be your authentic self

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:25.940
in that meeting, because
you're still angry about what

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:27.200
happened a few days ago.

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.480
And you're carrying that.

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:30.135
And again, I think
that stuff reads.

00:44:30.135 --> 00:44:32.510
It may not read on a conscious
level for a lot of people.

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:36.950
They may not have the
vocabulary to say what they see.

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:38.420
I have the vocabulary,
because I've

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:41.190
spent 40 years
analyzing and looking

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:43.281
like a laser at this stuff.

00:44:43.281 --> 00:44:45.030
But most people haven't,
but they feel it.

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.730
They sense something.

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:46.950
They'll say, you
didn't speak up.

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:47.530
What's up?

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:48.620
What's up?

00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:49.560
They can feel it.

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:52.504
We read each other
incredibly well.

00:44:52.504 --> 00:44:54.920
And that sort of goes back to
that richness of vocabulary.

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:56.400
How do we make use
of what we read?

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.590
When do we speak up?

00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:01.300
There's also the art of
when not to say something.

00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:03.210
That's not being inauthentic.

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:06.090
That's being smart.

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:08.885
We can't always say
what we want to say.

00:45:08.885 --> 00:45:11.510
Now, do we have five volunteers
who want to do something really

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:12.150
wacky and fun?

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:14.470
If we don't, that's fine.

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:16.120
Oh, that hand wants to go up.

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:17.520
I've got one.

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.250
I've got two.

00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:19.810
Come on.

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:21.520
I've got three.

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:23.234
OK, come on over here.

00:45:23.234 --> 00:45:24.650
And the rest of
you, why don't you

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:27.430
just come over here
or turn your chairs

00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:30.130
so you can watch this exercise?

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:31.750
We'll pick one person.

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:35.440
How about the lovely
gentleman in the green shirt?

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:37.290
You guys back off a little bit.

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:40.290
I'd like you to walk
in a large circle,

00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:42.860
just using this whole
space-- bigger circle.

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:44.665
Make it really big.

00:45:44.665 --> 00:45:46.030
AUDIENCE: Around the chair?

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:48.440
GINA BARNETT: Yeah,
just that space there.

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:50.760
Nice big circle.

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.395
And one by one, I
want each of you

00:45:52.395 --> 00:45:58.107
to fall in behind this lovely
gentlemen and copy his walk.

00:45:58.107 --> 00:46:01.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:04.120
To the best of your capacity.

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:05.630
Don't worry about being perfect.

00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:07.657
It's about the
spirit of the thing.

00:46:07.657 --> 00:46:12.527
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.470
You can all hashtag #walkcopy.

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.760
OK, now exaggerate your
walk just a little bit.

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.332
Really make it a little
bit more over the top.

00:46:35.332 --> 00:46:36.040
Have fun with it.

00:46:42.327 --> 00:46:43.910
OK, now you stop
walking in the center

00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:46.250
and everybody else keep
walking but really exaggerate

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:46.760
that walk.

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:47.520
Really.

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.413
Yeah, there we go.

00:46:49.413 --> 00:46:50.399
There we go.

00:46:50.399 --> 00:46:52.864
Now we've got some
walking going on.

00:46:52.864 --> 00:46:54.343
I love it.

00:46:54.343 --> 00:46:56.320
Yes!

00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:57.240
OK, great.

00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:57.920
Bravo.

00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:59.265
Good work, guys.

00:46:59.265 --> 00:47:01.045
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:01.045 --> 00:47:04.346
So my quick question is,
what did that feel like?

00:47:04.346 --> 00:47:05.560
AUDIENCE: It's awkward.

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:06.170
GINA BARNETT: It is awkward.

00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:06.300
It's strange.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:07.540
AUDIENCE: Forcing
your body frame.

00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:09.345
First of all, there's the
masculine-feminine thing

00:47:09.345 --> 00:47:10.880
and the center of gravity thing.

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.260
GINA BARNETT: Totally.

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:15.240
But did it bring up any
different emotion just

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:17.970
to walk in a completely
radically altered way?

00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:18.450
AUDIENCE: Because
you kind of have

00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:20.533
to try to put yourself in
the other person's shoes

00:47:20.533 --> 00:47:22.960
to be able to echo
what they're doing.

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.920
GINA BARNETT: How
often do we do that?

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.860
How often do we put ourselves
in another person's shoes

00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:30.960
to experience
ourselves differently,

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:33.260
to begin to figure out
what they're about,

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:34.891
what they might be feeling?

00:47:34.891 --> 00:47:37.390
Did any of you feel different--
I know you're being watched,

00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:39.540
but did it trigger any
emotions of any sort?

00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:40.752
Did you feel kind of happy?

00:47:40.752 --> 00:47:41.710
AUDIENCE: A little bit.

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:43.668
Dina's walk was very
normal and rational to me,

00:47:43.668 --> 00:47:46.097
but it felt like I was
almost inside his head

00:47:46.097 --> 00:47:46.930
when I did his walk.

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:49.160
I was thinking [INAUDIBLE]
the way he thought,

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:52.657
and perhaps trying to impress
the world in the way he would

00:47:52.657 --> 00:47:53.740
kind of impress the world.

00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:54.800
GINA BARNETT: Interesting,
"impress the world."

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:55.840
Interesting choice of words.

00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:58.465
I had a client who used to come
in from Europe to work with me.

00:47:58.465 --> 00:48:01.960
He was very tall, very
proper, very European.

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.190
Kind of stiff guy.

00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:05.490
And I said, I want you
to do this exercise

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:07.444
when you leave my office.

00:48:07.444 --> 00:48:08.360
It was nighttime, too.

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.140
He goes, what if
someone sees me?

00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:11.713
I said, you're in New York.

00:48:11.713 --> 00:48:12.504
You live in Europe.

00:48:12.504 --> 00:48:14.320
No one knows you!

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.140
It's nighttime.

00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:17.435
And he was so resistant.

00:48:17.435 --> 00:48:19.260
And I said, I just think
this will be magic for you.

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:20.093
Just give it a shot.

00:48:20.093 --> 00:48:22.880
Anyway, he wound up texting
me a couple weeks later,

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:26.418
going I've been following
little Japanese ladies home.

00:48:26.418 --> 00:48:26.918
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:26.918 --> 00:48:30.226
He's like, I'm having
the time of my life.

00:48:30.226 --> 00:48:30.726
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:30.726 --> 00:48:32.719
It's just fabulous,
just wonderful.

00:48:32.719 --> 00:48:34.126
Thank you so much.

00:48:34.126 --> 00:48:36.471
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:37.409 --> 00:48:38.850
So we're at one o'clock.

00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:39.650
I think that's it for you guys.

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:41.120
You have lunch.
you have this hour.

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:44.570
Thank you so, so, so much
for listening and being here.

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:47.160
If you have any questions,
there's books back there.

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:49.200
I'm here, I think, for
a little while longer.

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:49.770
Yes, Alan?

00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:50.320
ALAN: Yes.

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:52.570
GINA BARNETT: Unless they
kick me out of the building.

00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:53.070
Thanks.

00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:54.510
Thank you so much.

00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:58.332
[APPLAUSE]
