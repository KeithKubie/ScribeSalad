00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:02.014
- [Voiceover] We left
off in the last video

00:00:02.014 --> 00:00:04.092
trying to solve for gamma.

00:00:04.092 --> 00:00:06.286
We set up this equation
and then we had the insight

00:00:06.286 --> 00:00:08.922
that look, we could
particular, we could pick

00:00:08.922 --> 00:00:13.125
a particular event that is
connected by light signal,

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:16.317
and in that case x would be equal to c t,

00:00:16.317 --> 00:00:19.807
but also x prime would
be equal to c t prime.

00:00:20.091 --> 00:00:22.749
And if gamma's gonna hold
for any transformations

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:26.116
between events, between x and
x prime and t and t prime,

00:00:26.116 --> 00:00:28.659
it should definitely hold
for this particular event,

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:32.188
and so maybe we can use
this to substitute back in

00:00:32.188 --> 00:00:34.127
and solve for gamma, so
that's exactly what we're

00:00:34.127 --> 00:00:35.126
gonna do right now.

00:00:35.126 --> 00:00:38.510
So for all the xes I'm gonna
substitute it, with the c ts,

00:00:39.167 --> 00:00:43.794
so I'm gonna substitute with
a c t, so x, substitute ct.

00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:46.405
x, I'm gonna substitute c t.

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:48.924
x, substitute c t,

00:00:49.392 --> 00:00:50.785
and that's it.

00:00:50.785 --> 00:00:52.793
And then all the x primes
I'm gonna substitute

00:00:52.793 --> 00:00:56.343
with a c t prime, with a c t prime.

00:00:56.845 --> 00:00:59.542
So x prime, c t prime.

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:03.268
x prime, c t prime.

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.402
And then I have an x prime here,
so it's gonna be c t prime.

00:01:07.852 --> 00:01:10.487
So let's simplify, and
now I'm gonna switch to

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:11.871
a neutral color.

00:01:12.217 --> 00:01:15.096
So I'm gonna now have, I'm now gonna have

00:01:15.096 --> 00:01:18.327
c times t times t times t prime.

00:01:18.893 --> 00:01:22.669
So that's gonna be c
squared, actually let me just

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.693
keep using the t, t primes, t, t primes.

00:01:27.693 --> 00:01:29.527
OK, I'll still do a little
bit of color coding.

00:01:29.527 --> 00:01:34.148
T prime is equal to gamma squared,

00:01:34.148 --> 00:01:39.144
gamma squared times, so
it's gonna be c squared

00:01:39.686 --> 00:01:43.836
c times c is c, let me do
that in the yellow color,

00:01:45.027 --> 00:01:48.434
so c squared, t times t prime,

00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:52.602
so t times

00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:55.710
t prime.

00:01:56.126 --> 00:01:57.904
and then we have plus

00:01:59.423 --> 00:02:04.101
c times v times t times t prime.

00:02:05.054 --> 00:02:09.105
plus c times v,

00:02:09.593 --> 00:02:11.021
I'll just write it this way.

00:02:11.021 --> 00:02:14.004
C times t,

00:02:15.828 --> 00:02:17.104
times v,

00:02:18.823 --> 00:02:20.072
times t prime.

00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:24.774
And then we have minus, minus, let's see,

00:02:24.774 --> 00:02:26.075
we're gonna have a c here.

00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:28.838
So minus c,

00:02:29.923 --> 00:02:33.134
minus c times t

00:02:34.717 --> 00:02:35.363
t

00:02:36.378 --> 00:02:39.473
times v, times t prime

00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:43.211
times v times t prime.

00:02:43.553 --> 00:02:45.860
I wrote this v in blue just
so it matches up with this.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.150
And we see something
interesting is about to happen.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.801
And then finally we have minus v squared.

00:02:51.587 --> 00:02:53.134
Minus v squared,

00:02:53.723 --> 00:02:55.340
times t times t prime.

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.243
Times t times t prime.

00:02:59.052 --> 00:03:01.328
It doesn't look that much
simpler, but we're about

00:03:01.328 --> 00:03:03.305
to simplify it a good bit.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.086
And so we're gonna get
these two middle terms

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:08.274
to cancel out.

00:03:08.653 --> 00:03:13.301
So plus c t v t prime,
minus c t v t prime.

00:03:13.924 --> 00:03:16.525
So those are going to cancel out.

00:03:16.525 --> 00:03:19.497
And then every other term has a

00:03:19.497 --> 00:03:20.658
t, t prime in it.

00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:23.808
So let's divide both sides of
this equation by t t prime.

00:03:24.513 --> 00:03:26.353
And so we're gonna get, if
we divide the left-hand side

00:03:26.353 --> 00:03:29.076
by t t prime, we're just
gonna be left with c squared,

00:03:29.453 --> 00:03:32.524
and then we're just gonna
divide everything by t t prime,

00:03:32.524 --> 00:03:35.728
and there our whole thing
has simplified quite nicely.

00:03:35.728 --> 00:03:38.770
Our equation is now, I'll
continue it over here.

00:03:39.617 --> 00:03:43.437
Our equation now is, c squared is

00:03:43.925 --> 00:03:48.925
equal to gamma squared,
is equal to gamma squared,

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.808
times c squared,

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.242
times c squared minus v squared.

00:03:58.588 --> 00:03:59.773
Minus v squared.

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:02.037
Minus v squared.

00:04:03.522 --> 00:04:06.123
Close the parentheses.
And now we can divide

00:04:06.123 --> 00:04:08.514
both sides by c squared minus v squared,

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:11.034
and we would get gamma squared,

00:04:11.487 --> 00:04:13.484
and I'm gonna swap the sides, too.

00:04:13.484 --> 00:04:15.574
So gamma squared is equal to

00:04:16.084 --> 00:04:20.102
c squared, c squared over,

00:04:20.624 --> 00:04:22.922
c squared, I'll write
it all in one color now.

00:04:22.922 --> 00:04:25.140
c squared minus v squared.

00:04:25.657 --> 00:04:27.775
Now if we like we can divide the numerator

00:04:27.775 --> 00:04:29.552
and the denominator by
c squared, in which case

00:04:29.552 --> 00:04:32.037
this will be equal to one over

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.428
c squared divided by c squared is one,

00:04:34.428 --> 00:04:37.807
and then, v squared divided by c squared,

00:04:38.317 --> 00:04:39.757
and we are in the home stretch now,

00:04:39.757 --> 00:04:42.416
we can just take the
square root of both sides,

00:04:42.416 --> 00:04:45.016
and we get, we deserve a
little bit of a drum roll.

00:04:45.016 --> 00:04:46.491
Actually let me continue it up here where

00:04:46.491 --> 00:04:48.174
I have some real estate.

00:04:48.174 --> 00:04:51.576
We get gamma is equal to
the square root of this,

00:04:51.576 --> 00:04:53.921
well the square root of one is just one,

00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:56.127
over the square root of the denominator.

00:04:56.127 --> 00:05:00.737
square root of one minus v squared

00:05:00.737 --> 00:05:02.385
over c squared.

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:03.987
So hopefully you found that as satisfying

00:05:03.987 --> 00:05:07.853
as I did, because all we
did, we just thought about

00:05:07.853 --> 00:05:11.417
the symmetry of x prime is
gonna be some scaling factor

00:05:11.417 --> 00:05:13.716
times the traditional
Galilean transformation,

00:05:13.716 --> 00:05:16.224
and x is going to be
some scaling factor times

00:05:16.224 --> 00:05:18.650
the traditional Galilean
transformation from

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.090
the prime coordinates.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.760
We use that and it's important that we use

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.328
one of the fundamental assumptions of

00:05:24.328 --> 00:05:26.325
special relativity,
that the speed of light

00:05:26.325 --> 00:05:28.821
is absolute in either frame of reference,

00:05:28.821 --> 00:05:32.849
that x divided by t is c, that
x prime divided by t prime

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:35.554
is going to be equal to c,

00:05:35.554 --> 00:05:38.016
for some event that's associated with a,

00:05:38.016 --> 00:05:39.235
a light beam.

00:05:39.595 --> 00:05:41.417
We use that to substitute back in,

00:05:41.417 --> 00:05:43.972
and we were able to solve for gamma.

00:05:44.355 --> 00:05:45.934
So this looks pretty neat.

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:47.609
And so some of y'all might be saying,

00:05:47.609 --> 00:05:49.404
well what about, what about,

00:05:49.404 --> 00:05:52.052
so we've been able to do the derivation

00:05:52.052 --> 00:05:54.119
for the x coordinates,

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:56.174
but what about the, the
Lorentz transformation

00:05:56.174 --> 00:05:59.552
for the t and t prime coordinates?

00:05:59.552 --> 00:06:01.886
And I'll let you think
about how we do that.

00:06:01.886 --> 00:06:03.813
And I'll give you a clue,
it's just going to be

00:06:03.813 --> 00:06:05.241
a little bit more algebra,
and we're going to do that

00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:06.446
in the next video.
