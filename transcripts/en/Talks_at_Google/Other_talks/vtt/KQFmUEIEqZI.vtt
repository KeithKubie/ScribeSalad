[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:09.410
MARY GROVE: Hi, everyone.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.550
How are you today?

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.630
Doing well?

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.090
So my name is Mary
Grove, and I'm

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.950
the director of Google
for Entrepreneurs,

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.867
and it's my pleasure to
welcome you to today's talk.

00:00:18.867 --> 00:00:21.200
Before we get started, just
a quick administrative note.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.908
We are live streaming
and recording this,

00:00:22.908 --> 00:00:25.375
so if I could ask you to
please silence your phones

00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:28.090
and computers, so the pings
don't get captured as well,

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.060
that would be great.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.830
So it's my pleasure to introduce
two of the amazing leaders

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.160
in our industry who really need
no introduction, David Cohen

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.860
and Brad Feld of Techstars.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.290
Techstars has been one of
Google Entrepreneurs' strongest

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.900
partners for several
years now, and we

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.610
are huge fans and
appreciative of all

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.060
they've done to develop
startup ecosystems worldwide.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.340
Just a bit of
background on David.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.850
David is the co-founder
and co-CEO of Techstars.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.880
He is a serial entrepreneur
with two successful exits.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.980
He founded Pinpoint
Technologies, acquired

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.629
by ZOLL Medical Corporation, and
Earfeeder.com, a music service

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.850
that sold to SonicSwap.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.570
David is also an active startup
advocate, advisor, author,

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.566
board member.

00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:12.940
You can read many
of his thoughts

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.960
on these topics at
davidgcohen.com.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.470
He and Brad also coauthored "Do
More Faster: Techstars Lessons

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.780
to Accelerate Your Startup."

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.620
A bit of background on Brad.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.290
Brad is the co-founder of
Techstars, an early stage

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.590
investor and entrepreneur
himself since 1987.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.450
Prior to co-founding
the Foundry Group,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.495
he co-founded Mobius Venture
Capital and Intensity Ventures.

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:38.780
Brad is active on
several boards.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.550
He is the chair of the
National Center for Women

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.580
and Information
Technology, and he's

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.150
on the boards of Path Forward,
The Kauffman Fellows, and Defy

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.260
Ventures.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.960
Brad is also a prolific
speaker and writer.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.510
He's written a number of
books as part of the Startup

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.070
Revolution Series.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.390
You can check out his thoughts
and more at the blogs Feld

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.027
Thoughts and Venture Deals.

00:02:00.027 --> 00:02:01.610
So without further
ado, please join me

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.260
in welcoming David
Cohen and Brad Feld.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:09.354 --> 00:02:10.729
DAVID COHEN: Thank
you very much.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.580
MARY GROVE: Lots of familiar
faces in the room for you guys.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.288
DAVID COHEN: Yes.

00:02:18.288 --> 00:02:19.950
MARY GROVE: Welcome
back to Google.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.658
BRAD FELD: It feels
warm and comfortable.

00:02:21.658 --> 00:02:23.310
MARY GROVE: [LAUGHS] Absolutely.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.800
So lots of topics I'd love
to cover today and also

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.910
take questions from
our audience as well.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.820
So let's start just with
a bit of background.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.860
I'd love to hear a
bit about the founding

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.240
story behind Techstars.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.160
What was your mission
when you started,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.500
and how has that evolved?

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.977
DAVID COHEN: Sure.

00:02:38.977 --> 00:02:40.560
The whole thing has
been an evolution.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.300
But the founding story
that's kind of fun

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.416
is I had never met Brad
before at that time,

00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:47.790
but I was reading his blog,
like I'm sure a lot of people

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.070
do still, because it's
an amazing resource.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.880
Had this idea around
Techstars being

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.611
this mentorship-driven
accelerator process,

00:02:57.611 --> 00:02:59.610
but really didn't have
much beyond that in terms

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.740
of the network around it.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.250
So I went to get a meeting with
you, and your assistant said,

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.000
no problem.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.130
Brad does these
random days that he'll

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.400
meet with literally anybody.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.733
So I guess I qualified for that.

00:03:10.733 --> 00:03:12.330
MARY GROVE: Great, great.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.390
DAVID COHEN: And it took
me just a short four months

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.980
to get the meeting.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.256
The assistant picked a time.

00:03:18.256 --> 00:03:19.380
It was a 15-minute meeting.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.588
I remember, because you were
doing them back to back,

00:03:21.588 --> 00:03:22.770
all day long.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.470
And I walked into that meeting
and slid a piece of paper

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.690
across the table,
folded in half,

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.580
and it was basically
the idea for Techstars.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.370
And I said, I'd love to have
you involved in some way.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.700
And 10 minutes into the
meeting, we were done

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.650
because Brad had said, I'm in.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.330
I love the idea, as long as
you're not a crook or a flake,

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.530
because we had just met.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.817
So I'm not sure where you
are on those topics today--

00:03:45.817 --> 00:03:46.900
BRAD FELD: Still learning.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.114
DAVID COHEN: Still learning.

00:03:48.114 --> 00:03:49.405
MARY GROVE: What year was this?

00:03:49.405 --> 00:03:50.334
DAVID COHEN: Oh, jeez.

00:03:50.334 --> 00:03:51.000
BRAD FELD: 2006.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.620
DAVID COHEN: Yeah, '06, I think.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.180
And from there, Brad helped
connect a lot of the mentors

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.009
into that first program
that would later

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:00.300
become known as an accelerator.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.674
That word didn't
exist back then,

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:04.860
and we apologize for
creating a word that

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.570
got used and overused.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.784
And of course, from
there, that network built.

00:04:08.784 --> 00:04:10.200
We built the
accelerator programs,

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.862
and it's really grown
from there over 10 years.

00:04:12.862 --> 00:04:15.320
MARY GROVE: I'm interested in
the evolution of accelerators

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.990
generally.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.680
And we saw this
big proliferation

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.790
five or six years ago.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.180
We saw a lot of the
business models sort of fail

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.140
around that.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.930
What's your current
thought on landscape?

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.050
What models are working?

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.520
What have you found
that works well

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.920
in terms of running, scaling,
growing accelerators?

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.690
BRAD FELD: I would
have a prelude to that

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.470
and then let you talk
about current reality.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.610
The evolution of Techstars from
where we were in 2007 to where

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.300
we are in 2018 is
important because its

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.851
like the evolution of many
really successful startups,

00:04:49.851 --> 00:04:50.350
right?

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.990
You created it with a premise.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.390
I would suggest that most
startups have no idea

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.900
whether the premise is
valid or not, regardless

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.400
of the enthusiasm
of the founders,

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.650
including us at the time.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.127
We also had our view
of a downside case,

00:05:08.127 --> 00:05:10.460
where the downside case was
we'd lose our all our money,

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.140
but we'd make some friends.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.150
So our worst case in
running that first program

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.270
in Boulder in 2007 was that
we'd make some new friends

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.300
with entrepreneurs.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.550
The 2007 program
was very successful,

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.640
and we decided to do exactly
the same thing in 2008.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.230
So rather than go on a journey
to start to expand or turn it

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.229
into something different,
we're like, yeah,

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:33.520
we did a bunch of things right.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.250
We did a bunch of things wrong.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.500
We can improve a lot of stuff.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.450
Let's do this experiment again.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.490
And we didn't really start
expanding Techstars until 2009,

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.011
when we got pulled by some
entrepreneurs to Boston.

00:05:47.011 --> 00:05:48.760
And that was when we
did a second program.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.600
So all of a sudden,
we've got a program

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.500
in Boulder, a program in Boston.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.100
We then got pulled to Seattle,
so we had a third program.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.126
We then got pulled to New York,
so we had a fourth program.

00:05:58.126 --> 00:05:59.250
Language is important here.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.370
I used the word
pull deliberately,

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.590
because we were having,
essentially, other people who

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.500
we wanted to participate
with pull us to do it,

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.260
versus us say, we're going
to expand into these vectors.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.220
The same phenomenon
happened with

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.490
our first corporate partners.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.990
We had never really thought
hard about corporate accelerator

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.000
or the dynamic of what those
relationships might look like.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.740
And the very first one was
somebody who came to us

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.490
and said, we want to
do what you're doing,

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.830
but with our ecosystem.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.740
Programs like Startup
Weekend, which--

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:34.990
MARY GROVE: That's how we met.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.170
BRAD FELD: That's how we met,
and Google for Entrepreneurs

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.990
has been an incredible supporter
of it for a very long time.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.760
Similar kind of
phenomenon, right?

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.660
It was something that the very
first program happened in 2007

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.160
in Boulder during
that first Boulder

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.840
program, because a
couple of people said,

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:50.650
eh, let's try this.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:51.370
Let's see if it works.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.120
I have no idea if it's
interesting or not,

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.040
but what the hell.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.490
My role in that first one was
that I provided the funding

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.709
for the food.

00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:01.000
MARY GROVE: That's very
important to us here at Google.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.200
BRAD FELD: And I should say
I provided half the funding

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.970
for the food, because
my partner, Seth Levine,

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.136
provided the other half of
the funding for the food.

00:07:06.136 --> 00:07:06.976
But we hung out.

00:07:06.976 --> 00:07:09.100
You sort of have this thing
that unfolds over time,

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.110
and it gets pulled in lots
of different directions.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:17.770
And I think that's a key
operating perspective for not

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.130
just Techstars, but for
many of the companies that

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.140
go through Techstars
or many startups,

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.010
is that the ones that are
really successful get pulled.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.260
And as a startup, if
you feel like you're

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.010
pushing into something, looking
harder for the place where

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:33.970
all of a sudden--

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.110
like to say, people won't
let you hold onto it.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.480
They just want to rip
it out of your hands

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.271
because they want it
so badly, whether it's

00:07:39.271 --> 00:07:41.800
a product or a service
or a technology.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.160
And as that phenomenon
starts happening, then

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.930
layering a strategy
of what you're

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.330
doing on top of that is key
because now you have enough

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:54.880
to work with, versus maybe it's
a historical business context.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:55.860
Create your framework.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:56.967
Figure out your strategy.

00:07:56.967 --> 00:07:58.300
What's your product going to be?

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.740
What's the market going to be?

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.450
And you basically
create this hypothesis

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.210
completely in the
absence of any real data.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.250
And so our journey,
really, from the beginning

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.270
to current reality--

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.260
and I'll hand it to you to
talk about current reality

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.500
and what success looks like--
is the dynamics of pull

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.710
versus the dynamics of push.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.460
MARY GROVE: It's an
excellent observation.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.360
And to that point,
David, in terms

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.300
of painting a portrait
of current reality,

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.530
there's so many
components to Techstars,

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.350
from the city programs, to
the corporate accelerators,

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.720
to the community programs,
the venture fund.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.080
Can you just give us the
quick-- paint us the map of who

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:31.959
is Techstars today?

00:08:31.959 --> 00:08:33.125
What's your scale and reach?

00:08:33.125 --> 00:08:36.490
DAVID COHEN: I'll tie it
back to the other topic.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:40.929
So today, we're 10,
11 years in almost.

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:42.590
People know us for
the accelerators.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.350
There's about 40
of those that we

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:47.270
run, so about 400
companies a year

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:54.020
being accepted into those in 11
countries, about 40 locations.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.740
The tens of thousands of
companies that apply there,

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.187
we're picking from that view.

00:08:58.187 --> 00:09:00.520
So a lot of those are coming
through the Startup Weekend

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.450
activity, which now, having
started in Boulder, Colorado

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:07.060
the same summer that
Techstars started,

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.330
has grown to be this
global phenomenon as well.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:15.020
That's in about 1,000 events
a year now in 120 countries,

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.980
so literally all over the world.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.920
And then you also have
the venture capital piece,

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.710
which follows on in
our own companies.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.890
It's capitalist-targeted and
participating in their success

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:27.850
as they grow.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:28.930
So those are the pieces.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:30.790
And when we think
about it, today

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:34.010
is very different from how
we think about it back then.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:37.390
I think if it were an
accelerator in Boulder,

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.490
Colorado, it wouldn't be
a very exciting business.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.850
But what it is as a product
today is really a network.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.890
And the way we
describe it is it's

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:47.694
the worldwide network that
helps entrepreneurs succeed.

00:09:47.694 --> 00:09:49.360
And to do that, we
have to be everywhere

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.450
that entrepreneurs are and
want to succeed and build

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:54.970
products along their
journey of entrepreneurship,

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:56.950
from the moment
they are inspired,

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.410
all the way through IPO.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.840
And so today, a lot
of scope and scale.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.140
Back then, I think like
so many accelerators today

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:09.280
on the market, thinking about
it as a thing and a place

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.940
that does 10 companies a year
or whatever, it turns out

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.020
wasn't really a business.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.850
The real business is all
of that put together.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:20.290
We've seen tremendous growth
in the corporate vector

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:22.210
that Brad was describing.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:26.202
We're running accelerators now
for lots of major corporations

00:10:26.202 --> 00:10:28.660
and really getting to work with
some amazing entrepreneurs,

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.120
to the point where
today, when you think

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.440
about the scale of it, about
1 in 20 of the series A's that

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.420
happen in the US, the $5
million and up type financing,

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.230
start with us as
the first investor.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:42.010
So it really is--

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:42.605
MARY GROVE: That's
pretty remarkable.

00:10:42.605 --> 00:10:44.063
DAVID COHEN: It
really is something

00:10:44.063 --> 00:10:46.720
that now has impact across
the entrepreneurial ecosystem.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.940
BRAD FELD: I'd add a
couple of things into that.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.520
Key on the word network
that David used.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.070
And one of the operating
principles from the beginning

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:57.670
was this idea of a network
model versus any sort

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.460
of hierarchical model.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:03.580
A book that I wrote in 2012,
called "Startup Communities,"

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:07.600
talked about this notion of
how startup communities evolve

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.130
as networks versus hierarchies.

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:10.540
You can't organize them.

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.620
There isn't a CEO of
a startup community.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.200
And for Techstars,
we tried to build

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.200
this very, very broad network.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.900
As part of that
phenomenon, we've

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.580
scaled horizontally
instead of vertically,

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.180
which is something that should
be near and dear to Google,

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.370
because I think
Google is probably

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.309
maybe one of the first companies
to really start to scale

00:11:30.309 --> 00:11:32.350
horizontally, in terms of
technical architecture,

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:33.844
in a significant way.

00:11:33.844 --> 00:11:35.260
And if you think
about it, instead

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.200
of having 10 companies go
through the Boulder program

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.310
in 2007 and 50 companies go
through the Boulder program

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:46.450
in 2018, we have 10 companies
go through the Boulder program.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:47.980
And that horizontal
scaling, where

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.742
each program has 10
companies, but now we

00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:51.700
have 40 companies happening
all over the world,

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.790
generates 400 companies a year
that, effectively, Techstars

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:58.010
is investing in through
the accelerator program.

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:00.550
It allows that network
to grow worldwide,

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.140
and it's built on
a principle, which

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.690
I know that Mary shares
from all the stuff

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.540
we've done in the past, which
is that entrepreneurship can

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.060
and should exist everywhere,
and that you can build

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.490
vibrant startup communities
and significant companies

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:14.030
all over the world.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.460
And I think that's
been something

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.840
we've included in our thinking
from the very beginning.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:24.790
In 2007, the idea of starting
a company in Boulder, Colorado,

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.650
not that insane, but nobody
would look at Boulder and say

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:30.850
Boulder is this incredible
place to start companies.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.350
MARY GROVE: People are certainly
headed your way these days.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:37.070
BRAD FELD: Well, and today,
Boulder, as a data point,

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:41.090
if you look at what I think is
a really interesting number,

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.220
which is not the amount
of dollars invested

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.800
in the geography or the
amount of companies created

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.520
in the geography, but if you
think about entrepreneurship

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.700
and entrepreneurship over
a long period of time,

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.640
it's the number of companies
per capita in a geography.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.270
And if you actually look at the
number of companies per capita

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.990
in different cities
around the world,

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.680
Boulder's at the
top of that list.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.090
Not number two,
not number three,

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:06.215
but at the top of the list.

00:13:06.215 --> 00:13:09.690
It's a relatively small place
with this incredible density.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.280
But it's not only that.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.050
Go back to this network model.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:16.200
Google has now a very
big presence in Boulder.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.217
Just finished a
campus there that

00:13:18.217 --> 00:13:19.800
can house a couple
of thousand people.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.920
I think it's 1,200 people
or so going to 3,000.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.630
And that came from
the acquisition

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:29.160
of a 40-person company
in 2004 called @Last

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.570
that was based in Boulder.

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:31.850
DAVID COHEN: You may
know it as SketchUp.

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:33.030
BRAD FELD: SketchUp, right.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:37.410
And so the expansion of
that and the integration--

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.830
by the way, Google in Boulder
is an extraordinary corporate

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.000
citizen.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.872
Scott Green, we have the
local people of the year,

00:13:45.872 --> 00:13:47.580
entrepreneur of the
year, business person

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.330
of the year award.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:52.800
He got one of the couple
of awards yesterday.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.210
And Scott's a good example
of that network model

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:59.280
and continuing to
engage, not just

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.620
in the context of whatever
I'm going to do here

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:05.160
is for me as a Google employee,
but I'm part of this geography,

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.370
and so I want to make sure
that the activity and vector

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.680
and interaction around
technology, entrepreneurship,

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.944
innovation is something
that's broadly distributed.

00:14:12.944 --> 00:14:15.360
I think that's been an operating
principle of this as well

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.170
for us.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:16.880
MARY GROVE: Let
me build on that.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.255
You talked about the density.

00:14:18.255 --> 00:14:20.720
You talked about
the talent pool.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.867
Boulder's a great example.

00:14:21.867 --> 00:14:24.450
So let's zoom out a little bit
and talk about your perspective

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:25.500
at the ecosystem level.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.225
And you have been really
investing globally

00:14:28.225 --> 00:14:29.100
in these communities.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.650
Can I ask, what are some
of the key ingredients,

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:33.360
aside from talent
and density, that you

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.790
think are required for
startup communities

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:38.340
to really thrive and take off?

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:42.870
BRAD FELD: So I have a very,
very simple starting point

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.586
from the book that
I wrote in 2012.

00:14:45.586 --> 00:14:48.210
I'm in the process of writing a
sequel to it that will come out

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:51.292
later this year around the
notion of how to create

00:14:51.292 --> 00:14:52.500
a startup community anywhere.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.520
And it's been very interesting.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.978
A lot of what I've learned over
the last six or seven years

00:14:55.978 --> 00:14:58.680
has also come from the work with
Startup Weekend and UP Global

00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.888
and Google for Entrepreneurs.

00:14:59.888 --> 00:15:02.510
So there's a lot of
reflective learning.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:05.410
The core principles
are really easy.

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:07.570
And they're a little
bit counter-intuitive

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:08.650
to conventional wisdom.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:10.600
Conventional wisdom
was that you had

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:14.020
to have a really strong research
university at the center of it,

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.630
or else nothing would happen.

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:18.130
Another piece of
conventional wisdom

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:21.250
was that it had to
be in a place where

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.310
there was a lot of
top-down economic activity

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:25.550
and influence.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:29.000
And it turns out, neither of
those two things are true.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.710
The key principles are first
that the leaders of the startup

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:34.830
community have to
be entrepreneurs.

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:37.390
So you have to have this
motive force of entrepreneurs

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:39.700
who are continually
investing and building

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.350
in their startup community.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:45.070
Not government, not
university, not big companies,

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.260
not nonprofits that are
organized around it.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.212
Those are all support functions.

00:15:49.212 --> 00:15:50.920
I called them feeders
in that book, which

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.480
is a word I probably
wouldn't use again,

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.700
because it was too pejorative
relative to how people

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:55.379
interpreted it.

00:15:55.379 --> 00:15:56.920
But this idea that
they're different.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.930
They play different
roles in this.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.750
If you don't have entrepreneurs
who are playing that leadership

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:05.560
role, the startup community
won't grow and make progress.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.580
The second is that you have
to have a very long-term view,

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.444
at least 20 years.

00:16:10.444 --> 00:16:12.110
And when people talk
about, for example,

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.290
Silicon Valley and the
Bay Area, the Bay Area

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:17.920
is 110 or 120 years into
its entrepreneurial journey.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.354
You really have to have
this very long-term view

00:16:20.354 --> 00:16:21.520
of what you're trying to do.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.010
And so many
organizations, again,

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:26.380
university, government,
even big companies,

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.171
run on rhythms that
are short-term.

00:16:28.171 --> 00:16:28.670
Right?

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:30.164
Quarterly, annually.

00:16:30.164 --> 00:16:31.830
How much progress did
we make this year?

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:33.370
What are the metrics that
show that our startup

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:34.120
community grew?

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.220
It doesn't matter.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.320
Play a much longer game.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.780
The third is that you have
to be inclusive of anyone who

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.640
wants to engage at any level.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.760
And the notion of
inclusion and diversity

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.780
and inclusion in the
last, say, 24 months,

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.660
has started to become
something that is

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.920
a front-of-mind conversation.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.370
But this idea that anyone,
regardless of gender,

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:01.090
race, socioeconomic background,
educational background,

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:05.650
experience, can be and should
be able to engage in the startup

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:06.920
community is key.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.500
And in fact, the
more diversity you

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.900
have going on in that
mix, the more vibrant

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.054
that startup community is.

00:17:13.054 --> 00:17:14.470
And then the last
is that you have

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:17.589
to have this supersaturation
of activities and events

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:19.569
going on all the time
that engage people

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:22.780
around entrepreneurship,
not just entrepreneurs.

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.490
So it's, again, this
notion of inclusion

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:26.290
around the system
of anyone who has

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:29.710
any interest in
entrepreneurship and innovation.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:34.120
The interesting challenge here,
which is really important,

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:38.655
is that as entrepreneurial
activity increases,

00:17:38.655 --> 00:17:40.780
and as the startup communities
become more vibrant,

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.350
often the signal-to-noise ratio
gets really out of whack--

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:46.390
a lot of noise,
not enough signal.

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:50.267
And you see this especially
in places like the Bay Area,

00:17:50.267 --> 00:17:52.600
where there's just an enormous
amount of stuff going on.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.460
You can't figure out
where you should engage,

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.960
or you can engage in
everything and then

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.760
never get anything done, because
you're spending all your time

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.801
running around doing stuff
that has nothing to do

00:17:59.801 --> 00:18:01.300
with making forward progress.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.360
And so in the context
of the startup community

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.550
and the maturation
of them, making sure

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:09.640
that the signal stays
high and making sure

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.560
that the leaders
are not necessarily

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.915
curating what happens,
but that everybody

00:18:13.915 --> 00:18:15.790
can do what they want,
but that there's still

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:19.526
an engagement model that's such,
including by the people who

00:18:19.526 --> 00:18:21.400
have been engaged and
involved in the startup

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.214
community for a
long period of time.

00:18:23.214 --> 00:18:24.380
MARY GROVE: Thank you, Brad.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.930
And we can't wait to read more
about that in your next book,

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:28.550
which comes out when this year?

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:29.530
BRAD FELD: Later.

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:30.410
MARY GROVE: Later this year.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:30.950
You heard it here first.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:32.400
DAVID COHEN: Once you write it.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.987
BRAD FELD: Later this year.

00:18:33.987 --> 00:18:36.570
MARY GROVE: So David, building
upon that, Brad touched briefly

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:40.790
upon diversity inclusion and
its importance to Techstars.

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:42.920
And today is, of course,
International Women's Day.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.650
Thanks for spending it with us.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:47.180
Can you talk to us a little
bit, David, about the culture

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.780
of Techstars and how you are
addressing building inclusion

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.370
within your team, part one.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:54.140
And part two, how
do you advise--

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.430
you're working with
entrepreneurs who are building

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:56.870
companies from the ground up.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.730
How do you advise them to think
about layering this mentality

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:00.639
in from the get-go?

00:19:00.639 --> 00:19:02.180
DAVID COHEN: That's
funny, because we

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.890
didn't think enough
about it, I think,

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.950
in the beginning of Techstars.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:06.950
There are four founders.

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:08.880
They all happen to be men.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.539
And I think thinking
about it early is

00:19:11.539 --> 00:19:12.830
that the first piece of advice.

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.830
So we've been building
a lot of content

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.990
and a lot of
process and programs

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:22.730
to help startups who are at day
one to think about this stuff.

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:25.220
Because in the end, it's
not only the right thing

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.840
to be thinking about
and do, but it's

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.400
going to make the
companies better,

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.830
which is going to make
us better as investors

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:32.300
in those companies,

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:37.550
So over the years, we've
certainly worked on ourselves,

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:40.280
so that when we work
on our portfolio,

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.200
it sort of hits home with them.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.810
I think four years
ago now, something

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:47.120
like that, we launched
something called the Techstars

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.500
Foundation, which Google's
been a huge supporter of.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:55.970
And that is focused on
diversity inclusion in tech.

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:58.130
And so we've been
experimenting with what's

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:59.120
the right model there.

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.280
We think one of the
things we're good at

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.540
is identifying scalable
organizations, startups,

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.940
that can go and have impact.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.230
If we can do that by
finding organizations

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:14.037
early on that are going to
have this impact long term,

00:20:14.037 --> 00:20:16.370
then we can support them, and
that's useful and helpful.

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:19.820
So we funded that with a
bunch of our own money.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.470
Our companies have funded it.

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:24.900
We've had incredible
support from partners.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.380
And today, it's a
reasonable-sized foundation

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:31.030
that has made on the
order of 10 or so grants,

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:36.920
but also has its own programs
to try to help have an impact.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.767
Very early one of those
was Defy Ventures,

00:20:39.767 --> 00:20:42.350
which is now something that the
whole venture community really

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:44.320
understands and talks about.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.100
But back then, we were a
very early supporter of it.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.370
So I think we can play
that role in helping

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:52.190
identifying something
that can have an impact.

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:55.100
What Defy does, Brad's
now super involved,

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.080
so maybe you can do their
commercial, if you'd like.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.020
MARY GROVE: It's an
amazing organization.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.372
DAVID COHEN: It's a lot of fun.

00:21:01.372 --> 00:21:02.330
BRAD FELD: So happy to.

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:05.570
And then I'll make another
comment specifically

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:08.360
on the gender diversity dynamic.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.570
That's something that
I've learned from my time

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:15.710
at NC WIT, which Google also has
been the long-term support on.

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:20.030
Defy provides
entrepreneur programs

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.800
for people who are incarcerated.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.156
And a bunch of Google folks
have gone to Defy programs now.

00:21:25.156 --> 00:21:26.030
A couple of hundred--

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:27.400
200, 300?

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.580
And so it's become--

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.350
Rick and I have been
friends for a long time.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:32.645
And I think the first program--

00:21:32.645 --> 00:21:35.270
you went to the one in Lancaster
that I went to the first time,

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.430
right?

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.430
So we both went for the first
time to the same program.

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:38.070
And what you do--

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.010
DAVID COHEN: So you've
been in prison together.

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:40.718
BRAD FELD: We've been
in prison together.

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:45.080
The program is
called Training EITs,

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.820
or Entrepreneurs In Training.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:50.540
So the people who
are incarcerated

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:54.440
go through a six-month
process that's in the prison.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.080
It's an educational program.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:00.207
In California, there's quite
a wide number of programs.

00:22:00.207 --> 00:22:01.790
There's a couple of
other states where

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:02.780
it's pretty prevalent now.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.520
Colorado and Nebraska
are two of the ones

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.800
that are growing very quickly.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.590
That six-month
program has a bunch

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:11.870
of interim mentoring periods.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.690
They're sort of business
mentoring activity.

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:17.660
The curriculum is called
Become CEO of Your Life,

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.210
and the idea is around the
notion of second chances.

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:21.710
So there's a book
that just came out

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:23.240
last week called
"Second Chances"

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.550
by Cat Hoke, who's
the CEO of Defy.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.890
And it's Cat's story,
but Cat's story

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:29.889
against the backdrop of
her own second chance

00:22:29.889 --> 00:22:32.180
and against the backdrop of
giving people who have been

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.880
incarcerated second chances.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:38.370
The culmination is graduation
day, which is a full day.

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:39.500
It was 12 hours for us.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.980
We spent it at a prison,
the first one in Lancaster.

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:46.530
That was a level 4 maximum
security prison with 50 EITs.

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:49.190
There were about 75 volunteers.

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:51.440
And it's a combination
of a pitch competition,

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:55.490
a graduation, and then a bunch
of socialization exercises.

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:59.310
And for those of us who
were the volunteers,

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:02.420
you do a day like that in
any sort of new context,

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:04.939
and maybe you'll have one
insight or two insights,

00:23:04.939 --> 00:23:06.980
and you'll get those
insights over and over again

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:08.760
throughout the
course of the day.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.300
So you're like, wow, I never
thought of the world that way

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.730
before, but then
that gets repeated.

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:16.490
My experience, the first time
I did this program with Defy

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:19.100
was I had 20
different epiphanies

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.990
over the course of the day.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.500
They just come at you from all
kinds of different directions

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.910
and all kinds of
different contexts.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.590
And it's a reflective
phenomenon.

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:30.810
So the EITs are having
the same experience

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:34.120
that you're having in terms of
multiple epiphanies from them

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.470
and how you engage.

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:37.930
Here's a great example
from a program we just

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:40.789
did in Colorado, where
our governor, Governor

00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:41.830
Hickenlooper, came to it.

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.332
And there's an exercise
called Walk the Line, where

00:23:44.332 --> 00:23:45.790
you get a bunch of
questions asked,

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:47.664
and if the answer is
yes, you go to the line.

00:23:47.664 --> 00:23:50.260
If the answer is no, you
walk back from the line.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.180
And the questions
become pretty intense.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:55.690
But one of them was, have
you ever been in jail?

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:59.000
And our governor
walks up to the line.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.640
And of course, all the
EITs are on the line.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.150
And they're looking at each
other like, our governor?

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:05.601
And he admitted it?

00:24:05.601 --> 00:24:06.100
Right?

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:07.120
MARY GROVE: What
was his story there?

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:07.619
Was he--

00:24:07.619 --> 00:24:10.060
BRAD FELD: You don't
ask the story, right?

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.600
By the way, his team, of which
it was a half dozen people,

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.850
they were like, what the fuck?

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:16.460
Our governor just
walked to the line.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.525
But you have that moment
over and over again.

00:24:18.525 --> 00:24:20.180
So it's extraordinarily
powerful.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.090
And if you have
any interest in it,

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:25.060
Defy Ventures is the
name of the organization.

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.406
And I'm Brad@Feld.com, so
you can send me a note,

00:24:27.406 --> 00:24:28.780
and I'll get you
plugged into it.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.050
DAVID COHEN: It's
creating entrepreneurs

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:30.966
where there were none.

00:24:30.966 --> 00:24:32.967
And the impact of it is--

00:24:32.967 --> 00:24:34.175
I don't remember the numbers.

00:24:34.175 --> 00:24:34.690
You may know them.

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:36.310
But recidivism,
meaning you're going

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:38.320
to go back to jail
once you're released,

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.696
that rate is very
high, normally.

00:24:39.696 --> 00:24:42.361
MARY GROVE: I think it's like 3%
or 4% after the program, right?

00:24:42.361 --> 00:24:45.020
DAVID COHEN: Now, after Defy,
those people, it's like 3%.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:45.850
BRAD FELD: Yeah.

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:49.270
70% in-- I think it's
in California, maybe

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:53.440
US, 70% recidivism within
five years for people

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.589
who have had violent crimes.

00:24:55.589 --> 00:24:57.880
It's under 5% if they've gone
through the Defy program.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.635
And it's enough numbers
now where that's actually

00:24:59.635 --> 00:25:00.470
a relative statistic.

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:02.053
DAVID COHEN: You try
to support things

00:25:02.053 --> 00:25:04.660
like that are going to have
this long-term scalable impact.

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.820
BRAD FELD: Really
change how things work.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:10.960
And, by the way, doing a
pitch competition with--

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:14.327
the prisons I've been in have
been all men-- with these guys,

00:25:14.327 --> 00:25:15.410
is absolutely fascinating.

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:17.620
Because you see these
guys who are totally

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:21.160
comfortable in certain contexts
just completely terrified,

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.140
nervous, uncomfortable
and having

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.517
to work through that and
just their own self-esteem

00:25:25.517 --> 00:25:27.850
that they're working through
that in a different context

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:29.502
than wherever they land.

00:25:29.502 --> 00:25:31.210
The other one I just
wanted to do quickly

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:33.860
was National Center for Women
and Information Technology,

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:38.315
especially in the context of
International Women's Day.

00:25:38.315 --> 00:25:39.940
I've been involved
in that organization

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.680
for over a decade, chair
for a number of years.

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.890
It's about a $10 million a
year nonprofit, based also

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:47.991
in Boulder, but worldwide.

00:25:47.991 --> 00:25:49.990
And its goal is to help
more girls and women get

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:51.198
involved in computer science.

00:25:51.198 --> 00:25:54.820
It started in the mid-2000s,
so before people were really

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:55.700
focusing on that.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:59.030
It's an organization
that's been very inclusive.

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.870
So instead of it trying to
control the programs, much

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:05.350
of the money that we raise,
we give to other organizations

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:08.950
to fund and help support
programs they're doing.

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:11.440
As part of that, I learned
a very powerful thing

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.230
that is said some,
but I don't think

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:16.450
it's being said
enough right now,

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:19.330
around the dynamics
of roles men can

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:22.040
play in the context
of gender diversity.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.460
And it's especially
true, when you

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:27.830
have to claim your own identity
as a 50-year-old white guy,

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:30.470
I mean, that's what I am, and
that's what I'm going to be.

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:31.447
DAVID COHEN: 50?

00:26:31.447 --> 00:26:32.030
BRAD FELD: 52.

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:32.805
DAVID COHEN: Oh.

00:26:32.805 --> 00:26:34.270
You're trying to take
a couple of years off.

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:34.780
MARY GROVE: Ouch, ouch.

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:35.800
DAVID COHEN: I just
want to call it out.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:36.508
BRAD FELD: 50ish.

00:26:36.508 --> 00:26:37.780
MARY GROVE: Who's counting?

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.640
DAVID COHEN: I'm barely in
my 40s, so I just wanted to--

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.411
BRAD FELD: The phrase we started
using a long time ago at NC WIT

00:26:43.411 --> 00:26:43.910
through--

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:45.175
NC WIT's a research-based
organization,

00:26:45.175 --> 00:26:47.091
so they've done a ton
of research around this.

00:26:47.091 --> 00:26:50.380
And if you're interested,
ncwit.org is the website,

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:53.260
and just do a search
for male advocate.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.570
And the phrase today that's
being used is male allies.

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:57.580
I think it's a more accessible
phrase that male advocate.

00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.413
But the phrase we used
for a number of years

00:26:59.413 --> 00:27:00.270
was male advocate.

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:04.390
And this notion of the
mistakes so many men make

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:08.230
around gender diversity is
they try to solve the problem.

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:09.130
Hi, here I am.

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:11.440
I'm now going to
solve this problem.

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.760
And that's completely wrong.

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:17.200
The right approach, from an
advocacy or ally approach

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.850
is hi, here I am.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:21.370
I understand and acknowledge
that there's a problem.

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:23.770
I'm going to participate
in helping find

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:25.850
a solution to this problem.

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:28.910
And this notion of being
an advocate or an ally,

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:31.520
rather than the one who's
trying to control or develop,

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.135
is so incredibly important.

00:27:33.135 --> 00:27:34.760
And I think it's one
of the reasons why

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.910
Me Too hit a tipping point.

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:41.170
Is that Me Too was generated
by women, basically

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:44.750
in Hollywood, that amplified
this phenomenon that

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:45.980
had been going on.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.720
But it was driven
by those women,

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.300
and the men who have
supported it didn't co-opt it,

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:53.204
didn't control it,
didn't try to change it.

00:27:53.204 --> 00:27:55.370
And I would just use that
as a metaphor that I think

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:57.650
is so important around
this idea, for me at least,

00:27:57.650 --> 00:27:58.610
of inclusion.

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:01.940
When you're part of,
essentially, a privileged part

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:06.410
of the cycle is to try to be
an advocate and ally rather

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:08.876
than the controller or solver.

00:28:08.876 --> 00:28:10.250
Which, again, for
a lot of people

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:12.710
in positions of privilege or
positions of power is hard.

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:15.290
That's a difficult frame
of reference to be in,

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:17.377
but it's a really
important starting point.

00:28:17.377 --> 00:28:18.960
MARY GROVE: I
appreciate that so much.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.290
I think it's exactly
the right way

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:23.017
to frame the challenge,
the opportunity.

00:28:23.017 --> 00:28:25.100
And you guys have been at
the forefront of leading

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:25.790
on many parts.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:29.480
And I think on the Techstars
Foundation piece specifically,

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.460
there are no other
organizations I

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.860
can think of who are investing--
it's almost like seed

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:36.470
funding for nonprofits who
are working towards diversity

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:37.280
inclusion in tech.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.685
And so I applaud you and
thank you for those efforts.

00:28:40.685 --> 00:28:43.670
I want to zoom out a bit
and talk about policy.

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:46.580
You're both active in advocating
for entrepreneur-friendly tech

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:47.540
policies.

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:52.615
What's the current climate
around tech policy?

00:28:52.615 --> 00:28:54.740
Anything you're highlighting
for your entrepreneurs

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:57.789
at the moment and how they
can be active advocates?

00:28:57.789 --> 00:29:00.122
DAVID COHEN: We're not being
sued by the government yet,

00:29:00.122 --> 00:29:00.960
so that's good.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.210
BRAD FELD: Speak for yourself.

00:29:04.054 --> 00:29:04.970
No, I'm not right now.

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:12.820
Actually, there's an
emotional reaction

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:14.320
I have to the
question, so I'm going

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:17.670
to have the emotional
reaction first.

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:20.430
Government, especially
federal government,

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:23.480
makes me very tired.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.690
And that's my
emotional reaction.

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:30.040
It makes me very tired not
because I'm cynical, angry,

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.340
unhappy, whatever.

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:34.060
It's just slow.

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:36.880
And that's actually
by design in the US.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.340
Our democracy, one of the
operating principles of it

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.890
is it's hard to change things.

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:45.700
Lots of things change, but it's
hard to change the long arc

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.880
over time, for good or for bad.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.580
Both sides of that.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:54.760
So it is a thing that I've
learned by being involved

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.980
on a couple of vectors.

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.570
For me personally,
the two things

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:03.130
that I've cared the most
about as it applies to tech

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:08.320
are immigration reform
and patent reform.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.510
On the immigration reform
front, personally, I

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:12.460
believe that a
human being should

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.740
be able to start a business
wherever in the world

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:15.707
they want.

00:30:15.707 --> 00:30:17.290
And a human being
should be able to go

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:20.380
anywhere they want in the
world and work for where

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:21.130
they want to work.

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:25.780
That mobility, in the US, the
mobility across state borders

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:29.300
is something that's made our
country incredibly powerful.

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:32.170
The ability to have people
who for many, many years,

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:35.590
everybody wanted to come to
the US to start their business,

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:40.570
and the innovation engine of
the US was so enhanced by that.

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:43.450
The idea that there is
any meaningful friction

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:46.956
for somebody who wants to
come to the US to be able to,

00:30:46.956 --> 00:30:48.580
number one, come to
the US, number two,

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:52.480
start a business in
US, is ludicrous to me.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:57.340
If you wind the clock
back to even 2009, 2010,

00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:00.040
if you're an entrepreneur
in another country,

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.020
and you want to
come to the US, you

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:04.270
have to navigate
this Byzantine system

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:07.722
to get the appropriate
visa to be able to start

00:31:07.722 --> 00:31:08.680
your company in the US.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.060
And there's very
few ways to do that.

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:12.110
It's very difficult.

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:15.070
And so there was a group
of us in 2009 or 2010

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:17.130
that started something
called the Startup Visa

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:21.490
Movement to try to get a visa
that allowed entrepreneurs

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:22.709
to come to the US to do it.

00:31:22.709 --> 00:31:24.250
And one of the things
that stimulated

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:28.090
that for me personally was
two Techstars companies that

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:31.180
had non-US founders
in our second program.

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:35.344
Two of them were from Canada,
a really, really scary country.

00:31:35.344 --> 00:31:36.760
Lots of dangerous
people up there.

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:38.380
DAVID COHEN: I'd build a
wall if I were them, yeah.

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:40.710
BRAD FELD: Yeah, I'd build--
if you were them right?

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:41.860
One direction.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.830
And then the other
founders were from Europe.

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:46.420
The one I remember
was from France.

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:48.340
I think one was from England.

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:52.030
And after Techstars was over,
they wanted to stay in Boulder,

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:53.860
and they couldn't
get visas to stay

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:57.030
and had to go back to Canada and
Europe to run their companies,

00:31:57.030 --> 00:31:59.380
and I thought that was insane.

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:02.050
So I've put a lot of
energy personally,

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:05.590
and I'd say sort of around
the system, within Techstars,

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:09.220
we've gotten reasonably
good at helping founders

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.230
that are non-US founders
be able to figure out

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:12.790
how to stay in the
US after they've

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:14.050
gone through the program.

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:16.756
But we've also expanded
geographically very

00:32:16.756 --> 00:32:18.130
aggressively to
make sure there's

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:21.430
lots of places around the
world where we can engage.

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:23.230
From a policy
perspective, I think

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:28.270
this is the biggest
industry policy

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:32.920
issue that has to do with
long-term US competitiveness.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:36.240
Because I think what's happening
on a very systematic basis,

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.990
you're already seeing
these massive shifts

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:40.660
of movement of capital to
other parts of the world.

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:42.790
And yes, the amount
of capital that's

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:45.280
being deployed against startups
and technology companies

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.710
is growing very
rapidly, but that ratio

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:51.220
is changing equally
rapidly away from the US.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.020
And there are many,
many entrepreneurs

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:56.320
that I know internationally who
don't aspire to come to the US

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.580
to start their
companies anymore.

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:01.100
And I think that's a tough one.

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:05.500
The other one that I care about,
which is patents, I would say,

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:13.300
personally, the patent system
is so tangled up in itself

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:16.060
that it will just sort
of work itself over time.

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.980
There are, then,
second-order issues

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:19.870
which are happening, right?

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:22.570
Google, I know, is in the
midst of all the dynamics

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:26.470
around the election and
news and news curation.

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:30.640
You have this whole phenomenon
around cryptocurrency

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.490
and how to think
about cryptocurrency.

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:37.270
Many of these things are,
from my frame of reference,

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:41.620
around innovation, areas
where entrepreneurs should

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:43.990
be respectful of
the current context

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:45.490
that they're operating in.

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:49.250
Our advice is be
respectful of the context.

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:52.150
But at the same time, don't
be unwilling to challenge

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:54.520
whatever that context is.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.550
I think a mistake that
plays out over and over

00:33:57.550 --> 00:34:01.750
again is entrepreneurs ignore
the context completely, pretend

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:05.020
like the context either
doesn't exist or is irrelevant.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:07.360
And then downstream,
you might end up

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.190
being very successful
as a business,

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:11.469
but you create
enormous an dislocation

00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:13.179
in second-order
effects by not being

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:15.013
respectful of that
context going in.

00:34:15.013 --> 00:34:16.179
MARY GROVE: Thank you, Brad.

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:17.050
Thank you.

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:19.000
I'm avid readers of
both of your blogs.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.760
And, David, an
interesting post you

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.400
made, a comment about
making sure to have

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.449
a pessimist in the room.

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:28.170
Can you tell us a
bit more about that?

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:28.920
DAVID COHEN: Sure.

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:31.026
MARY GROVE: I think I
consider you an optimist.

00:34:31.026 --> 00:34:33.400
DAVID COHEN: You have to be
to be an entrepreneur, right?

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.429
But it's also important
to surround yourself

00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:40.300
with at least one person in a
decision-making context that's

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.820
not necessarily one of these
pessimists that's like,

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:46.150
that'll never work, but
more the, look, I'm really

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.900
worried about this or that.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:50.590
And I think too
many entrepreneurs

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:54.104
surround themselves with people
that are like themselves.

00:34:54.104 --> 00:34:56.020
Not enough diversity in
the room, diversity of

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:59.410
thought, in this case, to
where if you don't have that,

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:01.810
you end up just going
down the wrong path.

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:04.201
And it can be this
asymmetric risk where

00:35:04.201 --> 00:35:05.950
that thing didn't work
out, and it ends up

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:06.930
blowing up everything.

00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:09.340
And the stakes get high
as these companies grow.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.470
And I just had a couple
of recent examples

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:13.860
of witnessing that.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.520
And just a little
reminder, to have

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.940
somebody in the room that's
very smart, very respected,

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:21.640
that isn't necessarily
just an optimist, right?

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.739
That says, well, maybe
this could go wrong,

00:35:23.739 --> 00:35:25.780
and let's at least think
about what could happen.

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:27.729
I've seen it save
companies, so that's

00:35:27.729 --> 00:35:29.020
why I wanted to write about it.

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:29.705
MARY GROVE: That's great.

00:35:29.705 --> 00:35:31.371
BRAD FELD: I'd add
one just quick thing.

00:35:31.371 --> 00:35:35.230
It's important on the
dimension of diversity

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:39.760
that there is a whole
language around culture,

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.370
and you want to add people
to your company that

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:43.720
fit your culture.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.370
And I think that's nonsensical.

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:48.190
If you are simply
adding people that

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:51.610
fit your culture, especially
as a startup, what you're doing

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:53.710
is you're homogenizing
your thinking,

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:57.937
and you're actually going to
sort of recede to the norm

00:35:57.937 --> 00:35:59.020
in terms of your thinking.

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:01.070
You're not going to have people
challenging what's going on.

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:03.220
You might have different
frames of reference

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:04.930
on specific things,
but you're not

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:06.730
going to get a broader view.

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:09.640
The phrase we like to
use is culture add.

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.430
So instead of getting people
into your company that

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:15.100
fit your culture, everybody
that joins your company

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.870
adds to your culture.

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:19.060
And instead of using
the word culture,

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:22.537
I personally like to use
the phrase cultural norms.

00:36:22.537 --> 00:36:24.370
Because there's a
difference between culture

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:25.990
and cultural norms.

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:29.416
And your cultural norms are
your stated value system,

00:36:29.416 --> 00:36:31.540
the way you're going to
behave, that sort of thing.

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:34.060
And so if you're continually
adding to your cultural norms,

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:36.520
that's a pretty
dynamic thing, and that

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:40.420
will cause you to be more
inclusive of other frames

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:42.610
of reference, which
will also include

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:44.440
having people who
will tell you that, I

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.030
don't agree with that idea.

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:49.609
Versus a very consistent,
homogenized group,

00:36:49.609 --> 00:36:52.150
which when you're three or four
people may or may not matter,

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:55.510
but when you're 20 or 30
people, has a big influence

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:57.700
on what goes from
30 people to 100

00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:59.155
people in a successful place.

00:36:59.155 --> 00:37:02.080
DAVID COHEN: And
on cultural add,

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:05.830
I first heard that from
Mitch and Freada Kapor.

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:06.990
Talk about that a lot.

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:08.770
And I think we've really
tried to adopt that and help

00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:10.770
companies try to think
about things that way.

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:13.440
That's just a great way to
think about it differently.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.610
MARY GROVE: It's a great
framework, cultural add.

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:16.360
So in a few minutes, I'm
going to switch over and take

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.832
questions from our audience,
if you want to start thinking

00:37:18.832 --> 00:37:20.040
of those and teeing those up.

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.280
But just a couple of quick
fun ones while I have you.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.738
I want to get some
life hacks here.

00:37:23.738 --> 00:37:27.310
So tell us, when you're
not writing books,

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:30.070
what book are you
reading right now?

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:34.270
BRAD FELD: I am a fairly
promiscuous reader.

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:36.040
I read about 100
books a year, and I

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.690
read lots of different stuff.

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:42.250
My favorite books to
read are science fiction,

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:45.220
so I try to, every three or four
books, read or a random science

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:47.650
fiction book.

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:53.860
In terms of a recent book
that I read that was really

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.710
thought provoking was
a book from an MIT

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:58.660
series of shortish books--

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:01.180
100, 150 page books--

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:03.340
called "Post Truth."

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.500
And it's a series of books
around specific topics,

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.524
so they have a book
on robotics and a book

00:38:07.524 --> 00:38:09.190
on artificial
intelligence that somebody

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:11.320
wrote that's sort of a primer.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.650
And this one was on
this idea of post truth

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:17.620
and how postmodernism
and postmodernist thought

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:19.900
plays into the
way, today, we talk

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.690
about what is truth,
or what is fake news,

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:23.750
or what is not truth.

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:27.529
And that was an interesting one.

00:38:27.529 --> 00:38:29.320
It had a lot of bias
in it too, by the way.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.153
So you had to sort of
read through the bias.

00:38:31.153 --> 00:38:34.546
Although the author exposed
his bias at the beginning.

00:38:34.546 --> 00:38:35.920
So you're like,
this is his bias.

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.420
OK, I got his bias.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:39.450
Oops, I bumped into
his bias again.

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:41.380
That was a good book.

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:45.190
One other book, if you're
interested at all in history

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:48.730
or interested in whatever
is happening currently,

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:51.565
is a book by Will
and Ariel Durant.

00:38:51.565 --> 00:38:52.940
It's about 150 pages.

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:54.910
They're the ones that
wrote the 12-volume,

00:38:54.910 --> 00:39:00.170
10,000-page books about
the history of society.

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:02.010
It's called "Lessons
of History."

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:05.090
And it's basically 10 short
chapters on different topics.

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:10.240
Government, education,
religion, morality.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.030
And they used all
of human history

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:16.980
to show that it's the same
shit over and over again.

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:19.940
And in very, very short,
bite-sized chunks.

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:21.950
And it was actually
very-- for someone

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:28.550
who has regular moments of
anxiety around whatever's

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:32.407
happening, it's very reassuring
to read something like that

00:39:32.407 --> 00:39:34.490
and realize that over the
course of human history,

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:37.310
yes, we've made progress
on a bunch of dimensions,

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:39.264
but yeah, a lot of
the shit's the same.

00:39:39.264 --> 00:39:40.430
MARY GROVE: And we survived.

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:41.360
BRAD FELD: And we survived.

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.460
MARY GROVE: David, three
apps you can't live without.

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:44.240
DAVID COHEN: Oh, I was going
to give you the book one.

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.360
MARY GROVE: Oh, give
me the book one first.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.170
DAVID COHEN: I'll just
give you the titles,

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:47.050
because they're so great.

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:47.770
MARY GROVE: OK.

00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:48.920
DAVID COHEN: So the
one that our whole team

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:51.044
is reading right now, which
we do as a team sport--

00:39:51.044 --> 00:39:53.939
I have no idea how you
read 100 books a year.

00:39:53.939 --> 00:39:54.730
BRAD FELD: No kids.

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:55.150
DAVID COHEN: I guess.

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:55.917
That must be it.

00:39:55.917 --> 00:39:56.750
BRAD FELD: I don't--

00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:57.420
I don't need
electronic [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.910
DAVID COHEN: That's probably it.

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:01.190
Three kids.

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:03.750
"How We Decide," which is
emotional decision making,

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:05.952
which is an older book,
but super impactful

00:40:05.952 --> 00:40:06.910
if you haven't read it.

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:09.050
And then the one that
really changed me recently

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:10.590
is called "The Soul of Money."

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:12.260
It's sort of you
are what you spend

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:15.150
and how you can use
money to have impact,

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:16.790
so really interesting.

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:18.005
Three apps?

00:40:18.005 --> 00:40:19.790
I'll give you one,
and I'll try to think

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:21.081
of others while I give you one.

00:40:21.081 --> 00:40:22.120
BRAD FELD: Gmail?

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.161
DAVID COHEN: Gmail, yeah.

00:40:23.161 --> 00:40:25.960
You should use that one.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:30.090
One that I use that actually
people don't know much about

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:32.690
is called Voxer.

00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:35.090
It's voice message back
and forth really quick.

00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:38.270
So we're 200 people all around
the world, a small company,

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:39.200
but very distributed.

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.960
The biggest office
is maybe 20 of us.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:44.820
So it's a way to have
hallway conversations.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:46.832
Brad's going to
demonstrate, apparently.

00:40:46.832 --> 00:40:49.040
Just like on WhatsApp, it
has that tiny little button

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.486
that no one pushes
for the voice,

00:40:50.486 --> 00:40:52.610
Voxer's got a big button,
and that's why I like it.

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:54.020
MARY GROVE: So you guys
use this within Techstars.

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:56.415
DAVID COHEN: We literally
run the company on it.

00:40:56.415 --> 00:40:58.790
BRAD FELD: Hey, David, you
having fun with this At Google

00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:59.690
thing right now?

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:00.020
DAVID COHEN: Yes.

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:00.840
MARY GROVE: I'm in the
middle of a great talk.

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:02.423
DAVID COHEN: So if
Voxer is listening,

00:41:02.423 --> 00:41:05.090
they can totally tune into
the strategy of Techstars

00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:08.580
just by stealing our
data and listening.

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:11.520
So that's a big one that
I think helps us a ton,

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:14.220
because when you're
so distributed,

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:16.900
you can't have that meaningful
conversation in the hallway.

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.609
So it lets us do
that, and I love it.

00:41:18.609 --> 00:41:20.150
MARY GROVE: My last
question for you,

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:22.610
I'm just so curious
how you manage

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:23.694
your time, scale yourself.

00:41:23.694 --> 00:41:25.193
We're always looking
for life hacks.

00:41:25.193 --> 00:41:27.090
You talked earlier about
when you first met,

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:29.000
that Brad had a couple
of days set aside

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.630
for meetings with anyone
in 15-minute intervals.

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:34.460
Do you have any hacks,
tips for people who

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:36.510
are juggling a million things?

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:38.330
How do you prioritize
and run your life?

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:39.330
DAVID COHEN: Guess what?

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:41.060
Brad wrote a book.

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:42.064
He's a book salesman.

00:41:42.064 --> 00:41:42.730
BRAD FELD: I am.

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:43.854
I could be.

00:41:43.854 --> 00:41:45.270
Yeah, I wrote a
book with my wife.

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:46.450
DAVID COHEN: You have
a book on every topic.

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:47.325
BRAD FELD: Not quite.

00:41:47.325 --> 00:41:48.010
Not quite.

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:49.470
I have a book I
wrote with my wife,

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:52.800
Amy Batchelor, called "Startup
Life: Surviving and Thriving

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.380
in a Relationship with an
Entrepreneur" is the subtitle.

00:41:55.380 --> 00:42:01.380
So if that sings to you, it's
available at all booksellers

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:03.469
named Amazon.

00:42:03.469 --> 00:42:04.260
And others as well.

00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:09.930
And there's a bunch of hacks
in that book, by the way.

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:14.700
Amy and I do a thing called
four minutes in the morning,

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:19.110
where each morning, we
spend four minutes together,

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:20.460
first thing, just getting set.

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:22.380
We don't have kids, but
we play with our dogs,

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.880
and we talk, and sometimes we
have a cup of coffee together.

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:27.010
But it's linked to
whoever wakes up last.

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:28.620
So who ever wakes
up last, that's

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:30.450
a prompt for the person
who woke up first

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:33.000
to stop whatever they're
doing and just spend

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.437
a few minutes together as a
way of grounding ourselves

00:42:35.437 --> 00:42:36.270
in our relationship.

00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:38.894
DAVID COHEN: You can also do it
in three minutes, to save time.

00:42:38.894 --> 00:42:39.970
Don't use four.

00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:40.870
It's another hack.

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:42.990
BRAD FELD: The
most profound thing

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:47.070
that I've incorporated into
my life in the last couple

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:51.114
of years around this is I used
to be that person who woke up

00:42:51.114 --> 00:42:53.280
at 5 o'clock in the morning
every morning, no matter

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.260
what time zone I was in.

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:59.930
I worked all the
time, the 24/7 thing.

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:01.941
And I had ego
attachment to the fact

00:43:01.941 --> 00:43:03.690
that I was always
getting up at 5 o'clock,

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:05.760
even if I flew
cross-country and needed

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.520
to sleep for another
couple hours.

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:09.960
And I was always available.

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:14.550
I try to be very responsive to
email, try to always engage.

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:18.150
And I'm Jewish,
but not religious.

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:22.470
And I got very depressed
at the end of 2012

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:26.266
and about a six-month
depressive episode in 2013.

00:43:26.266 --> 00:43:27.640
And some of that
was just-- there

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:28.715
were a bunch things
that played into it,

00:43:28.715 --> 00:43:30.940
and I'll leave that
riff for another day.

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.900
But two things that
I did that were

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:36.630
really powerful life
hacks is I stopped

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:38.950
waking up with an alarm clock.

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:41.790
And what happened was I
slept 12 hours or more

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:43.790
a day, every day, for
the next six months.

00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:46.410
So I did not realize
how physiologically

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:48.060
exhausted I was.

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:49.710
And I love sleep.

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:52.230
And so I'm really
now very focused

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:54.210
on making sure that
on a regular basis

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:56.670
I'm getting at least eight
hours of sleep a night.

00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:59.160
So valuing sleep,
especially as you

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.140
start to get a little bit older.

00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:03.780
There's a good book
about this that

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:06.690
relatively recently came out.

00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:08.930
But there's just so
much evidence now

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:10.680
that sleep is a
critically important thing

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:13.110
around both physical
health, mental health,

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:14.730
and productivity,
like your ability

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:16.926
to concentrate for
extended periods of time.

00:44:16.926 --> 00:44:18.300
The other thing
that was profound

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.600
for me on this dimension is--

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.820
and it ties back into
the Jewish thing--

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:25.980
is that I started having
a digital Sabbath.

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:28.340
So from Friday night
sundown to Saturday night

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:35.040
sundown, no email, no
phone calls, no meetings.

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:39.690
I just have time for me,
for Amy, for my dogs,

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:41.477
for friends, for reading.

00:44:41.477 --> 00:44:42.560
That's how I read so much.

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:43.459
DAVID COHEN: No kids.

00:44:43.459 --> 00:44:44.250
BRAD FELD: No kids.

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:46.674
But if I had kids, I
would play with my kids.

00:44:46.674 --> 00:44:48.090
Or I'd give them
to somebody else,

00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:49.260
so I'd have some free time.

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:50.580
Actually, I'd probably
sell them if I had kids.

00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:51.900
DAVID COHEN: I'll bring my
kids over to your place.

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:53.233
BRAD FELD: Please don't do that.

00:44:53.233 --> 00:44:55.920
But that one day
a week of complete

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:59.250
disconnect from the digital
world that we're in has--

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:01.210
I don't watch television.

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:03.600
I just disconnect.

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:07.240
And I have time for myself.

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:11.560
The first four or five months
of doing that each weekend is

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:12.544
excruciating, right?

00:45:12.544 --> 00:45:13.210
Like, oh my god.

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:14.560
I might miss an email.

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:15.340
It's only 9:15.

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:18.760
I've got a whole fucking day
still to not check my email.

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:21.260
But after a while, you
really get into this place

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:25.130
where it creates an
enormous amount of space.

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:27.682
And when you sort of
reengage with the world,

00:45:27.682 --> 00:45:29.390
and I often stretch
it to Sunday morning.

00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:31.431
I kind of reengage with
the world Sunday morning.

00:45:31.431 --> 00:45:34.300
What you start realizing
is you didn't miss much.

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:36.910
And every now and then, there
might be something that, eh,

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:39.246
might have been additive if
you had some involvement.

00:45:39.246 --> 00:45:41.620
And there's occasionally things
that I have project stuff

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:42.940
that I have to do on Saturday.

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.950
But the point I would
make of this life hack

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:48.940
is making sure you're giving
yourself real time each week

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.370
for you, however you do it.

00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:54.190
And I saw a phrase in
a book somebody else

00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:58.450
wrote that I'm proofreading for
him or giving a pre-read for.

00:45:58.450 --> 00:46:04.630
That he shifted
from 24/7 to 24/6.

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:06.140
And I love that idea.

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:08.950
And I don't care whether
you distribute the 24

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:11.470
hours across the week, or you--

00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:13.900
I think it's easier to
distribute across a day.

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:16.420
But to disconnect
from all the nonsense

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:19.870
that we're dealing with all
the time and all the stimuli,

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:22.032
so that we can remember
that we're human,

00:46:22.032 --> 00:46:24.490
and we can spend time with the
people we want to spend time

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:26.710
with, especially ourselves.

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:28.660
And allow you to
then have the energy

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:31.557
to go after the next six days
of whatever that intensity is

00:46:31.557 --> 00:46:32.640
has been a big one for me.

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:35.700
DAVID COHEN: So you message to
Google employees, work less.

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:37.490
MARY GROVE: Work
less, sleep more.

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:40.720
As a mom of one-year-old twins,
Brad, your comment about sleep

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.310
is making me very,
very, nervous.

00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:44.290
BRAD FELD: [LAUGHS]

00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:46.500
MARY GROVE: David, any
quick hacks to add?

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:47.380
DAVID COHEN: One
hack is if you're

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:48.879
going to write a
bunch of books, you

00:46:48.879 --> 00:46:51.130
should totally outsource
the chapters of those books

00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:54.962
to others, like Brad did
with the "Startup Life" book.

00:46:54.962 --> 00:46:55.920
"Startup Relationship."

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.240
BRAD FELD: Yeah, all my books.

00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:57.720
DAVID COHEN: What's
the title of that one?

00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:57.880
"Startup Life"?

00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:58.480
BRAD FELD: "Startup Life," yeah.

00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:00.370
If you read any of
my books, there's

00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:02.110
a bunch of sidebars in them.

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:04.900
And basically, a
typical hardback book

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:06.580
is about 50,000 words.

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:08.590
And I figured out that
you can get other people

00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:10.820
to write about 20,000
of the 50,000 words.

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:12.100
DAVID COHEN: So you got
me to write the chapter

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:14.050
in that book, which was
"Always have a light

00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:15.250
at the end of the tunnel."

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:16.958
You know, we get in
these periods of time

00:47:16.958 --> 00:47:20.500
where we work really hard,
and I've found, in my family,

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:22.750
just knowing there's
always a thing coming up

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:26.560
that's really exciting, a trip,
or time off, or whatever it is.

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:28.630
Just don't ever not
have one of those,

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:31.120
no matter how far out it
is, and it helps everybody

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.420
stay sane in the context
of these busy periods

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:34.485
that we all go through.

00:47:34.485 --> 00:47:35.150
MARY GROVE: Great advice.

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:35.800
Great advice.

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:36.590
Thank you.

00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:38.961
Any live questions
from our Googlers?

00:47:38.961 --> 00:47:39.460
Yes.

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:40.876
SPEAKER: I have a
microphone here,

00:47:40.876 --> 00:47:44.347
if people have any questions.

00:47:44.347 --> 00:47:45.430
AUDIENCE: Thank you, guys.

00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:47.920
It was fantastic
to have you here.

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.170
I find myself thinking
a lot about something

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:51.660
you said at the beginning, Brad.

00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:53.290
In all the new
projects that I start,

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:56.110
I find myself pushing
and pushing and pushing.

00:47:56.110 --> 00:48:00.625
And then you were talking
about the dynamic of pulling.

00:48:00.625 --> 00:48:01.820
How do you think about that?

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:04.000
Is it an indicator that
this is a normal thing?

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.416
You have to push
in the beginning?

00:48:05.416 --> 00:48:07.900
Or maybe my ideas
are not so great?

00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:10.630
BRAD FELD: Well,
I actually think

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:13.880
most ideas at the beginning
are totally irrelevant.

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:14.380
Right?

00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:15.970
And they're just way overrated.

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:18.940
You start with an idea, and--

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:21.420
my partners and I
joke about this.

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:27.130
I have a hundred shitty
ideas for every good idea

00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:28.420
that I have.

00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:31.300
And the thing that
works its magic is I

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:34.120
let the hundred
shitty ideas out.

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.160
I don't hold them, or I
don't grab the first one

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:38.650
and then anchor on and try
to turn it into a good idea.

00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:42.501
Now, in the context of a
project, you could say, well,

00:48:42.501 --> 00:48:44.500
but this is a project I'm
going to be working on

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:45.340
for six months.

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:46.097
That's the thing.

00:48:46.097 --> 00:48:47.680
And what I would say
is break it down,

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:49.120
like an engineering problem.

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:51.520
Make it reductionist into
lots of little ideas.

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:53.440
And run lots of little
experiments, knowing

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:55.570
that most of the experiments
are going to fail,

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:58.630
or most of your hypotheses
are wrong early on.

00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:00.430
And you're running
a bunch of them

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:02.950
because you're looking
for one to grab hold.

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:08.110
Now, another mistake would be
to assume that pull is something

00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:10.291
that happens programmatically.

00:49:10.291 --> 00:49:12.040
Yeah, you have to go
out there and hustle.

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.160
You have to talk to people.

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.118
You have to experiment.

00:49:14.118 --> 00:49:15.550
You have to try
to convince people

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:18.470
that this is interesting
for them to even try it.

00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:21.010
And if you do that,
and time after time,

00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:22.690
quickly, it's all
not interesting,

00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:25.540
and you're not getting
any feedback back,

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:26.587
that's a problem.

00:49:26.587 --> 00:49:28.420
If you're getting
feedback back, then you're

00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:29.810
constantly adjusting.

00:49:29.810 --> 00:49:30.310
Right?

00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:32.064
And so you're playing
that hundred ideas

00:49:32.064 --> 00:49:33.730
until you get the
thing that you land on

00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:35.560
where all of a sudden,
people are pulling.

00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:37.095
So at the very
beginning, no, you're

00:49:37.095 --> 00:49:39.220
not going to have something
spring fully formed out

00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:40.930
of your mind that everybody's
going to get excited about,

00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:42.950
and if they don't, you
should walk away from it.

00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:44.824
But try to keep breaking
it down into smaller

00:49:44.824 --> 00:49:46.990
and smaller chunks.

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:50.290
The experiments that are
causing you to learn and modify

00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:52.990
the fundamental premise of your
idea until all of a sudden,

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:55.115
you find people trying to
rip it out of your hands.

00:50:04.183 --> 00:50:05.766
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
being here, guys.

00:50:05.766 --> 00:50:07.930
I was a former
Techstars participant.

00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:10.895
So thank you for
organizing that.

00:50:10.895 --> 00:50:12.520
I guess the question
I had top of mind,

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:16.340
what does success look like
for you guys for Techstars

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:17.230
in like 10 years?

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:18.730
Where do you want
to see yourselves,

00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:21.221
and what impact do you
want to have on the world?

00:50:21.221 --> 00:50:21.970
DAVID COHEN: Yeah.

00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:24.807
So when we think about
building this big network,

00:50:24.807 --> 00:50:26.890
it's really helping more
entrepreneurs to succeed.

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:29.110
So figuring out more
ways to do that.

00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:31.430
Certainly, it's more worldwide.

00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:35.020
We want to be investing
in many more places.

00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:36.460
Today, 400 companies a year.

00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:39.520
We want to really
see that scale.

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.740
And I think we need to
help them in more parts

00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:43.450
of the entrepreneurial journey.

00:50:43.450 --> 00:50:46.990
So today we have products that
are very helpful in the very

00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:48.440
early stages.

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:50.260
We get a little
bit helpful as they

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:52.240
grow, and then
eventually, we hope maybe

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:53.950
someone else comes
along and is great

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:56.224
and helps that company succeed.

00:50:56.224 --> 00:50:58.640
And connecting them to those
people is part of what we do.

00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:01.090
But I think we can
play more of a role

00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:03.460
in showing the world that
there are going to be

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:04.900
more great startup communities.

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:07.800
That great companies are
going to be built everywhere.

00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:09.430
And that there is
a role, perhaps, we

00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:12.460
can play throughout that
entire journey and not just

00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:13.800
at the beginning of it.

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:16.300
MARY GROVE: We have time for
one final question in the back.

00:51:22.350 --> 00:51:23.200
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:27.430
So Techstars obviously has
a huge mentor and volunteer

00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:29.360
network and so on.

00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:31.810
And if you had to
give advice to someone

00:51:31.810 --> 00:51:34.330
who wants to build
the necessary skills

00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:37.060
to get into that
space, what would

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:39.520
you say that they
start off with?

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.520
DAVID COHEN: When you say
that space, you mean--

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:45.060
AUDIENCE: Just like in
the accelerator space,

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:48.240
as a mentor, as a
volunteer and so on.

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:50.910
So what kind of
skills would you say

00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:55.114
that they should start off
with or start building on?

00:51:55.114 --> 00:51:57.655
DAVID COHEN: To become a mentor
and help other entrepreneurs.

00:51:57.655 --> 00:51:57.920
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:58.670
DAVID COHEN: Yeah.

00:51:58.670 --> 00:52:03.600
So there's a post
that I guess I curated

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:06.350
on my blog, a lot of
people contributed to,

00:52:06.350 --> 00:52:09.240
called "The Mentor
Manifesto," that we

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:13.360
try to list what is it that you
should be doing as a mentor.

00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:15.510
And I think one of
the things that people

00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:19.200
think about when they hear that
word is that this is somehow--

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:22.380
you've been a person that's
built a billion-dollar company,

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:24.600
and you've had this
amazing outcome.

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:27.066
My argument is not
everybody's a mentor.

00:52:27.066 --> 00:52:28.440
Every single person
in this room,

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:30.720
there's someone who knows
a lot more about something

00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.780
than I would know
about that thing.

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:35.160
So everybody has
something to contribute,

00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:38.100
some expertise, some
advice that they're

00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:40.110
speaking from experience on.

00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:43.410
I think that's the key to being
a good mentor is recognizing,

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:45.360
where do my experiences lie?

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:47.370
What areas can I be helpful in?

00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:49.740
And it's OK that I
don't know everything.

00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:52.949
I can come and be helpful
in a context in a situation.

00:52:52.949 --> 00:52:54.990
But "The Mentor Manifesto"
does a pretty good job

00:52:54.990 --> 00:53:00.480
of laying out what I think of
as the social norms for being

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:02.320
a mentor.

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:04.470
Don't come in and try to
answer all the questions.

00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:07.670
Try to stay in the
areas you understand.

00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:10.284
Listen as much as you talk.

00:53:10.284 --> 00:53:11.700
And there's a whole
list of things

00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:13.646
that you can read
about in that post.

00:53:13.646 --> 00:53:16.440
But I think everybody can
contribute to the success

00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:18.700
of others in that way.

00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:22.740
BRAD FELD: One thing to add to
that is practical things you

00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:27.840
can do is engage and do things
with other people who are

00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:30.540
interested in entrepreneurship.

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:33.330
Startup Weekend is a
great example of it.

00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:34.740
Go do stuff.

00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:38.070
Like reading, watching
videos, talking to people,

00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:40.050
trying to learn on
the receiving side

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:43.650
is so different than
actively practicing

00:53:43.650 --> 00:53:45.480
the activity of
entrepreneurship,

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:49.260
especially if your mentor
engagement is not necessarily

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:51.330
as an entrepreneur,
but as a domain

00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:53.550
expert in some
area where you can

00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:57.390
help other entrepreneurs because
of your domain expertise.

00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:59.850
Understanding how
entrepreneurs think, work,

00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:03.570
what it feels like by doing
is so much more visceral

00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:06.824
than observing or studying it.

00:54:06.824 --> 00:54:07.740
AUDIENCE: I've got it.
