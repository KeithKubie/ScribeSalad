00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.930
&gt;&gt;Female presenter: Thank you for having us.
I want to thank Peter Bergen for this book,

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.349
Manhunt, because this is a book we've all
been waiting for. Not just because it's about

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:21.610
how we pursued, we as a nation pursued Osama
bin Laden and eventually killed him, but because

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.410
it tells us so much about the war on terror
and how it was conducted at the highest levels.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.870
In many ways, this is a culmination of work
Peter's been doing for a very long time. If

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:39.480
you had to pick both the person who would
write about Osama bin Laden's end, then you

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.699
would pick Peter Bergen. And if you would
pick the next project for Peter, it would

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:49.120
have been this book. He's written many books
about bin Laden, about al Qaeda. He's considered

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.270
the nation's expert on it. Let me get to the
heart of this. Why did it take us so long

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.660
to find bin Laden?

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.579
&gt;&gt;Peter Bergen: Thank you everybody for coming.
I know you have busy lives. Thank you, Karen,

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:08.190
for doing this, and thank you, Google, for
organizing this. Why did it take so long?

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.930
Rumsfeld had an interesting answer to that
question several years ago when he was asked

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:18.160
the same question. He said, in a very Rumsfeldian
manner, "The world's a big place." Think about

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.430
how long it took for the Israelis to find
Eichmann after the Holocaust. Not for a lack

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.360
of trying, it took 15 years. In fact, one
of the stories I have in the book is the CIA

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.470
looked at other manhunts like the hunt for
Eichmann, like the hunt for Pablo Escobar,

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.600
like the hunt for Eric Rudolph, like the hunt
for Aimal Qazi who killed two CIA employees

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.730
in Virginia in 1993. They tried to derive
any lessons learned.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.340
The lesson learned in the Eichmann case is:
you can hide, but your family may not be as

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.740
effective at operational security as you are.
In Eichmann's case, his son was dating a girl

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:59.000
in Argentina and he started bragging at their
house something about his father's Nazi past.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.830
The father of the girlfriend called a friend
of his in Germany who was a federal judge

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:10.170
who was interested in finding former Nazis.
Somehow, Mossad got wind of that and they

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.450
famously kidnapped Eichmann in Buenos Aires
and took him back. Of course, he stood trial

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:26.999
for his crimes in Jerusalem in 1962 or thereabouts.
Finding bin Laden. On one level, it was a

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:32.030
complicated problem. On another level, we
spent half a trillion dollars on our national

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.329
security, just on our intelligence, since
9/11. That was a lot of money to spend to

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.590
find one person. Because at the end of the
day, what was the war on terror? It was really

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.200
about finding bin Laden, in a lot of ways.
Because if the Taliban had handed over bin

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.139
Laden after 9/11, then you wouldn't be in
this room because there wouldn't have been

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:56.090
a war in Afghanistan. The whole story would
have been over.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.209
&gt;&gt;presenter: One of the things that you deftly
insert into this book, along with a lot of

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.099
other things that you might not think are
relevant to bin Laden, is the story of 9/11,

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:12.030
which is relevant to bin Laden. You are pretty
harsh on the national security establishment,

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.749
at least some of those people at the top level.
You don't name names, but you are concerned

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:24.439
about the failures that brought us 9/11.
Then, you spent a lot of this book talking

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:30.499
about the CIA, and the CIA's role in taking
the wrong direction in trying to find bin

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:35.349
Laden and taking so long to find bin Laden.
I'm just wondering on both these things how,

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.099
after all these years of thinking about the
United States and its relationship to bin

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:45.329
Laden and its relationship to al Qaeda, how
do you assess the CIA? Are there periods of

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.829
time in which they're doing a better job than
a worse job? Just what your overall report

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.400
card on them is, in the name of the war on
terror?

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:00.919
&gt;&gt;Bergen: Well, look. I think the point of
the book wasn't an assessment of how well

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:06.840
the CIA did before 9/11 as you say, but the
fact is, the CIA did pretty well before 9/11.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.200
9/11 wasn't an intelligence failure as it
was often portrayed. It was a policy failure

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.599
because the intelligence apparatus of the
United States, in particular the CIA, in particular

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.401
the bin Laden unit, in particular people that
Karen knows very well, who are in the National

00:04:19.401 --> 00:04:24.390
Security Council focusing on counter-terrorism,
Richard Clark and his deputies, and also,

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.860
by the way, the FBI field office in New York,
which was investigating the first Trade Center

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.490
attack. They were all saying bin Laden was
a big problem, and they were also all saying,

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:41.090
in the summer of 2001, "There is an imminent
attack." It was the most serious set of warnings,

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.361
I think, any administration had every received
about a matter of national security. It was

00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:50.940
simply tuned out. I do say in the book that
went President Bush was famously briefed on

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:57.389
August 6, 2001 with a highly classified presidential
brief that was titled "Bin Laden determined

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.639
to strike the United States", something we
only found out several years later. I interviewed

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:07.789
the woman who wrote that brief, Barbara Sude.
She's quoted in the book. After being briefed

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.900
about that, President Bush took the longest--
continued on the longest presidential vacation

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:19.700
in 30 years.
The idea that-- That's just a fact. You can

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.730
draw your own conclusions. Was the Bush Administration
really concerned about this threat? If they

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.210
were, why was the president-- why did the
president continue on the longest presidential

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:36.340
vacation in three decades? What happened,
of course, is they came into office as if

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.020
the Cold War wasn't over. Their biggest concerns
were China and Russia and anti-ballistic missile

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.970
defense, which, by the way, doesn't stop anything--
you can't stop a terrorist with an anti-ballistic

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:55.710
missile system, a system that doesn't still
even work to this day. There was plenty of

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.901
blame to go around, but I think it's at the
top levels of the Bush Administration, from

00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:05.710
a policy perspective.
Now, that said, after the event happened,

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:11.560
President Bush presided over the most successful,
unconventional campaign in modern history,

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:19.009
which is in three weeks, 300 US special forces
and 110 CIA offices overthrew the Taliban.

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:25.169
In three weeks. It was just amazing. They
were victims of their own success because

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:28.740
this model was so successful that they didn't
get bin Laden at the Battle of Tora Bora because

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:34.599
they kept to this model. That wasn't enough
to keep him enclosed at Tora Bora.

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:37.740
&gt;&gt;presenter: Let's talk a little bit about
Tora Bora. This is something you've been talking

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:43.840
about for 10 years, or however long. It's
always bothered you that we didn't get bin

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.430
Laden at Tora Bora. When you wrote this book,
did you learn anything new about--?

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:54.219
&gt;&gt;Bergen: I did. Wikileaks is an incredibly
useful resource for this kind of reporting

00:06:54.219 --> 00:07:02.551
because we have the-- There's a lot of material
on Wikileaks which is not significant, but

00:07:02.551 --> 00:07:08.110
some of it is significant. In particular,
the summaries of the Guantanamo interrogations

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:16.800
of the detainees there. Karen's written literally
several books on this subject. I have visited

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.990
Tora Bora, where the battle happened, on two
occasions. I've interviewed everybody who

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:27.550
was involved, more or less, at a high level.
But I still find out things on Wikileaks which

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:31.139
were interesting. There was one particular
discovery, which is what did bin Laden do

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:35.830
after the Battle of Tora Bora? He disappeared.
The conventional view was that he got into

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.060
Pakistan. Well, in fact, he did something
quite clever, which is he doubled back into

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:44.219
Afghanistan and he went to a place called
Kunar, which is heavily forested, very mountainous,

00:07:44.219 --> 00:07:47.810
perfect place to avoid American satellites
and drones. He went to ground there for a

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.341
while.
The other thing that I learned, I think a

00:07:50.341 --> 00:07:56.849
properly interesting anecdote: On January
4, 2002, the deputy director of the CIA, the

00:07:56.849 --> 00:08:02.669
now deputy directory of the CIA, Michael Morell,
who is the only person in this book who was

00:08:02.669 --> 00:08:09.180
with Bush on 9/11. He briefed Bush about the
Battle of Tora Bora, and he was the absolutely

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.650
principle person involved in a lot of the
intelligence cases in finding bin Laden. He

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:18.979
is the only person who actually spans the
whole story. On January 4, 2002, he went to

00:08:18.979 --> 00:08:22.790
President Bush and he said, "The CIA's official
conclusion is that bin Laden was at the Battle

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:26.210
of Tora Bora, and that he's escaped and he's
alive."

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:32.969
Why is that an interesting anecdote? Go back
to the campaign of 2004 when John Kerry was

00:08:32.969 --> 00:08:37.729
making quite an issue of this with George
W. Bush and the election campaign. Very closely

00:08:37.729 --> 00:08:44.470
run, very close election campaign. Vice President
Cheney publicly said that Kerry was essentially

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:48.990
making this fact up, that bin Laden was at
the Battle of Tora Bora. George W. Bush made

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:54.450
similar comments. General Tommy Franks, who
was the Bush supporter and also in charge

00:08:54.450 --> 00:09:01.220
of the military operations overall, made similar
comments. They all essentially-- [pause] Let's

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:06.170
say, generously, they forgot what actually
happened, or something. You could say something

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:10.820
less generous if you were so inclined. But
I think this is an important point: that the

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:16.240
CIA officially briefed President Bush shortly
after the battle to tell him it was their

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.290
conclusion that bin Laden was at the Battle
of Tora Bora, that he had escaped.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:23.029
Now you know-- go ahead.

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:28.480
&gt;&gt;presenter: I was going to change the topic
to something else, which is that you referred

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:36.560
before to the importance of family, or relatives
in the capture of Pablo Escobar, in the Eichmann

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:43.570
kidnapping. You make the point early on in
a way that keeps a tension through the book,

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:50.579
which is "Is bin Laden's family going to play
a role here?" You met bin Laden, famously,

00:09:50.579 --> 00:09:56.630
first in 1997. You've been thinking about
him for, I don't want to age us, but--

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.800
&gt;&gt;Bergen: A while.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:03.459
&gt;&gt;presenter: A long time. You talk a little
bit about his family and his family relations

00:10:03.459 --> 00:10:08.399
and the fact that his wives were with him
at Abbottabad, where he was eventually found.

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:17.699
I'm just curious, overall, how you think about
him as a father, as a husband. Where do you

00:10:17.699 --> 00:10:20.959
place that in his psyche and in the eventual
capture?

00:10:20.959 --> 00:10:26.730
&gt;&gt;Bergen: The CIA was asking a lot of the
same questions about "Okay, what is the profile

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.920
of Osama bin Laden?" Because most fugitives
don't try to take three wives and a dozen

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:36.670
kids and grandkids around with them, for obvious
reasons. But they concluded, at the agency,

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:40.630
that it would be quite likely that bin Laden--
Bin Laden's a family guy. He's had six wives,

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:44.899
one of whom he had a very brief marriage to,
another one who-- it wasn't even consummated.

00:10:44.899 --> 00:10:53.540
Another one divorced him. And he, of course,
had four wives. His first wife had left him

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:58.589
by the time he got to Abbottabad. So this
is a guy who's been married since he was 17.

00:10:58.589 --> 00:11:05.250
He was 54. He's got at least 20 kids, probably
more like two dozen kids now.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:10.440
The CIA, when they were thinking about "What
would be the profile of bin Laden? How would

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.560
he be living?", they certainly didn't discount
the idea that he'd be with his family. So

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.560
when they started zeroing in on the Abbottabad
compound, when it became clear that there

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:24.199
was not one, not two, but three families there,
and that the third family seemed pretty sizable,

00:11:24.199 --> 00:11:30.790
to anybody who'd been following bin Laden,
that was actually more of an indication that

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:35.519
this is looking pretty good.
As a father, he's a doting father. I have

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:40.839
a picture in the book with his son Hamza,
in which he was reading poetry to his kids.

00:11:40.839 --> 00:11:49.220
He's teaching them. Playing soccer with his
kids, and volleyball. Hitler was nice to his

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:58.380
dogs. What does that say about anything? Most
people are nice to their kids. "Is he a misogynist?"

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:02.170
is an interesting question, because certainly,
his view of the world seems quite misogynistic.

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:11.529
I would say yes, but with an interesting qualifier,
which is that he basically-- His first wife

00:12:11.529 --> 00:12:15.810
went into the marriage with bin Laden. He
was 17, she was 15. Obviously, she had no

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:20.990
idea that he was going to become an international
jihadi militant. Every other wife along the

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:25.630
way who married him understood what he was
getting into because he started being involved

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:32.690
in these fights with the Soviet Union in Afghanistan
against the Soviets when he was 22, 23. He

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:37.880
basically said to his wives, "If you want
to bail out, you can." In Sudan, one of his

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:42.600
wives said to him, essentially, "I thought
I was marrying the son of a billionaire, and

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:46.920
now we're living in total poverty in Khartoum,
without air conditioning. I'm going back to

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:55.589
Saudi Arabia, thank you." Which is what she
did. There was no contest. By Taliban standards,

00:12:55.589 --> 00:13:00.930
I guess that's relatively-- Of course, he
married wives with a lot of education. There

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:05.360
were three wives at the Abbottabad compound.
His first two wives both had Ph.D.s. They're

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:12.551
a 62 year old Khairiah and 54 year old Siham.
His youngest wife, Amal, the Yemeni who he

00:13:12.551 --> 00:13:17.380
was really living with in the Abbottabad compound,
she was basically a high school dropout. Maybe.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:23.540
I don't even know if she had any schooling
at all. Bu he's not afraid of educated women.

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:28.899
&gt;&gt;presenter: And she's the one, Amal, who
through herself in front of him as Americans--

00:13:28.899 --> 00:13:36.190
&gt;&gt;Bergen: Yeah. Amal, she married him when
he was 17, and again, she was from a rural

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:41.300
backwater in Yemen, a place called Ibb. She
told a cousin, "I'm going to go down in history"

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:46.019
and he was like, "Well, how are you going
to do that?" The way to do that was to get

00:13:46.019 --> 00:13:52.790
married to Osama bin Laden. It's interesting
to see how these wives-- they're now, as you

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:58.660
probably know, they're all back in Saudi Arabia,
she'll go back to Yemen. The Saudis will keep

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:05.390
a pretty careful watch over the two older
wives, but in Yemen it's an inefficient police

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:07.960
state, so she might have some ability to communicate.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:13.319
&gt;&gt;presenter: Let's talk about the courier
a little bit. The United States intelligence

00:14:13.319 --> 00:14:18.200
agencies and defense establishment seems to
have known about the courier since December

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:27.940
2003, January 2004, and his role in top level
al Qaeda operations. Then it took us until

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:36.320
a year ago today to actually tie the courier
to bin Laden and kill bin Laden. How do you

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:41.440
account for that? Let's put on hold talking
about how we got the information, because

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.440
I think that--

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:51.870
&gt;&gt;Bergen: Okay. Why it took so long? [pause]
Everybody knows who Whitey Bulger is? Whitey

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:59.550
Bulger killed 20 people in Boston and was
on the FBI's Most Wanted list starting in

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:04.839
1999. The allegation is he killed 20 people.
He was found relatively recently, I think

00:15:04.839 --> 00:15:13.550
in Santa Barbara, living quietly by the sea.
The FBI's tried to be-- It's not an incompetent

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:21.690
organization by any stretch.
The problem about finding bin Laden was the

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:25.240
United States has a few ways to find you.
Signals intelligence: you're talking on your

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:31.139
cell phone. That's how they found Pablo Escobar.
Essentially, they gave the Columbian police

00:15:31.139 --> 00:15:36.500
directional finding technology that allowed
them to zero in on his cell phone. Well, it

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:42.490
was a radio phone at that time. Another way
is human intelligence. We don't have a huge

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:48.540
number of Taliban fundamentalist Pashtun speakers
who can pass for members of al Qaeda that

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:54.089
would be able to penetrate the group. That's
what would have been required. Another way

00:15:54.089 --> 00:15:58.130
is-- People drop a dime on you to pick up
a reward. That happened, for instance, in

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:03.069
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the operational commander
of 9/11. Somebody picked up $25 million. Well,

00:16:03.069 --> 00:16:06.690
people in bin Laden's immediate circle think
he's basically the savior of true Islam. They're

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:11.480
not going to drop a dime on him. And then,
people make mistakes, and that's the other

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.540
way to find people. But waiting for bin Laden
to make a mistake is obviously not a particularly

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:16.540
effective strategy.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.630
&gt;&gt;presenter: But one of the things that your
book conveys is-- Part of it was about bin

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:25.620
Laden. That maybe he wasn't directing operational
activities around the world, but that he understood,

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:30.279
he was very careful. You were at Abbottabad.
You got in there before the Pakistanis destroyed

00:16:30.279 --> 00:16:35.399
the compound. Talk a little bit about how
he protected himself and how he was aware

00:16:35.399 --> 00:16:37.639
of all of these ways that he could have been
gotten at.

00:16:37.639 --> 00:16:40.720
&gt;&gt;Bergen: He stopped using his cell phone.
He stopped using his-- Cell phones were not

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.529
in existence in Afghanistan at the time. He
stopped using his satellite phone probably

00:16:44.529 --> 00:16:51.980
in '98. He [pause] was very paranoid about--
I mean, I met him in '97, and we were treated

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:56.529
in an extremely paranoid, secretive, disciplined
way, searched very thoroughly, not allowed

00:16:56.529 --> 00:17:01.110
to carry anything with us except-- not even
a watch. There were very concerned about electronic

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:09.809
tracking devices, for instance. He wasn't
letting people in his immediate circle that

00:17:09.809 --> 00:17:14.500
he didn't know very well. He wasn't talking
on a cell phone. He wasn't, obviously, using

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.500
the internet.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:24.030
&gt;&gt;presenter: You talk about his house and
the windows in his house, how he had this

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:28.420
house constructed for himself in Abbottabad,
and how the windows were these slits so that

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:29.420
you actually couldn't see.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.170
&gt;&gt;Bergen: In a way, he became a prisoner.
He created his own prison. It meant that it

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:36.820
was very hard to find him, but also, when
the day came, the night came, the SEALs were

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.690
there, he couldn't really see very much because
he created this prison-like environment. At

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:47.450
the end of the day, he faced a dilemma, which
was he could essentially stop communicating

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:51.669
with anybody and never be found, or he would
have to remain in communication with some

00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:57.179
of his followers, and there would be some
possibility of finding him. The agency essentially,

00:17:57.179 --> 00:18:04.809
I say in the book-- a female analyst--. One
of the interesting side stories here is how

00:18:04.809 --> 00:18:09.929
the CIA-- The biggest cultural shift, I quote
somebody in the book, in the CIA in the last

00:18:09.929 --> 00:18:15.580
20 years is the rise of women in the agency.
The bin Laden unit was full of women because

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:21.240
initially, at that time before 9/11, it was
seen as a backwater and no one really cared

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:26.440
about bin Laden. But some of the people who
did the work that found him, in particular,

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:31.409
were women. It was a particular female analyst
who essentially said, in 2005 when it was

00:18:31.409 --> 00:18:34.850
clear there was going to be no magic bullet,
"There are going to be four ways we can find

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:39.299
him. We can either find him through his immediate
family and their communications with him."

00:18:39.299 --> 00:18:42.480
That never really happened. "We can find him
through the communications that he makes to

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:48.710
Al Jazeera and other media outlets." Those
were always dry holes as it turned out. "We

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:53.630
can find him with communications with the
senior leadership." That didn't really bear

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:58.429
much fruit. "Or we can find him through a
courier."

00:18:58.429 --> 00:19:04.980
I think, deductive logic showed quite early
on that that was the way to go, but Abu Ahmed

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:09.880
al-Kuwaiti, which is the name of the courier,
that's the equivalent of being the father

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:14.980
of Ahmed the Kuwaiti. I don't know what the
number of citizens of Kuwaiti are, but it's

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:19.130
not an insignificant number. And of course,
he's not even really Kuwaiti, he was really

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:24.289
a Pakistani whose family had gone to Kuwait
and they moved back. Pakistan is twice the

00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:29.650
size of California, with a population of 180
million people, so trying to find out-- In

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:33.100
terms of--
Leaping over the question of coercive interrogation

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:38.490
for a minute, the things that really got to
find Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti was associating

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:45.570
a real name with him, which took till 2007.
The next big break was associating a real

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:50.940
cell phone with this real name. That took
till June of 2010. The reason that happened

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:55.240
is they switched cell phone carriers, or did
something to the way they communicated on

00:19:55.240 --> 00:20:02.260
cell phones, that made it a lot easier for
the National Security Agency, the NSA, to

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:07.830
geolocate the phone. But even when you geolocated
the phone, it still took a while to find where

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:13.450
this guy lived because he was very careful.
He took the battery-- he switched off his

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:19.970
phone and took the battery out at least an
hour's drive from where he lived. Then it

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:26.540
was a matter of inserting human spies on the
ground to actually survey this guy and follow

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:31.179
his distinctive white Jeep back to where he
lived in Abbottabad. There was no expectation

00:20:31.179 --> 00:20:35.340
that he'd be living with bin Laden. The CIA
thought there would be a whole other set of

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:40.280
hoops to jump through. But, as they started
looking at the compound, the strange third

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.809
family, then they're beginning to think, "Well,
maybe bin Laden's there."

00:20:43.809 --> 00:20:50.880
&gt;&gt;presenter: Let's talk very briefly, I promise,
about enhanced interrogation techniques. Al-Qahtani

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:57.710
is one of the individuals that we've known
for a long time was tortured or to whom enhanced

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:03.890
interrogation techniques were applied. In
December of 2003, in January of 2004. Those

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:11.750
techniques were approved by Donald Rumsfeld.
We've always had this questions lingering,

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:18.350
this question of torture, of whether or not
you can get reliable evidence. One of the

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:26.091
things seems to be that from Qahtani, as your
book says, we did get information. Could you

00:21:26.091 --> 00:21:31.580
talk a little bit about what that information
was and then we'll talk a little bit about--

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.330
So we know how important it is.

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:36.900
&gt;&gt;Bergen: Qahtani is really an interesting
case because he appears, from what we can

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:41.880
tell, to be the first person to finger Abu
Ahmed al-Kuwaiti as a reasonably significant

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:48.040
player in al-Qaeda. He describes him as somebody
who was giving him instruction. Al-Qahtani

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:52.840
was going to be the 20th hijacker and was
arrested at Orlando. Well, not arrested, turned

00:21:52.840 --> 00:22:00.150
back at Orlando Airport by a very astute INS
officer who said "This guy's on a one-way

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:05.380
ticket, doesn't really speak English." Qahtani
became hostile. A year later he was picked

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:12.090
up in Pakistan. His cover story, as was not
infrequent in these cases, was that he'd gone

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:19.390
to Afghanistan because of his pressing interest
in falconry, when he was in Guantanamo. Eventually,

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:24.940
they matched this guy to the fingerprints
of the hostile guy in Orlando who many people

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:29.780
think is the 20th hijacker, 'cause Mohammed
Atta was waiting for him outside the airport.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:35.429
Now this guy, the 20th hijacker, says that
he was trained in the use of the internet

00:22:35.429 --> 00:22:43.330
and other things by KSM, the operational commander
of 9/11. That makes these-- that Abu Ahmad

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:46.620
al-Kuwaiti is playing an important role in
al-Qaeda.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:50.740
Did that happen before the coercive interrogation?
Did it happen after? Did it happen during?

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:57.420
We don't know. But Wikileaks and other ways
of-- We know how this guys was treated. When

00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:04.760
Karen uses the word "torture", which I think
is a word that can sometimes be, as it were,

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:11.390
abused. In this case, Susan Crawford, who's
a federal prosecutor appointed by the George

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:17.679
W. Bush Administration to oversee the Guantanamo
trials, who was appointed to the bench by

00:23:17.679 --> 00:23:23.010
Ronald Reagan, not a pinko liberal by any
stretch, said this guy Qahtani could never

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:29.870
be tried for anything because he'd been tortured.
Qahtani was undoubtedly coercively interrogated.

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:34.880
He undoubtedly gave up useful information.
The Senate Intelligence Committee is doing

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:40.250
a massive investigation of all this. Dianne
Feinstein last night released a press release

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:43.029
giving some of the early indicators of what
they're going to come up with. It's going

00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:47.659
to be a 5000 page report. They look to several
million pages of documents. It will be the

00:23:47.659 --> 00:23:53.380
definitive history of what really happened
in this program. Neither of us on this stage

00:23:53.380 --> 00:24:00.320
know enough about it to really say exactly
what happened, but Qahtani gave up interesting

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:06.710
information. He was coercively interrogated.
Somebody else seems to have given up useful

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:09.450
information. We know less about him. He was
picked up in Iraq.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:13.370
The flipside is Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and
his replacement Abu Faraj al-Libi, the number

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:20.169
3 in al Qaeda, were both coercively interrogated.
They gave disinformation about Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti,

00:24:20.169 --> 00:24:30.039
the courier. Where does that leave you? We
can't run history backward. There is ammunition

00:24:30.039 --> 00:24:37.940
for both sides of the argument, I think. But
the fact is that the first big break in the

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:43.080
9/11 case came from a guy called Abu Zubaydah,
who was interrogated with completely conventional

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:49.770
techniques by the FBI by a guy called Ali
Soufan, who is a well-known Arabic speaking

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:55.860
FBI agent. He gave up, within about a week,
the key information about the operational

00:24:55.860 --> 00:25:01.179
commander about 9/11. There are many examples
of this. Somebody I quote in the book, Brad

00:25:01.179 --> 00:25:07.700
Garrett, is an FBI agent who interrogated
Ramzi Yousef on the flight back from Pakistan.

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:11.990
He was the architect of the first Trade Center
attack. Ramzi Yousef gave up the whole story

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:13.460
in the course of a plane flight.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:18.110
&gt;&gt;presenter: I was really impressed by the
way that you didn't back away from the topic

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:24.919
and handled it in a very even-keeled and I
thought responsible way. I'm not sure anybody

00:25:24.919 --> 00:25:25.929
else could have done it as well.

00:25:25.929 --> 00:25:30.240
&gt;&gt;Bergen: I went into it thinking the answer
was likely to be kinda gray, like a lot of

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:37.640
things in life. And the answer is, it is kinda
gray It's not one of these perfect "One group

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.080
is wrong and one group is right."

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.909
&gt;&gt;presenter: Right. And it doesn't affect
the moral question of whether it's right or

00:25:42.909 --> 00:25:45.140
not. The question of-- Or does it?

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:50.990
&gt;&gt;Bergen: That's an interesting question.
That's at a level above my pay grade--

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:53.850
&gt;&gt;presenter: Right, I know, I know. I didn't
expect you to have to make that comment. [laughs]

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:59.640
I want to turn to a different subject. One
of the things that surprised me about the

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:05.539
book was how much of it is after 2008. It's
almost like we're trying, we're trying, we're

00:26:05.539 --> 00:26:09.490
sort of trying, we don't know what we're doing.
And then all of a sudden, 2007--

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:14.630
&gt;&gt;Bergen: I think that's right, and I think
that President Bush-- I quote Mike Hayden,

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:18.470
then the director of the CIA. Every morning
he would go in the Oval Office at Thursday

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:22.610
at 8 am for his weekly meeting with the president,
with President Bush. The first question was,

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:27.940
"How's it going, Mike?" Everybody in the room
understood that to mean, "How is finding bin

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:32.760
Laden going?" President Bush didn't-- he wanted
to find bin Laden.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:38.380
I think General Hayden came to Bush in '07
and said, "We haven't killed a single person

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:44.669
in a drone strike this year. Al Qaeda is regrouping."
Bear in mind that in 2005, we had the biggest

00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:48.470
terrorist attack al Qaeda had done in the
west since 9/11, which is the 7/7 attacks

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:53.080
in London. Bear in mind that in the summer
of 2006, it was planning to bring down 7 American,

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:57.580
Canadian, British airlines over the Atlantic.
If it had succeeded, 1500 people dead and

00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:02.460
9/11-style events. Al Qaeda was regrouping
in the tribal regions. It didn't seem to be

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:08.580
doing enough about it. So the agency essentially
came to the president with a plan to basically

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:12.730
amp things up, amp up the drone strikes. They
were preaching to the choir. I think there

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:17.510
was also an attempt, in the last 6 months
of President Bush's presidency, to try and

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:22.870
eliminate as many members of al Qaeda as possible
with drone strikes. They were quite successful.

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:29.929
In the first 6 months of President--. In the
last 12 months of President Bush's presidency,

00:27:29.929 --> 00:27:34.390
there were 6 drone strikes in the first 6
months, and there were 44 in the last 6 months.

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:38.480
This program got dramatically amped up.
What's a little surprising is President Obama

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:43.029
comes in, maybe surprising for the people
who voted for him, he amped it up and quintupled

00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:47.070
it. He didn't just take the program and say,
"We're just going to keep going." He quintupled

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:53.240
to number of drone strikes. He tripled the
number of troops in Afghanistan. He was extremely

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:57.870
aggressive. I had an op-ed in the Times on
Sunday in which I called him the "Warrior

00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:01.529
in Chief" because I think there's a certain
amount of cognitive dissonance both on the

00:28:01.529 --> 00:28:06.230
right and the left about who President Obama
is as a Commander in Chief, which is—. He

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:09.799
won the Nobel Peace Prize very early in his
presidency. He used that as an opportunity

00:28:09.799 --> 00:28:17.280
to say, "Much as I admire Gandhi and Martin
Luther King, nonviolence wouldn't have stopped

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:23.490
the Nazis. You can't negotiate with al Qaeda."
I'm paraphrasing. Remember in the campaign,

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:28.360
he was roundly criticized for the idea that
he would do a unilateral strike into Pakistan

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:33.720
if the Pakistanis wouldn't work. Romney called
him a Dr. Strangelove. McCain said, "We're

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:38.649
going to bomb one of our allies." Hillary
Clinton said that he was telegraphing the

00:28:38.649 --> 00:28:43.410
wrong message, or something to that effect.
The point is that if people have actually

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:48.830
been paying attention to what he said, both
in the campaign and also in his Nobel Peace

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:52.730
Prize acceptance speech, which most people
would use as an opportunity not to discuss

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:58.559
their philosophy of war, maybe there'd be
less cognitive dissonance. I think the laughter

00:28:58.559 --> 00:29:02.190
said very little, really. He is the first
American president in history, that I'm aware

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:05.539
of, who's actually authorized the assassination
of an American citizen and, by the way, has

00:29:05.539 --> 00:29:09.600
also killed an American teenager, because
Anwar al-Awlaki's son was also killed in a

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.169
drone strike. Unintentionally, but nonetheless,
it's the case.

00:29:13.169 --> 00:29:20.399
Then on the right, he can't--. He's not going
to get any credit, or very little credit,

00:29:20.399 --> 00:29:23.680
or very begrudging credit, for what he's really
done.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:29.480
&gt;&gt;presenter: I think that's a really important
point about President Obama's willingness

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.750
to be a warrior.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:37.190
&gt;&gt;Bergen: What I say in the piece, in the
Times, was, and I didn't actually fully develop

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:41.200
this, but this is the first major American
political figure, when I say major, really

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:51.231
major, who in a sense-- Other than somebody
like Hillary Clinton, who isn't-- The issue

00:29:51.231 --> 00:29:55.830
is not what happened in Vietnam. If you think
about McCain and Kerry, their service in Vietnam

00:29:55.830 --> 00:30:02.220
is in a sense what defined them as people
for so long. For Cheney, who took 5 deferments

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:07.040
as we know, his lack of service in Vietnam
is certainly part of his story. President

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:11.230
Bush, of course, was in the Texas National
Guard. He didn't serve in Vietnam. Bill Clinton

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:18.730
was at Oxford and then got--. In the end,
his number wasn't called.

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:23.679
Obama is part of a generation of Democrats
for whom Vietnam is not an issue. I think

00:30:23.679 --> 00:30:33.019
that maybe-- This is complete speculation.
Is that, he prepared to use violence in a

00:30:33.019 --> 00:30:38.700
way that isn't so hobbled by the question
of Vietnam? If you go back to the discussions

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:44.390
of the Afghan search, Dick Holbrooke, who
was the Afghan-Pakistan representative of

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:55.190
Obama to the region, served in Vietnam. Joe
Biden, of course, was out of that generation.

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:59.070
They were concerned that tripling the number
of troops in Afghanistan would be a Lyndon

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:04.480
Johnson-like decision.
Anyway, Obama doesn't seem to be that preoccupied

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:08.690
by it. I think he also, this says a lot about
the way he makes decisions. He doesn't make

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:13.269
decisions from the gut at all. You recall
how he was criticized for tripling the number

00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:18.750
of troops in Afghanistan, taking 10 weeks
to discuss it. I'm like, "10 weeks?" He's

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:23.120
been visiting Afghanistan since 1993. It's
pretty complicated just to understand the

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:28.690
basics about it. Look at the deliberative
process in this case, trying to find Osama

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:35.610
bin Laden. August 2010 is when it became clear
that there was a real possibility. It took

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:41.220
almost a year. He pulls the trigger, but he's
not trigger-happy. It's deliberative, and

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:48.630
it's also in a very structured process within
the National Security Council. I think that

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:53.380
it-- Look at his intervention in Libya, by
the way. It took two years for Clinton to

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:58.840
intervene in Bosnia. He never intervened in
Rwanda. This seems to be just a different

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:03.400
kind of presidency in terms of that issue.
I think it's a little unexpected.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.760
&gt;&gt;presenter: He is the decider, actually.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:12.580
&gt;&gt;Bergen: Indeed. Well, this is a really interesting
thing about the book, is that of system, I

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:17.000
quote Tom Donilon, the National Security Advisor.
"At the end of the day, somebody has to go

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.539
into their own bedroom at night and make a
decision on behalf of 300 million Americans."

00:32:22.539 --> 00:32:28.299
That's a pretty lonely place to be. If you
think about the decision that the president

00:32:28.299 --> 00:32:32.970
made, you have Vice President Biden saying,
"You shouldn't do this." Now Vice President

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:39.830
Biden became a Senator when Obama was age
10. You have Secretary Gates saying, "You

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:46.789
shouldn't do this. You should do something
else." Secretary Gates joined the Nixon Administration

00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:54.100
as an official when Obama was 13. I may have
my numbers slightly wrong, but the point is

00:32:54.100 --> 00:33:01.320
that these very senior guys with incredible--.
Gates has served every president since Nixon,

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:07.139
and was in the room when Operation Eagle Claw,
the ill-fated Iranian rescue operation, blew

00:33:07.139 --> 00:33:12.990
apart. He was in the White House as a 41 year
old, relatively senior CI. He was the Executive

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:16.529
Assistant to the CI director at the time,
Stansfield Turner. He saw the whole thing

00:33:16.529 --> 00:33:22.720
unfold in real time. That was very much on
his mind. Then, the number 2 military officer

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:27.700
in the nation, James Cartwright, was advocating
another course. To make a decision like that--

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:32.930
Hillary Clinton was saying, "Go for the raid."
She gave a very lawyerly deliberative presentation.

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:38.210
I did an interview with her in which she,
I quote her directly, she said, "I gave a

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:42.360
long and deliberative presentation because
President Obama is-- that's what's going to

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.360
convince him."

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.360
&gt;&gt;presenter: Lawyerly.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:48.340
&gt;&gt;Bergen: Lawyerly. She really examined the
pros and cons. And people didn't know where

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:51.539
she was going to go. In the end, she said,
"You should do the raid." Leon Panetta, the

00:33:51.539 --> 00:33:56.800
director of the CIA, was, of course, pushing
for the raid from the beginning. He also had

00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:04.809
a form of the political argument, which is,
I quote him again directly from an interview,

00:34:04.809 --> 00:34:08.080
he said, "Mr. President, this is the test
I would use. What if an ordinary American

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:14.170
was in the room? What if they knew what we
know? What would they say about it? I think

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:18.860
the answer to that is, I think most Americans
would say, 'Yeah, this is worth the risk.'

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:25.950
Then there was another form of the political
argument, which is you want to do this when

00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:30.520
there's no moon. Well, the lunar cycle is,
of course, a month. The next new moon weekend

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:36.100
was going to be June 1. By now, even though
this was incredibly tightly held for so long,

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:39.470
meetings that would have meant--. In the White
House, people began to notice there were a

00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:43.420
set of meetings which were called "non-meetings."
[chuckles] I don't know if you have those

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:50.210
at Google, but the non-meetings were-- very
few people were coming to them or allowed

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:55.600
to come to them. No seconds, nobody was allowed
to substitute. There was no paper trail. There

00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:00.900
was no written products. But at a certain
point, when you drew an operation like what

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:04.200
happened in Abbottabad, you are going to have
to bring in more people, even if they're not

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:09.710
fully briefed on what's happening. The universe
of people is growing. As it grows, it grows

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:16.330
exponentially. What'd happen if somebody started
blogging about this, or it leaked out? Bin

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:21.380
Laden wouldn't have hung around. The political
costs also of not doing something were actually

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:28.721
pretty high, because--. If you hadn't done
the raid and then two months later it were

00:35:28.721 --> 00:35:33.950
to come out that we had all this information,
it would have been a disaster. So it was a

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:35.150
very tough decision.

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:39.620
&gt;&gt;presenter: Right. And as you point out,
even then, even with all the pressure on him,

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:42.410
he took the night to think about it. Right?
He took--

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:48.450
&gt;&gt;Bergen: I would love to have-- I asked for
an interview with him and didn't get one.

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:53.190
He did do a pretty substantial interview with
60 Minutes, and gave a very interesting interview

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:56.660
to the History Channel, on which he develops
some of his thoughts further. And obviously,

00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:03.160
I was able to talk to a lot of people familiar
with his decision-making. But at the end of

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:06.830
the day, it was his decision. It was nobody
else's. So the idea that anybody could have

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:10.840
made this decision, which I've heard in the
last day or two, I think that is absolutely

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:16.220
nonsensical. I mean, let's do a thought experiment
where--. Joe Biden was a Democrat candidate

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:19.950
for president who seemed to have a lot more
foreign policy experience. By his own admission,

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:22.820
he wouldn't have made the same choice. But
we know he wouldn't have made the same choice.

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:29.230
Do the thought experiment where Bob Gates
was president. The point is is not everybody

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:32.350
would have made the same decision. It's very
easy to say retroactively because it worked

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:35.670
out pretty well that "That's the decision
I would have made." Not at all clear to the

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:36.670
people involved.

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:40.670
&gt;&gt;presenter: It's very interesting. You've
laid out the answer to the question I wanted

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:46.500
to ask you, which one of the very interesting
things is I expected, even though I know you,

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:50.891
I expected there'd be a lot in this book about
the SEAL team and how they thought. That kind

00:36:50.891 --> 00:36:53.650
of book. It's very much not that. This is--

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:56.210
&gt;&gt;Bergen: They wouldn't talk to me, so that's
really easy. [laughs]

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:58.780
&gt;&gt;presenter: But it's very much about the
teamwork--

00:36:58.780 --> 00:36:59.780
&gt;&gt;Bergen: Yeah.

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:03.900
&gt;&gt;presenter: --that went on inside the Obama
Administration. For a president who has made

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:09.590
his mark being the deliberative, procedural,
process driven, as Hillary Clinton says, lawyerly

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:15.750
type. He actually did this in that way. You
watch this last year come together, one opinion

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:20.860
after another. It's a little bit surprising,
the absence of Gates in the narrative. But

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:26.340
it's also surprising, not because of his position,
just because it's surprised me in the narrative,

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:31.930
the prominence of Panetta. If there is a hero
in this book, in some ways, although there

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:35.470
are a lot of people who could be heroes and
you could make the case for the President

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:39.640
and for that particular woman at the CIA,
you might--

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.070
&gt;&gt;Bergen: Do you think Al Pacino will play
him, or?

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:46.110
&gt;&gt;presenter: I don't know. I think it's--
We have to think. But it's very interesting

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:51.850
in how he's the person who goes in and says,
"Abbottabad? Why don't we know more about

00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:53.520
it? We need to know more about it."

00:37:53.520 --> 00:38:02.170
&gt;&gt;Bergen: Panetta was very incensed by-- He
was getting very angry about why they weren't

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:06.740
able to get more information about it. He's
certainly one of the people who comes out

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:11.770
of the book incredibly well. There's a great
quote from him in the book. I interviewed

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:16.030
him, one of the last people to interview.
The morning of the raid, he looks at himself

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:20.830
in the mirror, and he's shaving, and he says,
"The next time I look at myself in the mirror,

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:23.850
this is either going to go pretty well, or
I'm going to have a lot of explaining to do

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:31.491
to a lot of people." [laughs] The point is--.
And another great quote: he was talking to

00:38:31.491 --> 00:38:36.180
his deputy, Mike Morell, who I mentioned earlier.
They had a final conversation before the raid.

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:40.641
Mike Morell says, "Where are you, Director
Panetta, on this?" and he says-- either one

00:38:40.641 --> 00:38:46.430
of them or both of them say versions of "Either
bin Laden is not going to be there, or he

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:51.790
is going to be there." And they both say,
"That's where we both are." These are the

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:57.520
two most senior intelligence officials in
the United States in a sense. [background

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.150
scraping noise] I think Panetta comes out
of it very well. Admiral McRaven, who organized

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:07.381
the raid, comes out of it very well. A lot
of people come out of it well. It wasn't my

00:39:07.381 --> 00:39:08.790
intention to make them look good.

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:12.750
&gt;&gt;presenter: No, it's not. It's that they
look good at--. They work as a team from all

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:17.890
different parts. If you ridicule the inter-agency
process, this would be one instance where

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:18.890
it's not--

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:20.470
&gt;&gt;Bergen: I think this will be one of these
things like the Cuban Missile Crisis that

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:25.060
historians will be examining it as a classic
case study about presidential decision-making.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:28.531
Already, Graham Allison, who wrote the best
book on the Cuban Missile Crisis, did a piece

00:39:28.531 --> 00:39:36.640
in Time last week, looking at this in a very
analytical frame. It worked, but it could

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:41.300
have--. If things had gone wrong, it might
be one of those presidential case studies

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:45.380
of Operation Eagle Claw, which was a total--

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:51.251
&gt;&gt;presenter: Disaster. But let's talk a little
bit about bin Laden and bin Laden-ism. One

00:39:51.251 --> 00:39:57.520
of the things--. He's referred to by surveillance
teams as the Pacer. They realize there's somebody

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:02.180
pacing back and forth in the compound. They're
not sure who it is, so they name him the Pacer.

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:08.890
It turns out to be bin Laden. There are certain
things that happen that surprise us about

00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:13.720
bin Laden. One of them is the Arab Spring,
and the fact that he can't, for all of the

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:18.470
complaining that he'd done and pointing to
mistreatment of Muslims and this war between

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:23.210
the religions and this war on Islam. When
it actually comes right down to what happens

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:28.180
in those final years of bin Laden's life,
is that the headline is not about al Qaeda.

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:33.350
Talk a little bit about what you think this
meant to bin Laden and what it means for the

00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:35.180
future of al Qaeda, in general

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:39.840
&gt;&gt;Bergen: I think we know what it meant to
bin Laden. Bin Laden released around 30 audiotapes

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:44.390
and videotapes after 9/11, and he would comment
on the matters of the most minor interest

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:48.210
in the Muslim world. Arcane discussions of
theology amongst Saudi clerics who would talk

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:52.620
about the decision in France to ban the public
wearing of the burqa. He would talk about

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:57.830
any issue of any significance to Muslims anywhere.
The floods in Pakistan of the summer of 2010,

00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:05.190
the list goes on and on. He never released
a tape about the Arab Spring. He did make

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:08.740
one, which has been recovered, but this is
the most significant event in the Middle East

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:14.660
since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire since
the end of World War I, and yet he had nothing

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:19.140
to say about it. I think there's a reason
for that. His people were not involved, his

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:22.740
ideas were absent. I didn't see--. To me,
it was very telling that in the thousands

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:27.780
of hours of videotape of the Arab Spring,
there was not one picture of an American flag

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:31.740
being burned. There wasn't even a picture
of an Israeli flag being burned, because these

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:36.130
issues, which had seemed to so animate the
Middle East, actually were not the real issues.

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:41.670
The real issues were the mistreatment of Arab
publics by their rulers and authoritarian

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:48.300
kleptocracies, often family kleptocracies.
People'd had enough. Of course, in Egypt the

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:52.950
main political party was called Kefaya, which
means "enough." People had had enough. This

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:56.491
had nothing to do with bin Laden. Bin Laden
was losing the war of ideas in the Muslim

00:41:56.491 --> 00:42:00.790
world long before the Arab Spring or his own
death because he had nothing to offer. There's

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:06.490
no al Qaeda hospital system or social welfare
service or ideas about political economy.

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:10.580
It's just a restoration of the caliphate,
by which he means not the Ottoman Empire,

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:16.000
but Taliban-style theocracies from Indonesia
to Morocco. Most Muslims see what the Taliban

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.500
did in Afghanistan. It's not a very attractive
model for the future.

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:26.800
The two great quotes that I use at the end
of the book, one is by President Bush, who,

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:34.980
9 days after 9/11, said that al Qaeda would
eventually "join the unmarked grave of discarded

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:41.230
lives." Just as fascism and communism had.
President Obama called them "small men on

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:45.530
the wrong side of history." Those are both
accurate.

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:48.970
One of the really interesting things to me
about bin Laden's death was the absence of

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:53.100
reaction to it in the Arab and Muslim world
at large. You can have a million men march

00:42:53.100 --> 00:43:00.580
in Pakistan over almost nothing. There was
nobody getting out on the streets. There was

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:06.820
the usual hundred rent-a-crowd-type religious
fanatics in Qatar and places, but there was

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:10.920
nothing significant. Bin Laden's moment had
long come and past.

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:15.620
I think when we zoom out and look at this
in a historical sense, we're going to look

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:25.110
at this as a period of essentially world domination
by Google and uninterrupted peace. 9/11 will

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:29.850
be seen as a significant event, but it was
an aberrational event. I think we can say

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:33.890
that now already. I don't think we're, Al
Qaeda doesn't pose a National Security problem

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:38.930
in the United States or anything close since
9/11. 17 Americans have died in the United

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:44.810
States as a result of al Qaeda or al Qaeda-like
individuals or groups. More Americans die

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:49.790
accidentally, drown in their bathtubs every
year, something like 300 every year. We don't

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:53.820
have an irrational fear of accidental bathtub
drownings, so we shouldn't have an irrational

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:58.120
fear of al Qaeda. In fact, we're doing their
business for them if we do. Let's put it all

00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:00.530
in perspective.
We had a case today, by the way, in Cleveland

00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:04.770
where a group of anarchists were planning,
supposedly, to try to blow up a bridge. It's

00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:09.800
not the-- Only al Qaeda and jihadi militants
is not the only form of terrorism out there,

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:14.460
but we have a huge--. On 9/11, there were
16 people on the no-fly list. Now there are

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:18.671
21,000. On 9/11, there was no TSA. We can
debate about the merits or demerits of that,

00:44:18.671 --> 00:44:23.270
but the point is there was none. On 9/11,
there was no DHS. On 9/11, the FBI and the

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:27.350
CIA were barely talking. On 9/11, there were
very few joint terrorism task forces. We have

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:32.700
directed, the United States, a huge amount
of resources in thinking about this problem.

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:36.600
It is basically you can't--. No politician
is going to get up and say, "The problem is

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:41.210
over" because what if it isn't? Even if you're
wrong by 1%, politically, you pay a huge price.

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:45.990
But we can say that this problem--. I have
every interest in saying this is a problem

00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:50.051
that continues to exist because I spent 15
years and 4 books trying to document it. But

00:44:50.051 --> 00:44:55.070
I feel like a Sovietologist in 1989, which
is like this problem--. The difference is,

00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:59.060
of course, the Soviet Union officially has
dissolved itself. Al Qaeda will never say,

00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:02.960
"Hey, we are out of business." But they are
effectively out of business. If the death

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:07.190
of bin Laden and the Arab Spring isn't the
punctuation mark, what is? We didn't kill

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:09.220
every Nazi to win World War II.

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:12.970
&gt;&gt;presenter: Perhaps you could whisper that
in the ear of some politician.

00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:16.880
&gt;&gt;Bergen: Yeah, I could whisper it, but I
think it would be a waste of breath because

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:22.730
I think no--. Politicians are politicians
because they want--. This is not even a criticism

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:25.720
of them. They're not going to say that because
it becomes freighted with too much political

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:26.720
cost if you're wrong.

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:33.040
&gt;&gt;presenter: Well, let me ask a question.
Do you think that there is a concerted group

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:36.700
of politicians who think that the al Qaeda
moment is over and the threat of al Qaeda

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:40.410
is something we can now be at ease about?

00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:44.330
&gt;&gt;Bergen: The way I would answer that, Christmas
Day 2009. If that plane had blown up over

00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:50.070
Detroit with 300 Americans on board, carried
live on CNN, the Obama presidency would have

00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:55.730
been over, in my view. He would be a one-term
president. That's not a comment on him, it's

00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:59.850
a comment on zero tolerance that the American
people now have for this kind of thing. After

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:04.970
all, Pan Am 103 blew up over Scotland, killing
270 people in 1988. It wasn't the end of George

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:11.650
H. W. Bush's presidency. But in the post-9/11
era, that would be something that would be

00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:13.960
politically impossible to recover from.

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:17.990
&gt;&gt;presenter: So we need to keep this--. Or
we will keep this big infrastructure? Do we

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.990
need all of that?

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:23.180
&gt;&gt;Bergen: I'm sure we don't. There are 860,000
Americans with top secret clearances. Not

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:31.020
secret, top secret. I don't think they all
need them, somehow. Having a certain amount

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:35.790
of redundancy is fine, but there's--. Clearly
everybody's going to have to give blood at

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:42.450
the blood bank in terms of this budget crisis.
The national security industrial complex shouldn't

00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:43.450
be exempted.

00:46:43.450 --> 00:46:50.650
&gt;&gt;presenter: Well said. Do you have any questions?
We have a few minutes for questions if you

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:55.430
have any. [pause] Go to the microphone if
you have a question.

00:46:55.430 --> 00:47:00.200
&gt;&gt; male #1: I actually have a question. Actually,
I have two questions, but I'll make them brief.

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:03.980
First one is, I read your piece in the New
York Times, the op-ed piece, which I thought

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:08.680
was excellent. But a few days later, and I
don't know if you caught it in a Wall Street

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:14.471
Journal, there was a piece that, I can't remember
who wrote it, that implied that the Obama

00:47:14.471 --> 00:47:20.980
Administration is losing their focus on al
Qaeda and focusing more on China and the Far

00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:25.570
East. I was just wondering what your reaction
to that is. The second thing, on a more personal

00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:30.540
level, I realize you're a journalist, and
so there's always a tension between journalism

00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:35.710
and the national security apparatus. But I
was just wondering, are there ever times where

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:42.970
you're surprised by what information is publicly
available? Where you say to yourself, "Wow,

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:48.510
I didn't realize" or "That might be information
that could help al Qaeda or some other terror

00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:49.510
organization."

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:50.510
&gt;&gt;presenter: Okay, good.

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:53.510
&gt;&gt;Bergen: On the question of informations
publicly available, obviously I'm a journalist,

00:47:53.510 --> 00:48:00.910
so I'm in favor of as much publicly available
information. Obviously at Google, which is--.

00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:07.690
Obviously, that's part of Google's philosophy.
Am I surprised what's out there? The way I

00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:12.910
would answer that is the CIA, belatedly, but
in a real way, is getting into the open source

00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:20.850
intelligence business which-- [pause]. When
I'd been writing about bin Laden, some of

00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:25.860
the most useful materials were stuff that
was publicly available information in the

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:31.970
Arab language press. The open source, you
can actually -- Universities have access to

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:39.240
it. It's a CIA-funded thing. Universities
and think tanks. That's a tremendous resource.

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:44.690
I'm happily surprised by how so much is available.
I think that, until recently, I think the

00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:48.780
intelligence community tended to view things
that weren't secret as not being useful. I

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:53.990
think they now understand that in fact, most
of the useful material is actually open. At

00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:58.770
the end of the day, there are certain things
that are--. There's a distinction between

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:07.720
secrets and mysteries. Mysteries are very
hard to-- A mystery might be "What is Ahmadinejad

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:13.280
really thinking?" [laughs] That's a tough
one and obviously not something easily available

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:19.080
on open source.
On the question of China. The idea that the

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:24.210
United States government can't chew gum and
walk simultaneously is ridiculous. Al Qaeda

00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:30.470
has received a huge amount of attention. I
think it's good that there's been more attention

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:35.470
on these other issues. They're not going away.
I just don't buy that.

00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:36.820
&gt;&gt;presenter: Over here.

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:42.290
&gt;&gt; male #2: I have two questions. The first
is, you said if they had handed over bin Laden,

00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:46.720
there would be no war on terror. Do you truly
believe that? Isn't it a little bit pretext?

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:48.680
&gt;&gt;presenter: Okay, and next question?

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:53.250
&gt;&gt; male #2: So as someone who served in Afghanistan,
what is the future for the country?

00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:54.250
&gt;&gt;presenter: Thank you.

00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:58.730
&gt;&gt;Bergen: Okay. What's the future of Afghanistan?
I'm like a lot of people. I'm somewhat optimistic.

00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:02.820
I've been visiting since '93. I was there
in the civil war. I was there for the Taliban.

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:07.510
What's happening in Afghanistan is not great.
On the other hand, it's much better than being

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:10.940
invaded by the Soviets, having a civil war,
and being ruled over by the Taliban, which

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:15.100
is what happened to the country in the last
30 years. There was no phone system under

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:20.380
the Taliban. Now, 1 in 3 people in Afghanistan
has a cell phone. There were no girls in school.

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:28.690
Now, 2 million girls are in school. GDP growth
rate was 20% in 2009. The list goes on and

00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:33.530
on. There've been advances. Not to say that
Afghanistan would be anything other than a

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:38.920
not particularly successful central Asian
state like Tajikistan. That's what it will

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:41.630
be.
I think the prognosis is really reasonably

00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:44.620
good. We signed an agreement with the Afghan
government in principle that the United States

00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:50.250
will be there another 10 years after 2014.
I think most Afghans are happy about that,

00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:53.810
that we will continue to be involved in the
future of their country.

00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:59.530
The pretext on bin Laden. I think if the Taliban
had handed over bin Laden, why would we have

00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:04.020
gone to war with them? It's not like Afghanistan's
such a valuable piece of territory for the

00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:11.670
United States. There would be no reason to--.
Why? Let's do the thought experiment. They

00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:17.050
handed over bin Laden. The United States would
still have gone to war to fight the Taliban,

00:51:17.050 --> 00:51:18.050
you think?

00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:20.140
&gt;&gt;male #2: Iraq. [pause]

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:22.860
&gt;&gt;Bergen: I don't see the connection.

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:24.530
&gt;&gt;presenter: Let's move on to another question.

00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:27.750
&gt;&gt; male #2: Okay. I just want to sum up. I
talked to a lot of Afghanis--

00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:30.260
&gt;&gt;presenter: You know what, we're just going
to take the next question. Thank you very

00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:31.260
much.

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:35.900
&gt;&gt; woman #1: Hi, I have a related question
to that, which is as the person who manages

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:41.490
for Google our military veteran programs internally
and externally, we've seen, our military and

00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:46.430
our American public has seen the goal shift
a number of times. At least, that's the perspective

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:51.660
of the hundreds of veterans I've talked to
who've served on multiple deployments. We

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:57.060
went in to get bin Laden. We decimated al
Qaeda. Bin Laden's gone. Now it's all about

00:51:57.060 --> 00:52:02.930
the Taliban. We're going to be there for 10
years. From your perspective of having written

00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:08.791
so many books and covered this winding road
of this story over the many, many years, where

00:52:08.791 --> 00:52:13.500
do you, where does the goal stop? When we
do leave in 10 years, what's to say that the

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.600
Taliban isn't going to come back?

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:21.190
&gt;&gt;Bergen: Right. That's a fair enough question.
Why are we in Afghanistan. What is the strategy?

00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:25.920
I think if President Obama was here, or President
Romney if he gets elected, or President Hillary

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:31.190
Clinton, or any other president, would say
that we're in Afghanistan basically to prevent

00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:37.510
the Taliban having a resurgence of any meaningful
nature. Not to say that the Taliban won't

00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:41.760
be part of the future of Afghanistan in some
way, but it wasn't just al Qaeda that was

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:47.420
living in Afghanistan pre 9/11. Every jihadi
group from the Philippines to Uzbekistan to

00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:54.010
around the world was living there.
The reason that it's a powerful argument to

00:52:54.010 --> 00:52:59.870
say we should continue trying to continue
this counter-sanctuary strategy is we've tried

00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:07.710
varieties of ways in the past to-- We've had
an Afghan policy of essentially leaving it.

00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:11.700
In 1989, we closed our embassy. We zeroed
our aid to the poorest countries in the world

00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:17.150
at the time. That was under the Clinton Administration.
George H. W. Bush closed the embassy there,

00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:22.290
his administration. Into the vacuum came the
civil war, the Taliban. Then we did a version

00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:29.660
of that again in 2002 when George W. Bush,
because of an ideological aversion to nation

00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:35.860
building, didn't really do anything in Afghanistan.
In 2003, there were 6000 American soldiers

00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:40.740
in Afghanistan. It's a country the size of
Texas with a population 10 times the size

00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:47.680
of Houston. 6000 is the number of policeman
in Houston. So it was not enough to maintain

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:58.210
control. I think any American president will
say, will try to maintain some kind of presence.

00:53:58.210 --> 00:54:02.730
Our post 2014 presence is not going to be
a combat presence. It's going to be an advisory

00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:08.260
presence because the Afghan National Army
is going to need help. By the way, there was

00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:12.950
no--. The coalition in Iraq was essentially
the British, and that was that. The coalition

00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:16.860
in Afghanistan includes about 40 countries,
including some Muslim countries: Jordan and

00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:23.010
Qatar have very small contingents. Many countries
are threatened by--. The Germans are threatened,

00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:27.370
or there's a case going on right now in Germany
today about some Germans who were training

00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:32.870
in the tribal regions who were planning to
attack in Europe.

00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:37.650
I think that that is, I don't think it's so
much the goalposts have changed. A part of

00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:43.700
it is also what people say about what the
strategy is. I think that it's easier just

00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:47.910
to say, "We're there to defeat al Qaeda" rather
than to say, "Our goal is a counter-sanctuary

00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:52.160
strategy to prevent the Taliban coming back
from controlling a significant part of the

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:56.250
country where they might bring back al Qaeda
or like-minded groups" because that does not

00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:58.790
fit very well on a bumper sticker. But that's
really the strategy.

00:54:58.790 --> 00:55:00.210
&gt;&gt;presenter: I'll take the last question.

00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:04.510
&gt;&gt; male #3: So based on your research, do
you believe there is every any sincere attempt

00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:09.770
or intention to capture bin Laden alive? Or
was this team effectively on a shoot-to-kill

00:55:09.770 --> 00:55:13.640
mission? And if we had brought him out alive,
what would have happened?

00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:19.690
&gt;&gt;Bergen: I say in the book. There was a plan,
if we captured bin Laden, to take him to Bagram

00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:26.660
Air Force Base and then put him on a plane
to the USS Carl Vinson, which is a huge warship,

00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:30.950
which is where he was buried, essentially
from that warship. There was a group of high-valued

00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:39.180
interrogators, special high-valued interrogation
team, linguists, lawyers, experts in al Qaeda

00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:43.980
who were assembled there who would have interrogated
him in Bagram and then on the the Vinson.

00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:47.970
He probably would have been kept there for
several months, probably incommunicado. It

00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:52.100
would not have been announced, if there was
a way to keep it covert that he was actually

00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:54.670
in custody.
Was there any real chance that he was going

00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:58.940
to be killed, uh, you know, captured? I'm
pretty skeptical. First of all, his own public

00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:03.170
statements were "I'm going to go out as a
martyr." He said that repeatedly. Secondly,

00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:10.530
unless he conspicuously surrendered, I think
the rules of engagements suggested adult males

00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:18.270
in the building were likely to be killed,
which is what happened. The US Navy SEAL Team

00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:23.310
6 is not the Red Cross. On the other hand,
they do have rules of engagement which they

00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:30.320
would follow. But he didn't conspicuously
surrender. He was shot. Why he didn't put

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:35.710
up a fight is a question I could never really
get a good answer to because obviously, he

00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:36.970
wasn't available for an interview.

00:56:36.970 --> 00:56:43.070
&gt;&gt;presenter: Let me ask you one final question,
Peter, following up on that. Was there anything

00:56:43.070 --> 00:56:49.580
that you in particular would have liked to
know from bin Laden, had he been taken alive?

00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:54.880
Beyond what we've gotten from the documents
cache that has been retrieved from the Abbottabad

00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:58.490
house? Is there anything we wanted to know?

00:56:58.490 --> 00:57:02.850
&gt;&gt;Bergen: One of the interesting things about
these documents is a question that I've always

00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:08.800
had about bin Laden, which is he claims he's
a defender of Muslims, yet a lot of his victims

00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:14.590
have been Muslims civilians. A lot of the
victims have been civilians. From a juridicial

00:57:14.590 --> 00:57:20.310
Islamic theology perspective, that's not a
very easy thing to say is okay. Plenty of

00:57:20.310 --> 00:57:24.320
people have pointed out that bin Laden is
on very thin ice when he says it's okay to

00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:28.580
kill American civilians and others.
A question I would have had for him is: how

00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:32.320
do you justify that? He's been asked that,
but what's interesting in these documents

00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:38.960
is that it became clear to bin Laden that
the attacks that people were doing on civilians

00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:44.870
in al Qaeda's name were actually very counter-productive.
I have a piece on CNN right now. The leaders

00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:48.750
of al Qaeda wrote the Pakistani Taliban saying,
"You've got to desist from these attacks on

00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:55.250
mosques and public marketplaces. They're killing
lots of Pakistani civilians." Was that a tactical

00:57:55.250 --> 00:58:01.100
thing, was that a religious thing, was it
both? Probably a little bit of both. Al Qaeda

00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:04.430
itself was beginning to realize that this
was its main Achilles' heel.

00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:09.240
&gt;&gt;presenter: Well, we're out of time, but
thank you Peter. I encourage you to buy the

00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:11.560
book, which is for sale over there. It is
wonderful.
