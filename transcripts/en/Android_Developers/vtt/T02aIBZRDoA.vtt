00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.940
We all have apprehensions when it
comes to money.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.540
So I thought, why not use technology
to help with that?

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.220
Money Forward lets you manage
your financial information

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.100
from bank accounts to credit cards,
bonds, and loyalty points

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.700
all from one app.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.820
With just a glance at your smartphone,
you can check everything instantly

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.540
your income, your outgoings,
your current balance, and so on.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.020
All of which are updated in real time.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.740
We inquired about Google's Material
Design as soon as it was announced

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.360
and it's been really beneficial
to us.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.700
Within the first month, we experienced
a 30% increase in total users

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.720
a 7% increase in user retention

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.160
and a 4% decrease in bounce rate.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.240
Using the UI templates on offer

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.940
we were able to create a great
UI that works for our product.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.960
We've found that tablet users are
1.5 times more likely to pay for

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.600
in-app purchases than smartphone users.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.280
While users who use both
smartphones and tablets

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.020
are around three times as likely.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.600
Before using Material Design

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.860
we had to set aside a lot of time
whenever there was an OS update.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.680
But now, the Android Support Library
guarantees that even after an OS update

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.320
the app will behave the same.
It's a real time saver.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.840
CoordinatorLayout is a great
example of how it has helped.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.200
There was one case where we'd
developed a feature

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.280
to automatically hide the header
when scrolling down a page.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.720
But this stopped working after
an OS upgrade.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.680
Fortunately, this kind of function is
now covered by the Support Library.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.900
Our app will soon support Android Wear.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.560
You can now add to your account book
using voice recognition.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.740
We're also thinking of adding
a feature to notify users

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.200
about their incoming debits.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.260
For example, "Payment due on Monday."
or, "Your balance is insufficient."

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.960
Given that our service handles
sensitive customer information

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.720
we are very mindful of security.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.720
This means operating strict security
measures at every step

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.800
from handling device data
to encrypting transmissions.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.260
Google gives us the perfect platform

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.460
to explore new technology and
create great applications

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.860
that we hope will have a positive
impact on many people's lives.
