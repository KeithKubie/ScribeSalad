00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.628
- [Voiceover] Derek sent a
chain letter to his friends,

00:00:02.628 --> 00:00:05.321
asking them to forward the
letter to more friends.

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:07.504
The group of people who
receive the email gains

00:00:07.504 --> 00:00:10.662
9/10 of its size every three weeks,

00:00:10.662 --> 00:00:12.867
and can be modeled by a function, P,

00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:16.280
which depends on the
amount of time, t in weeks.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.241
Derek initially sent the
chain letter to 40 friends.

00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:21.539
Write a function that
models the group of people

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.047
who receive the email t weeks

00:00:24.047 --> 00:00:26.763
since Derek initially
sent the chain letter.

00:00:26.763 --> 00:00:29.758
So pause the video if you
wanna have a go at this.

00:00:29.758 --> 00:00:31.906
All right, now the way I'd
like to think about this,

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:33.508
let's just gonna table

00:00:33.508 --> 00:00:37.181
with values for t

00:00:37.181 --> 00:00:39.422
and our function P

00:00:39.422 --> 00:00:41.988
which is a function of t.

00:00:41.988 --> 00:00:43.729
For some values that we can just pull out

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:45.343
of the description here.

00:00:45.343 --> 00:00:48.442
So when t is zero, when
it's been zero weeks

00:00:48.442 --> 00:00:50.659
since Derek initially
sent the chain letter,

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:52.470
how many people have gotten it?

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.086
Well, they tell us.

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:55.268
He initially, Derek initially sent

00:00:55.268 --> 00:00:57.404
the chain letter to 40 friends.

00:00:57.404 --> 00:00:58.925
So t equals zero.

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:01.653
P of t or P of zero is 40.

00:01:01.653 --> 00:01:04.486
Now, what's an interesting time period?

00:01:04.486 --> 00:01:06.007
It says that the email,
the number of people

00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:08.491
who receive the email gains 9/10

00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:11.950
or increases by 9/10 every three weeks,

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.564
every three weeks.

00:01:13.564 --> 00:01:15.770
So after three weeks,

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.453
so three weeks have gone by.

00:01:17.453 --> 00:01:20.146
So I'm just adding three to t.

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:22.004
What is P of t going to be?

00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:25.321
Well, they tell us it's going
to gain 9/10 of its size.

00:01:25.321 --> 00:01:27.981
So it's going to be 40

00:01:27.981 --> 00:01:32.981
plus 9/10 times 40

00:01:33.183 --> 00:01:35.505
which is going to be equal to, what?

00:01:35.505 --> 00:01:37.741
Well, that's equal to 40.

00:01:37.741 --> 00:01:39.006
We factor out our 40.

00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:43.162
40 times one plus 9/10

00:01:43.162 --> 00:01:46.598
or you could say this
is equal to 40 times,

00:01:46.598 --> 00:01:51.184
whoops, 40 times 1.9.

00:01:51.184 --> 00:01:52.206
Another way of thinking about it,

00:01:52.206 --> 00:01:54.678
after three weeks, we've grown 90%.

00:01:54.678 --> 00:01:56.478
That's another way of saying
that the number of people

00:01:56.478 --> 00:01:59.568
who receive the email
gains 9/10 of its size.

00:01:59.568 --> 00:02:02.308
You could say the group of
people who receive the email

00:02:02.308 --> 00:02:06.303
grows 90% every three weeks.

00:02:06.303 --> 00:02:08.451
And so if we go another three weeks,

00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:09.856
so plus another three weeks,

00:02:09.856 --> 00:02:10.838
I could say, well, let me just write this,

00:02:10.838 --> 00:02:12.231
this is six weeks.

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:14.739
Well, how many people would
have received the email?

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.097
It was going to be this number.

00:02:16.097 --> 00:02:18.651
It's going to be grown another 90%.

00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:21.240
So we're gonna multiply
it times 1.9 again.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.691
So it's going to be 40

00:02:22.691 --> 00:02:26.116
times 1.9 times 1.9.

00:02:26.116 --> 00:02:28.252
We're gonna grow by another 9/10.

00:02:28.252 --> 00:02:30.817
Growing by 9/10 is the
same thing as multiplying

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:33.011
by one and 9/10.

00:02:33.011 --> 00:02:34.439
The one is what you already are.

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.517
Then you're growing by another 9/10.

00:02:36.517 --> 00:02:38.433
So this is the same thing as 40

00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:41.811
times 1.9 squared.

00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:44.690
We go another three weeks,

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:45.816
nine weeks.

00:02:45.816 --> 00:02:47.492
We're gonna grow another 90%.

00:02:47.492 --> 00:02:48.955
So you're gonna multiply it by,

00:02:48.955 --> 00:02:50.092
you're gonna take this number

00:02:50.092 --> 00:02:51.938
and multiply by 1.9 again

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:55.851
which is going to be
1.9 to the third power.

00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:58.056
And so what's going on over here?

00:02:58.056 --> 00:02:59.751
Well, we can see some
exponential function.

00:02:59.751 --> 00:03:01.318
We have our initial value.

00:03:01.318 --> 00:03:03.849
And every three weeks,
we're multiplying by 1.9.

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.113
So 1.9 would be our common ratio.

00:03:06.113 --> 00:03:11.113
So we could say that P of t is
equal to our initial value 40

00:03:11.295 --> 00:03:14.309
times our common ratio 1.9.

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:18.438
And we multiply by 1.9 every three weeks.

00:03:18.438 --> 00:03:19.402
So we could just say,

00:03:19.402 --> 00:03:22.199
how many three week
periods have passed by?

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:25.357
Well, we will take t
and divide it by three.

00:03:25.357 --> 00:03:27.342
T divided by three is a
number of three week periods

00:03:27.342 --> 00:03:28.886
that have gone by.

00:03:28.886 --> 00:03:29.664
And there you have it.

00:03:29.664 --> 00:03:31.487
And notice, t equals zero,

00:03:31.487 --> 00:03:34.366
1.9 to the zeroth power is one

00:03:34.366 --> 00:03:35.759
so 40 times one.

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:39.485
T equals three, that's gonna
be 1.9 to the first power,

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:40.600
three over three.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.943
And so we're gonna grow by
90% and so on and so forth.

00:03:43.943 --> 00:03:46.376
So feeling pretty good about this.
