00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.540
By popular demand, it's Mars Needs Moms!

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.500
Yeah, sorry it took so long to get to these.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.900
We've kinda been busy with a few other things,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.500
but here I am and I finally saw one of Disney's biggest disappointments.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.720
The critical and box-office flop that actually destroyed Robert Zemeckis' motion capture company.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.700
Yep!  Remember Polar Express, Beowulf, Christmas Carol?

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.680
You're gonna see nothing like that anymore because this is the film that killed it.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.200
Some would say that's a shame, others would say "Thank God!"

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.480
because if they kept turning out films like this...

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.120
... Yeah.  It's not a big loss.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.100
The film is about a little boy who's having trouble getting along with his mother,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.780
only to discover she's being kidnapped by aliens and he follows along.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.120
They're taken to a planet that's ruled by females

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.720
who have absolutely no idea how to take care of children.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.560
Huh...  Then how did they survive all these years...

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.840
Okay, we'll get to all that.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.740
The boy comes across another guy who was taken hostage long ago,

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.500
and while he doesn't like what they do

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.140
He just sorta learns to accept it because he has no other choice.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.340
But the boy says he does have a choice and thus the two of them,

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.060
as well as an alien graffiti artist,

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.840
decide to change how Mars works,

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.560
fight the evil, repressive system,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.940
and stop all the mothers from being destroyed.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.520
Oh yeah.  When a mother's out use their usefulness,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.860
they just blow 'em up.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.880
And that gets to, kinda, the major problem of this movie.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.560
Okay, I know they always say, "Don't judge a movie by it's title",

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.220
But the title of this movie is, "Mars Needs Moms".

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.500
Okay, it's stupid, it's one of the worst titles for a movie ever,

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.380
but at least when you hear it, you get an idea of what you're going to get.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.960
Something playful, something goofy and colorful, kinda lighthearted.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.060
But no.  This is a really dark, miserable looking, even intense film!

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.500
There's a scene where one of the characters talks about about seeing his mother

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.820
actually get destroyed! Right in front of his eyes!

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.840
And it's told really slowly, and really dramatically

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.300
and all I can think to myself is...

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.180
*Mockingly* MARS NEEDS MOMS!

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.860
But that wouldn't really matter if the film was say, creative or charming or imaginative,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.840
and it's surprisingly not.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.100
I know the idea of this world is that it's suppose to be repressive and there isn't any color,

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.460
but come on.  Even for a repressive world, we've seen this a million times.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.460
It looks like Tron.  It looks like 1984.  It looks like The Matrix.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.060
It looks like all these movies we've seen with miserable worlds a bajillion times,

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.320
and it's just not interesting anymore.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.380
I guess the idea of a race run by females

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.580
and all the males are just kinda left in the garbage is kind of interesting,

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.820
but even then, I'm not sure what kind of commentary they're trying to get across.  If any!

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.060
Is this like a "Wicker Man" remake?

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.880
Is women taking over a good thing or a bad thing?

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.820
Or is it suppose to show ironically how, like how men treat women

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.720
or women treat men?  I don't know!

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.700
Maybe there is no commentary.  Maybe it's just the way this planet does things

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.640
and they just need an enemy to go after.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.800
And that's exactly what this film feels like.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.440
It feels like everything is there just so it can kind of be there.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.520
A kid travels to Mars because,

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.920
kids wanna travel to Mars!

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.780
They fight oppressive systems because

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.840
kids like fighting oppressive systems!

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.260
(Hey, look how much they argue with their parents)

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.260
We're gonna motion capture Seth Green as the little kid

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.960
even though he doesn't do any of the voice because...

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.520
We just kinda motion capture celebrities for some reason.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.320
At least with Tom Hanks and Jim Carrey, they were in the movie; they got to use their voices

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.660
But Seth Green?  I mean, he's a fine actor, but

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.140
did you absolutely "need" this guy in this role?

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.080
I can tell you that his addition doesn't add anything, nor any of the characters.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.560
Joan Cusack! She's one of my favorite actresses!

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.040
She is so funny and so entertaining yet,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.420
she's just there to kinda, be there.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.640
For a film about a kid who wants to go save his mother,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.080
they don't make this mother interesting at all.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.440
And it's such a shame to hear someone I know is so  uniquely fun

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.780
like Joan Cusack, just given nothing to work with.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.080
So I guess if you're just in a mood to say,

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.140
"Fight the power and the repressive... Whatevers"

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.480
as hey, those films do well sometimes

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.000
This one definitely doesn't make any sense but,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.240
I guess if you just wanna get that rebellious emotion out of your system?

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.700
But aside from that, I have no idea who would enjoy this film.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.240
It's not the worst, it's just dull.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.320
And when it's not dull, it's kind of unpleasant.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.200
And for movie called *mockingly* "Mars Needs Moms",

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.700
you wouldn't expect something so grim and depressing.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.540
In terms of at least seeing a yearly film with

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.720
motion capture that's gonna look like a really high budget production,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.800
they're pretty much extinct now.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.320
Again, it's hard to say this is a good thing or a bad thing,

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.240
but if they're anything like this film, I can say we definitely traded up.
