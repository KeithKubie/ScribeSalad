00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.420
We're on problem 4.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.840
Traditions Clothing Store
is having a sale.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.590
Shirts that were regularly
priced at $20

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.840
are on sale for $17.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.540
What is the percentage of
the decrease in the

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.110
price of the shirts?

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.680
So what is just the decrease
in the price of the shirts?

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.180
Well, they've gone
from $20 to $17.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.140
So the decrease is $3.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.440
We have a $3 decrease in the
price of the shirts.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.840
So what is the percentage
of decrease?

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.980
Well, we're starting at $20,
and we're decreasing by $3.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.360
So the percentage of the
decrease-- let me write it in

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.620
a darker color.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.280
We're starting at $20 and we're
decreasing it by $3, or

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.560
decreasing it by 3/20.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.100
This is the percent decrease,
or the fraction

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.120
decrease right there.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.960
And this is going to
be equal to what?

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.210
This is the same thing.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.350
We can divide it out.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.590
You might be able to do
that in your head.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.050
But just in case you
can't, let me just

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.110
write it out like this.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.650
If I divide 20 into 3, 20
does not go into 3.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.700
Or you could say 20 goes
into 3 zero times.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.800
0 times 20 is zero.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.150
And then I put a decimal
point right there.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.690
20 goes into 30-- maybe I should
have done this-- let me

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.420
do it over here.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.060
20 goes into 3 zero times.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.820
0 times 20 is 0.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.230
And then let me put a decimal
point like that.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.390
And then I'll do
3 minus that 0.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.270
So I'll just say you have
3.0, just like that.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.640
Maybe I shouldn't even
write the decimal.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.040
Maybe I'll write
a 30 like that.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.660
We have the decimal up here.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.310
20 goes into 30 one time.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.740
1 times 20 is 20.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.280
30 minus 20 is 10.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.360
And then bring down another
0, this 0 right there.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.360
And 20 goes into
100 five times.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.400
5 times 20 is 100.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.520
100 minus 100 is 0.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.720
So 3/20 can be rewritten
as 0.15.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.800
And another way you could think
about this is 3/20, is

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.840
the same thing-- if you multiply
the numerator and the

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.960
denominator by 5-- is the
same thing as 15/100.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.180
Right?

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.980
If I multiply the top and the
bottom by 5, which we can

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.180
always do, this is the
same thing as 15/100.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.880
So that's the way you could have
done that in your head,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.960
saying, oh, that's the
same thing as 0.15.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.360
And 0.15 expressed as
a percentage is 15%.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.360
So the correct answer is B.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.950
All right.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.050
Problem number 5.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.890
Which number equals 2 to
the minus fourth power?

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.290
So this is a little bit of
review of exponents.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.760
2 to the minus 4 is the same
thing as 1 over 2 to the

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.500
fourth power.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.780
That's all a negative
exponent does.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.630
It means 1 over essentially
the base to

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.210
the positive exponent.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.320
And this is just going to
be 1 over 2 times 2

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.550
times 2 times 2.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.210
And that's what?

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.110
2 times 2 is 4, times 2
is 8, times 2 is 16.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.660
So it's equal to 1/16.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.120
So that is choice C.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.110
Problem 6.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.130
What is 3/4 minus 1/6?

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.550
So whenever you add or subtract
fractions, you have

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.400
to find a common denominator.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.620
And a good common denominator
is the least common multiple

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.480
of these two guys, or the
smallest number that both of

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.600
these denominators go into.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.880
So the smallest number that both
of these denominators go

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.440
into is 12, right?

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.580
4 goes into 12 three times, and
6 goes into 12 two times.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.130
So let's rewrite these fractions
with 12 as a

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.910
denominator.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.730
So something over 12 minus
something over 12.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.940
So how do we rewrite 3/4
as something over 12?

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.520
Well, 4 goes into
12 three times.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.250
Or we could say 3
times 4 is 12.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.670
So 3 times 3 will be the
other numerator.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.550
You get 9/12.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.870
3/4 and 9/12 are the exact
same fraction.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.660
This is in kind of its simplest
form, when you

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.250
reduced the numerator
and denominator

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.260
as much as you can.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.680
But this is a completely
equivalent fraction.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.430
To go from there to there, you
just multiply the numerator

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.500
and the denominator by 3.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.970
3 times 3 is 9, 3
times 4 is 12.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.260
And the way you can think
about it, 4 goes

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.720
into 12 three times.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.410
So just multiply 3 times
that numerator.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.890
Let's do the same
thing with 1/6.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.540
6 goes into 12 two times.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.490
So to go from there to
there, we have to

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.310
multiply the 6 by 2.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.860
So to go from there to whatever
this numerator is, we

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.250
have to multiply that
numerator by 2.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.210
So you stick a 2 right there.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.800
And now that we have a common
denominator, this becomes a

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.700
simple problem to work out.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.550
It is equal to-- we have 9 out
of 12 pieces, minus 2 out of

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.890
12 pieces, or whatever
we're talking about.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:08.990
Or slices of pie.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.240
So that's going to
be equal to 7/12.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.680
And that is choice C.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.060
Next problem.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.563
Problem 7.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.830
Do it in blue again.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.360
A salesperson at a clothing
store earns a 2%

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.020
commission on all sales.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.260
How much commission does
the salesperson

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.780
earn on a $300 sale?

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.630
Well, they earn 2% on that.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.070
Or you could say 0.02
of the sale.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.650
So you could just multiply
300 times 0.02.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.220
This is kind of the
way to just do it.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.090
And I'll maybe give you a little
intuition on how you

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.970
could do this in your head if
you're constrained for time.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.600
But the easiest way to think
about it is just

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.590
multiply 2 times 300.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.330
Or 2 times 0 is 0.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.920
2 times 0 is 0, and
2 times 3 is 6.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:05.960
You could have done
that in your head.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.290
2 times 300 is 600.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.510
And then you worry about
the decimals.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.290
So we have two spaces behind
the decimal right here.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.570
Right?

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.160
We have one, two.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.420
So we're going to have to have
two spaces behind the decimal

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.670
in our answer.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.870
So the answer right
here is $6.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.490
And that is choice A.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.110
Now, a way you could have done
this in your head, you could

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.350
have said, look, he makes
a 2% commission.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.220
So for every $100,
he makes $2.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.700
Right?

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.650
2% is the same thing
as 2 out of 100.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.670
So every $100, he makes $2.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:47.030
He sold $300, so that would
also be 3 times

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.460
$2 per 100, or $6.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.010
Whatever is easier for you
to understand, that's

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.420
what you should do.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.140
Problem number 8.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.420
I'll do this in green.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:05.740
Some students attend school 180
of the 365 days in a year.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.920
About what part of the year
do they attend school?

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.870
And so the keyword here is
about, which tells me that

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.630
they don't want an
exact answer.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.040
They don't want me to sit
there-- I mean, if I wanted

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.500
to, they attend 180
out of 365 days.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.650
If I wanted the exact
percentage, I would have to

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:29.590
take 365 and divide it into 180,
with some decimals, and

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.970
I'll get some-- I could work
it out, just like I did the

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.200
decimal division in the past,
but it would take some time,

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.020
and they just want
to know about.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.550
So what's 180/365 roughly?

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.840
Well, what's 180 times 2?

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:49.190
You could say 180/360, and I
picked 360 because that's 180

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:53.880
times 2, that's equal to 50%.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.930
This is not that different
than this.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.610
We just have a small change
of the denominator, small

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.310
relative to how large
that denominator is.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:05.060
So the answer here is 50%.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.630
If they had a couple of other
choices here like 49% or 51%,

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:10.960
then you would have to
work this out in a

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.310
little bit more detail.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:17.510
But it's pretty clear
that 180/365 is

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.130
pretty close to 50%.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:23.100
It's nowhere near 18% or 75%,
so you can feel pretty good

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:23.790
about this answer.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.520
If 49% were one of the choices,
then I would have to

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.520
do a little bit more
arithmetic right

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.330
here with the division.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.250
Problem number 9.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.539
What is the value of 2 to the
sixth times 2 to the fourth,

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:39.750
divided by 2 to the fifth?

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.360
Now, you could solve each
of these powers.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.580
2 to the sixth is what?

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:48.430
It's 64.

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.650
You could work out each of
these exponents, and then

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.240
multiply them and then divide,
but it would take you forever.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.830
So what they really want you
to do here is use your

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.230
exponent rules.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.460
So when you multiply two
exponents and they have the

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.620
same base-- let me write
it this way.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.210
2 to the sixth times 2 to
the fourth, all of that

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.740
over 2 to the fifth.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.890
What's that equal to?

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:11.490
So let's just simplify the
numerator first. So I'll keep

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.300
the denominator the same.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:19.610
When you multiply two exponents
with the same base,

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.420
you essentially can just
add the exponents.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.920
So the same base is 2.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:29.270
So this is going to be equal to
2 to the 6 plus 4, or 2 to

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.810
the 10th power.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:34.840
Now, when you divide exponents
that have the same base, you

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.060
subtract the exponents.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:41.290
So this is going to be equal to
2 to the 10 minus 5 power,

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:45.140
which is equal to
2 to the fifth.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.040
And that's our answer.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.620
And we look at our choices, we
don't see 2 to the fifth.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.970
So we're actually going to
have to multiply it out.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:54.250
And so 2 to the fifth
is 2 times 2 times 2

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.880
times 2 times 2.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.670
2 times itself five times.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.560
That's what 2 to the
fifth means.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.140
So what is this?

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.780
2 times 2 is 4.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.720
4 times 2 is 8.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.650
8 times 2 is 16.

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:08.830
16 times 2 is 32.

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:10.930
So that is our answer.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:12.180
D.
