[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.630
JOAN HALIFAX: So I first want
to express a lot of gratitude

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.580
to Google.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:17.480
Actually, it's a wonderful
honor to be here because I

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.730
use your platforms daily.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.760
Although perhaps I should
go on a fast, a Google fast.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.230
But anyway, it enhances
my fastness in the world

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:38.300
because I'm able to access many,
not only facts, but also people

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.340
all over the world,
even in the most

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.090
remote parts of
the world, the most

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.810
remote parts of the Himalayas.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.640
I want to say a few things.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.080
One is I'm not up here to really
talk about end of life care.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.170
What I want to speak
about is an exploration

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.500
of compassion,
which is something

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.500
that I'm beginning to
understand in an initial way,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.520
but also I begin to see as the
most important human quality

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.240
that we are invited
to actualize today.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.980
And why do I say that?

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.310
Well, let me first recall
some words of His Holiness,

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.710
the Dalai Lama.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.390
His Holiness said,
"compassion is not a luxury.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.910
It is a necessity in order for
the human species to survive."

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.420
And I would suggest
that we're speaking

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.600
not only about our
species or His Holiness,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.550
we're speaking not
only about our species,

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.910
but really all
species on this Earth,

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:06.640
and that from my point of view,
having compassion instantiated

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.330
into the view and
values of Google

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:18.610
could be life-changing
for millions of people,

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.240
and also many, many species.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.040
But it's important to
understand what compassion is.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.900
And part of my curiosity
about compassion

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.260
comes from the work that
Karen was referring to,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.350
this work in end
of life care field,

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.010
but also the fact that I've
been involved in human rights

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.350
and justice issues
since the 1960s.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.460
I have the great honor of
serving in the Himalayas

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.140
in our nomads clinic working
with now thousands of people

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.580
in the most remote villages
in the high Himalayas

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.730
who have no access
to health care,

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.450
and also having worked as a
volunteer in the penitentiary

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.790
of New Mexico on death row in
maximum security for six years

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.880
and really learning
a lot, learning

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.330
a lot about how compassion
operates, and what it is,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.550
and also there's
a kind of deficit

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.700
of compassion in
our culture today

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.660
that is affecting everyone.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.320
Why?

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.920
Well, first, let me just
say, why compassion?

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.970
Very interesting research
in neuroscience and social

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.550
psychology suggests that
compassion is profoundly

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.510
enhancing of our
immune response.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.150
I know that's kind
of a challenge

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.530
to integrate that data point,
but it's extremely interesting

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.520
how beneficial compassion
is, not only in terms

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.020
of our immune response, but
also in terms of our longevity.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.910
And I'm thinking about the
story of Nicholas Winton, who

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.950
died at the age of 106,
who was a kind of money

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.370
guy, young guy in
the Second World War,

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.980
and who ended up in
Czechoslovakia on one mission,

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.770
but changed his mission
when he realized

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.870
that many children were going
to be taken to the camps.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.780
And he ended up liberating 669
children, saving their lives,

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.360
and not making
anything about it.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.300
He did it at great
risk, and it wasn't

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.600
until he was an elderly person
that his wife discovered

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.910
the records of what he had done
and actually told the BBC, who

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.420
secretly assembled
those survivors,

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.510
those people who had
grown up in England,

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.410
who'd been placed in
homes, who found their life

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.950
and livelihood.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.240
And I don't know if you've
seen the video, but you should.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.900
Every time I see it, I
just kind of choke up.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.240
With this old guy sitting there
in a BBC theater, a theater

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.760
about the size of this
theater, and the BBC moderator

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.120
introduces him to the woman
next to him, and said,

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.390
do you recognize her?

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.430
And he said, no.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.450
Said, well, you saved her life.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.690
And then he began to choke up.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.880
And then the moderator
said basically,

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.950
anyone whose life was
saved by Nicholas Winton,

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.630
will you please stand up?

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.925
And the whole theater,
everyone in the theater stood.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.510
Very powerful.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:55.510
Because a person who
does such a selfless act

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.740
and seeks no
outside recognition,

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.390
but recognizes within
themselves the imperative

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:09.520
to serve others and lives
within those principles

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.830
modestly, and in
a way, secretly,

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.840
is an extraordinary
example to us.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.310
I wanted to understand
compassion better.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:31.390
I've worked in medical systems
literally all over the world.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:38.560
I've also had the experience of
having compassion well up in me

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:45.760
and break my life open in a good
way to the truth of suffering,

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.780
and also the possibility
to transform suffering,

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.020
and to realize that
I, as a person who

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.890
was born in the
early 1940s, feel

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:01.960
that imperative on a daily
basis, what can I do to serve?

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.140
What can I do to end suffering?

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:11.170
How to keep myself viable to
meet the truth of suffering

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:12.720
in this world.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.030
So I was so fortunate
to be appointed

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.190
as a distinguished
visiting scholar

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.320
at the Library of Congress.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.010
And in the course of
my time at the library,

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.530
I began to map out compassion.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.300
Because I realized
that, first of all,

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.490
even though neuroscience and
social psychology, the research

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.400
being done in these
areas indicates

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.080
the great benefits of compassion
not only to those whom

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.750
are served, but those
who experience it

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:48.070
and to society in general,
but also that compassion

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:52.810
is in a way, challenged
in our society right now,

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.530
and that it's
difficult for actually

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.720
train people in compassion.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.130
Not as an acquired skill, but to
actually create the conditions

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:08.470
where compassion is an emergent
process in our subjectivity.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.440
And so I sat in the
Library of Congress

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.520
and began to look at compassion
from many points of view.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.410
And I recognized that
compassion is not

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:25.060
possible without
attentional balance.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.740
This is really critical.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.160
Our capacity to
actually look deeply

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.150
into what is happening
in the present moment

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:40.059
necessitates that we are able
to be very grounded and not

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:45.820
divided in our attention, not
dispersed in our attention,

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.800
nor distracted.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.920
And just that is the kind
of first base, if you will.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.430
I mean, in a world where
our technology is actually

00:08:55.430 --> 00:09:01.010
designed, interestingly enough,
not necessarily to enhance

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:05.750
focused attention, but
actually to ungrounded us

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.580
so that our
consciousness can be,

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.100
if you will,
inhabit or colonized

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.550
by messages which
aren't necessarily

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:18.170
benefiting us or others.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:21.100
So the cultivation of
attentional balance

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.090
is really critical so that
we have high resolution

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:29.320
of perception, that we're
able to also sustain

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.470
our attention on any
given object, including

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:38.620
our own subjective experience,
for more than a moment.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:44.400
It's really hard to put
aside our brain prosthesis.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.070
Because we are,
in a certain way--

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:54.390
these technological devices
have been so deeply insinuated

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:57.180
into my life, and
also I think the lives

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:03.990
of most of us in this room and
who are listening to this talk,

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:08.070
but how do we actually
have the capacity

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:13.590
to allocate our attention to
an individual or to a situation

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:17.930
without leaving,
abandoning that moment?

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:21.650
So being grounded and
cultivating attentional balance

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:23.970
is essential.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.450
It's also essential to
be pro-social in a way

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:32.150
to lift out of the negative
narratives that inhabit us.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:36.510
And prosociality is the
opposite of antisocial.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:41.180
So it's very powerful
to engage in practices

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:45.830
that actually nourish
beneficial qualities within us.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:54.040
It's also essential to have a
motivational foundation which

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:58.000
is unselfish, which
is ethical, which

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.300
is about non-harming,
which is engaged

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:06.670
in a process of constantly
inviting us to deconstruct

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:10.720
our fear and open up
to the world in a way

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:16.750
where we're in this beneficial,
non-separate, non-objectifying

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.810
relationship with
so-called others,

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:24.880
and to actually develop
the capacity to expand

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.990
our subjectivity to include
the experience of others

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:32.440
in a way that is healthy.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:37.000
It's also essential in terms
of compassion to have insight.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.130
Not only insight at the level of
a metacognitive capacity, which

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.860
is to stand outside
of our experience,

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.590
to see the truth
of impermanence,

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:52.390
to understand that all beings
are really aspiring to be

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:56.110
happy, even the most deluded
ones and the most politically

00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:01.780
confused ones, but also
that we, on one level,

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.660
are very connected
to that person

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:08.110
across from us, the dying
person, the prisoner,

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:11.920
our child, our
teacher, our boss,

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.080
but also we are not that person.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.910
So the distinction
between self and other,

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:21.520
understanding that
distinction is

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.710
critical in terms of us
being able to regulate

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.800
our experience of
resonance with whatever is

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.690
arising in the present moment.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.420
So the map grew.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:41.710
And it, I think, has
been of help to others.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:45.730
People in the neuroscience
and social psychology research

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.480
world, but also it's been very
helpful in terms of developing

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.250
training protocols.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:55.480
And I developed a very
simple one called GRACE,

00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:01.120
which I can just share briefly
here, which many clinicians--

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.530
and actually, there's a National
GRACE Organization in Japan

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:05.680
now--

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:11.680
many clinicians use, and I'll
just give you the shortcut.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:18.300
The G of GRACE is
gathering your attention.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.830
How do you really get
grounded in this moment?

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:28.070
The R of GRACE is
recalling your intention.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:32.760
What is our motivation
for any given action?

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.150
The A of GRACE is
attuning to oneself,

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:41.550
to one's own subjectivity,
to our somatic experience,

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:46.050
to our emotional experience,
and to the actual cognitive

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:51.420
experience that we have
before we attune to others.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.500
So once you understand
the protocol,

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.940
it's a lived in
act of compassion.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.860
It happens in an instant.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:03.400
You can really assay your
subjectivity physically,

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.590
emotionally, and cognitively
before you actually

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:11.700
include the experience of
others into your subjectivity,

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.860
engage in empathy.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.590
So this is other attunement.

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:22.280
Attuning first to yourself,
and then attuning to the other.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:26.840
And then from that base,
the C of GRACE, which is

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:31.000
consider what will really serve.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.890
And then the E of GRACE
is engage and end.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.080
Ending is really important.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:44.020
So this is a tool that
many clinicians are using

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.520
and educators at this time.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.120
And actually, it's just great if
you're a parent or a colleague.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:54.280
It just has a way of grounding
you, remembering who you really

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.830
are, attuning to
your own situation

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:58.960
before you include
others into it

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.570
and getting grounded,
and so forth.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:07.490
So in the process of
working on this project,

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:15.840
I began to consider how
the absence of compassion,

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.510
the absence of
attentional balance,

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:21.630
the absence of
emotional balance,

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:26.400
the lack of capacity to tune
into one's own subjectivity,

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:31.320
the inability to be in
resonance with others, and also

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:39.090
how fast the reaction time often
is at great cost in the end,

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:43.920
or how fear inhibits
us from acting.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.480
And over many decades,
literally thousands

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.030
of people in end
of life care field,

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:53.660
educators, people involved in
corporations in the business

00:15:53.660 --> 00:16:00.050
world, parents, practitioners
have shared with me

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.870
the challenges that
they've experienced

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.820
in meeting suffering.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:08.150
And by the way, I'm
not just speaking

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:11.630
about the kind of dramatic
suffering that, for example,

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.790
I in end of life care
field would encounter.

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.450
I'm speaking about the kind
of day-to-day suffering

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:22.010
that you would encounter as
you meet with colleagues who

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:26.750
are super upregulated or
very depressed or angry,

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:31.070
or with a parent
whose child has died

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:34.870
or whose child is extremely ill.

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.390
And I began to
realize, actually,

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:40.990
I suffered in the same way
as those who were sharing

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:43.630
their difficulties with me.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:47.470
And I located, if you
will, five geographies

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:51.940
in the ecosystem
of our subjectivity

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.960
that are really
extraordinary capacities

00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:00.610
within our human
experience, without which

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:05.800
we would be deeply
challenged as individuals,

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.290
and as a social body,
and as a body that

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:12.250
lives within the
environment on this Earth.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:18.310
And those five capacities were--
interestingly enough for me--

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:26.170
capacities which had a deeply
challenged shadow aspect.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:29.030
And they're capacities
which we value,

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:33.700
but we often don't realize
that they can make us ill.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.640
They can be great hindrances.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.340
And this is actually what
I outlined in the book.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.770
I call them edge states.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:49.090
Because they are ecologies that
include healthy manifestations,

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:54.460
but also they're ecologies
that include unhealthy aspects.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:59.640
And it's very important for us
to realize this vision of edge

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.520
states that falling
over the edge

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.880
isn't necessarily a
terminal condition,

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.210
that actually climbing back
onto the high edge of any

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:15.470
of these qualities produces
potentially a lot of strength,

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.390
a lot of character.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:20.020
But it's important to
also have the ability

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:23.470
to stand on the high edge
of any of these capacities,

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:28.870
to see the entire landscape
of the toxic aspect,

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:33.400
or aspects in the
challenged aspects.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:39.390
So the first edge that I
looked at was altruism.

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:42.300
Nicholas Winton
was a great example

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:47.940
of an altruist, someone
who felt the imperative.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.840
Just as [? Chante ?] Davis
says, you step on a thorn,

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:56.130
and the hand doesn't sort
of ask the foot permission

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:57.960
to remove the thorn.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:02.310
The hand goes immediately to the
foot and pulls the thorn out.

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:05.400
It's this kind of
seamlessness of response.

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:14.040
I read in "The New York Times"
a very interesting story

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.370
about a man called
Wesley Autrey.

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:20.610
And Wesley Autrey was
an Afro-American man

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:24.300
who was standing on a
subway platform with his two

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.160
daughters, and
there were probably

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:31.650
100 people on that subway
platform along with him.

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:35.760
And all of a sudden, a young
white guy had a seizure

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.870
and fell into the subway tracks.

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:43.260
And as this young guy
was having the seizure,

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:49.570
Wesley Autrey saw the
oncoming subway, jumped off

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:52.980
of the subway platform, leaving
his two little girls who

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:57.390
were standing right beside him
there on the subway platform,

00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:03.420
got on top of this young
guy, and he realized

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:07.490
that if he wasn't able
to hold this guy down,

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:10.140
and he certainly
wasn't able to drag him

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:15.930
off the tracks in time, that he
and this young guy would die.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:19.920
And he held this seizing
young man down on the tracks,

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:25.800
and the subway passed over his
head, grazing his knit cap.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:30.150
And he was hailed as
an incredible hero,

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:34.230
and it was a decision
that was like that.

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:38.250
He didn't say, well,
my military background

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:40.470
is giving me the
capacity to do this,

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:43.840
and I'll be a big deal
in "The New York Times"

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.540
and lauded as a hero.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.240
He just went for it.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:54.760
Now the shadow
side of altruism is

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.770
called pathological altruism.

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:01.140
And pathological
altruism is that we

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:06.270
engage in an action of service
toward others, or another,

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:10.800
or toward an institution,
or toward a country which

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:16.080
endeavors to be beneficial,
but that that act of altruism

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:20.580
actually causes harm to
ourselves, to those who we're

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.970
endeavoring to serve,
to the institution

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:28.530
that we perhaps are part of,
to the institution that we're

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:31.750
trying to serve, or to the
country that we're serving.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.800
So a good example of
pathological altruism

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.920
is what happened in Haiti.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:42.810
Very interesting, this notion
of pathological altruism.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.630
And also what is
so fascinating is

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:51.960
how tenuous that line is between
altruism and pathological

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.370
altruism.

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:57.210
Because if you take the
example of Wesley Autrey,

00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:07.280
a very selfless, dramatic act,
unprecedented in a certain way,

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.910
no preconception, just a leap.

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:14.660
If the train, the
subway had killed him

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:19.250
and also killed
Autrey, he probably

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:23.670
would have been deemed
a pathological altruist.

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:25.920
So it's very fascinating.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:33.150
We just-- the line is
fragile, to say the least.

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:35.730
There's a big grey area.

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:41.070
But it's also a very
important quality for us

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:42.990
to examine deeply.

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:46.860
Because just as the
case of Nicholas Winton

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:50.760
and of Wesley Autrey,
both of these people

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:54.960
acted not selfishly,
but from a perspective

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.440
of complete unselfishness
in this very

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.960
seamless, unfiltered way.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.350
And this is, if you will,
one of the qualities

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.120
or aspects of altruism.

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:18.100
The second quality
that I jumped into,

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:21.920
I heard so much about
it over the years.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:26.260
In fact, interestingly enough,
I was in a conversation

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:30.790
a few days ago with
a young Indian man

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:36.520
who's a Zen practitioner who
is a specialist at AI who

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.460
said that he can hardly
turn on the news he's

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:48.330
so overwhelmed in
accessing the news today.

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:51.100
And he had my book and
asked me to sign it.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:54.450
He said, you know, I'm
beginning to understand

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:59.040
something about empathy
from what you've written.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:05.610
So empathy is that experience of
somatic emotional or affective

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:10.470
resonance, as well as cognitive
resonance with another.

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:13.470
We can be somatically
attuned, for example,

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:17.550
and not being necessarily
in resonance emotionally

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:20.340
and cognitively, but
we can have all three

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:23.760
of our perceiving
mechanisms engaged,

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.730
our sensing mechanisms engaged.

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:29.940
It's that experience where
our subjectivity begins

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.570
to drop away in terms
of the small self,

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:38.340
and we practice a kind
of increasing inclusivity

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:43.050
which is really important from
the point of view of meditation

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:43.590
practice.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:48.460
Because fundamentally,
our realization

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.370
in meditation practice,
the sort of sign of it

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:54.460
is that we recognize
that we're deeply

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:59.790
interconnected with
all beings and things.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:04.830
But when we're so connected
with all beings and things, when

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:10.560
we, for example, over-identify
with the dying patient,

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.820
or with our boss who
might be angry at us,

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:19.500
or our child who is acting
out, or a colleague who

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.290
has experienced
profound loss, it

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:25.260
becomes a very
difficult situation

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:29.040
where we can experience
secondary trauma.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:34.380
And I have to say, that
young guy in the AI world

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.770
that I talked to, or who
talked to me a few days ago,

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:44.540
I have to titrate my
consumption of news too.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:50.360
Because I notice if I
take in too much bad news,

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.000
I begin to shut down.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.550
I begin to go numb.

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:59.540
But it's very
important to understand

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:06.200
where your boundaries are,
what serves your awakening.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:14.350
When one over-identifies
with, for example,

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:20.770
the Fuhrer in Nazi
Germany, where you--

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:24.220
it's not just with the
ordinary kind of suffering,

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:29.920
but it's also, for example, in
cults, or views, or even inside

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.980
of a corporate
system, and you begin

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:38.110
to lose your own moral compass,
the principles by which you're

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:39.190
living.

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:42.430
Even a corporation
can be a kind of cult,

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:49.490
if you will, where
diversity is not condoned,

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:53.670
where it's looked on as
a threat to identity.

00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:56.720
That's why I'm so glad to see so
many different colors of seats

00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:01.490
here, and also just a feeling
of diversity in this community

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:03.240
here.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.410
But when that
experience of arousal

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:10.880
happens in connection with
the experience of others,

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.100
and if that
experience of arousal

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:18.080
is not regulated, either from a
bottom up perspective, that is,

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:22.250
the perspective of a kind
of natural regulation

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:26.000
that happens to keep us
from moving into overwhelm,

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.390
or a top down regulation where
we can, sensing into our body,

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:34.790
recognize the signals
that are coming up

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:38.180
from this amazing
organism that is

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:43.340
a repository of an enormous
amount of information

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:48.410
that we're often dissociated
from as we are attending

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:52.170
to our digital
device, for example,

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:56.880
where we lose touch
with the messages coming

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:01.820
from the body telling us, oh,
I have a lot of fear coming up.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.220
I can feel it in my diaphragm.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.800
I can feel the
tension in my legs.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.930
I know I'm violating
my integrity.

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:13.160
I feel my guts are squeezing.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.170
My heart rate is increasing.

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:19.940
Or I'm witnessing suffering,
and I have a vasovagal moment

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.460
where I'm about to pass out.

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:25.050
If we're not able to
regulate ourselves,

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:27.800
we can be traumatized.

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:32.330
We can move into the
experience of distress.

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:37.410
And this is one of the reasons
why practice is so important.

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:40.560
It's not about
disassociating from the body.

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:44.000
It's actually being in this
experience of embodiment

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.350
so that we can sense into
our visceral processes

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:51.410
and receive the information
that's coming up

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:55.070
from the body about
what kind of response

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:59.210
we're experiencing in relation
to external events, or even

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:00.460
internal processes.

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:07.200
So this is called
empathic distress

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.940
and empathic over-arousal.

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:12.015
It is the shadow
side of empathy.

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:22.000
The next ecology that I
looked at with great interest

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.870
was that of integrity.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:29.600
We can ask what we
mean by integrity,

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.120
and from my point
of view, integrity

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:36.570
has to do with nonviolence
and non-harming.

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:41.460
How do we actually nurture
integrity in a world

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:47.520
where there is so much
violence, such deep dissociation

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:52.440
from this planet Earth,
where war is the norm,

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.660
and where violence
is being fed to us

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.920
through the media constantly?

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.040
And I looked at the
shadow side of integrity

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:05.900
and saw there are basically
four valences to what I've

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.600
termed moral suffering.

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.850
And by moral
suffering, I'm talking

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:15.470
about that feeling of
trespass that many of us

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:19.160
experience when we engage
directly or indirectly

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.210
in behaviors that are harmful.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:26.300
And they include four
different expressions.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:32.190
And one of those expressions
is called moral distress.

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:36.210
And it's when you see a
situation where there is

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:42.810
a violation of values, of
principles, of beneficence,

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:48.650
you see a way through, but
you cannot actualize it.

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:50.840
Moral distress.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:55.520
Moral injury, which
is well-documented

00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:02.910
in the military, but also, we
see it in education, medicine,

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:06.150
and in big corporations as well.

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:09.620
And this is when you
are in a system that

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:12.770
is causing harm to others.

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:16.430
You either are part of it
or you're witnessing it,

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:20.510
and you feel shame
and self-blame.

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:21.440
Moral injury.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:29.690
The third aspect is
called moral outrage.

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:34.070
And I have a bit more of a
predisposition toward that.

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:36.290
I have some toward
more moral injury

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:39.110
and some toward
moral distress too,

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:41.900
but it is the sense
of anger and disgust

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:47.330
that arises when you perceive,
external to yourself,

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:49.620
acts that harm.

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:52.080
And it can be chronic.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:56.100
There are many of my
friends and I kind of--

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.600
I don't think I'm
chronically in it,

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.860
but I kind of know
it pretty well.

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:05.120
The sense, just looking at
our political landscape,

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:10.010
feeling moral outrage, or
looking at war in the world

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:13.010
and feeling a sense
of moral outrage.

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:15.330
And the shaming and
blaming, of course,

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:20.890
is expressed outwardly
toward others.

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:28.190
And then the fourth one
is called moral apathy.

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:31.910
And actually, I didn't even
think about moral apathy

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:36.140
at all, because I'm in
the bubble of my world,

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:40.950
until I went to see
"I'm not your Negro",

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:44.610
And I heard the
term moral apathy,

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:47.610
and I was like, that's it.

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:55.350
It is when we live in a bubble
of privilege, or of addiction,

00:32:55.350 --> 00:33:00.800
or denial, or fear
that disallows us

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:04.940
from seeing what really
is going on at the systems

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:09.850
level in our surround.

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:12.290
Where we have turned
away, if you will,

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:15.590
from the truth of suffering.

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:18.960
And I know recently, I was
flying internationally,

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.180
and I had this--

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:28.060
going through the airport
as a privileged Anglo-Saxon

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:33.810
Protestant Zen person,
and I saw a woman

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:37.950
in a burqa coming up beside me.

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:44.590
And I realized she was in a
much more vulnerable position

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:50.590
than I. And I had this
flash about the privilege

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:55.840
that I enjoy, and also
of compassion for anyone

00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:00.580
whose identity puts them
on the margin of what

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:05.130
appears to be socially
and psychologically safe.

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:08.580
And I remember just
I did this thing--

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:10.290
I mean, she probably
thought I was crazy.

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:14.580
But I put my hands together and
made a little bow to her just

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:21.489
to make that connection
in that moment.

00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:23.710
Integrity.

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:27.580
The fourth edge state
that I've written about

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:30.730
is in relation to respect.

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:37.210
And it's when we hold really,
all beings in equal regard.

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:42.240
And I had when I was working in
the penitentiary of New Mexico

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:47.980
a really deep experience of
walking into a system that

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:51.670
is characterized by
a lot of violence,

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:56.020
of working inside as a
volunteer for six years

00:34:56.020 --> 00:35:00.720
with men in maximum
security in death row.

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:03.840
And it was such a
wake up call for me,

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:08.220
because I walked into that
system with a lot of judgments.

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:13.170
And actually, what I
learned from being inside

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:17.070
was these are human beings.

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:20.740
They've caused immense
suffering to others.

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.940
It was not a matter
of me being in a kind

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:28.320
of romantic
atmosphere internally

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:33.450
about the truth of suffering
in a very violent, rage-filled

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:37.710
penitentiary system, but it
was developing the capacity

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:43.390
to see the truth of a
particular kind of suffering.

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:47.920
Per individual, every individual
had a different narrative.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:52.520
Some of the narratives were
really horrifying to consider.

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:54.940
But at the same time,
to recognize that

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:58.750
beneath the narrative,
beneath the actions

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:02.320
of any one of those
individuals was a human being.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:06.310
No matter that they
had raped and killed

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:09.940
children, or their
parents, or strangers,

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:13.070
there was a human
being under there.

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:15.370
And part of the
work was to actually

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:19.090
hold the truth of the
narrative, as constructed

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:23.560
as it was, and also the truth
that maybe not this lifetime,

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.200
but maybe in some
lifetime, this one will be

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:29.170
liberated from their delusion.

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:33.970
So I learned so much
working inside that system.

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:37.750
But that system, our
corrections system,

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:41.830
is actually a kind
of ground engendering

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:45.080
phenomenal disrespect.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:48.610
And I began also to look
at respect and disrespect

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:52.690
in medicine, particularly
after a student of mine,

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:56.860
who was a nurse, did a thesis
at our chaplaincy training

00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:01.120
on what is termed
horizontal hostility.

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:06.710
And this is behaviors of
disrespect between peers.

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:11.740
Bullying, disparagement,
third party communication,

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:14.590
dissing and so forth.

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:21.120
And what she brought my
attention to is that 15% to 20%

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:25.650
of nurses actually leave the
nursing profession because

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:30.810
of having been bullied, and
just being unable to sustain it.

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:35.070
And it's interesting to
look at that in relation,

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:40.240
for example, to the
culture here at Google,

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:44.480
or the culture in any
corporation around gender,

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:49.580
for example, around
race, ethnicity,

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:53.720
around religion
view, around height.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:57.800
I can say as a short
woman, sometimes

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:02.810
I'm actually treated more
like a pet than a person.

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:06.970
And you can imagine that does--

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:08.420
that's right, moral outrage.

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:11.360
That does nothing for
me or the other person.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:16.130
I try to do my best to
help set things straight,

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:18.920
needless to say.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:22.040
So horizontal
hostility is actually

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:25.060
rampant in our culture.

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:29.950
And it's a complement,
so to speak,

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:35.290
in the world of verticality is
called vertical violence, which

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:37.660
can happen in a top down way.

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.210
And certainly, we
see it in terms of--

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:43.030
well, you see horizontal
hostility, for example,

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:47.620
in the political arena, of how
candidates treat each other

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:49.510
and speak about
each other, and it's

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:54.220
kind of horrifying for
our children to witness.

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:56.200
But you also see
vertical violence

00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:02.530
in terms of the disrespect
that our politicians

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:07.870
engage in in relation to people
who are differently abled,

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:12.250
or from other cultures,
other societies.

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:17.440
There is also a bottom
up vertical violence,

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.140
where people who are
less empowered, less

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:25.510
acknowledged actually
manifest dramatic disrespect

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:29.180
toward those who are in power.

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:32.430
So part of the work
is how do we actually

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:37.080
come into this
experience of recognizing

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:42.090
our fundamental humanity in
relation to others, all others?

00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:47.040
And respect is something that
is about holding all beings

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:50.610
and things, including all
species on this Earth,

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:54.550
in equal regard.

00:39:54.550 --> 00:40:02.780
The final piece that I looked
at was burnout and engagement.

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:08.090
Our capacity to
engage in a vocation,

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:13.530
in work that is meaningful
is really important.

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:19.970
Our workplaces also have to
be nontoxic in order for us

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:21.770
to survive.

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:24.230
And we also have to
have good agreements

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:27.650
with our places of employment.

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:29.060
Engagement is essential.

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:32.870
A sense of enthusiasm, of
dedication, having work

00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:36.140
that is about benefiting
others and working

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:39.780
in healthy environments
is really essential.

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:42.470
And by the same
token, what happens

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:48.410
when those aspects are not
part of our work environment.

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:50.780
The outcome, of
course, is burnout.

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.840
We become completely exhausted.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:57.950
So I do a big thing on burnout.

00:40:57.950 --> 00:41:01.280
So we can look at our experience
in an interesting way,

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:04.010
because whether we're
in the human rights

00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:07.490
field or the health
care field, all of us

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:12.140
have, in one way or another,
fallen over the edge.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:17.570
And one of the principles
operating in this work

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:22.260
is how powerful it is not
just to fall over the edge

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:27.840
and to encounter failure
and to be traumatized,

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:33.380
but also the repair process that
actually builds character, that

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:37.160
enhances our
resilience, that deepens

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:41.510
our sense of flourishing,
that gives us deeper meaning.

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:43.250
It's really important.

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:49.340
And I said at another Silicon
Valley company yesterday,

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:54.920
it is important to
actually include failure

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:58.460
into the equation of success.

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:01.910
We know from the point
of view of living systems

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:08.390
that systems that break down
and learn from the breakdown

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:13.550
can reorganize themselves at
a much higher and more robust

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:15.050
level.

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:18.650
And robust is the
key here, robustness.

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:22.220
Our capacity to
actually encounter

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:27.920
incredible difficulties,
loss, sorrow, failure,

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:32.810
and to use that
experience as a way

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:38.690
to engender, not only humility,
but to engender wisdom.

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:45.960
The capacity to see deeply
into who we really are.

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:49.670
So I ask myself, what
was the kind of pivot?

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:54.680
How do we actually work the
edge of these edge states?

00:42:54.680 --> 00:43:00.290
And I realized that the most
important thing that we can do

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:04.730
is to actualize compassion,
because compassion gives you

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:09.530
the attentional balance,
emotional balance, and insight

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:14.090
that allows you to transform
even the experiences that have

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:19.280
caused us distress, have
caused us the most suffering

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:22.710
into qualities of strength.

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:25.590
So what I'd love
to do in finishing

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:29.940
this short presentation
is to open up

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.100
for questions or comments.

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:37.890
I'd be really happy to hear
more from you than from me.

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:40.050
AUDIENCE: Always good
to see you [INAUDIBLE]..

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:43.050
So you talked of
attentional imbalance.

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:45.690
And most of us,
all of us here are

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:50.280
engaged in making very useful
pieces of technology that

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:52.510
has really done a
lot for the world,

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:55.860
including democratizing
information

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:57.510
and enabling compassion.

00:43:57.510 --> 00:44:00.840
And yet, I often
feel guilty that I'm

00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:05.500
the drug dealer making more
weapons of mass destruction.

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:06.840
How do we reconcile the two?

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.210
How do you find peace in that?

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:11.490
JOAN HALIFAX: Well, I'm so
grateful you feel guilty.

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:14.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:19.050
So in your situation, a
little moral suffering

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:21.240
could go a long way.

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.860
Yeah, I mean, you
just don't want

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:27.930
to sit there numb and not aware
of the potential consequences

00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:31.260
of what you're doing in
this corporation, both

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:33.840
to benefit, and to harm.

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.200
And I think one of the facet--

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:39.930
so I've sort of painted
a kind of grim picture

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:41.560
of the human species.

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:44.610
But I think one of the really
incredible things that's

00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:50.700
happening today is how
many extraordinary people

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:53.850
and projects are out
there on the landscape,

00:44:53.850 --> 00:45:00.000
and I'm sure inside the
Googleplex that are directed

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.530
toward benefiting others.

00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:05.280
There's so much
that is happening

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:10.990
that is really upholding
the best of our humanity.

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:16.500
And it's also, as
you say, I think

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:20.700
I was a little bit of an
early adopter, so to speak,

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:25.680
in the early 90s,
getting technology

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:28.450
as a good ally in my life.

00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:31.650
And I also am sensitive to
what you're talking about.

00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:34.170
The fact that our
attentional ground

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:40.110
has been completely fragmented
by our technology, allowing for

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:42.210
means to actually
enter our psyche

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:45.000
and colonize us that
are unwholesome.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.540
So part of it has to do
with self-determination.

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:52.620
That is, somehow creating
the conditions where

00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:55.950
I as an individual, you as
an individual, all of you

00:45:55.950 --> 00:46:02.880
individuals value and
instantiate within others

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.970
the importance of
actual, if you will,

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:10.200
top down control of these
addictive tendencies

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.340
in relation to our technology.

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:15.220
And I think that's happening.

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:18.740
I think that I remember--

00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:21.330
what is the name of that?

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:22.656
Zenga.

00:46:22.656 --> 00:46:25.740
I remember a conversation I
had with one of the founders

00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:29.640
of Zenga who said, he was like,
"Farmville", are you kidding?

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:31.110
Now it's like really out there.

00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:33.840
There's all these
alternate realities

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:36.480
that people are plugged
into that actually you

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:41.460
have to buy tokens for to create
a kind of bigger power base

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:43.170
and so forth.

00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:47.610
I feel like we
should also create,

00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:53.730
if you will, tokens of goodness,
not just that kind of power.

00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:55.230
And I think we have
a chance to work

00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:58.980
in a very creative
way in shaping

00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:03.030
what is happening in our
future in a positive direction.

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:07.400
And I'll say from working in
Nepal, which a few years ago, I

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:08.950
don't know if this
is still the case,

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:14.310
but was determined to be the
second poorest country in Asia

00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:19.740
after Afghanistan, and I'm
very sensitive to the effects

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:23.160
of technology, both
in the positive sense

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:26.570
and the negative sense,
on Nepali people,

00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:29.280
high Himalayan people.

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:33.210
Technology allows for greater
connectivity, more information,

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:35.440
better health care.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:39.690
It also helps them document the
beauty of their cultures, which

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:41.880
are quickly disappearing
at the same rate

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:44.430
that the glaciers are melting.

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:47.760
It allows them to
access language in a way

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:51.360
that they could never
access up until that point.

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:54.570
It gives them access to
education in a way that

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:56.640
was never possible.

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:59.750
But also the
downside is the sort

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:03.090
of deeper strains of those
Himalayan cultures are

00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:06.540
being negatively
affected by technology.

00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:10.470
How do we reappraise,
if you will,

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:14.460
the value of cultural
diversity and the importance

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:18.060
of cultural identity in a
world where tribalization

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:21.490
is often negative?

00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:24.710
And I think that technology
can play an important part

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:25.970
in that regard.

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:29.690
And I'm counting on
you guys to do it.

00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:34.156
So good for you for
your moral suffering.

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:38.920
Yeah?

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:39.830
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:39.830 --> 00:48:44.300
I've read a little bit recently
about compassion fatigue, which

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:47.210
is something professional
caregivers spend

00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:49.580
so much of their
energy helping others

00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:53.430
that they find that they don't
have any left for friends

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.930
and family.

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:56.580
And in my last
relationship, I was

00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:00.180
very much on the receiving end
of that, which was very hard.

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:04.590
I'm a nurse who worked in
Nepal after the earthquake.

00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:07.620
JOAN HALIFAX: A nurse who worked
in Nepal after the earthquake.

00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:08.120
Daniel.

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:11.290
The question Daniel asked
is very interesting.

00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:16.110
It was about the
challenges associated

00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:18.850
with so-called
compassion fatigue.

00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:22.470
So I think Richie
Davidson, [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:24.540
and I agree on many
things, including

00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:27.930
the fact there's no such
thing as compassion fatigue.

00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:28.780
Yeah.

00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:31.770
What actually one
is experiencing

00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:34.390
is empathic distress.

00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:38.880
And it's created a problem
inside health systems

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:42.510
where the word or the
term compassion fatigue

00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:46.710
has been used, and
so it's conduced

00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:50.130
to a situation of suspicion
toward the experience

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:51.810
of compassion.

00:49:51.810 --> 00:49:54.570
So when we're in this
kind of resonance

00:49:54.570 --> 00:50:00.570
with others and over-identified,
we can be easily overwhelmed.

00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:03.030
But compassion as
I described it,

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:08.130
as composing or comprised
of attentional balance,

00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:11.370
emotional balance,
inside an embodiment,

00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:13.530
it does not fatigue you.

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:18.120
And what the fascinating
research done by Davidson,

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:20.910
and Lutz, and Chuck
Raison, and Tanya Singer,

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:23.490
and a number of
other neuroscientists

00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:26.340
and social psychologists
have given us

00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:30.870
a good view that compassion
actually enhances

00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:37.680
resilience, enhances immune
response, enhances longevity.

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.780
It's morally elevating.

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:43.440
And when we don't
respond compassionately,

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:46.230
we feel morally compromised.

00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:49.360
As well, it's contagious.

00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:53.160
So when you see someone
out in the world doing

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:57.930
a good thing, like for example,
Nicholas Winton or Wesley

00:50:57.930 --> 00:51:03.180
Autrey, you have this feeling
of I want to be like that.

00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:08.310
It's this natural arising of
this experience of the value

00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:10.900
of being in service to others.

00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:15.420
So I would love for you
to just delete that term

00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:20.430
from your psyche
and to actually use

00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:25.150
another term which is called
empathic distress in its place.

00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:28.140
I have experienced
empathic distress.

00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:32.100
In the introduction--
but compassion fatigue,

00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:36.000
it's not compassion that
we're talking about.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.490
It really has to do with
empathy and burnout.

00:51:39.490 --> 00:51:42.460
And so in the introduction
to the empathy chapter,

00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:45.180
I talk about being in this
small clinic in Nepal,

00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:51.060
and a very haggard man walked
into the clinic clutching

00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:54.330
a little bundle in his arms.

00:51:54.330 --> 00:51:58.350
And one of our clinicians
walked up, helped the man unwrap

00:51:58.350 --> 00:52:03.000
the bundle, and it was a little
girl who was horribly burned.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:10.070
And so we took her into one of
the clinics rooms and began,

00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:15.030
the clinicians, the Nepali
nurses and doctors and our team

00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:17.460
began to debride her
wounds, but we didn't

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:20.130
have pediatric anesthesia.

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:24.270
And I was in such
resonance with this child

00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:27.840
that I had a vasovagal response.

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.320
I almost passed out.

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:31.770
I thought I was going to
throw up on the floor.

00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:35.890
And I just-- all of
the life ran out of me.

00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:38.790
And then I realized, I
had this kind of insight.

00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:42.720
Wait a minute, that is
not going to serve here.

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:46.950
And I reallocated my attention
to the sensation of my feet

00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:48.780
on the floor.

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:51.000
I got myself grounded.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:56.700
And as I was grounding
myself, this sense

00:52:56.700 --> 00:53:01.170
of gratitude to the father
for bringing this little girl

00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:03.360
into the clinic arose.

00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:07.860
I could feel my vascular
system warm up, become happier,

00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:09.240
if you will.

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:11.760
And then I had this
sort of next wave

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:14.820
of just incredible
gratitude for the clinicians

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:17.190
who were serving this child.

00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:21.980
And that's compassion.

00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:26.810
Being in affective resonance
and somatic resonance

00:53:26.810 --> 00:53:28.850
with the child was empathy.

00:53:28.850 --> 00:53:32.330
I would have been wiped
for all of the work

00:53:32.330 --> 00:53:37.110
that I've done in the medical
field as a support person.

00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:39.240
There's no way I
could've sustain it.

00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:42.950
But in fact, compassion
is characterized

00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:46.892
by unbiased resilience.

00:53:46.892 --> 00:53:47.550
Thank you.

00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:49.300
SPEAKER: --for sharing
her wisdom with us.

00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:51.800
