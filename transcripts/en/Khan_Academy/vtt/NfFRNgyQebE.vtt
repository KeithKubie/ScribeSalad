00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.954
- [Instructor] Hey, this is
Kim and I'm here with Leah,

00:00:02.954 --> 00:00:06.015
Khan Academy's US Government
and Politics Fellow.

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:06.848
Welcome Leah.

00:00:06.848 --> 00:00:07.681
- [Leah] How's it going?

00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:08.986
- [Kim] Alright, so we're talking about

00:00:08.986 --> 00:00:10.816
the Articles of Confederation,

00:00:10.816 --> 00:00:12.647
which I think many people don't realize

00:00:12.647 --> 00:00:15.218
was the first constitution
of the United States

00:00:15.218 --> 00:00:19.192
before the one that we
have now since 1789.

00:00:19.192 --> 00:00:21.076
So could you take us through a little bit

00:00:21.076 --> 00:00:23.539
what the Articles of Confederation were

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.818
and the context in which
we first brought them on

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:28.142
as a governmental system?

00:00:28.142 --> 00:00:30.167
- [Leah] Sure, so I think
the most important thing

00:00:30.167 --> 00:00:31.818
to understand about the
Articles of Confederation

00:00:31.818 --> 00:00:33.821
and why we would talk about this

00:00:33.821 --> 00:00:36.883
is because one of the
biggest debates that we have

00:00:36.883 --> 00:00:39.098
in our history is about
the balance of power

00:00:39.098 --> 00:00:42.484
between the federal government
and state governments.

00:00:42.484 --> 00:00:45.274
When the Articles of
Confederation were first created,

00:00:45.274 --> 00:00:47.290
it was in the middle of
the American Revolution.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.107
They were created in 1777,
and so the question becomes,

00:00:52.107 --> 00:00:53.896
well, how can we run a government

00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:56.703
that looks as different
from monarchy as possible?

00:00:56.703 --> 00:00:59.781
- [Kim] Right, so they're
trying to run away from the past

00:00:59.781 --> 00:01:02.325
that they're getting away
from in the Revolutionary War

00:01:02.325 --> 00:01:05.265
and trying to create a separate government

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:07.769
that doesn't have any of those abuses

00:01:07.769 --> 00:01:10.124
that they are rebelling against.

00:01:10.124 --> 00:01:11.500
- [Leah] If they're running
away from a monarchy,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.486
what they're running towards

00:01:12.486 --> 00:01:14.466
is what we would call limited government.

00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:15.299
- [Kim] OK.

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.291
- [Leah] So their central government,

00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:18.878
which is synonymous with
a federal government,

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:20.650
the central government is actually

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.400
really, really, really small.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.233
- [Kim] OK.

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:24.396
- [Leah] They don't have
an executive branch.

00:01:24.396 --> 00:01:25.731
They only have Congress.

00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:27.670
They don't even have a judicial branch.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.295
So Congress is made up of all 13 states.

00:01:31.295 --> 00:01:33.327
Every state had one representative.

00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:34.160
- [Kim] OK.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.959
- [Leah] In order to change
the Articles of Confederation,

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:38.759
if they wanted to pass an amendment,

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.598
they had to get unanimous
consent from all 13 states.

00:01:42.598 --> 00:01:44.319
- [Kim] OK, so they're trying to make sure

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:48.642
that all of the states
are represented equally,

00:01:48.642 --> 00:01:52.293
but that also sounds like it
would have a lot of hurdles

00:01:52.293 --> 00:01:56.408
to overcome when it comes
to getting consensus.

00:01:56.408 --> 00:01:58.638
- [Leah] Yeah, for laws,
you had to get nine

00:01:58.638 --> 00:02:01.737
out of 13 states to actually pass a law.

00:02:01.737 --> 00:02:04.893
So if you can imagine, if
you're in a room of 13 people

00:02:04.893 --> 00:02:07.997
and you all have to agree
on one pizza topping

00:02:07.997 --> 00:02:10.170
for the rest of your lives.
(Kim laughs)

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.928
It would be almost impossible, right?

00:02:11.928 --> 00:02:14.819
- [Kim] Wow, OK, alright,
so it sounds like

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.198
there are some problems with
the Articles of Confederation,

00:02:18.198 --> 00:02:21.501
but did they do anything good
for us in this early period?

00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:22.870
- [Leah] Yeah, so the biggest thing

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.652
is that it unites all 13
colonies who are now states

00:02:26.652 --> 00:02:28.934
under one government.

00:02:28.934 --> 00:02:29.767
- [Kim] OK.

00:02:29.767 --> 00:02:31.158
- [Leah] This government is able to pass

00:02:31.158 --> 00:02:33.745
a really favorable treaty with Britain

00:02:33.745 --> 00:02:37.968
and end the Revolutionary War
in 1783, the Treaty of Paris.

00:02:37.968 --> 00:02:39.804
- [Kim] OK, so this is
kind of the government

00:02:39.804 --> 00:02:42.110
that gets us through the revolutionary war

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.856
and is with us when we
first start in the 1780s.

00:02:46.856 --> 00:02:50.011
- [Leah] Yeah, and one another
specific law that they pass

00:02:50.011 --> 00:02:53.224
is the Northwest Ordinance of 1787

00:02:53.224 --> 00:02:56.226
and this Northwest
Ordinance kinda tells us

00:02:56.226 --> 00:02:59.413
how we are going to expand as we move west

00:02:59.413 --> 00:03:01.047
and what are we going
to do with that land,

00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:03.119
and that's a really important idea

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:05.978
when we're moving
forward with our country.

00:03:05.978 --> 00:03:08.571
The only problem is with the
Articles of Confederation

00:03:08.571 --> 00:03:11.347
is there is a lot of things
that we still have to figure out

00:03:11.347 --> 00:03:13.535
as we're growing, there's
a lot of growing pains.

00:03:13.535 --> 00:03:16.126
- [Kim] So what led the early government

00:03:16.126 --> 00:03:18.085
of the United States to realize

00:03:18.085 --> 00:03:20.873
that they wanted to abandon
these Articles of Confederation

00:03:20.873 --> 00:03:23.569
in favor of a different constitution?

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.214
- [Leah] So the inciting
incident is Shays' Rebellion.

00:03:26.214 --> 00:03:29.006
It happens in Massachusets,
and it's a group of farmers

00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:31.492
led by this guy named Daniel Shays.

00:03:31.492 --> 00:03:33.879
What's happening is that
we had just gotten out of

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.861
the Revolutionary War,
and a lot of of the people

00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:37.410
who had fought in the Revolutionary War

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.050
still hadn't gotten
payment for their duty.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.376
They also were experiencing
really high state taxes,

00:03:43.376 --> 00:03:47.638
so Daniel Shays and these farmers
are very upset, obviously,

00:03:47.638 --> 00:03:50.874
in their wanting their money
and so they started rebelling,

00:03:50.874 --> 00:03:53.447
but the problem is, with the
way that the central government

00:03:53.447 --> 00:03:57.147
that was built, first,
Congress had no ability

00:03:57.147 --> 00:03:59.389
to levy or collect taxes.

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:00.607
If they couldn't collect taxes,

00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:04.547
they had no ability to actually
pay back their farmers.

00:04:04.547 --> 00:04:07.413
Along with that, they
didn't have any money

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:10.648
to create a military, so each
state had their own militia,

00:04:10.648 --> 00:04:13.478
but the United States
as a whole as a country

00:04:13.478 --> 00:04:16.123
did not have a military to
suppress this rebellion.

00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:18.457
So on both ends, we are in

00:04:18.457 --> 00:04:21.690
a really bad situation politically.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.843
- [Kim] Wow, so, there's this moment

00:04:23.843 --> 00:04:27.758
where you find armed rebellion
against the United States

00:04:27.758 --> 00:04:31.195
for a lack of money and the US government

00:04:31.195 --> 00:04:32.957
finds that it can't raise money

00:04:32.957 --> 00:04:35.907
and it can't raise an army
to put down this rebellion.

00:04:35.907 --> 00:04:39.393
- [Leah] Exactly, and so there
is this fear immediately.

00:04:39.393 --> 00:04:41.305
And what we see is a lot
of the founding fathers

00:04:41.305 --> 00:04:44.044
that we know and really respect
today like George Washington

00:04:44.044 --> 00:04:47.177
and Ben Franklin and Alexander
Hamilton and James Madison,

00:04:47.177 --> 00:04:49.678
they get together and they
say this is a problem,

00:04:49.678 --> 00:04:51.685
we need to change what we have,

00:04:51.685 --> 00:04:53.728
and this leads to the
Constitutional Convention

00:04:53.728 --> 00:04:56.239
in which we draft our second constitution.

00:04:56.239 --> 00:04:58.964
- [Kim] Right, yeah, so in 1787,

00:04:58.964 --> 00:05:02.301
the leaders of the United
States get together and say,

00:05:02.301 --> 00:05:04.676
alright, the Articles of
Confederation aren't working.

00:05:04.676 --> 00:05:06.884
We're gonna need a stronger
central government,

00:05:06.884 --> 00:05:09.500
even though we were trying
to get away from the monarchy

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.447
and now let's think of something

00:05:11.447 --> 00:05:13.628
that's going to work a
little bit better for us.
