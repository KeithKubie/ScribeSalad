ELISE BIRKHOFER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.240
My name is Elise
Birkhofer, and I'm

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.360
one of the Global Program
Managers for Women at Google.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.840
We are very excited today
for a Special Talks at Google

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.900
hosted by Eileen Naughton,
VP of People Operations

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.740
at Google and Maureen Chiquet.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.000
Maureen Chiquet began
her career in marketing

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.580
at L'Oreal Paris in 1985.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.400
She has worked at The Gap,
helped launch Old Navy,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.020
and was president
of Banana Republic

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.750
before becoming COO
and president of US

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.810
operations of Chanel in 2003.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.590
In 2007, she became
its first global CEO,

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.510
where she oversaw the
business and brand's

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.310
worldwide expansion.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.950
She left Chanel in 2016 to
focus on writing, speaking,

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.680
and developing new
leadership initiatives.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.130
There's a Dory for
questions, go/maureen-dory,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.560
if anyone who's over live
stream wants to add a question

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.070
remotely when we open it up.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.010
Thanks.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.426
EILEEN NAUGHTON:
Thank you, Elise.

00:01:04.426 --> 00:01:06.110
And good morning, everyone--

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.760
afternoon if you're watching
from other parts of the world.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.722
We have, I think, well
over 200 people signed up,

00:01:12.722 --> 00:01:13.430
so hi out there--

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.470
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Good
morning, everyone.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.890
EILEEN NAUGHTON: --on the GVC.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.335
And welcome back
to Google, Maureen.

00:01:18.335 --> 00:01:19.460
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Thank you.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.140
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Maureen
and I ran into each other

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.710
in the hallway this morning.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.310
And one of the reasons I was so
intrigued to come in and speak

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.980
with you was I've met
Maureen in the past.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.990
She was, at the
time, CEO of Chanel,

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.550
one of the most coveted
accounts in the New York office,

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.490
I might add.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.416
And all of our sales
executives would

00:01:39.416 --> 00:01:44.340
dress up very, very specially
when Chanel team came in.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.800
And they got a lot
of love from us.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.060
But, Maureen, you were
really pushing your team

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.660
to drive more value
through digital marketing.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.130
And so clearly, a lot of
leadership insight there.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.380
But I read the book review
of "Beyond the Label,"

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.570
Maureen's first book.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.120
And I was intrigued,
and I sent the review

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.940
to our director of
leadership development,

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.790
because I thought were so many
leadership lessons in here.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.440
And I go, you might want to
get Maureen to come to Google

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.620
and tell us about this.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.452
MAUREEN CHIQUET: I love that.

00:02:18.452 --> 00:02:20.868
EILEEN NAUGHTON: So Maureen,
you were running a $5 billion

00:02:20.868 --> 00:02:25.550
global company, one of the
most iconic brands in the genre

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.950
of fashion and luxury.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.850
And suddenly, it stopped
December 2015, was it?

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.270
MAUREEN CHIQUET: It was
January 2016, right.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.820
EILEEN NAUGHTON: So you've
had this meteoric career.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.690
You're one of the most
admired CEOs, female CEOs,

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.440
in your industry, but
also an American CEO

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.566
this iconic French brand.

00:02:48.566 --> 00:02:49.800
And then it stops.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.290
Can you talk a
little bit about what

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.260
it felt like and that
the disorientation

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.150
that you describe in the book.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.650
MAUREEN CHIQUET:
I would love to.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.610
So there's a story in the book.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.380
It's the first story.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.240
And I'll give you a,
sort of, brief synopsis

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.323
and let you read the rest.

00:03:05.323 --> 00:03:08.790
But from one day to
the next I found myself

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.430
no longer with a title with
a label of global CEO Chanel.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.730
And as part of what
I was going through,

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.120
and I think to be honest,
it was a moment for me

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.150
of both freedom,
in a way, because I

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.630
had been working in a
company for over 30 years--

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.200
in companies.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.490
I had three major companies--

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.480
L'Oreal, Gap, and all three
divisions, and then Chanel.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.180
And so while at one point
it was kind of liberating,

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.982
I was also grieving.

00:03:37.982 --> 00:03:39.690
It was really hard
because I found myself

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.990
without knowing
who I was anymore.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.510
And the story goes
that I decided,

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.150
for whatever reason-- you
all probably think I'm crazy.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.350
But I decided I need
to purge my closets.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.830
I have been wearing the
same uniform for 13 years.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.290
And I know it's a
really wonderful treat

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.570
to be able to wear
this kind of uniform.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.320
For me, it was jeans, because
you can't give up your roots.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.337
So I had my denim jeans,
any variety of denim jeans.

00:04:09.337 --> 00:04:10.920
EILEEN NAUGHTON:
What's your favorite?

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.590
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Well, at the
time, I was wearing J Brand.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.300
But I've now transitioned
to Rag &amp; Bone.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.040
EILEEN NAUGHTON:
Yeah, they're good.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.829
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Yeah,
I really like them.

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.390
I'm giving them a plug.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.465
I hope they're happy.

00:04:19.465 --> 00:04:22.147
So all you Googlers--
no, I just think

00:04:22.147 --> 00:04:23.730
they're really
comfortable, well-made,

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.080
and beautiful fabrics.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.687
But I would wear any variety
of J Brand jeans back then.

00:04:28.687 --> 00:04:31.020
My American Apparel-- now
they're going out of business,

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.960
unfortunately-- tank
tops and a Chanel jacket

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.750
everyday 13 years,
that's what I wore.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.160
So I had this moment.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.030
I need to purge my closet.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.730
I did it that, and I
realized that all I had left

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.000
were tank tops, a few
woven shirts from a company

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.672
called Hartford,
and these jeans.

00:04:50.672 --> 00:04:52.630
So I thought, oh my god,
what am I going to do?

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.980
So I called Jeffrey's,
a store in New York.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.655
I called Jeffrey, or texted him,
and said, SOS, I need clothes.

00:05:00.655 --> 00:05:01.780
EILEEN NAUGHTON: I'm sorry.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.196
What did you do
with the old ones?

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:05.910
MAUREEN CHIQUET: I know.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.101
Everybody asks.

00:05:07.101 --> 00:05:08.600
I don't know if I
should admit this.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.350
There are about 10 closets
full in my basement.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.982
So I haven't done anything
with them, but I really--

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:16.680
I know.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.970
I know.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:17.760
EILEEN NAUGHTON: You
can auction them off.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.690
MAUREEN CHIQUET:
Everybody-- I know.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.898
I haven't figured it out yet.

00:05:19.898 --> 00:05:21.780
I haven't had time
to figure it out.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.830
So I went into Jeffrey, and
I'm a merchant at heart,

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.690
meaning I love clothes,
and I feel them.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.990
And I love to think about
what looks good in stores.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.330
So I walked in probably the most
intimidated I had ever been,

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.520
because I felt almost nude.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.830
I felt naked at this point.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.550
I had on some of my
Converse sneakers and jeans,

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.070
and I'm touching the mannequins,
and they're looking down at me.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.090
And I'm thinking, I
don't belong anymore.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.340
I don't know where I belong.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.770
And fortunately, thanks
to the team there,

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.662
they littered the dressing room
with all different options.

00:05:55.662 --> 00:05:57.120
And you know, my
first instinct was

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.515
to go over to my old identity.

00:05:58.515 --> 00:06:00.640
Because, by the way, this
is a story about clothes,

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.760
but it's really a
story about identity.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.195
And I started looking
at all the jackets.

00:06:05.195 --> 00:06:06.570
That's all I could
see was fitted

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.114
jackets, Chanel-type jackets.

00:06:08.114 --> 00:06:09.780
And they said, no,
why don't we show you

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.580
some other things--
wide leg pants

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.090
and this kind of jacket
and underpinnings and all

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.400
these things that I hadn't
ever thought about wearing.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.430
And I started to look
at myself in the mirror,

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.920
and I thought, oh, my god,
there's a person in there

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.750
beyond the label, really, beyond
the level of global CEO Chanel.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.780
And it was the
beginning of, almost,

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.400
the process that I went
through of rediscovering

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.310
who I was after this
13-year stint as the CEO.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.636
EILEEN NAUGHTON: So a 13-year
stint as CEO of Chanel,

00:06:40.636 --> 00:06:43.070
purging your closet is
a metaphor for purging

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.790
your life--

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:44.600
MAUREEN CHIQUET:
That's exactly right.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.725
EILEEN NAUGHTON: --as well.

00:06:45.725 --> 00:06:50.790
Your marriage of 26 years,
is it, purged that too

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.900
in a rather dramatic way.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.400
MAUREEN CHIQUET:
It wasn't dramatic.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.860
It's interesting to be in
the situation, where, and I

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.300
think, in honesty, a wonderful,
wonderful relationship, which

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.080
is still there, is a friendship,
and to recognize that,

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.970
and to be able to say, can
we evolve this relationship

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.190
from what it is and go
beyond our own labels,

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.390
basically, into a friendship?

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:20.240
And so Antoine, I call him
my was-band, and said--

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.190
because we're best friends,
and he lives in Africa.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.782
His passion and
his work is really

00:07:25.782 --> 00:07:28.530
in setting up NGOs in Africa.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.470
So he's living in Burundi.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.960
He does a lot of
work also in Uganda.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.820
But I also realized,
and what was

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.680
interesting about
our relationship,

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.520
is so much of what he had to do,
in so many ways, was follow me.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.810
And this allowed
him to follow him.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.240
So it was a real opening.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.410
Now, I say this.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.000
It sounds really easy.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.490
But I cried for three months.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.070
And I kid you not, this
was not an easy thing.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.580
But it was-- you're right.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.790
It was a kind of identity.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.860
It wasn't-- I hate to
say purging, though.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.151
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:07:59.151 --> 00:08:00.470
It's maybe a strong word.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.880
But do you think that had your
separation from Chanel not

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.960
happened, do you think you would
have been provoked to move well

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.277
beyond all of your labels?

00:08:10.277 --> 00:08:12.110
MAUREEN CHIQUET: You
know, it's interesting.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:16.790
My marriage-- we were separated
long before I left Chanel.

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:20.445
And it was interesting for me,
actually, to go through that.

00:08:20.445 --> 00:08:22.820
I don't want to talk too much,
because it's going to be--

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.410
I think it will be the
subject of my next book.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.250
No, I'd love to talk more.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:28.340
We can talk about--

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.540
because I haven't
formulated all my ideas yet.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.789
But it was-- and I don't--
you know how sometimes when

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:37.669
you're in it, and I think,
in a way, I'm still in that,

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:38.720
you're not exactly--

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.469
you don't have the
distance enough to say,

00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:41.750
what did I glean from this?

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.669
Or what questions can I ask?

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:45.800
Or what observations
can I make that might

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.340
help other people going
through major transformations?

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.065
I'm still in the transformation.

00:08:52.065 --> 00:08:54.650
I think, kind of, we
always are, right?

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.276
But this one was a big one.

00:08:56.276 --> 00:08:57.650
EILEEN NAUGHTON:
It's remarkable.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:59.960
So many strong women
are giving voice

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:05.000
to what it is we
experience in life.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Sheryl Sandberg, who was
one of the founding--

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.190
she was the founder of Women
at Google, which was here,

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:13.650
has just come out
with "Option B"

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.825
and her whole premise
of resilience.

00:09:17.825 --> 00:09:22.820
And you actually learn how
through difficult transitions

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.810
just how resilient you can be.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.240
And resilience itself
is a learned skill.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.450
Is that something that
you've been toying with?

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.490
I haven't been able to
read the book yet, but--

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:35.990
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Yeah, in fact,
very early on in my career

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:38.960
I started learning this
notion of resilience.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.450
And there's a story
in there when I was

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:42.830
a young merchant at The Gap.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.250
Now, you have to understand, I
was at L'Oreal for three years.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.154
I was pretty sure--

00:09:48.154 --> 00:09:50.570
and I had no idea, by the way,
that when I went to L'Oreal

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.130
I was going to be a marketer.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:53.909
I studied literature.

00:09:53.909 --> 00:09:54.950
EILEEN NAUGHTON: At Yale.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:56.944
MAUREEN CHIQUET: At Yale.

00:09:56.944 --> 00:09:58.610
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Any
Yalees in the room?

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:00.193
MAUREEN CHIQUET:
Maybe some out there.

00:10:00.193 --> 00:10:01.150
Hi, Yalees.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:05.900
But I studied film
as a literary form.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.640
So I was looking at
imagery and trying

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.630
to understand the emotion
that's created with image.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.400
And I never thought about that
might be a career in marketing.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.445
But how logical is that?

00:10:14.445 --> 00:10:15.070
Really amazing.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:16.070
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Especially
at L'Oreal, which

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:17.249
is such a visual marketer.

00:10:17.249 --> 00:10:18.290
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Exactly.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.240
And so I fell, really,
in the right place.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.910
But I'd come from
this three years.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.640
And I had I gone on the road.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.280
L'Oreal has this great program
where they sent me actually

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.250
to the north of France, which is
the industrial part of France.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.520
All my friends were
going to the Cote d'Azur,

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.060
and I'm and I'm in the north
of France with the coalmines.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:42.590
And they actually asked you
to sell L'Oreal products out

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:43.550
of a suitcase.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:47.570
And you're basically a traveling
salesman to hypermarkets.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:50.630
Hypermarkets are three times the
size of your local supermarket,

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:51.980
I mean, at least.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.382
And I would meet
with these guys,

00:10:53.382 --> 00:10:54.590
and there's a store in there.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.570
I met with one
guy, and he buys--

00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.550
he bought peas.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.220
He bought sanitary concerns.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.840
And he bought hair gel.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.214
Now, you can imagine.

00:11:04.214 --> 00:11:05.630
And I was selling
mousse that day.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.229
And his hair is
all slicked back.

00:11:08.229 --> 00:11:10.270
I'm thinking, maybe I
should change my marketing?

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:13.400
I've got the marketing speak,
and I'm giving my sales pitch.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.180
And finally he said, no, no, no.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.470
Look, let's talk
about the endcap.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:19.620
How much will you give me?

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.120
And we started going
back and forth.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.411
And I realized that I actually
had to step in his shoes

00:11:23.411 --> 00:11:24.120
to understand.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.120
But all that to say
I came out of L'Oreal

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.700
sure I was a marketer,
absolutely sure.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.730
And I got to The Gap, and
it turned out they actually

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.340
had advertising not marketing.

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.500
So they had said, you're
going to be a merchant.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.270
And I thought, this is great.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.630
I mean, I like looking
at beautiful products

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:41.770
and selecting them.

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.705
My interview with the
CEO, then Mickey Drexler,

00:11:44.705 --> 00:11:45.580
had gone really well.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.538
I picked out some bags.

00:11:46.538 --> 00:11:48.550
I'm like, oh, I can-- a cinch.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:50.980
Well, not so fast.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.690
I found myself pretty
much in a sample

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:54.670
closet for the first
several months,

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.961
trying to sort through
all the very disarray

00:11:56.961 --> 00:11:58.960
of different products
that hadn't been organized

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.260
in several years.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.839
And then I had to learn this
thing called the Open-To-Buy,

00:12:02.839 --> 00:12:03.380
which was a--

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.310
it's a tool to manage
your inventory.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:10.180
And I had a difficult boss.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.360
And he one day said to
me-- you know, I had lost--

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.090
I get lost.

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:17.310
I had not known where
some paisley bags were.

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:18.945
And he got very angry
at me and told me

00:12:18.945 --> 00:12:21.070
he wasn't going to teach
me the Open-To-Buy, that I

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.860
had to learn it on my own.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.590
I'm a young person, and I'm
also the sole breadwinner.

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:30.310
So he had yelled at me
to just such a degree

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.370
that I found myself crying
and calling my mom, which

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:34.900
is what you do, right--

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:35.830
call mom.

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.620
So my mom at that
point said to me,

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.120
and you're talking
about resilience,

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.110
she said, well, honey, I hate
to see you working so hard.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.280
I was working 12-hour days.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.620
I didn't understand this
thing called the Open-To-Buy.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:48.786
I had never been a merchant.

00:12:48.786 --> 00:12:51.640
I realized that it was way
harder than anybody had told me

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.929
in the beginning, or that
I at least had surmised.

00:12:53.929 --> 00:12:55.970
And so she said, why don't
you do something else?

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:58.656
And I said, but I want to
be close to creativity.

00:12:58.656 --> 00:13:00.280
And by the way, no
Google at that time.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.380
This was back in 1989.

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:04.840
If I had known, I
might have come here.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.580
No, I love The Gap so much.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.620
But I so wanted to be
close to that creativity.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:13.366
And I was watching
the levels above me

00:13:13.366 --> 00:13:14.740
and what they were
getting to do.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.281
And they're working
with design teams

00:13:16.281 --> 00:13:19.150
and picking these beautiful
clothes out for the store.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.189
So I stuck in there.

00:13:20.189 --> 00:13:21.980
And I said, Mom, I'm
going to stick it out.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:26.650
And I think it was a very early
lesson in resilience, which

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:29.440
is basically, for me,
about when you care

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.320
so deeply about
something, you're

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.560
kind of willing to tough out
some of those moments that

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.610
aren't as easy.

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.800
And I care deeply about
being close to creative.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.232
EILEEN NAUGHTON:
I love that story.

00:13:41.232 --> 00:13:43.990
Because there is
something in your 20s

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:47.295
where you have this sense of
who want to be professionally.

00:13:47.295 --> 00:13:51.399
But you really do have to
learn your way into it.

00:13:51.399 --> 00:13:52.440
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Totally.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.020
EILEEN NAUGHTON: And the ability
to be patient with yourself

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.690
and learn the tools
of the trade, I

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.480
think, those are
important lessons.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.980
Because I often say to
many Googlers who are,

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:08.230
by and large, a
very high-capability

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:10.000
ambitious group,
you're going to be

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.220
working for probably 30 years.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.190
This is a marathon and
enjoy this journey.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:18.640
But you had quite a
journey through, OK,

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.430
marketing, merchandising, then,
what I would call, leadership.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:27.704
You were CEO of The Gap
when you left, weren't you?

00:14:27.704 --> 00:14:28.870
MAUREEN CHIQUET: No, no, no.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.880
I was I was president
of Banana Republic.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.255
EILEEN NAUGHTON: That's it,
president of Banana Republic.

00:14:33.255 --> 00:14:37.080
And then to be
selected for Chanel,

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.710
you have an unusual profile.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.030
You're bilingual.

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.360
You've had to work [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:46.120
But that is daunting
leadership [INAUDIBLE]..

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.480
We talk sometime at Google
about Imposter Syndrome, when

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.720
you show up somewhere, and all
of sudden, you realize, wow,

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.030
everyone else is
really knowledgeable.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:15:00.180
How did it feel walking into
the storied house of Chanel

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.120
and [INAUDIBLE]?

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.190
MAUREEN CHIQUET:
Well, first of all, it

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:07.450
was incredibly,
incredibly exhilarating

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:09.250
and intimidating. timidating.

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:11.950
And I remember standing in
Gabrielle Chanel's apartment--

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:15.220
this beautiful crystal
chandelier, and I

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.320
talked about this in
the book, and gazing up.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.970
And then going to
these fashion shows

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:22.490
in a 17th-century convent.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:27.140
And the beautiful,
detailed, intricate couture,

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.110
I had never seen
anything like this.

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:34.590
And then here's a brand that
has almost a 100-year history.

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:38.170
Gap was created in 1969.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.160
And so I didn't--

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.420
the richness of that.

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:45.490
And how do you take that forward
into this very different future

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:48.040
was going to be, I knew, one
of my biggest challenges.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.952
But as the story goes,
when I started as CEO--

00:15:51.952 --> 00:15:54.160
so this is after three years
of training, by the way.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.210
I had three years of training.

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:57.700
So you talked about patience.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.830
I think I learned to
cultivate patience.

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:01.360
But the first year
they had sent me

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.364
to France to just listen and
learn, put a tape on my mouth.

00:16:05.364 --> 00:16:07.280
They basically, we want
you in France and then

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.210
around the world.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:10.990
We want you to meet everybody
and anybody you can.

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.490
I went into every
single department,

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:16.240
from creative to the
factories to finance,

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.387
visited with all the teams.

00:16:17.387 --> 00:16:19.720
And all I could do was ask
questions, because they said,

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.610
you are not allowed to make
a decision for a full year.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:24.940
So that was humbling,
very humbling.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.680
And after about nine
months, I was going,

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.325
I want to do something.

00:16:28.325 --> 00:16:30.700
And you're seeing these things
that you think you can do.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:35.020
But this house has such a
beautiful storied history

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.900
that you really do have
to learn the ropes first.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:42.560
But when finally
became CEO in 2007,

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.110
that was equally a
hurdle, because I actually

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:49.190
found myself at the table, at
the head of a table, of 10 men.

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:52.920
And all of them were in their
beautiful suits and CC logo

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:53.420
ties.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.340
Now, I knew them
because I'd been there.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.290
But all of a sudden,
I was at the head,

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:59.570
and I was 43 years old.

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:00.470
I'm American.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:01.880
Most of them were French.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.490
Most of them were a decade,
if not two, of my senior.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:08.130
And they all had not three
years, but about 20 years

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:09.750
of luxury experience.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:12.319
So that was the beginning
of actually tapping

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:15.140
into a different
kind of leadership.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.390
I had always thought
about leadership

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:21.020
is the idea of take
charge, demand respect,

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.355
be focused, be strategic.

00:17:22.355 --> 00:17:24.140
You have a vision.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.036
And that wasn't going to work.

00:17:26.036 --> 00:17:27.619
That wasn't going
to work because they

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:31.610
had such deep history,
such deep knowledge, that I

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:34.670
had to figure out how I was
going to integrate the things I

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.040
was seeing and certainly
the digital world that

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.230
was coming out.

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:42.260
Really, 2007 was the beginning
of a major digital revolution.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.880
And I had to figure that out.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.690
So I realized that it was going
to be through asking questions,

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:50.510
through actually sitting
on their side of the table,

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:54.520
not trying to push my agenda
and actually being vulnerable,

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.270
saying, you know, guys,
I don't know this.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:57.830
Help.

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:01.310
It was collaborating
with them, mixing ideas,

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:03.740
and actually opening
questions to everybody

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:06.360
so that we could actually
co-create a future.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.450
And that knowledge of that
moment-- this is getting long.

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:09.950
I'm sorry.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:10.170
But I--

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:10.790
EILEEN NAUGHTON:
No, it's perfect.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:11.780
It's fascinating, actually.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:12.863
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Oh, good.

00:18:12.863 --> 00:18:15.230
So that's a personal story.

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:18.230
But it taught me something
really deeper about leadership.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.710
Because what I realized
during that moment,

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:24.860
and this is three major things
were happening in our world.

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:28.660
The digital revolution for
you guys is incredible.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.100
Now imagine yourself
a luxury company,

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.740
where it's all
about exclusivity.

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.060
It's not more is more.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.910
It's not about pushing sales
or getting more exposure.

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:41.870
It's actually about making your
products rare and beautiful

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:46.520
and connecting to that customer
not en masse, but one on one.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.240
So the digital revolution
actually scared us.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.110
So we had that as
a great unknown.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:55.290
And how are we going to be
relevant in this revolution

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.544
if we are about rarity
and exclusivity?

00:18:57.544 --> 00:18:58.710
So that was the first thing.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:02.390
The second thing
was globalization.

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:05.900
We had been global, but we had--

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.080
when China began to
gain so much wealth,

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:13.250
we had clients all over the
world flooding our boutiques

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:14.510
from China.

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:15.720
And that was hard.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.270
We didn't know the
culture that well.

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.760
But also, we didn't
know how to still serve

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.970
our loyal clients when the
boutiques were brimming,

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:24.500
so challenge two.

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:27.432
Challenge three, and I'm
looking out at all of you

00:19:27.432 --> 00:19:29.390
and probably some of you
there, this generation

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:32.150
that everybody so fondly
called Millennials,

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.610
for a luxury brand--

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.910
it's a patriarchal company.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:39.050
It is based on a lot of history.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:42.290
And you have people who are
born with devices in their hands

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:44.840
and who have a very different
perspective about what

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:49.310
makes up a luxury company, not
to mention different values

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:52.130
about ethics and
social behavior.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:56.180
So as I'm sitting at this
table, and this happened

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:59.030
over a period of a
few years, I realized

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:02.540
that what I learned, when
I came into the unknown

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:06.020
and uncertainty about how I
should behave as a leader,

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.510
was something that the
leaders in our company

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:11.570
would greatly benefit from,
and that we as a company,

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:15.680
in order to step
into this new age,

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.920
would actually have to adopt
new leadership behaviors

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.090
and shift our culture.

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:24.030
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Were you
explicit about those leadership

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:26.069
behaviors [INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:26.069 --> 00:20:28.610
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Yes, and I'll
tell a funny story about that.

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:34.150
So I had a coach,
and I had begun

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:35.950
to realize that
these were things

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:37.210
that were starting to help me.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:41.350
So when I could sit at the other
side of the table with my team,

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:46.390
when I could actually engage
in questioning and curiosity,

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:48.160
not only did our
relationship get better,

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.930
but more ideas started to spawn.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.080
So I decided, great,
I got it down.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.520
I know what qualities.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.100
I am going to teach
these guys what to do.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.370
At this point, by the way, I
added some women to the team.

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:02.200
I had added six women, actually.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.700
So it was a rainy day in July.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:07.780
July is not a good month.

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:08.946
I couldn't control the rain.

00:21:08.946 --> 00:21:10.960
But July is not a
good month in France

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.030
because it's a month before
people go on vacation

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:13.770
and people leave for months--

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:14.740
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Very busy.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:15.865
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Very busy.

00:21:15.865 --> 00:21:17.800
People are stressed out.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.130
And I corralled my team
into a dusty ballroom.

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.840
The ballroom was 10 times
the size of this room.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.930
And there were 20 of us.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.370
So you can imagine
what that felt like.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.430
And then I had them play
those team-building games,

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:31.956
which sometimes are good.

00:21:31.956 --> 00:21:33.580
But when you're in
a group of Europeans

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:37.257
and when you're actually forcing
them to be out in the rain,

00:21:37.257 --> 00:21:38.590
because we did out in the rain--

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.450
I don't know what
I was thinking.

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:42.184
That doesn't go over so well.

00:21:42.184 --> 00:21:43.600
And then I got up
on my bandstand,

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.600
and I started to say, listen, we
need new leadership qualities.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.201
We need to change our culture.

00:21:48.201 --> 00:21:49.450
We need to be more empathetic.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:50.746
We need to be more flexible.

00:21:50.746 --> 00:21:52.120
We need to be more
collaborative.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.270
You can imagine.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:53.490
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Ooh.

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:54.740
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Ooh is right.

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.985
Biggest face plant
of my entire career.

00:21:56.985 --> 00:21:57.860
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Wow.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.530
Did they revolt immediately?

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:01.660
MAUREEN CHIQUET:
Well, so, pretty much.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.060
I had also brought some
consultants from California,

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:06.000
and that just wasn't
the right mix.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.440
They felt like--

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.870
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Well, first of
all, it doesn't rain here, so.

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.130
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Touche.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:15.650
They felt like I wasn't taking
into account their perspective,

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:18.550
their point of view, their great
history, and all the things

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:20.870
and it made them great
up until this point.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:23.830
So I had one of
those moments where

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:28.310
your biggest errors are usually
your greatest learnings.

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:31.770
And August came,
took some time off.

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:36.880
I had organized an off-site
with a great wonderful poet

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.655
and speaker named David White,
and that we had to cancel it

00:22:39.655 --> 00:22:40.450
at the last minute.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:41.680
I canceled it.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.440
I canceled it because I
thought, what am I doing?

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:48.610
I didn't actually listen
or heed my own advice.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:51.490
I actually need to let go
of my preconceived ideas

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:54.700
and collaborate with them
on how they see the future.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:58.720
So while my ideas around
leadership might be valid,

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.370
I'm not going about this
the right way at all.

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:05.211
So I sat down with each team
member for over two hours, one

00:23:05.211 --> 00:23:05.710
by one.

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:08.560
I just said, tell me
how you see the culture.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.450
Tell me what you
hope to improve.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.856
Tell me what you hope to retain.

00:23:12.856 --> 00:23:13.480
What about you?

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.220
Where are you struggling?

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.540
What are your ambitions?

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:17.500
What's your purpose?

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.160
What do you care about?

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.150
And how can you contribute to
what we're going to co-create?

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:27.910
So I gathered all that 20 hours
of interviews into some themes.

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:32.170
And we met again, and this time
they were completely engaged.

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:34.690
And we co-created
something we later

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:37.936
called Active and Conscious
Leadership Journey.

00:23:37.936 --> 00:23:39.310
EILEEN NAUGHTON:
Oh, so listening

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:41.950
was key, acknowledging
their expertise,

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:44.996
respecting their history
and their legacy.

00:23:44.996 --> 00:23:47.650
So the Active Leadership--
what [INAUDIBLE]??

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:50.320
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Active and
Conscious Leadership Journey.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.749
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Can you tell
us a little bit about that?

00:23:52.749 --> 00:23:54.040
MAUREEN CHIQUET: With pleasure.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.600
So one of the things
I also realize

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:00.700
is in any company there's
a very specific culture.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.880
And while I respect
lots of consultants,

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.460
I knew that actually in this
culture for this company,

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:10.610
it was going to be more about
really creating something very,

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:12.860
very specific for them
that's tailor made,

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.040
and that takes into
consideration not

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.650
just the culture of the
company, but the business

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:19.090
issues that we have, right?

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:23.590
I mean, ultimately you want
to create an environment

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:27.100
where good business can flourish
and employees are happy.

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:30.010
So I just said we're
going to design this.

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:30.630
I had a coach.

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:33.160
We decided that we would
design it together.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:36.430
And it started with
having outside speakers,

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:37.870
just like today.

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:39.970
Only the difference
perhaps in this situation

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:42.430
was we would take
an outside speaker

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:46.280
and ask them to work
with us on our questions.

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.280
And so that we would have
a session of speaking,

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.154
and then we'd go into
some of the things that

00:24:50.154 --> 00:24:51.040
were going on for us.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.702
So the first speaker
was a wonderful poet

00:24:54.702 --> 00:24:56.410
by the name of David
White, and everybody

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:57.430
thought I was crazy at first.

00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:58.888
But if you want to
hear that story,

00:24:58.888 --> 00:25:01.000
we can come back to that.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.810
We had Scilla Elworthy,
who was a peace builder

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:05.890
and had worked with
Desmond Tutu and taught

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:08.740
us a lot about
nonviolent communication

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.680
and deep listening.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.600
So the idea is you were
going from inside out.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.790
So who am I, as a leader?

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:17.110
What do I care about?

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:18.250
What triggers me?

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:19.540
What gets me excited?

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.690
Then who am I with relation
to my colleagues, my team?

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:27.510
Who am I with relationship to
the business and to the world?

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:29.030
And so it went from inside out.

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.990
It started with David
White, went to Scilla

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:33.323
and then we started actually
with some business leaders,

00:25:33.323 --> 00:25:34.320
like Clay Christensen.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.060
We used Dan Pink.

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.490
And so the idea was
really try to understand

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:41.310
how do you connect who
you are as a human being,

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:43.530
as an individual, to your
greater business purposes?

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.580
There was that component.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.800
Each executive had a coach.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.570
I mean, this is
in the space where

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:54.360
we were just in 20 people.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.280
And I asked them
to work on anything

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.620
they wanted, just one
thing, choose one thing.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:01.170
And I mentored them
through that coaching.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:04.179
So it was a very rich
program, and it lasted for--

00:26:04.179 --> 00:26:05.970
I actually don't like
to call it a program.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:07.080
I like to call it a journey.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.040
EILEEN NAUGHTON: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.440
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Yeah, because
it's actually leadership

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.030
doesn't start and stop.

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.370
It's something that we do all
the time, and we're active

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:16.410
and we're conscious
in it hopefully.

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:20.760
So it ended up a year
long for this group.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.950
And they were so enthusiastic,
because by the end

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:26.310
of this time, they were
working in new ways together.

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:28.380
New ideas were coming about.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:31.030
Our business was on fire--

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:31.530
on fire.

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:33.570
And the brand reputation
had never been better.

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:35.770
So they wanted to roll it out.

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:38.400
They ended up, and this is
what was so amazing to me--

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.010
I get chills thinking about it.

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:43.120
They said, we'll roll
out to the next 200.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.810
And so they took
it to 200 people.

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.030
Now, we couldn't afford
coaches for everybody.

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:49.290
But there are a lot of ways
of getting good feedback

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:51.280
other than getting a coach.

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.980
That 200 then
said, we love this.

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.810
Can we roll it out to 400?

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:57.384
And by the time I left,
we were 600 strong.

00:26:57.384 --> 00:26:58.800
This is a really
powerful program,

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.060
and it did start to
shift our culture.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.650
Meeting at the time
with Google was

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:06.490
one of the beginning things.

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:07.530
How do we get digital?

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:11.460
How do we create relationships
with external vendors,

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.070
partners, really?

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:14.820
How do we begin to
create those so that we

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.761
can be relevant in our field?

00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:19.302
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Do
you recall having

00:27:19.302 --> 00:27:22.410
visited the Googleplex here in
Mountain View with your team?

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:25.030
And when you went back
to Paris and/or New York,

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:27.280
because when I first
met you, you were,

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.310
I think, working between
Paris and New York.

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:31.592
MAUREEN CHIQUET:
Yes, always, yeah.

00:27:31.592 --> 00:27:33.050
EILEEN NAUGHTON:
Was there anything

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:34.940
that shifted in
your approach that

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.220
was conscious that was
sparked by something

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.360
you experienced here?

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:38.900
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Here at Google?

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:39.200
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Just curious.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.310
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Yeah,
you know, it was amazing.

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:46.190
So I chose actually, I
want to say, 12 executives.

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:49.040
I can't remember how many there
were, not even executives,

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.890
across levels to
come here to Google.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:55.010
We went to Facebook.

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:57.150
I mean, we were really
trying to get a good sense--

00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:58.355
Pinterest at the time.

00:27:58.355 --> 00:27:58.610
EILEEN NAUGHTON: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:00.735
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Yeah, it
was really, really small.

00:28:00.735 --> 00:28:01.960
It was in like one room.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.210
But it was really interesting.

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:06.350
We were trying to figure out
how do we-- and we sat in a room

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:07.472
and shortly after Google.

00:28:07.472 --> 00:28:08.930
We loved the
environment of Google.

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:11.240
I mean, one of the things
that we picked up on

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:15.165
was this notion of creativity
in any domain at Google.

00:28:15.165 --> 00:28:17.540
And I don't know if that's
something that you experience,

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:19.331
but it's what's what
we experienced meeting

00:28:19.331 --> 00:28:20.360
with Googler.

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.820
It was like this
freedom and ability

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:26.270
to express and to be in a
creative mind, regardless

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:27.800
of what kind of
job you're doing.

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.090
And I'm--

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:29.756
EILEEN NAUGHTON:
[INAUDIBLE] Montessori.

00:28:29.756 --> 00:28:32.650
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Yeah, I was
inspired by that totally.

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:34.280
And just the
ideation-- you know,

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.560
we drove in the driverless car.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.410
And the kind of ideation
and forward thinking,

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:41.660
that I think Google
has, was something

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:42.650
I wanted to learn from.

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:44.510
Because even though
luxury companies,

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:47.660
one of the components of being
a luxury company at the highest

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.880
end is history, you
can't ignore the future.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.360
And if you get stuck
on history, then you've

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.964
got a problem getting
into the future,

00:28:54.964 --> 00:28:56.880
and that's a balance
that you have to achieve.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:57.500
EILEEN NAUGHTON:
That's a problem.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.330
Actually, France
has that problem.

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:00.040
I love France.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.300
I went to university [INAUDIBLE]
Paris and went there afterward.

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:06.500
And increasingly-- and I go back
there on business quite a bit.

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.020
But it does feel a little stuck.

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:11.000
MAUREEN CHIQUET: I've
felt that before myself.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.314
EILEEN NAUGHTON: A
little museum-like.

00:29:12.314 --> 00:29:13.190
Beautiful, beautiful place.

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:15.606
MAUREEN CHIQUET: The French
are extraordinary because they

00:29:15.606 --> 00:29:17.930
have exquisite taste.

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:21.500
They understand beauty better
than, I think, any culture.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:24.240
I mean, Italians also do,
and they have a, I think,

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.090
different way of expressing it.

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:28.724
But the French in terms
of food and wine and--

00:29:28.724 --> 00:29:30.140
EILEEN NAUGHTON:
Refinement, yeah.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:35.060
MAUREEN CHIQUET: And I feel like
that is a gift for any culture.

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.860
It's a gift to the world.

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:40.760
And not like a luxury
brand, like Chanel,

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.240
if there is a way that we could
all benefit from that gift

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.867
and make it contemporary enough
so that we can connect to it,

00:29:47.867 --> 00:29:48.950
I think it'd be beautiful.

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:51.470
One of the things that I'm
seeing with luxury companies

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:55.220
today and something I've been
watching quite carefully,

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.730
is this notion of purpose.

00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:00.570
Google has a great
purpose, and I can feel it.

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:03.860
And luxury companies, some
of them do and some of them

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.030
are still developing that.

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:08.880
And purpose, to me, isn't
just about adapting a cause.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.262
It's when the cause and
who you are connect.

00:30:11.262 --> 00:30:12.470
EILEEN NAUGHTON: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.995
MAUREEN CHIQUET:
Yeah, it's intrinsic.

00:30:12.995 --> 00:30:15.410
So I think about
Tesla, for example.

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:17.240
And you look at--

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.820
they've made a luxury car.

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:22.490
And their sales have been better
on their top model than BMW,

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:25.490
I think, and Mercedes.

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:27.410
But what's so interesting
to me about Tesla

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:30.380
is you have all the
fittings of a luxury car,

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.840
because it's
beautifully appointed.

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.600
It's a technological innovation.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.870
And yet you feel
good about driving it

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:42.410
because you're not
putting more carbon

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:44.060
monoxide into our environment.

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:46.100
And it's just there's
something about that,

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:49.715
to me, that feels really
relevant in luxury brands today

00:30:49.715 --> 00:30:54.140
is how do you figure out how to
connect to today's consumers,

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:56.770
connect to what we care
about in the world,

00:30:56.770 --> 00:31:00.330
whilst still having
a luxury offer?

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:03.530
EILEEN NAUGHTON: And in a world
of 7 and 1/2 billion people,

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:06.130
most of whom, if they can ever
afford something from Chanel,

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:07.270
it would be a lipstick.

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:09.860
And that would be an indulgence.

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.000
That's a tall--

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.549
MAUREEN CHIQUET:
That's a tall order.

00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:15.340
EILEEN NAUGHTON: --for
a brand like Chanel,

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:18.672
how to make it accessible
yet still retain

00:31:18.672 --> 00:31:19.630
its luxury [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:20.630
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Indeed.

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:23.240
But if you look at what a
great brand to do that in.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:28.340
You have a story, a true story,
a legendary story about a woman

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.830
who was an orphan.

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.390
She was a complete orphan.

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:33.980
It's a rags-to-riches story.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.440
She became a courtesan.

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.910
Husband And then she finally
started her own couture

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:41.120
business and became all the
rage and the top couturier

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.530
in all of Paris.

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:46.130
And besides, she changed
the way women could dress.

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:49.520
She liberated us from
corsets and long dresses.

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:53.330
So for me, that's a
contemporary story,

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:57.560
that iconoclastic
perspective, the subversion.

00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:00.590
She took menswear fabrics-- no
one had heard of doing this--

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:01.850
into women's design.

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:03.702
So when you have as rich as--

00:32:03.702 --> 00:32:05.410
EILEEN NAUGHTON: She
was a revolutionary.

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:06.140
That's fair.

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:08.473
MAUREEN CHIQUET: And you think
about it for women today.

00:32:08.473 --> 00:32:09.630
And I think about it.

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:11.497
And I think there
are other companies.

00:32:11.497 --> 00:32:13.580
There are companies that
are doing amazing things.

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:16.220
But I think it's slower
for luxury companies,

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:20.690
because sometimes the concerns
have been much more around just

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:23.150
that impeccably beautiful
product and service

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:25.850
rather than thinking about,
so consumers of today,

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:28.459
they're not just in this
transactional mode anymore.

00:32:28.459 --> 00:32:29.750
They don't just want the label.

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:31.130
They want to go beyond a label.

00:32:31.265 --> 00:32:33.473
EILEEN NAUGHTON: There's
something about authenticity

00:32:33.473 --> 00:32:38.070
that's really popping
in US culture,

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:43.245
but I think we see it popping
up in retail around the world.

00:32:43.245 --> 00:32:45.060
I'd love you to free associate.

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.733
You've already said Tesla,
obviously Chanel, great brand.

00:32:47.733 --> 00:32:50.070
We talked a little
bit about Rag &amp; Bone.

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:53.280
But what's in the brand that
really stand out for you?

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.740
MAUREEN CHIQUET: --that
resonate with me right now.

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.765
I love REI.

00:32:57.765 --> 00:33:00.360
I just think it is amazing--

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:03.629
opt out on Black Friday.

00:33:03.629 --> 00:33:04.920
It's not just a marketing move.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:07.967
And you know that, because
they care about being outside.

00:33:07.967 --> 00:33:09.050
And you know what I think?

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:11.260
And I think about luxury,
and this may sound crazy.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.810
But what is luxury today?

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:15.830
It's time, right?

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:18.030
We both said that
at the same time.

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:21.180
It's getting outdoors, because
that's rarer and rarer.

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:24.330
It's connecting with
friends and with oneself.

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:27.950
So I love REI for the way
that it taps into the outdoors

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:28.700
and what it means.

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:30.950
I actually think Nike's
doing a really good job.

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:34.650
Big company, but equality
has no boundaries.

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:36.030
That is, to me--

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:38.610
that made me want to
run out and buy Nike.

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:40.710
So they're connecting to
something I care about,

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:43.365
and they're still making
great innovative products.

00:33:43.365 --> 00:33:47.014
So you can't forget, for me, the
product is still the-- you've

00:33:47.014 --> 00:33:48.180
got to have a great product.

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:50.140
It starts with the product.

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:53.320
But you also have to,
today, offer more than that.

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.620
And I think those are the
two examples just that I've

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:58.110
been kind of following a bit.

00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:59.880
I was looking at--

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:03.190
Reformation does anybody--
does anyone know that?

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.720
Yeah.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.540
It's an online
clothing brand that's

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:09.719
really going after ethical
sourcing, ethical products,

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:13.020
things that don't
rob our environment

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.473
of natural resources.

00:34:14.473 --> 00:34:16.139
And I think it's an
interesting concept.

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:18.210
I don't know where it will go.

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:21.500
But I'm hopeful that we can get
more of that kind of attitude

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.274
and environment into fashion.

00:34:23.274 --> 00:34:24.690
EILEEN NAUGHTON:
So when did you--

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:27.960
for how long did you know
you had a book inside of you?

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.550
Because that's a
brave thing to do.

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:31.820
It's time-consuming.

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:32.736
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Very.

00:34:32.736 --> 00:34:34.645
EILEEN NAUGHTON: It's
extremely personal.

00:34:34.645 --> 00:34:37.539
And you share you're vulnerable.

00:34:37.539 --> 00:34:38.580
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Totally.

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:41.163
EILEEN NAUGHTON: You don't know
what the reaction of the press

00:34:41.163 --> 00:34:42.040
will be.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:46.630
You were a fair-haired
CEO everyone knew.

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:52.360
And now you're an author with
a completely new orientation

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:56.365
towards your professional
life, which is still a journey.

00:34:56.365 --> 00:34:58.260
MAUREEN CHIQUET:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.634
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Were you
itching to do this for a while?

00:35:00.634 --> 00:35:02.760
MAUREEN CHIQUET: You know,
I never considered it.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.530
It's funny, because
any of my jobs,

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:07.650
I've never considered
before I kind of got

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:09.930
at the doorstep of
them that that's

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:11.541
what I wanted or could do.

00:35:11.541 --> 00:35:13.290
So with writing, I was
a literature major.

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:14.890
Sounds kind of logical.

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:16.830
And I've read.

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:17.790
I love reading.

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:20.670
I love stories,
especially fiction.

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:24.240
And so what happened is when
we did the Active and Conscious

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.762
Leadership Journey,
I wanted to share it.

00:35:26.762 --> 00:35:29.220
I really wanted to share it,
and I started with an article.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:32.460
Could not get the article
down to a reasonable size.

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:36.380
And I meant an independent
editor who said, listen--

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:39.870
was a great question asker and
was pulling ideas out of me.

00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:42.720
And she said, why
don't you write a book?

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.120
And at first I was like,
no, I can't write a book.

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.520
And I realized
that actually I had

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.250
a lot of things
that I had learned

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:53.760
and stories that I wanted to
share to provoke questions--

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.480
I ask questions in the book--

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.100
observations, so that I
could help other people

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:00.894
create their own
paths to success.

00:36:00.894 --> 00:36:02.310
And when you read
the book, you'll

00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:06.180
see it's not a set of rules
or dictates or how to.

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:07.950
I don't give a lot
of instructions

00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:11.460
because I feel like everybody
has his or her own journey.

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:14.760
But this is really
about reading, opening

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:18.600
somebody else's journey up,
asking yourself some questions,

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:23.130
looking in the mirror, and
using some of those observations

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:25.344
for your own lives and
for your own careers.

00:36:25.344 --> 00:36:27.510
EILEEN NAUGHTON: You're
clearly a courageous person.

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:30.930
For a teenager, who decided
to study abroad in France one

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:32.670
summer, fell in love
with goat cheese.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:32.930
Love to hear more about that.

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:33.470
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Yeah.

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:34.310
Yeah.

00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:35.820
EILEEN NAUGHTON:
And that somewhat

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:39.504
set you on a trajectory
that has you here today.

00:36:39.504 --> 00:36:40.420
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Yeah.

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:42.450
EILEEN NAUGHTON: I mean,
did you consciously

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:44.714
know that you were a
bit of an adventurer?

00:36:44.714 --> 00:36:46.380
MAUREEN CHIQUET: You
know, I don't think

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:47.588
I thought of it as adventure.

00:36:47.588 --> 00:36:49.800
I fell in love with France.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:50.870
I think I'm very curious.

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:53.040
I'm exceedingly curious.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.050
But I fell in love with
the notion of France

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:57.690
because my father spoke
really fluent French.

00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:59.469
He had learned
without a textbook.

00:36:59.469 --> 00:37:02.010
And believe it or not, I think
that was so interesting and so

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:02.510
effective.

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:05.010
He spoke with beautiful accent.

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:06.264
So I had looked up to my dad.

00:37:06.264 --> 00:37:07.680
I wanted to speak
French like him.

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.450
I had a great French teacher.

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:12.030
And I decided, I got
in in my head one year,

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:14.290
I said to my parents--

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:15.820
oop, you have mic issues?

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:19.570
I said to my parents,
I must live in France.

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:21.790
I must go be with
a family because I

00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:23.020
have to have this language.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.000
This language, I want
to learn it to an extent

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.601
that nobody can tell
I'm an American.

00:37:27.601 --> 00:37:29.350
And the only way you
can do that, I think,

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:32.050
is really, other than my
dad's schooling, which

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:34.995
they weren't doing in my
school, is go immerse yourself

00:37:34.995 --> 00:37:35.620
in the culture.

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:38.260
And so I landed in
the south of France,

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.270
which was incredibly lucky.

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:42.670
And I stayed for a
month with a family.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:46.120
And my father was a
[FRENCH],, so he's a mechanic.

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.340
And I got to work
at the gas station.

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:53.320
And every morning the table
was set with fresh wildflowers,

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.720
and the light would
glow on the limestone,

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.670
and I would smell the lavender.

00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:00.070
And my senses just broke open.

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:03.276
It was almost like I
didn't know that I cared

00:38:03.276 --> 00:38:04.400
so much about these things.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.890
But the beauty,
the sheer beauty,

00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:08.890
and their appreciation of
it, the way they take it in--

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:12.050
[FRENCH],, which you know
is the hour that you

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:13.900
have the drink at night.

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:17.600
Everybody sits, and they
pour the pastis and common--

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.150
it's a moment to be
together, and it's a moment

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:21.670
to take in the surroundings.

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:26.800
And I found that absolutely
just refreshing, fascinating.

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:30.340
At the time in France, and
I had also later gone back

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:33.276
as a college junior,
I found a roommate.

00:38:33.276 --> 00:38:34.900
And you'll read about
this in the book.

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:38.530
She was very liberated about her
sexuality and about her body.

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:40.720
And I thought, that's
cool, because I grew up

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:41.920
in the Midwest.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:47.620
And it was women really weren't
supposed to be sexual beings.

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:48.700
I did not feel that way.

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:52.300
I felt like I was supposed to
be very, very careful with who

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:54.760
I was and buttoned up.

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:57.610
And so this liberation
really appealed to me.

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.820
EILEEN NAUGHTON:
I love that story.

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:03.250
I'm going to invite-- now we
have questions on the Dory.

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:05.680
I can keep talking, and I have
plenty I could ask Maureen.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:06.900
But there are a lot
of people in the room.

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.860
There are mics, and
there are Dory questions.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:14.590
So I don't want to
completely dominate the Q&amp;A.

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:16.330
Anyone in the room so motivated?

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:18.310
We're going to have
to get you a mic.

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:20.037
You can take mine for a second.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:23.920
AUDIENCE: Hi, Maureen.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:26.170
So you mentioned
what luxury means

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:29.140
to everybody in today's
society a little bit, tired

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:30.400
and being outdoors.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.620
So I'm also from St. Louis.

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:33.610
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Yay.

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:36.137
AUDIENCE: And I did a little
Wikipedia research earlier.

00:39:36.137 --> 00:39:38.220
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Where'd
you grow up in St. Louis?

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:38.800
AUDIENCE: Clayton.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.310
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Oh, cool.

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:39.897
[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:39.897 --> 00:39:41.730
AUDIENCE: I know you
went to John Burroughs.

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:43.330
MAUREEN CHIQUET: I did go
to John Burroughs, yeah.

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:44.210
EILEEN NAUGHTON:
There are no secrets.

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:45.550
MAUREEN CHIQUET: No secrets.

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:46.700
But she knows the area.

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:49.930
It's like we can speak
each other's language.

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:52.430
AUDIENCE: So I'm curious from
John Burroughs in St. Louis

00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:54.460
to leading one of the
most coveted fashion

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:57.670
houses in the world, how has
your personal interpretation

00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:59.110
of luxury evolved over time?

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.551
MAUREEN CHIQUET: That's
really interesting.

00:40:01.551 --> 00:40:03.550
You know, I think I
always loved luxury,

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:06.190
but I wouldn't have
called it luxury.

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:08.365
Once I had that
experience in France,

00:40:08.365 --> 00:40:10.810
I realized that I loved
beautiful things and just

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:13.090
the make, the way
they feel, things

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:17.920
that smell good, great, great
food, things on the palate.

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.250
I love music.

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:22.600
And so I think the
initial thing that

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.820
drew me was beauty and
not this notion of luxury.

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:27.940
By the way, I find beauty in
things that aren't expensive,

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:28.780
a lot of beauty.

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:31.930
And in fact, one of my
early experiences at L'Oreal

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:34.330
was I was driving in
coal-mining country.

00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:38.410
And it was a foggy
industrial area.

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:42.460
And I rolled down my window, and
I noticed this purple mountain

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.650
of coal debris.

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:47.410
And it was glistening in sort
of the early morning hazy sun.

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:50.120
And I thought,
that's so beautiful.

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:53.380
There's a beauty in that,
even though, in a way,

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:56.260
it represents something
that's about hardship

00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:58.660
and about difficult
living conditions.

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:00.010
But that was the beauty.

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:02.980
The beauty wasn't the
perfect aesthetic.

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:05.700
The beauty was actually
the story it told.

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:06.700
So that was my initial--

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:09.970
I don't know that I've changed
that much on that, by the way,

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:12.910
because, to me, to luxury,
and I think recently now I'm

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:17.200
realizing that luxury is
so much more than objects.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.480
It really is this
notion of being

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.600
able to have time, being
able to have space outdoors

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.490
and with the people
who you love.

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:26.650
To me, that's what I think
where I've evolved to.

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:29.200
But in the beginning, and
I think it's still in me,

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.882
that notion of beauty is
imperfection not perfection.

00:41:32.882 --> 00:41:34.090
EILEEN NAUGHTON: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:36.070
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Yep, exactly.

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:37.850
And it's in the story.

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:39.940
It's in the story
that there is beauty.

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:41.800
And it doesn't have
to be this kind

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.310
of aesthetic plastic thing.

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:46.969
Thanks for asking.

00:41:46.969 --> 00:41:47.510
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:48.670
I'm also from St. Louis.

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:49.580
No, just kidding.

00:41:50.775 --> 00:41:54.950
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Wow, was going
to be like, you go, St. Louis.

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:56.210
AUDIENCE: I'm from Paris.

00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:59.630
And by the way, I love France
as described by Americas.

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:01.330
It sounds amazing.

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:04.130
So I wanted to ask, you
have been CEO of Chanel

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:05.090
for a long time.

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:06.840
What keeps you motivated?

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.710
And how did you reinvent
yourself all these years

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:11.645
to keep being a
great visionary CEO?

00:42:11.645 --> 00:42:13.520
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Oh,
that's a great question.

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.600
Thank you.

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.480
I think, interestingly
enough, it

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:21.470
was pretty easy from about
2007 on because of what

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:23.060
was happening in the world.

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:26.300
And our business was exploding.

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:30.620
So I was being motivated just
by trying to actually keep

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:35.420
this historical brand, this
incredibly beautiful house

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:38.990
moving into the future, without
compromising or sacrificing

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:40.480
the things that
made it so special.

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.480
And it kept me motivated
because every day there

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:44.930
was a new-- we'd
wake up one morning,

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:48.920
and there was yet another social
media platform to consider.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.711
Or we'd have--

00:42:50.711 --> 00:42:53.210
In fashion, what's great is you
always have new collections.

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:54.950
So there's a new
collection to figure out

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:57.530
how to communicate
to your customers,

00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:59.090
how to sell it to
your customers,

00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:01.050
and how to create
desire all the time.

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:04.670
So for me, that actually
wasn't difficult.

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:06.920
Towards the end of, I guess,
the last three years when

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.080
I was doing active and
conscious leadership,

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.520
I was actually discovering
beauty in people.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:14.100
And so what was really
keeping me motivated

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:17.930
was watching this team, and this
big team, and getting, I mean,

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:19.670
hundreds of letters
from people who

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:23.000
said that this work had
changed their lives.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.445
That was really,
really motivating me.

00:43:25.445 --> 00:43:28.130
It's like, how do
you, in a company,

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:30.860
get people to tap into
what they love best,

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.864
where they can bring value,
and how they connect that

00:43:33.864 --> 00:43:35.030
to the purpose of the brand.

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:36.446
And when you do
that, and you guys

00:43:36.446 --> 00:43:39.360
know because Google's such
great place, when you do that,

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:42.500
you get incredible work out
of people, and they're happy.

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:44.820
So that kept me
really motivated.

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:45.330
Thank you.

00:43:49.098 --> 00:43:50.890
AUDIENCE: Hi, Maureen.

00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:52.710
Thank you so much for coming.

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:53.305
MAUREEN CHIQUET:
Thanks for having me.

00:43:53.305 --> 00:43:54.010
EILEEN NAUGHTON: And
where are you from?

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:55.435
Because this is typical Google.

00:43:55.435 --> 00:43:56.502
We're from all over.

00:43:56.502 --> 00:43:58.210
AUDIENCE: Well, I'm
originally from India

00:43:58.210 --> 00:44:01.180
but in California for a while.

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:03.205
So I had a question around
the inflection points

00:44:03.205 --> 00:44:03.830
in your career.

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:06.730
Could you speak a little
bit about what brought you

00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:09.370
to your next
opportunity from L'Oreal

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:11.662
to Gap to Chanel because
these are so different.

00:44:11.662 --> 00:44:12.995
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Great question.

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:20.620
So the L'Oreal story is that
after three years I was there,

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:23.100
and I loved it there, I was
learning all about marketing.

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:25.240
By the way, I did not
go to business school.

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:29.440
So there's always I had to
learn all the techniques

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:32.830
or technical terms, what
marketing really was,

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:35.230
UPS, and market segmentation.

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:37.450
And everybody around me had
gone to business school.

00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:39.400
So I had a lot of
catching up to do.

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:42.370
But I realized that my
one gift that I had is I

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:44.530
could see image, and
I could understand

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:47.470
what emotion was created.

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:49.687
The thing is, is
after three years,

00:44:49.687 --> 00:44:51.520
I didn't see a lot of
women at the top then.

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:52.940
And it's changed so much.

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:55.530
I mean, L'Oreal is now one of
the best companies for that.

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:57.360
But back then it wasn't.

00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.470
And in the meantime,
my husband had an offer

00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:01.360
to go to Indonesia.

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:02.170
And I didn't want--

00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:03.380
I didn't see myself there.

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:07.160
And so we decided to pick up
and come to San Francisco.

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:09.100
So this is the funny
inflection point

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:10.900
about getting into retail.

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:13.930
If you had asked me,
even leaving L'Oreal,

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:15.720
can you see yourself
in fashion or retail?

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.136
I would have said,
absolutely not.

00:45:17.136 --> 00:45:17.950
I'm a marketer.

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:19.220
So I come to San Francisco.

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:20.303
Now, this is not so smart.

00:45:20.303 --> 00:45:21.600
We didn't have jobs.

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.500
And we had about,
I don't know, maybe

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:24.640
a month or two of savings.

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:25.264
So that was it.

00:45:25.264 --> 00:45:27.670
And it was sort of like,
you got to get a job.

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:28.900
So I started interviewing.

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:31.130
This is, I guess, in 1989.

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:32.344
I started interviewing.

00:45:32.344 --> 00:45:33.760
And I realized
that at this point,

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.860
I have the label in my
own head of what I am.

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:37.175
I have an expectation.

00:45:37.175 --> 00:45:38.050
It's called marketer.

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:39.880
It's, you know,
fixed on my head.

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.280
So I go to the two
packaged goods companies,

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:46.800
biggest in the Bay at the
time, Clorox and Del Monte.

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.760
OK, Del Monte
doesn't call me back.

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:50.934
I mean, I don't even
get my foot in the door.

00:45:50.934 --> 00:45:52.600
I get one interview
at Clorox, and like,

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:53.830
you don't have an MBA.

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:54.880
What are you doing here?

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.560
But also I realized,
wait a minute.

00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:00.220
I don't think I want to be on
photo shoots for toilet bowls.

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:04.510
I respect them.

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:06.377
But I don't think
this is right for me.

00:46:06.377 --> 00:46:07.960
And so I'm walking
down Market Street,

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:09.880
and you ask about
inflection point,

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:11.890
and I see this poster
of Miles Davis.

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:15.697
And Miles Davis, jazz great,
and his head is in his hands.

00:46:15.697 --> 00:46:17.530
He's got this soulful
look, and he's wearing

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:20.770
a black T-shirt that says Gap.

00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:23.210
I'm like, I want to market that.

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:25.790
Well, the story goes,
snail mail, at this time,

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:28.310
I send my resume a week
later, or whatever it was.

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:30.849
I got a call from the recruiter.

00:46:30.849 --> 00:46:32.390
He said, what do
you want to do here?

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:33.590
I said, I want to
market The Gap.

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:34.715
He said, you're a merchant.

00:46:34.715 --> 00:46:36.110
I said, I'm a what?

00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:37.806
I mean, what does a merchant do?

00:46:37.806 --> 00:46:38.930
I don't want to sell stuff.

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:40.305
Like, I'm not a
good salesperson.

00:46:40.305 --> 00:46:42.080
I had learned that in
the north of France.

00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:42.700
I'm not going to--

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:44.180
I don't think I should
do that anymore.

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:45.596
So he said, no,
no, no, a merchant

00:46:45.596 --> 00:46:46.849
works with design teams.

00:46:46.849 --> 00:46:48.890
They help to create the
products and assortments,

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:51.770
and they figure out how much to
buy and where to source them.

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:54.260
So that was the-- but the
inflection point, if I think

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:56.220
about it, I mean, two things.

00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:58.250
One was being in
a company where I

00:46:58.250 --> 00:47:01.010
wasn't sure I could
progress and wasn't sure

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:03.830
that I had the means to do
what I really thought I wanted

00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:06.300
to do, or at least grow.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:09.500
And then the second thing was
seeing that poster and saying--

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:10.790
so that was one transition.

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:12.980
And then I guess the
second inflection point

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:15.180
was getting that call
from a headhunter

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:17.100
while I was at Old Navy.

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:20.330
I'm still selling $5 cheese
out of the back of a truck.

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:24.000
And they say, a French
luxury company's interested.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.890
Now, at this point in my
life, I was missing France.

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:29.550
We were living on
the West Coast.

00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:31.744
We'd been here for 15 years.

00:47:31.744 --> 00:47:34.160
And just the notion of working
in a French luxury company,

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.354
getting back to my--

00:47:35.354 --> 00:47:36.520
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Your dream.

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.853
MAUREEN CHIQUET: It was a dream.

00:47:37.853 --> 00:47:39.800
It was absolutely a dream.

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:42.580
And then I learned
about Chanel's story,

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:44.690
who she was as a person.

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:46.820
And I thought,
this is new for me.

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:49.790
This is going to be
the next challenge.

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:52.670
So again, and I never imagined
that I would be doing that,

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:54.740
I think, ever in my life.

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:58.190
But it's just sort of being open
and opportunistic, in a sense,

00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:01.060
and seeing those things
and hearing those things.

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:03.560
And of course, I got
that wonderful call.

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:04.880
But you know, it's funny.

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:07.410
I'll tell you the
funniest story about that.

00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:08.680
This is-- Gap--

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:12.230
let's see, what was it, about
2001 when I got the call.

00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:16.200
Now, Gap was the center
of the universe back then.

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:18.020
Chanel was small.

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:22.350
And I thought it was a
brand for older women.

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:23.990
Like, I didn't know
that Chanel could

00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:27.050
be young and hip, because it
wasn't so young and hip then.

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:30.260
So for me, it was actually--

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:31.029
it sounds crazy.

00:48:31.029 --> 00:48:31.820
It was a huge risk.

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:33.361
I had to moved move
my entire family.

00:48:33.361 --> 00:48:35.240
My kids were 11 and 8.

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:40.135
So I moved them from their
cozy little Mill Valley slash

00:48:40.135 --> 00:48:43.315
Tiburon existence first
to Paris for a year

00:48:43.315 --> 00:48:44.190
and then to New York.

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:47.130
So it was actually a huge risk.

00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:48.860
And I didn't think--
you know, I didn't--

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:51.905
at the time, I wasn't sure.

00:48:51.905 --> 00:48:53.530
But I ended up
thinking, you know what?

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:55.896
There's something about
this that feels right.

00:48:55.896 --> 00:48:57.582
EILEEN NAUGHTON:
Trust your instincts.

00:48:57.582 --> 00:48:59.040
MAUREEN CHIQUET:
Long story, sorry.

00:48:59.040 --> 00:48:59.190
But--

00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:00.856
EILEEN NAUGHTON: No,
no, it's excellent.

00:49:00.856 --> 00:49:04.269
We're storytelling here
today at Boston Google.

00:49:04.269 --> 00:49:05.560
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:08.500
And my question is that,
were their key mentors

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:10.930
that you had along your journey?

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:14.170
And what kind of pivotal
role did they play for you?

00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:17.690
And then did that inspire
you to mentor others as well?

00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:20.720
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Oh, I have
mentored so many people,

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:23.210
and it's one of my
favorite, favorite things.

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:26.290
I had a lot of really
amazing mentors,

00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:29.350
both at Gap and even at Chanel.

00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:31.570
But one thing I
think about mentors,

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:33.490
because it's kind
of a hot topic--

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:35.530
we talk about it
a lot, especially

00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:36.655
amongst women mentors.

00:49:36.655 --> 00:49:38.290
And I think that's amazing.

00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:40.720
But I would encourage all
of you to think broadly

00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:44.120
about a mentor, because I
learned as much in so many ways

00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:49.390
from my friend in France, Fleur,
in the book, who taught me

00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:51.130
about being
comfortable as a woman,

00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:52.990
being comfortable
in your own body.

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:55.690
I would say I learned
in so many ways as much

00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:57.790
from her, as I have some
of my greatest mentors,

00:49:57.790 --> 00:50:01.030
like Jenny Ming, who was running
Old Navy, and Mickey Drexler,

00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:02.470
who was the CEO of Gap.

00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:06.460
So mentoring doesn't have
to be a hierarchical thing.

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:08.530
I think it's really
about getting somebody

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:13.120
with whom you can share
conversations, stories,

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:14.290
you can ask questions.

00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:16.570
I mean, a lot of mentors
will-- mentees, I guess,

00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:21.310
is how we term that, have asked
me, so what do I do about that?

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:22.990
And I never answer.

00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:26.140
Instead what I do is I ask
some more questions about what

00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:28.654
they care about, where
they want to go with this.

00:50:28.654 --> 00:50:30.070
And what ends up
happening is they

00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:32.500
find answers that are
better than any answer

00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:33.670
that I could give.

00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:37.540
And so for me, that
means that mentors

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:39.710
can be a broad range of people.

00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:41.500
And it doesn't have
to be somebody who is

00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:43.875
really impressive or higher up.

00:50:43.875 --> 00:50:45.250
EILEEN NAUGHTON:
In your book you

00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:47.530
talk about, just to
follow on this getting

00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:49.195
comfortable in
your own body, you

00:50:49.195 --> 00:50:51.550
talk about spending a
long time in your career

00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:55.330
operating in a masculine frame.

00:50:55.330 --> 00:50:57.532
When did you realize that
wasn't working for you?

00:50:57.532 --> 00:50:58.990
Or did it work for
you for a while,

00:50:58.990 --> 00:51:02.464
and you just decided to
move beyond that label?

00:51:02.464 --> 00:51:03.880
MAUREEN CHIQUET:
It's interesting.

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:05.176
I never thought of it.

00:51:05.176 --> 00:51:06.550
I never really
thought of it when

00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:09.730
I was at Gap, first of
all, because I think we

00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:12.430
were such drivers of business.

00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:14.290
And while leadership
and management

00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:16.060
was incredibly
important, and Gap

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:19.880
was progressive in this, the one
thing that Gap had done for me,

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:20.880
they'd given me a coach.

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:24.400
So I'd already been working on
my own leadership capabilities

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.270
and learning even
more how to listen.

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:29.070
I have a funny story
in there about once

00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:32.295
when Mickey Drexler
taught me how to listen.

00:51:32.295 --> 00:51:35.140
It was a very tough
story, another one

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:37.900
of those embarrassing
moments, but--

00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:40.280
so I was aware of
this in myself.

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.340
But I wasn't so
aware that it would

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:44.980
be those feminine qualities.

00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:47.650
By the way, I didn't label
them feminine qualities.

00:51:47.650 --> 00:51:49.270
Sociologists and
researchers are now

00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:51.730
saying these are
feminine qualities,

00:51:51.730 --> 00:51:53.920
but can be found
in men and women.

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:56.320
In fact, they happen to
be intrinsic to women,

00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.870
but both men and women
share these qualities.

00:51:58.870 --> 00:52:01.420
So once I started, I
didn't notice that,

00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:03.640
or I didn't think about
it that way, I would say,

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.590
when I was at The Gap.

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:08.350
Once I got to
Chanel, as I realized

00:52:08.350 --> 00:52:12.970
that I had to shift from the
drive out of the strategy

00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:16.030
and vision and focus and all the
things that had made me really

00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:18.150
successful, that I
had to actually use

00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:21.600
those other things that I was
also aware of and working on.

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:24.640
That those things would become
more important-- or not more

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:27.340
important-- those things that
least have to be integrated.

00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:30.430
And the one thing I think about
sort of this masculine-feminine

00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:32.440
thing that a lot of
people are talking that--

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:33.730
I don't love the labels.

00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:34.790
I really don't.

00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:39.190
And I think different people
have different qualities.

00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:42.460
But what I see is that great
leaders actually combine.

00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:44.680
So they know when to be firm.

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:47.890
They know when to be strategic
and focused and determined.

00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:51.070
And they know when to
listen and to be empathetic.

00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:53.740
So that the balance
of great leaders

00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:55.280
is what I'm really intrigued by.

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:58.390
And if you watch great
leaders, you can really, really

00:52:58.390 --> 00:53:03.400
see that they are toggling quite
a bit in all different ways,

00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:07.110
I should say,
multi-dimensionally.

00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:09.610
AUDIENCE: Maureen, thank you
so much for sharing your story.

00:53:09.610 --> 00:53:11.740
You have an incredible career.

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:15.880
And if you were to look back
and talk to your young self

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:18.490
as you were just starting
out in your career, what's

00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:22.150
the one piece of advice
you would give yourself?

00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:23.830
MAUREEN CHIQUET:
Well, I'll tell you,

00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:25.690
because people told me
this, but I look back

00:53:25.690 --> 00:53:29.630
and I think about this
a lot, two things.

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:33.100
One is I was so
serious, and I was so--

00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:34.270
I was really serious.

00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:37.090
I took everything to
heart all the time.

00:53:37.090 --> 00:53:38.800
And I had it, and
I still have it.

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:39.550
I'm working at it.

00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:40.790
It's work in progress.

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:42.960
So my young self and
my old self share this.

00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:46.780
I have a big self critic.

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:49.120
And I think I would
have actually just tried

00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:52.540
to quiet the critic a
little bit, and at times

00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:55.362
that I was really
beating myself up a lot.

00:53:55.362 --> 00:53:57.820
The other thing, and we haven't
talked about this much here

00:53:57.820 --> 00:54:00.236
today, but in light of those
things we were talking about,

00:54:00.236 --> 00:54:01.030
I have two kids.

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:06.100
And I was traveling a lot,
every three weeks just about,

00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:07.570
since I was at Gap.

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:10.690
And I raised both the
girls, and Antoine was there

00:54:10.690 --> 00:54:15.010
as the stay-at-home dad,
which was, at that time--

00:54:15.010 --> 00:54:16.600
at The Gap it wasn't so unusual.

00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:19.780
But outside The Gap was,
and we took a lot of flak.

00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:20.707
And it was really--

00:54:20.707 --> 00:54:22.540
there's a painful story
in there about this.

00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:26.740
But I would have loved to have
some conversations with my kids

00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:28.450
about what that
was like for them

00:54:28.450 --> 00:54:29.830
and what that was like for me.

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:34.252
And I think I was so grateful
to Antoine that he was home

00:54:34.252 --> 00:54:35.710
and that he was
taking care of them

00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:37.360
that I thought
everything's fine.

00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:39.400
But in fact, and you'll
read it in the book,

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:41.670
there's a story that
everything wasn't that fine,

00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:45.220
and that these are hard
things to grapple with.

00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:46.930
You're in a
wonderful environment

00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:49.810
here, where you have
flexible working schedules.

00:54:49.810 --> 00:54:52.620
But I do think it's
things aren't perfect.

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:55.300
And this thing called
perfect work-life balance,

00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:56.350
it's another label.

00:54:56.350 --> 00:54:58.870
It's another label that I
feel really uncomfortable--

00:54:58.870 --> 00:55:00.400
it makes us feel--

00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:02.350
I think it disappoints
us automatically.

00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:04.210
You set yourself up
for disappointment

00:55:04.210 --> 00:55:06.820
and for feeling guilty, as a
mother or father, by the way.

00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:10.210
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Yeah, I call
it managed disequilibrium.

00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:13.420
And sometimes work win,
and sometimes family wins.

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:15.880
And as an individual,
you have to make sure you

00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:17.770
win every so often, because--

00:55:17.770 --> 00:55:20.170
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Otherwise
no one actually wins.

00:55:20.170 --> 00:55:23.740
EILEEN NAUGHTON: But
knowing that it's never

00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:25.719
in perfect balance
is liberating.

00:55:25.719 --> 00:55:27.010
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Yeah, exactly.

00:55:27.010 --> 00:55:30.840
Well, yeah, and you
live with the sadness.

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:33.400
I mean, I cried on
planes to Hong Kong.

00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:35.740
I remember just leaving
those little kids,

00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:37.690
and I didn't want to leave--

00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:40.140
lonely hotel rooms at night.

00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:41.820
But you also know
where you show up.

00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:45.670
And where you show up for
me was I had two girls.

00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:48.230
It was the emotional
ways of crying

00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:51.190
on Mommy's shoulder and
hugs at night and just

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:53.680
when I could support
them emotionally and then

00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:55.540
schoolwork, because
Antoine is French,

00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:59.470
so he didn't know the American
school system quite as well.

00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:02.410
And trying to really,
really be present

00:56:02.410 --> 00:56:05.260
in those moments when
you are there, I think,

00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:09.250
is so, so, so important, but
not to the extent that you get

00:56:09.250 --> 00:56:12.660
exhausted yourself, because
then you're not present.

00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:14.660
AUDIENCE: So the first
question is, can you

00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:17.090
share some practical
advice on cultivating

00:56:17.090 --> 00:56:19.225
sponsors and champions
in the organization?

00:56:19.225 --> 00:56:20.600
MAUREEN CHIQUET:
Practical advice

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:23.950
in cultivating sponsors and
champions in the organization--

00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:28.130
yeah, I think, that's a great
point, or great question.

00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:30.365
For me, again, it was about--

00:56:30.365 --> 00:56:32.240
and I think about my
own personal experience,

00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:35.630
because, by the way, I
didn't necessarily have,

00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:38.870
at Chanel, that many sponsors
other than the owners

00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:40.730
at the time, because
nobody knew me.

00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:42.980
And while they
wanted to like me,

00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:46.010
my experience didn't
fit the exact profile

00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:49.520
of what they thought should
probably lead the company.

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:53.660
So it really was about
listening and about being

00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:55.010
on their side of the table.

00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:59.570
And to actually get champions
means that, for me, it's

00:56:59.570 --> 00:57:01.170
a two-way street.

00:57:01.170 --> 00:57:03.650
It's not about
convincing someone.

00:57:03.650 --> 00:57:05.960
It's not about telling
someone what to do.

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:08.450
It's actually about living
in their world and with them

00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:11.986
and what they do, and then
you co-champion something.

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:19.482
AUDIENCE: Did Mr.
Lagerfeld participate

00:57:19.482 --> 00:57:21.440
in the Active and Conscious
Leadership Journey?

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:23.150
MAUREEN CHIQUET: No.

00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:25.930
No, no, no.

00:57:25.930 --> 00:57:30.305
No, I have been a huge--
oh, well, I'll answer that.

00:57:30.305 --> 00:57:31.180
Then I'll get to you.

00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:34.130
I have been such a huge
admirer of creativity.

00:57:34.130 --> 00:57:37.450
I think when you think
of creativity, the word,

00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:41.250
you think of Karl Lagerfeld,
in the fashion industry anyway.

00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:44.590
And I've worked with amazing,
amazing creative people at Gap,

00:57:44.590 --> 00:57:47.330
at Banana Republic, at
Old Navy, and at L'Oreal.

00:57:47.330 --> 00:57:50.110
In fact, my early, early
experiences were at L'Oreal.

00:57:50.110 --> 00:57:53.140
What I noticed is working
with someone creative means

00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:56.050
giving them the
space, the resources

00:57:56.050 --> 00:57:57.500
to do what they do best.

00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:01.830
And to me, that was what
was really important.

00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:03.850
AUDIENCE: Hi, it
seems in you career

00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:05.620
you've held a lot
of different titles,

00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:07.600
and part of what
your success was,

00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:09.700
was not holding yourself
or defining yourself

00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:11.005
to a certain label.

00:58:11.005 --> 00:58:12.637
But I was also
wondering, I think

00:58:12.637 --> 00:58:14.470
for a lot of people in
their career journey,

00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:16.690
they have to sort of
eventually find somewhere

00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:19.330
where they specialize
in or where, like,

00:58:19.330 --> 00:58:21.310
that that's an
area that they own.

00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:23.920
So I'm wondering how
that journey was for you

00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:26.487
in kind of figuring out
what you specialize in

00:58:26.487 --> 00:58:28.570
or what skill sets you
bring to the table and then

00:58:28.570 --> 00:58:30.007
how that evolved over time?

00:58:30.007 --> 00:58:32.590
MAUREEN CHIQUET: That's a great
question, and I appreciate it.

00:58:32.590 --> 00:58:34.173
You know, I actually
think there are--

00:58:34.173 --> 00:58:37.420
I always say there are three
groups of questions you ask--

00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:40.180
what do I love so much
that I can't live without?

00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:41.800
Beyond the label
and beyond the roles

00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:45.400
and beyond the definitions,
what makes my heart sing?

00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:46.930
Where can I bring value?

00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:50.770
What is my greatest gift?

00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:54.220
And how do I connect those two
things, where I bring value

00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:55.380
and what I love?

00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:59.730
And then to sort of answer your
question, what context am I in?

00:58:59.730 --> 00:59:01.840
Sometimes you have
to take jobs that you

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:03.680
don't like for a while.

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:06.070
But I found that always
staying really close to what

00:59:06.070 --> 00:59:07.450
I cared about was something.

00:59:07.450 --> 00:59:10.420
And I learned it
early on at L'Oreal.

00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:12.850
There's a story in
the book about this.

00:59:12.850 --> 00:59:14.830
So here I had not been
to business school,

00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:18.110
and I was in marketing,
and everybody else had.

00:59:18.110 --> 00:59:19.780
So I didn't have
that advantage, and I

00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:21.700
had to figure out what
it was that-- what

00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:22.862
was my path, to your point.

00:59:22.862 --> 00:59:24.820
What was it that I really,
really wanted to do,

00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:26.500
and what was my mark?

00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:30.820
And it ended up I got invited
into some advertising meetings.

00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:35.130
And the art director in the
advertising agency, I just--

00:59:35.130 --> 00:59:38.020
I felt a connection with
what he was trying to do.

00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:41.570
And we had this big oval
tables, and I would find myself

00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:44.560
like kind of scooching over to
back to the advertising agent

00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:45.070
side.

00:59:45.070 --> 00:59:46.750
You know, you're supposed
to be this client and agent

00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:47.960
back in those days.

00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:52.172
And I found myself wanting so
badly to see through his eyes.

00:59:52.172 --> 00:59:53.630
And it turns out
we became friends.

00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:55.600
He's the one who
taught me about jazz.

00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:57.590
And we became friends
and spent a lot of time.

00:59:57.590 --> 00:59:59.530
And he spent a lot
of time showing me

00:59:59.530 --> 01:00:02.620
how he sees beauty, which is how
I thought about beauty as kind

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:04.945
of an imperfection because
he was showing me models,

01:00:04.945 --> 01:00:06.820
and they might have been
plastically perfect.

01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:10.570
But he said, but she's not
giving something to the camera.

01:00:10.570 --> 01:00:12.880
Like, he talked about
it in such cool terms.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:16.900
So I think from
my perspective, it

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:19.630
was really kind of
tapping into that

01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:23.140
what it is I care so much about
and how can I bring value.

01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:25.470
And in that environment,
for me, that was one place

01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:28.030
I could bring value because
it was different from what

01:00:28.030 --> 01:00:29.280
most everyone.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.280
Most everybody was doing
more classic marketing.

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.946
Not to say everybody,
there were great--

01:00:32.946 --> 01:00:34.840
you said it's a great
aesthetic company.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:38.119
But for me, that was
really what counted.

01:00:38.119 --> 01:00:39.660
EILEEN NAUGHTON: I
think we have time

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:41.052
for perhaps one more question.

01:00:41.052 --> 01:00:42.510
Anyone in the
audience or the Dory?

01:00:45.606 --> 01:00:46.730
Oh, a gentleman, I love it.

01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:53.125
AUDIENCE: Thank you
again very much--

01:00:53.125 --> 01:00:54.250
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Thank you.

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:55.374
AUDIENCE: --for being here.

01:00:55.374 --> 01:00:57.630
It's really incredible.

01:00:57.630 --> 01:01:02.560
So you've worked both
in Europe and here.

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:08.330
And you were, of course, a
female in the fashion world,

01:01:08.330 --> 01:01:12.500
with several stereotypes
about women and dominated

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:16.130
by male executives.

01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:18.590
What is your comment
about the attitude

01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:23.300
that you saw in France,
especially, but was here

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:27.500
and how this has
changed over the years.

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:30.810
I know there's a lot of
room for improvement,

01:01:30.810 --> 01:01:36.260
but some suggestions about
how to improve the attitudes

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:45.849
toward women and getting to
that state of really equal,

01:01:45.849 --> 01:01:46.890
no discrimination at all.

01:01:46.890 --> 01:01:47.420
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Equality
in the workplace, right?

01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:48.753
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's the idea.

01:01:49.253 --> 01:01:51.080
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Thanks
for that question.

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.871
First I'll say, you
know, it's interesting.

01:01:52.871 --> 01:01:55.340
I worked around the world, so
not just in France, but all

01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:56.840
over Europe, all over Asia.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:01.310
And each culture is different,
and it's almost impossible

01:02:01.310 --> 01:02:05.252
to even categorize them in
terms of their views of women.

01:02:05.252 --> 01:02:05.960
It's interesting.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.940
We were just talking
earlier because Eileen

01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:10.640
is on the L'Oreal board.

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:12.930
French companies
now actually have--

01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:15.605
they passed a law several
years ago requiring boards

01:02:15.605 --> 01:02:17.180
to have 40% women.

01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:22.100
So while they may seem like
more biased in the workplace,

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:24.140
I wouldn't say necessarily
that that's the case,

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:26.600
although there are fewer
women in top leadership.

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:30.170
There are also very few women in
top leadership in this country,

01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:33.110
and we're talking about 4% CEOs.

01:02:33.110 --> 01:02:37.130
4% of CEOs are women,
that is not a lot.

01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:41.450
My thoughts about this
are kind of clear.

01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:44.270
Equity in pay is obvious.

01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:47.980
Work-life arrangements that
help both women and men,

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:48.730
those are obvious.

01:02:48.730 --> 01:02:51.290
I mean, we have to
change these things.

01:02:51.290 --> 01:02:54.570
We can't-- I'm impressed
that Google has flex time.

01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:55.560
It's amazing.

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:59.090
But in my experience,
if we don't also

01:02:59.090 --> 01:03:02.510
start to integrate these
qualities of empathy

01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:06.050
and flexibility and
collaborative skills

01:03:06.050 --> 01:03:09.320
and deep listening, if we
don't start to integrate those,

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:10.670
many women--

01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:14.510
many women-- won't ever feel
as comfortable or as confident

01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:17.750
or as natural actually
being leaders.

01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:21.410
So I actually think that
there's an attitude shift

01:03:21.410 --> 01:03:25.700
that we need to make to get more
women confident in those roles,

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:28.310
past the, I call
it, the hard stuff,

01:03:28.310 --> 01:03:32.630
meaning the pay issues and
the work-life arrangements.

01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:35.300
We need to expand our
frame of leadership.

01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:38.210
We need to look at leadership
differently and consider

01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:41.160
that there are other qualities
both required for the world,

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.337
but also that are
intrinsic to women

01:03:43.337 --> 01:03:45.170
and make women actually
really good leaders.

01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:47.060
And the good news about
this is, by the way,

01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:50.870
and there's research done about
on this, that women leaders,

01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:53.120
where women are leaders and
where they're on boards,

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.420
those entities perform better.

01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:58.900
So this is a win-win
for everybody.

01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:01.220
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Well,
that's a perfect statement

01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:03.820
to end this talk on Maureen.

01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:08.450
We have a lot of discussion at
Google on these very issues.

01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:11.100
Especially lately, there's
been a lot in the news

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:14.690
around gender parity, pay
parity in the tech industry.

01:04:14.690 --> 01:04:18.680
And we're very, very
convicted about ensuring

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:22.530
that you get paid for the job
you do, not for the person

01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:23.250
you are.

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:26.060
Talent and tenure and
performance in the role

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:30.320
matters, but gender has
no place in that equation.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:34.050
So thank you, Maureen,
for sharing your Active

01:04:34.050 --> 01:04:36.050
and Conscious Leadership
Journey with us.

01:04:36.050 --> 01:04:36.490
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Thank you.

01:04:36.490 --> 01:04:38.920
EILEEN NAUGHTON: I can
see you're on the journey,

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:42.900
and there's probably a
lot more interesting acts

01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:45.810
that we're going to read
about or hear about.

01:04:45.810 --> 01:04:47.130
So best of luck to you.

01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:47.570
Thank you for spending
time at Google today.

01:04:47.570 --> 01:04:48.620
MAUREEN CHIQUET: Thank you.

01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:49.300
Thanks, everyone.

01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:50.000
Thanks to all Googlers.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:50.840
You're amazing.

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:53.590
