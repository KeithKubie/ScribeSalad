seventy fold and then tubal Cain pops up

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389
seventy fold and then tubal Cain pops up
 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.450
seventy fold and then tubal Cain pops up
on the horizon and he's the person who

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460
on the horizon and he's the person who
 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.259
on the horizon and he's the person who
makes artifices of war and so the story

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269
makes artifices of war and so the story
 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.620
makes artifices of war and so the story
in its fragmentary manner ties the

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630
in its fragmentary manner ties the
 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.660
in its fragmentary manner ties the
individual psychopathology that's

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670
individual psychopathology that's
 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.390
individual psychopathology that's
resentful and revenge seeking to the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400
resentful and revenge seeking to the
 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.910
resentful and revenge seeking to the
proclivity for broad scale warfare and

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920
proclivity for broad scale warfare and
 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.769
proclivity for broad scale warfare and
this really hit me because I was

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779
this really hit me because I was
 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.810
this really hit me because I was
interested particularly in what was

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820
interested particularly in what was
 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.550
interested particularly in what was
happening in the Nazi camps with the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560
happening in the Nazi camps with the
 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.370
happening in the Nazi camps with the
guards because the guards were

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380
guards because the guards were
 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.220
guards because the guards were
gratuitously cruel and I was very

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230
gratuitously cruel and I was very
 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.810
gratuitously cruel and I was very
curious about that and so here's an

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820
curious about that and so here's an
 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.490
curious about that and so here's an
interesting story this was in a book

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500
interesting story this was in a book
 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.369
interesting story this was in a book
called our ordinary Germans Hitler's

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379
called our ordinary Germans Hitler's
 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.590
called our ordinary Germans Hitler's
willing executioner's and it was a book

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600
willing executioner's and it was a book
 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.450
willing executioner's and it was a book
that was written about 30 years ago that

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460
that was written about 30 years ago that
 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.430
that was written about 30 years ago that
challenged the idea that the Nazi

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440
challenged the idea that the Nazi
 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.319
challenged the idea that the Nazi
phenomena was top-down order following

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329
phenomena was top-down order following
 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.479
phenomena was top-down order following
which I don't believe by the way I think

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489
which I don't believe by the way I think
 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.250
which I don't believe by the way I think
that's a very weak weak hypothesis

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260
that's a very weak weak hypothesis
 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.779
that's a very weak weak hypothesis
fascistic societies are fascistic at

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789
fascistic societies are fascistic at
 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.420
fascistic societies are fascistic at
every single level of organization

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430
every single level of organization

spiritually within the family within the
local community it's like a holograph

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939
local community it's like a holograph
 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.210
local community it's like a holograph
it's the same absolutely everywhere it's

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220
it's the same absolutely everywhere it's
 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.980
it's the same absolutely everywhere it's
not top-down I mean there are leaders

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990
not top-down I mean there are leaders
 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.600
not top-down I mean there are leaders
who get produced and maybe they catalyze

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610
who get produced and maybe they catalyze
 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.510
who get produced and maybe they catalyze
it but to blame it on the leaders is to

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520
it but to blame it on the leaders is to
 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.039
it but to blame it on the leaders is to
forget about the process by which the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049
forget about the process by which the
 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.740
forget about the process by which the
leaders come to be so no you don't get a

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750
leaders come to be so no you don't get a
 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.870
leaders come to be so no you don't get a
pass that way so here's one of the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880
pass that way so here's one of the
 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.340
pass that way so here's one of the
things that happened as the Nazis

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350
things that happened as the Nazis
 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.770
things that happened as the Nazis
started to lose the war so here's what

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
started to lose the war so here's what
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.940
started to lose the war so here's what
you should have done if you were a Nazi

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950
you should have done if you were a Nazi
 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.590
you should have done if you were a Nazi
and he wanted to win the war you should

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600
and he wanted to win the war you should
 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.789
and he wanted to win the war you should
have enslaved the Jews and the gypsies

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799
have enslaved the Jews and the gypsies
 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.399
have enslaved the Jews and the gypsies
and have them work right you have the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409
and have them work right you have the
 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.200
and have them work right you have the
head should have had them work for the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210
head should have had them work for the
 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.050
head should have had them work for the
benefit of the victory and then if you

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060
benefit of the victory and then if you
 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.490
benefit of the victory and then if you
wanted to liquidate them afterwards

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500
wanted to liquidate them afterwards
 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.350
wanted to liquidate them afterwards
that's the logical thing to do if you

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360
that's the logical thing to do if you
 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.749
that's the logical thing to do if you
want to win and we assume that Hitler

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759
want to win and we assume that Hitler
 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.700
want to win and we assume that Hitler
wanted to win but that's not a very

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710
wanted to win but that's not a very
 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.350
wanted to win but that's not a very
intelligent assumption why would you

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360
intelligent assumption why would you
 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.719
intelligent assumption why would you
assume that he wasn't exactly a good guy

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729
assume that he wasn't exactly a good guy
 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.429
assume that he wasn't exactly a good guy
so why should we assume that he was

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439
so why should we assume that he was
 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.950
so why should we assume that he was
aiming at the good that he was promoting

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960
aiming at the good that he was promoting
 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.170
aiming at the good that he was promoting
even in his own terms right

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180
even in his own terms right
 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.899
even in his own terms right
the glorious everlasting fourth Third

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909
the glorious everlasting fourth Third
 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.910
the glorious everlasting fourth Third
Reich right little rule for a thousand

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920
Reich right little rule for a thousand
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.130
Reich right little rule for a thousand
years and be a bastion of civilization

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140
years and be a bastion of civilization
 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.420
years and be a bastion of civilization
in music because that's the sort of

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430
in music because that's the sort of
 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.010
in music because that's the sort of
thing he purported to be interested in

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020
thing he purported to be interested in
 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.559
thing he purported to be interested in
well so what do you do with the Jews and

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569
well so what do you do with the Jews and
 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.410
well so what do you do with the Jews and
the gypsies well round them up fine it

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420
the gypsies well round them up fine it
 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.370
the gypsies well round them up fine it
slave them fine

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380
slave them fine
 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.200
slave them fine
you don't kill them you certainly don't

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210
you don't kill them you certainly don't
 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.990
you don't kill them you certainly don't
devote a substantial proportion of your

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000
devote a substantial proportion of your
 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.020
devote a substantial proportion of your
war resources while you're losing to

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030
war resources while you're losing to
 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.730
war resources while you're losing to
accelerate the rate at which the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740
accelerate the rate at which the
 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.680
accelerate the rate at which the
extermination is taking place because

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690
extermination is taking place because
 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.570
extermination is taking place because
that's a bit counterproductive unless

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580
that's a bit counterproductive unless
 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.190
that's a bit counterproductive unless
what you're aiming at is the maximum

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200
what you're aiming at is the maximum
 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.990
what you're aiming at is the maximum
possible mayhem in the shortest period

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000
possible mayhem in the shortest period
 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.300
possible mayhem in the shortest period
of time well so what happened as the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310
of time well so what happened as the
 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.070
of time well so what happened as the
Germans started to lose the war did

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080
Germans started to lose the war did
 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.590
Germans started to lose the war did
Hitler lose faith in his own ability

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600
Hitler lose faith in his own ability
 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.150
Hitler lose faith in his own ability
no he believed that the Germans had

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160
no he believed that the Germans had
 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.950
no he believed that the Germans had
betrayed him with weakness and so he was

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960
betrayed him with weakness and so he was
 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.290
betrayed him with weakness and so he was
perfectly willing to accelerate the rate

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300
perfectly willing to accelerate the rate
 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.120
perfectly willing to accelerate the rate
at which Germany was losing the war and

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130
at which Germany was losing the war and
 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.520
at which Germany was losing the war and
so when Hitler and his minions have the

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530
so when Hitler and his minions have the
 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.040
so when Hitler and his minions have the
choice here's the choice you can suspend

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050
choice here's the choice you can suspend
 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.800
choice here's the choice you can suspend
your unnecessary demolition of people

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810
your unnecessary demolition of people
 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.410
your unnecessary demolition of people
win the damn war and then pick it up

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420
win the damn war and then pick it up
 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.780
win the damn war and then pick it up
afterwards or well you're losing you can

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790
afterwards or well you're losing you can
 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.700
afterwards or well you're losing you can
just accelerate the mayhem even though

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710
just accelerate the mayhem even though
 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.410
just accelerate the mayhem even though
it's counterproductive it's like what

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420
it's counterproductive it's like what
 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.080
it's counterproductive it's like what
they pick while they pick to accelerate

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090
they pick while they pick to accelerate
 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.970
they pick while they pick to accelerate
demand and so to me there's an old

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980
demand and so to me there's an old
 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.100
demand and so to me there's an old
psychoanalytic idea I think this was

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110
psychoanalytic idea I think this was
 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.610
psychoanalytic idea I think this was
derived by you you can't figure out what

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620
derived by you you can't figure out what
 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.070
derived by you you can't figure out what
someone is doing or why look at the

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080
someone is doing or why look at the
 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.510
someone is doing or why look at the
outcome and infer the motivation if it

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520
outcome and infer the motivation if it
 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.680
outcome and infer the motivation if it
produces mayhem perhaps it was aiming at

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690
produces mayhem perhaps it was aiming at
 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.340
produces mayhem perhaps it was aiming at
mayhem

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350
mayhem
 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.710
mayhem
now you know you have to use that dictum

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720
now you know you have to use that dictum
 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.810
now you know you have to use that dictum
carefully if someone's irritating you

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820
carefully if someone's irritating you
 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.250
