00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090
for a feature and it definitely feels
 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.000
for a feature and it definitely feels
like he's attempting to make this film

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010
like he's attempting to make this film

something I'm noticing about the
 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.729
something I'm noticing about the
conjuring universe films and it is

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739
conjuring universe films and it is
 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.940
conjuring universe films and it is
troubling just about every single one

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950
troubling just about every single one
 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.940

that isn't a James Wan conjuring movie

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950
that isn't a James Wan conjuring movie
 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.670
that isn't a James Wan conjuring movie

almost like they're told to not be
 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.000
almost like they're told to not be
better than the conjuring because they

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010
better than the conjuring because they
 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.620
better than the conjuring because they
all feel like they're not trying to be
