00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.900
Okay so let me start underlining these nouns, and I'll start

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.810
identifying the ones that are relevant, and I'll ask you some

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.550
questions or you can ask me questions if

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.666
you see something that doesn't make sense to you. Good enough.

00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:17.650
&gt;&gt; okay, let's see, patron. It seems to

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.670
me that patron is definitely an important entity.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:20.808
&gt;&gt; That's, that's what its all about.

00:00:20.808 --> 00:00:23.270
&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, so actually, the way

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.750
I'm going to do this, I'm going to take all these relevant

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.610
entities and I'm going to start putting them into what I call a class

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.450
diagram. So you don't really need to know what that is exactly, but imagine

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.150
this being a, a diagram in which I'm drawing, I represent in all development

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.260
items as rectangles with a given name and, and then later on some attributes.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.660
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.055
&gt;&gt; Okay, and I'm, I'm just going to put

00:00:44.055 --> 00:00:45.600
them there. So I'm going to start with patron.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.420
I'm going to create one class for the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.250
patron. I'm going to give it the name patron.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.120
And by the way, assuming that you'd probably figure out, it's important that we

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.430
represent, we use the right names so that it's clear when we're looking at

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.790
the class diagram what we're referring to, so I'll just use the, the nouns

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.520
themselves as names. Okay, library card seems to be also a relevant element.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.072
&gt;&gt; Every patron has a library card.

00:01:08.072 --> 00:01:09.530
&gt;&gt; All right, perfect, so we'll just

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.880
create a library card here. And let's see.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.530
As, as long as they're in the system. And I saw that there's a system

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.000
here, this concept of system, this concept

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.076
of library. And based on my experience, normally,

00:01:22.076 --> 00:01:26.574
those are kind of in an overarching themes. So this is really what we are

00:01:26.574 --> 00:01:28.597
modeling. So the only

00:01:28.597 --> 00:01:30.297
thing that will make a difference is

00:01:30.297 --> 00:01:34.120
if there were more than one library or more than one system. Is that the case?

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.740
&gt;&gt; We just want one system for our one library

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.770
&gt;&gt; Okay so, in this case I won't even represent

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.540
those because basically what I'm representing is the system and

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.990
the library.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.740
&gt;&gt; I understand, I understand.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.350
Okay and then, oh name, address and phone

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.510
number are interesting because these are important entities,

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.180
but this seems like, you know, they're not

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.550
entities in themselves, so they're more attributes

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.070
of something else. I would imagine that

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.080
this is the way you identify, or these

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.860
are elements that are important for the patron?

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.880
&gt;&gt; That's what we take down when we issue the cards.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.800
&gt;&gt; Okay. Perfect. So, I'm going to

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.710
take those and make those attributes of the patron, which means

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.350
that I'm going to take the class that I created before, and I'm

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.430
just going to write them down here so that they're represented and,

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.360
and we know that these are kind of what characterizes the patron.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.070
&gt;&gt; Gotcha.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.540
&gt;&gt; Okay? And then, I guess similar consideration for the library

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.750
card number. So this is to be associated with the library card?

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:29.902
&gt;&gt; It's printed right on it.

00:02:29.902 --> 00:02:32.180
&gt;&gt; All right, so we'll put this as

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.130
an attribute of the library card, then. And then, in addition, at any particular point

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.630
in time. Okay, so time seems to be a relevant entity right,

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.880
because time seems to occur several times in this description. For example, I

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.940
think you guys keep track of how long a book has been loaned, right?

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:54.300
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.270
&gt;&gt; And there's some time associated also here.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.380
&gt;&gt; And a children's age.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.760
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah. The children's age here that

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.200
I didn't see before. Yeah. So, what

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.800
I'm going to do, I'm going to represent this in

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.520
a sort of generic way, as a date.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.520
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.380
&gt;&gt; These are kind of, kind of classes, utility

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.880
classes we call them, that are normally in every system.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.970
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.060
&gt;&gt; So I'm just going to put it down here

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.940
as a utility class that will be used

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.780
by different elements in the diagram. Okay, so

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.070
I want to calculate the items. So the items also

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.230
I mean I for what I know about libraries they

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.490
seem to be pretty relevant elements, right? So these are all

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.305
&gt;&gt; This is what we check out, this is what we're for.

00:03:31.305 --> 00:03:34.459
&gt;&gt; Okay, so then items definitely will become a

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.349
class, and then we have a due. Oh there's also

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.730
this concept of fines. I guess that seems to be

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.330
important. Right? You guys give fines to people who are late.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.700
&gt;&gt; Right, right.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.160
&gt;&gt; Right, collect fines and so on. So we create a fine class down here and

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.150
the children. So children are special customers, right? It's

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.890
their age makes a difference? Is that the way it works?

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.950
&gt;&gt; Right. They, they can only check out a few books.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.410
&gt;&gt; Okay. So I'll create them a special

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.170
kind of case, a special kind of customer so

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.000
I just create here a class for children. And

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.682
I can see that they're categorized by their age.

00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:09.340
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.160
&gt;&gt; So I'll just put the age here as an attribute of the child.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.712
And, okay, so the next one is

00:04:15.712 --> 00:04:19.653
restriction. And restriction is kind of tricky because just

00:04:19.653 --> 00:04:22.010
to be sort of a general concept. I mean,

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.915
in a sense, all of those are restrictions, right?

00:04:24.915 --> 00:04:28.250
&gt;&gt; Right, this is just another one of these requirements.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.180
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay, so, so we don't need to represent it explicitly, right?

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.430
&gt;&gt; Right, right.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.390
&gt;&gt; It's just telling us how the children, yeah, okay, right; this is

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.151
just another requirement, so I just won't consider that for now. And oh,

00:04:39.151 --> 00:04:43.444
I see that these books and audio video materials, I guess these

00:04:43.444 --> 00:04:48.902
are things that the patrons can check out, right?

00:04:48.902 --> 00:04:50.725
&gt;&gt; Those are some of the items, right.

00:04:50.725 --> 00:04:53.770
&gt;&gt; There are two

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.380
more down here, right? Reference books and magazines?

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.990
&gt;&gt; But, they can't be checked

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.270
out, but they're definitely in the library.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.338
&gt;&gt; Okay, so then I'm going to represent all of those

00:05:01.338 --> 00:05:04.180
actually, now. So, I'm going to have books, I'm going to have audio

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.990
video materials, reference books, and magazines. And

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.150
I'm just going to have those as classes. Then,

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.060
okay here we have week, and we

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.630
already represented this general concept of time, so

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:23.270
week will be represented by the date class as well. And oh, I see best sellers.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.520
So best sellers are also, I guess, items that can be checked out, right?

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.150
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.330
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'll

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.900
just represent those as a class as well and an additional item that

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.480
is relevant for the library. And the limit, this is also a time limit, right?

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.150
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.500
&gt;&gt; So it can also be represented with a, with a class.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.380
Oh, here we have cents, and for cents, same consideration that made

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.430
for time. This is kind of the money, is a general concept

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.240
that in all currency, many, in many IT systems. So, I'm, I'm

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.430
going to just have a money class here, which is another utility class.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.740
&gt;&gt; Okay

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:04.000
&gt;&gt; Okay, and, oh, here I have value, so value is a property.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.320
Let me look again at the requirement. Oh, it's the value of the item. So value

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.450
I'm going to put in the item as an attribute. Okay?

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.120
&gt;&gt; Okay. That's how much it cost us.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.090
&gt;&gt; Okay. Perfect.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.400
&gt;&gt; Seems like we got them all. Right? Anything I forgot?

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.640
&gt;&gt; That looks like it.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.580
&gt;&gt; Okay, so this one, what I'd like to do. We have a kind of

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.890
a first take, first cut at the class diagram. I'd like to kind of

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.480
move to that and go through the different classes with you. And I'll ask

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.440
you some questions again. And you can

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.510
tell me whether there is something that

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.894
jumps at you that's not right. And

00:06:36.894 --> 00:06:38.930
then we're going to try to refine that.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:39.180
&gt;&gt; Okay

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.510
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.800
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.
