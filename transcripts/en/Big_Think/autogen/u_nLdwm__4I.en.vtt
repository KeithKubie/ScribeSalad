right then they could participate and be

system right will probably get to a

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610
system right will probably get to a
 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.160

point where your ability to sell a

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170

that your ownership is recorded in this
in this ledger all right which would do

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900
in this ledger all right which would do
 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.830
in this ledger all right which would do
a tremendous amount to try to keep a bad

importantly how do we add sensor data

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:53.500
importantly how do we add sensor data
 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.420
importantly how do we add sensor data
from IOT devices right that say tamper

boats come in to satellite data that can

boats come in to satellite data that can
 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.520

right all of this data put together to

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:12.850
right all of this data put together to
 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.820
right all of this data put together to
try to say here's the formal provenance

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:14.830
try to say here's the formal provenance
 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.560
try to say here's the formal provenance
record and here's all the sensor data

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:16.570
record and here's all the sensor data
 

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.050
record and here's all the sensor data
that corroborates all that and by the

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:19.060
that corroborates all that and by the
 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.640
that corroborates all that and by the
way here's a place where the all the

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:20.650
way here's a place where the all the
 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.350
way here's a place where the all the
data doesn't line up and we might want

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.360
data doesn't line up and we might want
 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.730
data doesn't line up and we might want
to look more closely at that and see if

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:23.740
to look more closely at that and see if
 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.470
to look more closely at that and see if
some fraud happened there all of this

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:25.480
some fraud happened there all of this
 

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.660
some fraud happened there all of this
for the purpose of making sure that we

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:27.670
for the purpose of making sure that we

for the purpose of making sure that we
have sustainable fisheries in the ocean
