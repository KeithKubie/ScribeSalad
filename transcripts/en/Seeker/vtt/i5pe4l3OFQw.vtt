00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:02.549
Haha, you suck.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.299
Schadenfreude is enjoyment derived from another person's misfortune.

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.799
We've all watched fail compilations, shared vines, and cheered on Christy Teigen when she's out here roasting people.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.520
We enjoy seeing someone get dragged, roasted, or cooked for a mistake and that

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.600
enjoyment is felt in our reward centers in our brain.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.960
The striatum, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the amygdala, all contain dopaminergic

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.360
neurons that activate when experiencing schadenfreude.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.600
It's a complicated emotional response, which feels good, but how much should it govern our decision-making?

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.020
Theme song time.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.940
Seriously dude, you gotta get that theme song going.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.340
You deserve everything that's coming to you, stupid.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.239
Don't lie, I know you've gotten a chuckle when someone's taken an L on the internet or in real life.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.320
I know I giggle when I see someone speed past me on the highway and get a ticket.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.840
Or if someone gets a four-piece and some fries in a fast-food fight, you know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.900
Is it cool to laugh another person's misfortune?

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.840
No, but do we do it?

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.489
Hell yeah,

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.399
because we're human.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.940
Schadenfreude manifests more strongly when we perceive people deserve their misfortunes

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.020
or when misfortunes happen to people who are widely disliked.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.520
Makes sense.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.840
If a Nazi or racist gets cooked on Twitter we laugh because we think they're super wack and deserve to get flamed.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.059
Right? Right.

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.938
It can also manifest in less desirable social conditions like envy.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.640
Researchers found that when a subject felt that a person was superior and more important,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.540
stronger envy and stronger anterior cingulate cortex activation was also seen.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.000
Also, stronger schadenfreude and striatum activation were induced when misfortunes happened to an envied target.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.680
So, schadenfreude pops up in our brains

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.720
whenever someone we perceive as higher status than us or people we don't like gets knocked down a peg or 20.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.820
But schadenfreude could possibly also be a way of social learning from another person's mistakes.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.520
A UCLA study put electrodes in the heads of 10 subjects playing a computer card game and found that observing and predicting errors

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.060
in the card game activated the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, part of the cerebrum,

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.540
that encodes learning, decision-making, and rewards. Make sense so far.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.640
Made the wrong decision, we get a little bit of dopamine and hopefully you learn from the mistake that you're viewing.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.540
Researchers came to that same conclusion and believed that neurons from that specific area

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.400
we're learning and calculating next moves. But wait, there's more. That's a reference.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.140
This may sound a lot like one of my favorite topics, mirror neurons, but they're not the same.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.500
Mirror neurons are neurons that respond equally when we perform an action and when we see someone perform that same action.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.480
When we see someone make a mistake you're not thinking "man, let me go mess that up for myself."

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.089
You're learning from that mistake and making better life choices. Today's episode is brought to you by live choices...

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.040
When subjects in that card study found that they won, those areas activated much more than when they were let down by their

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.520
papapapa pokerface.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.560
Reference.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.180
Could be schadenfreude activated neurons, but remember, correlation does not equal causation.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.780
So as always, more research is needed.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.100
When we see a public figure take an L,  it quickly turns into a dragging

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.659
competition on who can pull that person down the furthest. This manifests all the way at the top with politics.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.120
America's famous for their two-party system and humans already have a tendency to have trouble identifying with out-group members,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.220
preferring members of our own perceived tribes. And when people from outside of our tribes take serious Ls, ding dong, schadenfreude here.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.459
A 2012 study found that participants felt more positive when misfortunes befell a high-status competitive target

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.820
as compared to other social targets with a less competitive streak.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.020
They discovered this by measuring participants facial muscles and found activity consistent with smiling.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.720
Politicians are running for the highest position of power in the country. If they crash, it's normally at high speed

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.480
and research suggests that we enjoy it.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.480
That same study suggests that schadenfreude

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:14.009
decreases when a target group member is of a low status or is cooperative and learns from their mistakes

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.129
So it's no fun to punch down, only up. Good note for comedians.

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.879
Political affiliation has become a sort of tribe identifier in recent years.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.520
In the last few elections, it always felt like a win for one party was a loss for the opposing party, when we live in one whole ass country.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.880
When President Bush won in 2000, it was perceived as the Democrats losing.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.200
When Obama won in 2008, a loss for the GOP.

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.789
A 2009 paper looked directly at schadenfreude and political affiliations in four studies, and across all four studies

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:44.219
participants political party affiliation and the intensity of in-group identification within those parties

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.720
strongly predicted whether their emotional reactions to news articles describing misfortunes happening to others produce schadenfreude.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.700
Basically, stronger political allegiances correlated with more laughs at the opposing political party's misfortunes.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.299
Schadenfreude has also been linked with anti-empathy, or the opposite of empathy.

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.379
Some people really deserve it like bullies, criminals, racists, sexists, people with way too much power.

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.739
Sometimes that's all the same person. And they will get what's coming to them.

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:15.149
But remember, research found that schadenfreude punches up, not down. If a more perfect union is the goal here, schadenfreude ain't it.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.050
Okay, enough of this enjoying other people's failures.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.819
I mean, what if there was a way to use neuroscience of the brain to do some good? To like...

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.590
Positively influence people. Oh, wait right here in this video. You're nerds. Watch it.
