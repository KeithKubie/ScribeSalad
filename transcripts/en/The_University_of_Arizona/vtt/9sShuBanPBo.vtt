00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.760
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.626
It's a little bit
more complicated.

00:00:09.626 --> 00:00:10.410
And you've got--

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.110
Regents' Professor of
hydrology and water resources,

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.030
Hoshin Gupta, is interested
in a deeper understanding

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.760
of scientific models--

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.340
all the facts and
things we understand

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.870
about how the world works.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.810
How do we take
conceptual ideas--

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.740
theories about how
the world works--

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.060
and data that we collect
from the world, and put them

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.480
together to build models, which
we can then use for prediction

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.820
or decision making.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.690
Or actually, my
interest is more in how

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.790
we use those models
to help further

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.590
enhance the learning
process, how we

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.270
understand the world around us.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.340
I think students-- it
usually takes students

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.610
about half a term to realize
that the subject material is

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.300
only a reason to be
talking, and that it really

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.220
has to do with more universal
ideas of science, and analysis,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.340
and insight, and creativity.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.230
There tends to be
this sort of idea

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.240
that if you build a
model based on physics

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.870
and physically-based
principles, that such models are

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.020
superior to models that
are built based primarily

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.467
on looking for patterns in data.

00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:28.050
And of course, in
today's world, there

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.750
tends to be a lot,
lot more data.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.500
And we're finding that our ideas
about how the world works--

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.050
which are based in
ideas about physics--

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.610
don't necessarily agree
with what the data tells us.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.000
Gupta was born in India,
attended Case Western

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.530
University for his doctorate,
and in 1983, followed

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.700
his professor to the U of
A Hydrology Department.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.510
It just so happened that
the major professors who

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.520
were involved in water resources
happened to be in the systems

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.540
department.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.580
That gave me the opportunity
to actually start

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.870
studying systems theory
as a foundational concept,

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.230
as opposed hydrology
or civil engineering

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.220
as a foundational basis.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.810
Gupta sees little distinction
between research and teaching.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.060
In addition to his
research, he teaches

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.880
classes in modeling
fundamentals,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.530
and an earth sciences course
for non-science majors.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.130
I don't think you can do
research without help.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.700
For that, you need
students and other people.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.672
And you can't get those
people to the point

00:02:43.672 --> 00:02:45.380
that they can assist
you in your research

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.750
without doing teaching.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.020
So I think of teaching as more
of a mentoring process, really.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.320
It's helping students to
acquire the kind of information

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.950
that they need in order to
be able to then contribute

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.480
to the scientific endeavor.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.560
He cares about the way you learn
as much as he cares about what

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.350
you're learning, so that
when he's teaching it to you,

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.540
you really understand
the point and not just,

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.060
OK, I can solve this problem,
or I can get the right number.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.643
It's not really about
the right number

00:03:12.643 --> 00:03:15.240
as much as it is about
the process of learning.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.380
Growing up in India, he
was a skilled sailor,

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.320
competing in
international competition.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.260
Today, he has a variety
of other interests,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.040
but keeps coming back
to his love of music.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.501
Much to my wife's chagrin, I
don't play the guitar very much

00:03:31.501 --> 00:03:32.000
anymore.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.635
And I now play drums.

00:03:33.635 --> 00:03:36.720
And I play drums in
three different bands.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.710
I tend to think that
there's a tendency

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.450
in our current
educational system

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:50.150
to make a strong wall
between physical sciences

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.780
and the social sciences.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.120
And the longer I'm involved
in this profession,

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.110
the less useful I think that is.
