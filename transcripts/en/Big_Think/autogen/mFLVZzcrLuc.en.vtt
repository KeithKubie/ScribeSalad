it's interesting question what is

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720
it's interesting question what is
 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.320
it's interesting question what is
coolness it's sort of impossible to

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330
coolness it's sort of impossible to
 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.360
coolness it's sort of impossible to
define but sociologists have tried and

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370
define but sociologists have tried and
 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.249
define but sociologists have tried and
their definition I think is really

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259
their definition I think is really
 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.250
their definition I think is really
useful their definition is that coolness

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260
useful their definition is that coolness
 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.960
useful their definition is that coolness
is a measured positive rebellion against

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970
is a measured positive rebellion against
 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.420
is a measured positive rebellion against
an illegitimate mainstream and like

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430
an illegitimate mainstream and like
 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.779
an illegitimate mainstream and like
thinking of that all in one big pile is

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789
thinking of that all in one big pile is
 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.339
thinking of that all in one big pile is
a little bit complicated but when you

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349
a little bit complicated but when you
 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.870
a little bit complicated but when you
disentangle that it makes a lot of sense

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880
disentangle that it makes a lot of sense
 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.870
disentangle that it makes a lot of sense
it is a measured small rebellion a

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880
it is a measured small rebellion a
 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.180
it is a measured small rebellion a
little difference or distinction for a

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190
little difference or distinction for a
 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.410
little difference or distinction for a
mainstream that is considered

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420
mainstream that is considered
 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.080
mainstream that is considered
illegitimate or bad coolness is a

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090
illegitimate or bad coolness is a
 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.510
illegitimate or bad coolness is a
response to a mainstream it is in many

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520
response to a mainstream it is in many
 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.580
response to a mainstream it is in many
ways very similar to the sociological

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590
ways very similar to the sociological
 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.330
ways very similar to the sociological
definition of a cult a cult is also a

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340
definition of a cult a cult is also a
 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.729
definition of a cult a cult is also a
measured rebellion to a mainstream that

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739
measured rebellion to a mainstream that
 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.799
measured rebellion to a mainstream that
is considered illegitimate maybe the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809
is considered illegitimate maybe the
 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.959
is considered illegitimate maybe the
best way to think about this definition

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969
best way to think about this definition
 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.639
best way to think about this definition
is to think about it through the lens of

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649
is to think about it through the lens of
 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.779
is to think about it through the lens of
dress codes for high schools right lots

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789
dress codes for high schools right lots
 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.700
dress codes for high schools right lots
of high schoolers when they attend a

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710
of high schoolers when they attend a
 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.110
of high schoolers when they attend a
school that has a dress code they try to

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120
school that has a dress code they try to
 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.719
school that has a dress code they try to
break from that code but only in ways

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729
break from that code but only in ways
 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.090
break from that code but only in ways
that are measured and positive right so

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100
that are measured and positive right so
 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.530
that are measured and positive right so
the dress code says you have to wear a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540
the dress code says you have to wear a
 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.570
the dress code says you have to wear a
coat with a tie and a button-up shirt

coat with a tie and a button-up shirt
 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.429
coat with a tie and a button-up shirt
maybe they'll undo the tie a bit or wear

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439
maybe they'll undo the tie a bit or wear
 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.260
maybe they'll undo the tie a bit or wear
a hat or undo their button-up shirt

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270
a hat or undo their button-up shirt
 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.060
a hat or undo their button-up shirt
they'll have measured measured

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070
they'll have measured measured
 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.740
they'll have measured measured
rebellions to that illegitimate

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750
rebellions to that illegitimate
 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.380

that's not a measured rebellion that is

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990
that's not a measured rebellion that is
 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.020
that's not a measured rebellion that is
outright rebellion and that is not

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030
outright rebellion and that is not
 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.390
outright rebellion and that is not
considered cool so you need a measured

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400
considered cool so you need a measured
 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.850
considered cool so you need a measured
rebellion number one but number two the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860
rebellion number one but number two the
 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.560
rebellion number one but number two the
mainstream has to be considered

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570
mainstream has to be considered
 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.810
mainstream has to be considered
illegitimate in the first place in order

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820
illegitimate in the first place in order
 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.819
illegitimate in the first place in order
for the action to be considered cool so

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829
for the action to be considered cool so
 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.350
for the action to be considered cool so
in one study these researchers did

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360
in one study these researchers did
 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.999
in one study these researchers did
something really clever they told a

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009
something really clever they told a
 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.219
something really clever they told a
bunch of students who are who were you

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.300
know departing from the mainstream dress
code and in various ways they told them

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310
code and in various ways they told them
 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.719

the dress code was initiated to honor a

the dress code was initiated to honor a
 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.190

dress code wasn't illegitimate it was a

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049
dress code wasn't illegitimate it was a
 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.800
dress code wasn't illegitimate it was a
completely legitimate way for people to

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810
completely legitimate way for people to
 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.680
completely legitimate way for people to
honor a fallen soldier and fewer

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690

students considered departing that dress

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879
students considered departing that dress

code to be cool

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410
code to be cool
 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.720
code to be cool
so it's very important to think when

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730
so it's very important to think when
 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.400
so it's very important to think when
defining coolness that you need two

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410
defining coolness that you need two
 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.620
defining coolness that you need two
parts first in your the mainstream that

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630
parts first in your the mainstream that
 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.750
parts first in your the mainstream that
is considered bad people need to agree

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760
is considered bad people need to agree
 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.300
is considered bad people need to agree
that the mainstream is bad and two you

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310
that the mainstream is bad and two you
 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.490
that the mainstream is bad and two you
need the rebellion to be positive and

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500
need the rebellion to be positive and
 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.950
need the rebellion to be positive and
measured it can't be crazy it can't be

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960
measured it can't be crazy it can't be
 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.110
measured it can't be crazy it can't be
insane and when you have those two

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120
insane and when you have those two
 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.720
insane and when you have those two
things together you have cool the

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730
things together you have cool the
 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.460
things together you have cool the
difference between that which we

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470
difference between that which we
 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.860
difference between that which we
consider cool and that which we consider

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870
consider cool and that which we consider
 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.500
consider cool and that which we consider
cultish because they're relatively

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510
cultish because they're relatively
 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.090
cultish because they're relatively
similar things they're both departing

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100
similar things they're both departing

from a mainstream is essentially degree
that cults are all designed around this

that cults are all designed around this
 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.600
that cults are all designed around this
idea that most human beings or most

of the first principle of that cult but

we reserved the word cult for
essentially groups that are too far away

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160
essentially groups that are too far away
 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.070
essentially groups that are too far away
from the mainstream to be considered a

from the mainstream to be considered a
 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.650
from the mainstream to be considered a
measured rebellion from it and so I

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660
measured rebellion from it and so I
 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.060
measured rebellion from it and so I
think that's exactly the right way to

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070
think that's exactly the right way to
 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.890
think that's exactly the right way to
think about coolness versus cultish Ness

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900
think about coolness versus cultish Ness
 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.990
think about coolness versus cultish Ness
is that we're all part of cults we're

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000
is that we're all part of cults we're
 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.240
is that we're all part of cults we're
all part of some we all disagree with

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250
all part of some we all disagree with
 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.250
all part of some we all disagree with
some aspect of mainstream social or

some aspect of mainstream social or

some aspect of mainstream social or
political thought but the but whether or

political thought but the but whether or
 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.080
political thought but the but whether or
not other people consider us cool or

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090
not other people consider us cool or
 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.180
not other people consider us cool or
cultish essentially depends on whether

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190
cultish essentially depends on whether
 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.800
cultish essentially depends on whether
they think that we are departing from

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810
they think that we are departing from
 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.570
