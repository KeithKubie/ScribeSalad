00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.540
In 1928 a man called Paget gave some
lectures here at the RI and we have his

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:21.330
original apparatus, which is here, exactly
as he left it in which the whole of

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.640
voice sounds are imitated by purely
mechanical means.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.540
This is the lungs. They force air 
up through the windpipe.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.240
This is the larynx; it's just an organ pipe reed.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.900
[BABY SOUNDS]

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.780
Now babies of course start by making a
noise something like that and then they

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.570
learn to manipulate their tongues and
lips to make different noises see if

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.240
I can imitate some baby noises..

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.380
[BABY SOUNDS]

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.860
And as they practice making sounds and

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.920
speech better then they shape their
mouths into specific shapes. For instance

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.430
this one is a tube exactly as made by
Paget with two cavities representing the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.080
positions before and behind the tongue.
When you put that on and it should make

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.540
an "eh" sort of noise.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.580
["EH" SOUNDS]

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.480
["BEH" SOUNDS]

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.140
I'm trying to say "baby" on it.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.600
["BEH BEH" SOUNDS]

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.900
All by moving the tongue to

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.520
change the proportions of the two
parts of the mouth we can get "ah".

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.680
Okay, "mama".

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.480
["MAH MAH" SOUNDS]

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.360
That is a simple voice synthesiser. 
These days, though, a voice synthesiser

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.680
can be made very much better by doing all 
those functions but doing them electronically.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.300
Over here we have a good voice synthesiser..

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:29.100
and it has been trained in
the first demonstration by having

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.810
phrases spoken at it by a real person, in
a real voice, and those sounds have not

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.620
been recorded but they've been analysed so the instructions to a synthesiser have been stored.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:51.280
Here is the first message spoken by a real person but  stored only as instructions to a voice synthesiser.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.160
[SYNTHESISER] "An apple a day keeps the doctor away".

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.740
A different person said..

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.020
[SYNTHESISER] "A bird in the 
hand is worth two in the bush".

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.020
And the lady's voice said..

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.260
[SYNTHESISER] "Sorry for the delay
please wait for dial tone".

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.900
That last message gives you a clue that this demonstration has been provided

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.920
from the research labs of British Telecom.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.380
In another demonstration,
though, we can get this voice synthesiser

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.660
to read actual type. 
Could I have your name please?

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.200
[GIRL] Rachel Borer.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.700
[PYE] Boyer?

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.520
[GIRL] Borer.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.060
[PYE] Borer. Rachel Borer. Let's type that
in and see how it gets on.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.460
[SYNTHESISER] "Rah-chel Boh-rer".

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.560
Of course the English
language is notoriously difficult to

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.939
spell and pronounce and this machine is
now being fed just with letters of the

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.480
alphabet to see what it can make of it.
What's your name please?

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.160
In the red.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.200
[BOY] Richard Bartlett.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.140
[PYE] Richard Bartlett. Let's try that.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.240
[SYNTHESISER] "Richard Bartlett".

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.260
It did rather better at that.
Let's try "Bill Coates" shall we?

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.140
[SYNTHESISER] "Bill Coh-ates".

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.340
It hasn't yet been taught
that "oa" is pronounced "oh" so

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.220
it pronounces the "a" separately and calls it "Coh-ates".

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.820
It also has a message inside itself that
it would like to give you if I...

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.420
ask it now to give its own message.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.760
[SYNTHESISER] "Thank you for letting me speak at the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures".

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.780
[LAUGHTER]
