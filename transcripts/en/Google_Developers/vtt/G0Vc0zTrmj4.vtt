MANO MARKS: OK.

00:00:03.115 --> 00:00:04.010
Hi.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.500
I am Mano Marks.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.050
I am a developer advocate
on the Google Maps team.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.670
This is Sean Maday.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.190
SEAN MADAY: I'm Sean Maday.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.800
I'm a geoengineer on the
Enterprise team.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.800
MANO MARKS: So it is
our pleasure to

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.820
do the session today.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.130
We're really happy to see you
and everybody on live stream.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.000
Hi.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.250
So I want to talk a little
bit of history here.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.570
And some of you may have gone
to the session yesterday--

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.940
What's New in Google Maps.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.710
And Brian McClendon talked
a little bit

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.600
about where we started.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.090
And this is the first
Google Maps.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.370
This is Google Maps
Beta in 2006.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.480
And we started out with points
and driving directions.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.740
And it was a really
revolutionary

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.830
interface at the time.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.060
At the time, if you wanted a
map, you had to go to a map

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.970
image, and if you wanted to zoom
or pan, you had to click

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.910
and load a whole other image.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.030
There probably would
be a little

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.850
iframe that would refresh.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.460
It would be like 10 seconds,
because this was the

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.810
internet back then.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.450
And what Google did was it
looked at that and thought,

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.510
wouldn't it be fantastic if we
could do a better experience--

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.690
a nicer, smoother experience
that would not require this

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.670
sort of disengagement
from the user.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.100
And so we released what has now
become a very standard way

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.280
to do maps online.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.130
Google started this tile serving
infrastructure using a

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.620
JavaScript interface, which
allows you to dynamically move

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.550
and pan your maps and add things
to it without having

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.845
these huge lag times--

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.810
an exploration of the
map, of the world.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.950
And we incorporated map tiles
and satellite imagery all

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.940
around the world.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.810
And it became this
it sensation.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.020
So much so that people, within
days of seeing this, had

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.610
reverse-engineered it and told
us, hey look, we can do really

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.190
amazing, cool things.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.570
And so in 2006, we actually
released the Google Maps API,

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:33.360
version 1, and asked developers
to come with us on

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.300
this journey--

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.360
this journey of exploration of
the world, of geospatially

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.895
organizing the world's
information.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.710
And they did.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.040
You did.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.670
If you're in this room, you
probably have written a Maps

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.020
API application.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.910
If you are a web developer, you
have probably written a

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.000
Google Maps API application.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.080
There are 800,000 active
websites--

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.730
that's active websites--

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.940
using the Google Maps
API right now.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.430
800,000, and it continues to
grow at a really huge rate.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.540
So in 2006, we asked you to
do this journey with us.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.270
And now you have.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.270
And we are now asking
you to do it again.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.200
Because, as Brian talked about
yesterday, there are still

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.030
dragons at the edges
of the map--

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.230
referencing old European maps,
which used to say, here be

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.100
dragons at the outskirts
of your map where

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.140
they didn't have data.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.200
So we want you to join
us on this journey

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.980
to get rid of dragons--

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.796
this adventure to get
rid of dragons.

00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:52.605
He actually called it
dragon slaying.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.940
We're going to slay
some dragons.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.220
So we want you to join us.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.450
And we want you to do
it the way we do it.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.740
We want to make our
infrastructure available to

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.870
you to serve out maps in the
way that we did it--

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.209
learning the lessons that we
have of creating a really

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.610
incredibly developed
infrastructure for

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.760
serving out maps data.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.690
And we want you to be able
to do the same for your

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:28.260
organization.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.860
So please, this is--

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.650
they always tell you to do a
call to action in these.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.750
I'm gonna do the call
to action early.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.900
The call to action is join
us in this adventure.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.090
OK, so let's talk about
what that means.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.570
That means we want you to build
your maps in our cloud.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.740
We want you to reach users
on every platform

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.470
that you can reach.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.170
And we want you to integrate
our data with your data in

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.820
your applications.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.112
Three basic key takeaways.

00:05:10.112 --> 00:05:12.690
If you don't remember anything
else, you'll remember.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.790
If you're watching on the live
stream, you should still watch

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:20.020
the rest of it, but those
are the key takeaways.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.410
OK.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.320
Let's talk about what
that actually means.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.420
This right here is a Maps
API application.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.470
You may say it looks like a
fairly standard Maps API

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.910
application.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.860
I didn't gussy it up, because
I'm not really a designer.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.680
But think about it this way.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.530
Even if you were the state of
Louisiana, or not literally

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.310
the state of Louisiana--

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.720
but you are a representative
of the state of Louisiana.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.680
You're concerned about the
impact of oil natural gas

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.480
infrastructure on disaster
preparedness.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.200
So you want to visualize
where things are.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.350
So we actually went
out and did this.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.480
Sean found a great site provided
by the state--

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.740
right, the state
of Louisiana--

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.460
that had data about
where things were.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.090
And we put that on this
Maps API application.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.920
So here are the Haynesville
shale wells.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.920
Here are some oil
and gas fields.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:31.080
Here our some permit points for
new permits for drilling,

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.580
I'm guessing, and polygons
that impact the

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.510
areas where these are.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.090
Here are some levees.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.430
You get you get the
idea, right?

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:48.340
We have lots of interesting data
about where things are.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.570
Well, here's the trick.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.170
So you've probably
seen Maps API

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.410
applications like this before.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.360
But all this data is actually
being served off of Google's

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.250
infrastructure.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.960
This is all data that's living
in Google Maps Engine and is

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.520
being served directly to
a Maps API application.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.980
The only thing that
is not on Google's

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.850
infrastructure is the sample.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.830
This is an HTML5 slide deck.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:18.400
I have an HTML page and some
JavaScript just sitting on my

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.610
laptop-- but it could be
on a server somewhere--

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.400
and that's it.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:28.210
All the data is served directly
from our servers in a

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.300
highly optimized fashion.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.410
And I can share that data
with whoever I want.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.910
I've made this public, because
I'm making a demonstration,

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.940
but I could limit access
to who can do

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:43.860
what with this data.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.300
So think about this
as an example.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.840
Sean's going to walk you through
a little bit more, but

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.890
first I want to talk
to you about what

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.530
the cloud looks like.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.920
Why should you think about
our geospatial cloud?

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.740
Google Maps is used a million
hours every day.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.940
For a million hours, people are
using our infrastructure.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.980
The billion monthly active
users of Google

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:17.560
Maps services and--

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.990
I don't know, how many of you
know about Santa Tracker, seen

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:21.390
Santa Tracker?

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:22.070
All right.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:25.690
You guys are part of the 1.6
million queries per second

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:31.730
that our infrastructure handled
on Christmas Day when

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:36.520
some very brave data center
engineers stayed during

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.760
Christmas Day, probably fairly
alone in the data centers,

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.570
making sure that Santa Tracker
stayed up and running--

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:47.330
1.6 million queries
per second.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.910
So we have a solid
infrastructure that we've

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:56.600
developed that will help you
serve your data when you need

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.790
it-- and during the lean times,
when you don't have

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.660
very many users, and during
the high peak periods.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.650
That's what you should
be thinking about.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.440
But there's more.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:18.000
We have available for
your use the world's

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.250
largest imagery database--

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.400
20 petabytes of imagery.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:28.850
That's just the data that we
make available through maps.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.590
We have constantly updating
base data.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:35.770
So the maps are being updated
moment to moment.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:38.430
We have people in Map Maker.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.750
We have a project called Ground
Truth, where we're

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.650
actually sourcing our own
data and inputting it.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.550
And we also have additional
data providers.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.890
So we have a massive
amount of base data

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.200
constantly being updated.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:55.760
We provide you with access
control, rock

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.780
solid access control.

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.750
So if you're familiar with--

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.710
how many of you use
Google Docs?

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.390
And Gmail?

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:03.860
All right.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.340
It's Google I/O, that's not
a fair question, right?

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.370
But you know then, about
access control.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:12.130
You can make a document
public.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.370
You can make it private.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:14.530
You can make it unlisted.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.950
And we give you additional
access control, but it's based

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:21.140
on the same solid
infrastructure--

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:26.700
so security and stability.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.310
And we have API integration.

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:33.100
We have the world's most
popular web API--

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.840
the Google Maps API.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.280
I'm not kidding when I say
probably everybody in this

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.500
room and everybody watching
has done a Google Maps API

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.620
application.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.420
I'm sure somebody's going to
tweet me later or plus me

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.770
later, and be like, I haven't.

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:51.390
But statistically speaking,
almost all web developers,

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:53.160
anybody who's done JavaScript--
lots of people

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.480
learn JavaScript by actually
developing Maps API

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:55.900
applications.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.690
It's simple and powerful--

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:00.955
huge amount of features, huge
amount of services.

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:07.930
So that's why you should
be trusting our cloud.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.270
Now Sean is going to talk
to you about the

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.250
details of Maps Engine.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:12.770
SEAN MADAY: All right.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.490
Thank you, Mano.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.520
As Mano described to you, we at
Google have gotten really

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.160
good at this geospatial stuff.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.870
Consumers around the world trust
our two-dimensional maps

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.070
and our three-dimensional Google
Earth environment to

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.250
make fast informed decisions.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.690
It's that familiarity that we
look to leverage with Google

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:32.290
Maps Engine

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:35.880
I should ask how many of you
have used Google Maps Engine

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.340
or put your hands on this
product to this point.

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.290
Good, OK.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:43.950
So for those joining us via live
stream, the thousands of

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:47.470
people in the audience all
raised their hands, and their

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:50.460
applause and laughter and
cheer was actually a bit

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:50.830
disruptive.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:52.080
But we're back now.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:59.360
Google Maps Engine is how we
have basically productized the

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.370
processes and the pipelines
that we used to make the

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.700
platform behind Google Earth
and Google Maps.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.160
So we have really awesome
engineers, outstanding

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.350
infrastructure that does lots
of really cool things with

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:11.750
geospatial data.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.050
Specifically, our core
competency has become

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:18.040
simplifying the delivery of
complex geospatial data.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.360
And that's what we're offering
with Google Maps Engine.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.725
Google Maps Engine allows you to
take your imagery, terrain,

00:12:22.725 --> 00:12:25.830
and vector data, upload it
into Google's cloud.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.440
It's replicated in
our data centers.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.000
We handle the redundancy.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.110
We handle the failover.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:34.300
You then are given tens of
thousands of processing nodes

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.350
to do interesting things to
process your data and to style

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:40.210
your data, and then all sorts
of interesting end points to

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:42.480
deliver your data out to your
intended audience, whether

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.370
that audience is public or
whether you just want to share

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.500
your data with certain
individuals or groups.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.570
And we'll talk through more
of this as we go.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.860
But these end points include
Google Earth, Google Maps, the

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:57.860
Google Maps API, OGC Standards
like WMS, as well as some

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.090
mobile end points we'll display
for you on a zoom

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:01.340
tablet here in a little while.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.950
So in the last six months, we've
really opened up the

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.830
Google Maps Engine platform and
brought in some trusted

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:12.740
testers and some early

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:18.370
customers to use this platform.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:20.880
And as Dylan Lorimer mentioned
to you yesterday, we're now

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.390
going to increase the velocity
by which we bring

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:24.490
stakeholders in.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.530
And we're hoping to bring lots
more individuals and

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:28.850
organizations into
this ecosystem.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.130
But today, it's interesting to
note that this platform is

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:35.600
already hosting 165 terabytes
of imagery.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.900
Our vector data store is
composed of over 2.5 billion

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.350
features at this point.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.960
And that's growing
exponentially.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.530
And today, Google Maps Engine
is being used to serve over

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.910
1,000 published maps.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.150
So small numbers by Google
standards, but really some

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:54.260
impressive usage and some
impressive adoption in just

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.040
these first few months.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.510
So as I present to you today,
what I want to do is show you

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:01.370
the Google Maps Engine
interface.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:03.510
I want to get you familiar with
some of the workflows.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:06.340
Specifically, I want to show
you how to upload data, how

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.700
that data is aggregated into
individual layers, how you can

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.080
style those layers, and then how
you can publish a map to

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.740
many of those different end
points that I discussed

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:15.990
previously.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:22.030
So as I operate and show you the
interface, we're going to

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:25.510
be referencing back to the
Louisiana Oil &amp; Gas demo that

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:29.290
Mano showed you earlier
in the presentation.

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:32.230
And my goal today is to show
you the workflow around two

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:33.890
different types of data--

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:37.460
that is imagery data, or raster
data, and vector data.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.250
In regards to vector, I'm
going to show you three

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:42.740
different subsets, points,
lines, and polygons; how these

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.400
are handled inside of Google
Maps Engine; and what tools we

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:50.550
give you to style and deliver
this data out to your users.

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:53.820
So Mano showed you what we have
as far as our base data

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.180
around Louisiana.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.250
As we zoom in here, I'll then
activate some of the layers

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:00.450
that he presented to
you a bit earlier.

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:03.280
Specifically we can look at
some point data, like the

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.300
permit locations.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.820
We can look at polygon data,
i.e. the polygons that

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:12.220
encompass those permitted
areas.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:14.040
We can also look at line
data, like the levees.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.150
And then, if our map weren't
cluttered enough, we would go

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.180
ahead and add some
raster data.

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.450
So here's a topographical
chart--

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:28.700
really interesting way to
visualize topographical data,

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.570
in this case, that was
housed by the USGS.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.090
And also imagery-- so I grabbed
this quad of ortho

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:36.400
imagery here from USGS.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.360
We can throw that on top.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.340
This is a scene that Google
doesn't have in our imagery

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.270
database, but this is available
to the public

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.970
through USGS.

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:44.530
And what I really want to
highlight here is that the

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:47.720
Google Maps Engine platform is a
really unique way to deliver

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.830
all this data to the end user
in a simplified way.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:54.150
Any user who's familiar with
Google Maps zooming, panning,

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.620
interrogating icons by clicking
on them, will be

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.820
familiar with this workflow.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.900
And the engineering we've done
in the background makes this

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.420
delivery fast and efficient.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.170
So the user's not sitting
around waiting for

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:06.420
this data to render.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.870
MANO MARKS: Sean,
one key point--

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.380
where does this iframe
come from?

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.630
SEAN MADAY: Yeah, great
point there, Mano.

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:19.330
So this iframe is actually being
populated right now by a

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.120
Maps widget, which is another
end point that we have within

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.050
Google Maps Engine I'll
show you a bit later.

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:25.810
But this is a little
bit of embed code

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:26.830
that we provide you.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:32.130
So at the very simplest
implementation, you can put

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:35.810
one line of HTML code into your
organization's website or

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:37.790
into the public facing website
that you want to use to

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.270
support a disaster response or
humanitarian relief-type

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:43.690
situation, and have all of this
Maps interaction inside

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.450
of inside of your
web environment.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.470
So one other thing I want to
touch on before I jump into

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:55.060
the live interface demo is this
concept of zoom levels.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:01.300
Zoom levels are the way that
we handle the delivery of

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.490
tiles inside of the Google
Maps environment.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.319
So if you're delivering a map,
you have a couple options.

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:09.530
One is to produce a really large
map, high resolution,

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.240
and that can be difficult
to interact with, right?

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.480
The other option is to give
you a small image that has

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.160
very low resolution.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.140
What Google Maps API and Google
Maps has done is they

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:21.760
use a tiling schema, so that
when your zoomed way out

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.970
looking at the whole world,
we're just delivering you a

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:27.109
couple tiles that represent the
world in low resolution.

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:30.630
And as you zoom in, you're
seeing more tiles, each tile

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:32.340
smaller, and those
tiles represent

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.990
higher resolution areas.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:37.250
The reason this is important is
because on the Google Maps

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:40.590
environment that we provide on
consumer devices and to the

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:43.590
average public, we have a vector
team that's done a

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:46.050
phenomenal job of making sure
that the right attributes are

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:47.810
visible at the right
zoom levels.

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:49.540
So for instance, when I'm zoomed
out and looking at the

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.330
United States here, I'm not
seeing every secondary and

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.900
tertiary street that's
available.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.060
In this case, at this zoom
level, it may be appropriate

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.290
for me not to see any
streets at all--

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:02.410
maybe just the labels associated
with states.

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:03.970
As I zoom in further
here, I start to

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:05.210
see interstate highways.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:08.320
As I zoom in further yet, I'll
start to see smaller

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.310
municipalities and smaller
infrastructure pieces.

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:14.460
This is all important, because
in Google Maps Engine we give

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.240
you the tools to style your
own data and to decide how

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.610
that data should be presented
to your audience.

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:25.070
And this chart is handy only in
that, as we style some of

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.630
this data in the demo next, I
just want you to keep in mind

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.520
that when you see these zoom
levels, this is what we're

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.130
talking about.

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.910
Zoom level 5, we're talking
about being zoomed way out at

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:35.640
a global view.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.170
Zoom level 17, 18 to 24, we're
talking about being zoomed way

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:44.870
in where you could see a
building or a street.

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:49.730
And without further ado then, we
will step off and show you

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.750
Google Maps Engine.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:54.490
So this is the landing page of
the dashboard that currently

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:56.060
exists for Google Maps Engine.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:58.220
The first thing you'll notice is
that inside this dashboard,

00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.290
I have some analytics--

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:02.730
so some basic metrics on how
many of my layers are being

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.700
consumed, and when my peak
usage is happening.

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.280
I can also do some querying
based on time to really

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.770
identify when my map data
is being consumed.

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:15.370
The basic building blocks inside
of Google Maps Engine

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:18.260
are data, layers, and maps.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.910
Data is the raw source
information and the raw source

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.200
files that you might currently
have in your geospatial

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.520
repository.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.330
Those are aggregated up into
layers and styled in layers

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:29.020
inside of Google Maps Engine.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.545
And then layers are brought
together as maps.

00:19:31.545 --> 00:19:34.340
An example of a map would be the
Louisiana Oil &amp; Gas demo

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.130
we just showed.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:38.670
So the first piece here
is data ingest.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.150
So what I'll show you here is
how we would upload a piece of

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:42.690
source data.

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:45.320
The upload interface
is fairly simple.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.020
It's just going to ask me right
off the bat if I'm going

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.980
to upload imagery
or vector data.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.170
For this demo, I'm just going
to show you what it would be

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:53.860
like to upload some imagery.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.005
This is always the dangerous
part of the presentation

00:19:56.005 --> 00:19:58.540
though, because I'm going to
browse to a piece of imagery,

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:01.030
and if I do this wrong, I'm
going to end up in a folder

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:04.500
that has all of my Justin Bieber
images and you will

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.810
forever taunt me.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:09.170
So we have to make sure we land
in the right place here.

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:11.780
Here, for example, is one
of those USGS quads.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.260
It's a .tif file.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:17.700
Google Maps Engine will consume
geoTIFFs, JPEG 2000s,

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:22.530
MrSID, most of the industry
standard raster formats.

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.260
In addition to that core source
piece of data, we will

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.040
also take side car files, like
world files and projection

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.760
files that might provide
amplifying metadata associated

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.890
with that image or
that vector data.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:35.200
So in this case, I don't want to
just include the TIFF, I'm

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.710
going to include the world file
and maybe even one of the

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:40.430
attribute files that's
associated with it.

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:43.080
From here, I have the ability
to name that layer.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.310
It's going to default to
whatever the file was named,

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:47.500
but I could put in anything
here that made sense to my

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.350
individual project.

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.670
I can then decide who I
initially want to share these

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:53.820
layers with.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:56.070
The relevance and the importance
of this sharing is

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:58.520
really the inside of the
Google Maps ecosystem.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.290
You can have many map makers.

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:05.140
Map makers are those who can
style data and compose maps

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.520
based on layers.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.560
So in this case, I can decide
which group or which

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.600
individuals inside of my
organization I want to share

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.030
this layer with.

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.050
And then I can assign
attribution.

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:18.260
Attribution is a catalog
of source information--

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.810
source provider information--

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.630
that you cultivate and you
populate inside of your Google

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:24.100
Maps Engine environment.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:27.950
It allows you to very quickly
add attribution to your Google

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:31.690
Earth or Google Maps
end point.

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:32.930
You can put in the
date acquired.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:34.810
This is very handy if you're
going to do some

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:36.730
temporal-based positioning or
if you're going to show

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:38.710
historic imagery or
historic raster.

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:41.240
This is very important, because
you can leverage this

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.650
in a few different ways.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:43.680
You can throw in
a description--

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.710
and then, tags are very
significant, because tags are

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:49.850
what allow us to actually make
this data discoverable and

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:51.780
searchable inside of our
Google Maps Engine

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.710
implementation.

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:56.410
So I'm actually going to cancel
that and show you what

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.740
this looks like once it's
already uploaded--

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:01.510
save you the excitement
of watching that

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:03.140
upload dialogue progress.

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:06.450
But what I can do now is I can
search for some of this data.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:07.690
So up in the search bar
here, I'm going

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:08.940
to search for Louisiana.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.830
Here's all of the layers that
I have branded with that

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:14.460
Louisiana keyword tag.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.840
Here is the raster layer
I was just showing you.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.950
This has been uploaded
and processed.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.880
Google Maps Engine is extremely
fast at processing

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.840
and has gotten faster even
in the last six months.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.960
So it can do really
wild things with

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.940
large chunks of data.

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:30.440
The raw size for
this particular

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.030
image was 110 megabytes.

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.400
But now we can deliver those
out as small consumable map

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.370
tiles for the end user.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:37.960
We get some information
on the resolution.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.330
In this case, we see this
piece was 2.4 meters per

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:44.020
pixel, which equates
to a zoom level 16.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.650
So back to our pyramid--

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:48.790
this would be good to
about zoom level 16.

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:50.130
And from here, I can
then aggregate

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:52.710
this data into a layer.

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:55.700
So if I do another search of my
layers now to show you what

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:59.600
my Louisiana data looks like, I
can show you all the layers

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.020
that I have built using
this Louisiana data.

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.360
Specifically, I want to show you
some of the point data we

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.320
talked about earlier.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.230
In this case, it's the oil
and gas locations.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:12.430
It's the oil and gas wells.

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:15.390
One thing you'll notice is I get
this thumbnail preview in

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:19.100
the upper right hand corner,
which shows me the geographic

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.130
parameters of this
particular file.

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:25.040
Interesting to note here that
this layer of Louisiana Oil &amp;

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.810
Gas actually shows me that I
have coverage all the way up

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:29.180
the center of the United
States through

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.520
the Mississippi corridor.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.360
What we can look and
QC, quality check,

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.750
here with the preview--

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:37.110
and we'll let this render
here a second--

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:41.590
but what we can see is that the
quality of this input data

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:42.230
wasn't great.

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:45.240
And in fact, this Louisiana Oil
&amp; Gas data will show me a

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.480
couple wells that are located
in northern Minnesota.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.250
So the point I want to make
there is that this is not a

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:56.860
tool right now for editing and
for curating your core

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.040
geospatial data.

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.770
And you want to make sure that
the data you upload has been

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:04.970
quality checked before you bring
it into this ecosystem.

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:06.750
Let's see if I can actually--
there's the actual-- there's

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:08.665
our delinquent well there
way up in Minnesota

00:24:08.665 --> 00:24:09.920
that throwing us off.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.980
So the point being there that,
again, we're not here to

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:16.540
replace your existing desktop
GIS-based systems.

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:18.940
The systems you use to generate
and cultivate this

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.720
data are important.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.680
We're just going to become the
visualization layer that

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.380
allows you to easily share this

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.890
information with your users.

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:29.830
From here, I can edit
this layer.

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:32.020
And this is where I wanted
to show you zoom levels.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:36.890
So I have basic options here
to assign either some point

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:40.350
icons, some place marker icons,
or do some different

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:44.710
stylization on these
individual points.

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:47.390
Interesting to note there that,
right now, we don't

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:51.990
support custom icons, but
that's coming very soon.

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:55.280
And what I really want to hit
home with that is that there's

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.980
some really rapid development
cycles

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:58.430
inside of this ecosystem.

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:00.480
And the benefit of a cloud-based
environment like

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.440
this is that we are on a very
fast release cycle where we're

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.300
pushing these things out
every few weeks.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.850
And your users and your map
makers will be able to take

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:09.610
advantage of this functionality
without

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:11.580
installing the latest software,
without going

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:14.880
through an IT change
management process.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.800
One of the benefits of the cloud
is, as fast as we can

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.820
roll out these new features,
they're going to be available

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.670
to you and your map makers.

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:23.800
From here then, I can decide
when these individual well

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.320
attributes should be available
at which zoom level.

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.790
I can also set up some dynamic
filters based on the

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:30.880
attributes inside of
that source data.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.940
So maybe if you're zoomed way
out, I want to show you large

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:37.390
wells-- wells that have a
certain production value that

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:41.520
is quantified inside of
the attribute table.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.890
In that case, I can set up some
pretty simple greater

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:48.730
than-, less than-, equal to-type
equations here to

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:52.520
really specify what portions
of the data I want to be

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.090
available at each layer.

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:57.220
I can dynamically cascade those
filters down and really

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:01.480
create a customized view
for my end users.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:05.930
The same basic workflow exists
for line and polygon data.

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:09.200
I'll show you that just with
levees, again to hit home that

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.190
this is all very customizable.

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:13.300
In this case, we could decide
what colors we want the levy

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.520
to be, full color palette
to choose from.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.090
We could decide how we want
to style those lines.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:20.930
We can also decide how we
want to present labels.

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:23.360
And again, using the cascading
filtering, we could decide

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:27.490
that maybe we want labels on at
a certain viewpoint, but we

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:30.450
want the labels to drop off and
become invisible once the

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:32.580
user is drilled into a
certain zoom level.

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.780
All of that's customizable
inside the Google Maps Engine

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:39.520
vector-based styling UI.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.320
Finally, these layers are all
aggregated inside of maps.

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:48.920
We'll let this load here.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.450
And what I want to specifically
show you and what

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:51.880
I can search-- there we go--

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:54.880
is what these maps look like.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.100
So here's my Louisiana
Oil &amp; Gas map.

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.290
It's going to show me all the
layers that I have aggregated

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:01.590
inside of this map.

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.510
It's going to give me some
metadata about when it was

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:05.270
processed, when it
was published.

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:08.380
And this is where I can really
set some granular sharing

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:08.890
parameters.

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:13.510
So very much like the sharing
parameters inside of Google

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:16.310
Docs, if you've used those, I
can decide which other groups

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:18.770
inside my organization I
want to be able to edit

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:20.680
and modify this map.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:24.070
And then I can decide how I want
to handle the viewing--

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:25.480
the Map user side--

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:28.390
of this particular data.

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:30.640
I can decide to share
this layer publicly.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.820
I can decide to share this layer
with just a specific set

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.590
of groups or individuals.

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:37.930
And then finally, here is
my gateway and all those

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:40.180
endpoints we talked
about earlier.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:42.600
So this is the URL I could click
on to interact with this

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:47.560
map in a Google Maps
API environment.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:50.770
The Maps widget that Mano
asked about earlier, the

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:54.130
iframe code, this is all I would
need to paste into my

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:56.940
web server in order to bring
this Google Maps environment

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.360
inside of my website.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.250
And then also we have
a WMS link here.

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:05.220
The benefit with WMS is that now
we can consume this raster

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.090
and vector data inside of our

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:09.140
traditional desktop GIS systems.

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:13.680
So for instance, if I have a
cadre of QGIS users or ArcMap

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.440
users, this one environment can
serve the geospatial needs

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.080
of my entire organization and
any partner organizations I

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.670
might bring into my ecosystem
on an ad hoc basis.

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:25.660
Specifically there, I'm thinking
about disaster

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:28.830
response or humanitarian relief,
where you have private

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:33.190
organizations partnering with
public organizations in very

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:36.980
dynamic relief efforts that are
then over a month or two

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:37.780
months later.

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:39.990
And that's the power inside
of Google Maps Engine.

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:42.590
It's that you can very quickly
share access to your data

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:45.070
without giving up that source
data, without having to move

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:48.940
around gigabytes or megabytes
of source data.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:52.150
You can share visibility and
just as quickly revoke that

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:53.670
visibility.

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.870
Mano's going to talk to you a
little bit more about some of

00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:58.490
the data behind our Maps
API or some of usage

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:00.170
behind our Maps API.

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:01.910
But this is actually how
I would reference these

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:04.160
individual layers
from Maps API.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.120
That's all detailed for
me here as well.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.062
So the two things I want to
show you before I step off

00:29:08.062 --> 00:29:12.570
then, is first the integration
with Google Earth, both in the

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:17.620
client and in the web-based
plug-in.

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:19.510
So I'll switch this over
to Google Earth here.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:20.760
We'll give it a second.

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:24.880
Maybe.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.130
Possibly.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.220
It wouldn't be a true
demo if something

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:32.260
didn't go wrong, right?

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:33.670
The demo gods are unhappy.

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:35.600
We didn't sacrifice to them
before we started.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.090
MANO MARKS: Oh, sorry.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:36.830
SEAN MADAY: So that's probably
what happened.

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:37.310
MANO MARKS: Forgot that.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:38.805
SEAN MADAY: Do you have
Google Earth on here?

00:29:38.805 --> 00:29:40.570
Do you mind if I launch it?

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:42.620
MANO MARKS: Do you want to
just open up Google Earth

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.500
instead of the plug-in?

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:43.900
SEAN MADAY: Yeah.

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:44.480
MANO MARKS: And show that?

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.460
Yeah, I do.

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:47.260
So yeah, just go
down to there.

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.510
SEAN MADAY: OK.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.100
So obviously, I lied to you.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:54.010
This is Mano's computer,
so those Justin Bieber

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:57.080
pictures were his.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.170
I tried to defend him.

00:29:58.170 --> 00:29:58.450
MANO MARKS: Train.

00:29:58.450 --> 00:29:59.640
I don't know what you're
talking about.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.890
It's Train.

00:30:02.635 --> 00:30:03.060
SEAN MADAY: All right.

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.900
While Mano tries to fix that,
let me show you what this

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:08.980
looks like from a mobile end
point, which is kind of cool.

00:30:11.866 --> 00:30:13.930
Let's see if we can bring
this up here.

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.015
All right, so what you're
seeing here, or what you

00:30:20.015 --> 00:30:21.265
should see here is
a zoom tablet.

00:30:25.378 --> 00:30:26.628
Come on.

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.800
Maybe.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.050
Who did we make angry?

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:42.350
All right, I'll give
this one more try.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.060
I swear this worked before the

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.620
presentation without any trouble.

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:52.870
MANO MARKS: It did.

00:31:01.868 --> 00:31:02.370
SEAN MADAY: All right.

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:04.510
Perfect, thank you.

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:08.370
So here from inside of Google
Earth, I can quickly zoom out.

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:11.190
You'll notice now in the Android
application we have

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:13.050
for Google Earth, you
can authenticate

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:14.450
to Google Maps Engine.

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:17.740
It will then build me a list of
layers that I have access

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.670
to based on the username and
password that I use to

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:22.980
authenticate to that
Google Maps Engine.

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:26.090
From there, I can activate the
layer and then decide which of

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:29.930
those layers I might want to
see inside of my mobile

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:31.680
environment on my Android
device, whether

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.330
that's a phone or tablet.

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:37.580
If you have the Google Maps
downloaded on your Android

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:41.480
device, I would highly encourage
you to check this

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:42.290
feature out.

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:43.010
It's quite neat.

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:45.200
Here you're seeing all the
layers that I have access to.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.450
I can dynamically turn those
layers on or off and view them

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:52.990
as I see fit from this
mobile device.

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:57.150
Mano's logging into our Google
Earth implementation over here

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:58.750
on the desktop, so
let me switch

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.000
back over to his machine.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:14.020
MANO MARKS: There you see I just
went up to File and Log

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.040
In, logged into Maps Engine.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:20.550
By the way, you may have heard
the old name for Maps Engine,

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:21.910
which was Earth Builder.

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:25.260
We rebranded about a
month or so ago.

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:28.060
And then, you see here I have
all the private maps that I

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:29.120
have access to.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:35.210
I can also enter in a globe by
address if it's a public map.

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:35.800
So then--

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.290
SEAN MADAY: So, similar to
unlisted layers that you may

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:40.010
have seen with implementations
like Fusion Tables.

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:40.700
MANO MARKS: Right.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:41.140
Exactly.

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:46.740
So then, here I have the
Louisiana Oil &amp; Gas, and I'm

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:49.300
going to click on that and
go back to Google Earth.

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:52.760
And you'll see down here in the
layers section, I actually

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.480
have Louisiana Oil &amp; Gas.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:33:00.650
And so it's actually integrated
directly with my

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:06.220
experience in Google Earth.

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:10.150
So as I zoom in, you'll see that
I start to see some of

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:13.330
this data showing up--

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:15.640
different zoom levels
that it's set for.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:16.996
And there you go.

00:33:16.996 --> 00:33:18.890
SEAN MADAY: The user can also
control the opacity on this.

00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:21.230
So they can very quickly
go from your enterprise

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:25.160
geospatial layers back to
Google's authoritative base

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.710
globe information, all within
the Google Earth environment

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:29.070
that they know and love.

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:31.240
One other end point we'll just
discuss before I pass it back

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.130
over is Google Earth Portable.

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:35.080
Google Earth Portable is some
really interesting software

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:36.690
that our engineers have
been working on.

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:39.000
It allows you to draw a polygon
around that Google

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.970
Maps Engine implementation that
you've created, extract

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:44.070
all the imagery, terrain, and
vector data inside of that

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:46.720
polygon and create a local
cache of either

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.870
two-dimensional map data or
three-dimensional Google Earth

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:51.680
data that your users, your field
workers can take with

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:54.510
them out into an austere
environment where they may not

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:56.560
have connectivity back
to Google's cloud.

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.590
So that's one of the ways
we're bridging that gap

00:33:58.590 --> 00:33:59.810
between ground and cloud.

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:02.520
I appreciate your time, and I'll
pass it over to Mano to

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.310
run you through some of
the developer options.

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:09.540
MANO MARKS: And actually, here
is that Earth plug-in that you

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:10.400
were looking at before.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:15.800
It hadn't loaded up quickly,
but that's because I had

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.920
loaded in a new browser.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.600
And it's the first
time, I think, it

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.150
was using that cache.

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:26.489
So this is directly loading off
of Google Maps Engine, but

00:34:26.489 --> 00:34:28.580
it is using the Google
Earth plug-in.

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:33.010
So it's a 3D environment
within the browser.

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:37.889
And you can actually do this
with your own Earth API

00:34:37.889 --> 00:34:40.150
applications as well, which
would allow you to combine

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:42.250
with other sources of
data that aren't

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:46.070
hosted on Maps Engine.

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:49.985
So I'm going to switch
back to the slides.

00:34:54.449 --> 00:34:58.390
I turned off my clicker so
I wouldn't bother Sean.

00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:59.100
There we go.

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:02.030
So now we're going to talk about
Google Maps Engine for

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:04.600
developers.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:08.210
There are four different
pieces that you need to

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:12.960
remember about Maps Engine for
developers at this point.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.270
We're in a fairly early stage.

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:20.210
We have MapsDataLayer, which
allows you to take maps and

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:25.370
layers from Google Maps Engine
and apply them directly to

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:27.950
your Maps API applications.

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:32.170
There's a JSON Feed that you
can get, which gives you

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:35.730
access to information
about what is stored

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:37.720
in individual layers.

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:42.580
You can also load a side
database using the Earth API,

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:45.390
which is similar to what
I just showed you.

00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:49.910
And then if you need to do
authentication it it's a

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:52.090
private map, you use OAuth.

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:53.760
So we don't have time
to get into the

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.060
details of OAuth here.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:59.330
And frankly, authentication is a
pain, but I'm sure there are

00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:03.720
other people here who can
walk you through that.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.860
But just keep that in mind.

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.780
So what we're going to be
showing here is public maps,

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:10.420
but this will be--

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.680
if you can implement OAuth in
your application, you can

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:16.180
actually get access to
private maps as well.

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:19.570
So let's go back to this demo
that we showed here.

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:25.650
Now this is, just as a
reminder, same data.

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:28.140
It's the same demo we showed
at the beginning.

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:31.440
And there's this USGS chart.

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.090
Well, I click on it, and it's
actually really tiny.

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:37.330
It's right down in here.

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:40.510
There's not a whole
lot that's there.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:43.210
And then there's some
ortho vector data.

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:45.500
We just basically couldn't
find any--

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:49.020
there's some great raster data
at the site where we were

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:49.870
downloading data.

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:52.150
So keep that in mind as
we get back to it.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:57.800
But this is basically Maps' data
layer loading in that map

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:01.530
that we've been working with.

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:04.320
So here's some basic
code here.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.860
You load in the Google
Maps API loader.

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:12.080
You use the visualization
library.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:15.230
So if you're not familiar with
libraries in the Google Maps

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:16.580
API, we have a number
of libraries--

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:19.650
one of which is visualization--

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:22.730
that are loaded as extra
parameters to the loader.

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:25.790
That is, if you don't load
them, then the API knows

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:29.510
nothing about them, so it
reduces the size of your code.

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:35.910
And then you create a new maps
data layer object and pass it

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:38.910
map ID, layer ID, and
the map that it's

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:41.800
supposed to create on.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.590
And so these are the
basic pieces.

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:45.650
Remember-- visualization,
maps data layer.

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:52.150
And then what you get back as a
piece of that-- this is what

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:54.660
the JSON object contains,
the information

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:57.380
here about your layer.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:01.160
And it gives you a lot of
information in there,

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:09.000
including the bounding box for
a particular layer, a list of

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.900
all the different layers that
are associated with a

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.260
particular map.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:15.010
And that allows you to do some
processing to figure out how

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:18.200
you want to display and interact
with the data.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:27.390
And so some of the key stuff on
here is asset IDs and the

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:30.120
keys for the layers.

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:34.240
So what I did in that demo
before is I just used some

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:38.390
jQuery to go through, parse out
each of the layers, and

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:41.430
add a check box with an
event handler that

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:44.910
triggers them on and off.

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:50.500
We're not done yet, but I want
to give you just a little

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.080
thing to keep in your mind.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:56.780
We announce later this year
that we're going to be

00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:01.730
releasing a full read-write
API for Maps Engine, which

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:04.880
will allow you to upload your
data programmatically to

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:05.680
Google Maps Engine.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:09.410
Currently, that's not an option,
but that is something

00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:12.930
that we are working on and
believe that we can release

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:14.120
within the year.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:17.700
And we think that will allow
developers to do a much more

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:22.450
dynamic approach to uploading,
styling, and

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:25.750
implementing data.

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:28.505
OK, but let's talk about a
couple of other features of

00:39:28.505 --> 00:39:31.260
our Geospatial Cloud that aren't
specifically tied to

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:34.360
Maps Engine.

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.720
And this will all come
together in a minute.

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:41.090
One thing that we released at
Where 2.0 this year is the US

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:42.760
Demographics Layer.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:46.520
So it's a layer that's available
to Enterprise Maps

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:47.440
customers--

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.450
if you have a Google Maps
API for business.

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:52.990
And if you have Maps Engine
you get a business license

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:56.040
along with that.

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.520
So it's available for internal
applications.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:03.280
And you see here that I get data
from the US Census about

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:07.810
things like income, population
density, property values, and

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:08.780
a lot more.

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:12.300
So we're going to take a look
at income in San Francisco.

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:16.420
In 2010, you can see the
different census tracts in

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:19.730
there have different
income levels.

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:21.530
And you can look back.

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:25.870
We actually have the most recent
census information.

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:29.330
We can actually even show you
the boundaries for the census

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:32.000
block, so you get a
nice sense of it.

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:40.880
And then we also recently
released--

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.580
actually the first public

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.600
announcement of it was yesterday.

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:48.990
Dylan talked in the What's New
in Google Maps API talk about

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:55.840
the Google Maps Gallery,
also called the

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.340
Google Earth Gallery.

00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:00.690
And in here, you have
lots of maps

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:02.420
that people have created--

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:06.810
KML files, and also Maps Engine
files that people have

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:11.820
uploaded and made public for
anybody to have access to.

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:18.240
So this is real time sharing
of public data.

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:22.430
And you can do this-- if you
have Maps Engine, you can

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:25.560
submit your maps to
the Earth Gallery.

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:34.226
So let's bring those
together, though.

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:39.470
Remember, I mentioned that I was
a little disappointed with

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:44.890
the raster support in the
state of Louisiana site.

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:47.130
That the raster imagery-- we
just didn't have very good

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:48.910
coverage, we felt.

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:55.070
So what we did here is, I pulled
into this Maps API

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:59.320
application a separate
Maps data layer.

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:05.700
And I brought in topographic
maps from the US Geological

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:09.020
Society, USGS.

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:13.250
And you see here, I can see the
actual topographic maps.

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:16.540
I can even see metadata about
these if I'm at a zoom level.

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:18.320
Well, that doesn't show
up right there.

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:22.390
But if I zoom in, you'll see I
get a little metadata about

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:23.950
each individual map.

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:27.940
And I can actually see a
bounding box of the different

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:31.650
portions of that raster.

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:38.550
So these are three layers
provided in a different map, a

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:42.700
public map made public in
the Google Maps Gallery.

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:46.350
And I just loaded it directly
into the Maps API application,

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:48.550
the same one-- or actually,
a slightly

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:50.030
different file, obviously.

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:55.770
And then I added in,
also, demographics.

00:42:55.770 --> 00:43:00.250
So I can look in and I can see
at a glance-- this is income

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:02.460
by census tract.

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:08.090
What I can see here is the
impact that, for instance,

00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:09.030
permit polygons--

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:11.280
where they are in
relation to the

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:14.890
demographics of that community.

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:19.000
And I can tell, for instance,
the impact that new drilling

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.170
might have on low income or high
income, whatever groups

00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:28.650
that I'm interested in, those
different communities.

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:32.120
So you can see by bringing these
powerful visualization

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:36.720
technologies together, I can
do some really interesting

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:42.570
visual analysis of my data and
layer in different features

00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:46.960
from different maps--

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:52.190
bringing it all together and
then serving it all off of the

00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:53.450
Google geospatial
infrastructure.

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:01.250
So this is your next
call to action.

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:06.530
Tomorrow, Sean Wohltman-- the
other Sean, as I like to call

00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:09.540
him; actually, when I'm talking
to Sean Wohltman, I

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:12.470
refer to Sean Maday as
the other Sean--

00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:15.610
and Mike Evanoff are running a
codelab here where you can

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:17.130
actually play--

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:18.530
Mike's in the back there.

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:20.450
All right, Mike, other Sean.

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:22.770
OK.

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:23.760
This is the other Sean.

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:25.010
Don't worry.

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.950
They're going to run a codelab
with a number of tutors-- a

00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:33.940
number of people will be there
to help out-- where you can

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:37.480
actually get your hands on Maps
Engine and play with it.

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:39.590
And they're going to walk you
through a lot of these steps,

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:42.390
including, for instance, the
OAuth stuff that I kind of

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:46.810
glossed over because it doesn't
really fit well in my

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:47.950
nice presentation.

00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:51.740
But they will cover that in
detail, And you'll actually be

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:54.350
able to get hands on, using
this in a development

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:55.140
environment.

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.620
So I'm really excited
that they're here.

00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:00.830
And I actually sat through a
couple of their different

00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:01.770
practice sessions for it.

00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:04.190
It's really going to be great.

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:07.860
So that concludes the
presentation.

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:11.320
We're really happy to have you
here, and happy to see that

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.820
there's an interest in it.

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:16.780
After this, we'll be out
in the Sandbox--

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.780
at the Google Maps Sandbox--
if you want to ask us

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:20.540
additional questions.

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.840
And we can take questions now.

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:26.090
And of course, both of us are on
Google+ and Twitter, so you

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:29.690
can find us there if
you want to ask us

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:31.070
questions out in the--

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:33.800
well, that's not really
the real world, is it?

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:34.810
SEAN MADAY: The real
virtual world.

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:36.900
MANO MARKS: Yes, so thank
you very much.

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:42.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.590
MANO MARKS: So we can take
questions right now.

00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:46.870
If you would, if you want to
have a question, please come

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:50.010
up to one of the two mics
that are provided.

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:51.035
Yes, go ahead.

00:45:51.035 --> 00:45:52.890
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you for
telling us about this new,

00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:53.720
exciting product.

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:57.980
I was wondering about how
Google Fusion Tables--

00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:00.300
the spatial aspect of that--
fits in with this.

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:01.540
Is this a replacement?

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:03.060
Or do they work together?

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:06.540
Or is Fusion Tables
being deprecated?

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:09.890
MANO MARKS: Fusion Tables is
still an active product.

00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:12.020
It's part of Google Docs.

00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:16.140
And it does run on Google's
infrastructure.

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.710
It's a different kind
of product.

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:24.220
We saw the interest that
was generated by that,

00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:26.730
particularly among Maps
developers, and we got excited

00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:28.170
about that.

00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:31.950
And we learned a lot of
lessons from that.

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:35.390
Because it uses a different
infrastructure for Maps

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:41.270
Engine, we can actually serve a
much greater amount of data.

00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:43.830
Do you want to give the stats
on how big a map can be, how

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:44.850
big your files can be?

00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:47.840
SEAN MADAY: Yeah, what we saw
was that Fusion Tables really

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:50.880
showed that there was a demand
for doing lots of complex

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:54.040
geospatial analysis
in the cloud.

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:58.280
So what we've tried to do with
Maps Engine is provide vector

00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:01.350
tools that will handle tens
of millions of vertices or

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:02.730
hundreds of millions
of vertices.

00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:04.660
So that's where we're really
focused with Google Maps

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:08.690
Engine, is getting beyond those
small use cases into

00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:13.060
those niche geospatial use cases
where there's really fun

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:15.050
things you can do with
big data sets.

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:16.950
MANO MARKS: I spent a lot of
time last year talking about

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:17.660
Fusion Tables.

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:20.800
And when I talk to people who
worked in the geospatial

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.120
industry, I would say,
well, you can upload

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:23.440
large amounts of data.

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.100
They'd say, really?

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:25.000
How much?

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.350
I'd say, well, you can have
files up to 100 megabytes that

00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:28.790
you can upload.

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:33.080
And in the geospatial
world, that's not a

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.950
large amount of data.

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:36.840
But for a lot of use
cases, that is.

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:41.210
So we think they fit into some
different use cases.

00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:45.680
And also we've worked on the
raster support, which isn't

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:48.160
something that we can really
do in Fusion Tables.

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:53.240
So we think this is definitely
the enterprise

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:55.660
solution in the way we--

00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:57.240
SEAN MADAY: If you need a
service-level agreement for

00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:59.690
tens of millions of vertices,
Google Maps Engine is where

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:00.610
we'd point you.

00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:01.100
MANO MARKS: Right.

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:04.310
And how large are the files
that you can upload?

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:06.960
SEAN MADAY: So at this point,
we can support several

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:08.710
gigabyte files.

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:12.130
And we're expecting that limit
to grow exponentially in the

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:12.640
months ahead.

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.830
So we've got some really smart
engineers who are doing great

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:16.330
things with our vector store.

00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:19.628
And that's going to
get big quick.

00:48:19.628 --> 00:48:20.960
MANO MARKS: Yes.

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:24.210
AUDIENCE: I have a simple
question that introduces a

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:26.070
more difficult question.

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:27.280
SEAN MADAY: I'll take
a simple one.

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.500
And then I'll pass it to Mano.

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:29.890
MANO MARKS: I'll take
the hard one.

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:32.010
AUDIENCE: The simple
one is about data

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:34.320
visualization rendering.

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:38.890
Do you foresee to have the
possibility to classify data

00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:43.190
based on an attribute of that
data, so make dynamic

00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:44.580
classification?

00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:49.770
And this introduces the second
one, which is how do you plan

00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:51.270
to evolve this product?

00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:56.310
Will it become a GIS product
in the future?

00:48:56.310 --> 00:48:57.480
Thank you.

00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:58.110
MANO MARKS: You want
the first one?

00:48:58.110 --> 00:48:59.590
SEAN MADAY: Sure.

00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:03.190
So, yeah, great question on
classification of data.

00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:07.770
Specifically, I assume you're
referring to raster data.

00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:11.410
We announced back at the COP
16, the climate summit last

00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:15.700
year in Mexico, that we had been
working on a platform we

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:19.040
call Google Earth Engine, which
starts to do some really

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.600
neat raster analysis.

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:24.030
We look forward to tighter
integration of that platform

00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:28.220
with Google Maps Engine as these
platforms both mature.

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:32.340
But right now the Google Maps
and Google Earth Engine API is

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:33.540
available to trusted testers.

00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:35.830
And if you want to start doing
some raster analysis and

00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:38.050
classification, it's a really
powerful platform for doing

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:38.750
what you described.

00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:39.650
MANO MARKS: Talk to David--

00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:42.840
he's in the audience right
there with the hair--

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:44.850
for Earth Engine.

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:49.290
So then the question is does
this become a GIS?

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:54.060
And I guess it depends on
definitions of what is a GIS.

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:57.210
And I've seen lots of
conversations about that,

00:49:57.210 --> 00:50:00.380
particularly a few years ago,
it was what is a GIS?

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:03.020
At this point, what we're
looking at is, Maps Engine is

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:09.410
a way to serve and share
your GIS data.

00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:14.760
And we are a platform for
collaboration and a platform

00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:15.980
for integration.

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:21.690
And we're also a way for you to
reliably have your data in

00:50:21.690 --> 00:50:27.080
the cloud in a way that
is not going to fail.

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.810
So that's where we're at.

00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:30.120
And we're also looking at--

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:33.850
we have this WMS output.

00:50:33.850 --> 00:50:36.680
So we're looking at ways in
which you can actually then

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:39.550
use Maps and Engine to integrate
not just with your

00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:46.260
web applications but with your
other GIS applications.

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:48.820
We're not done.

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:51.010
We've been out for six months.

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:53.490
We feel like it's a great
product, and it's going to be

00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:55.410
really, really fantastic
at some point.

00:50:55.410 --> 00:50:58.260
So we're really--

00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:01.830
come with us on this voyage.

00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:04.010
I think we're going to have
some really special

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:04.870
stuff coming up.

00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:06.730
SEAN MADAY: And just to add to
Mano's point, I would really

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:11.380
challenge that this is GIS
revisioned and reimagined.

00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:14.530
And our core competency, again,
is simplifying the

00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:16.780
delivery of complex
geospatial data.

00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:19.230
So my mom, my neighbor, when
they want to understand

00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:21.340
geospatially what's happening in
their neighborhood, they're

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:23.680
not going to install a
heavyweight GIS application on

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:24.590
their desktop.

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:27.460
This is the way we see ourselves
as being that

00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:31.850
visualization layer that makes
this consumable to everyone.

00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:33.610
MANO MARKS: Yes.

00:51:33.610 --> 00:51:37.350
AUDIENCE: You were talking
about the ability to push

00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:40.140
edits using the read-write
APIs.

00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:44.730
And I was wondering, have you
decided to allow concurrent

00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:48.180
editing between multiple users
that would show up in real

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:49.280
time to all users?

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:53.560
And if so, how do you handle
data collisions?

00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:54.870
MANO MARKS: You mean
through the API?

00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:56.110
AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:58.850
MANO MARKS: We haven't released
any details on what

00:51:58.850 --> 00:51:59.950
the API's going to look like.

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:06.110
So we've got the basic
infrastructure for developing

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:09.360
the API, but we haven't figured
out all the details,

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:13.520
and I don't want to promise to
something that we can't--

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:17.240
SEAN MADAY: More to
come on that.

00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:18.500
All right, any other
questions?

00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:19.610
MANO MARKS: Yes.

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:21.420
AUDIENCE: You haven't been
mentioning routing.

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:23.250
Are there any plans for
adding new routing

00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:25.900
features in Maps Engine?

00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:26.800
MANO MARKS: That's
a good question.

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.520
So you mean routing over
your own data?

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:29.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:31.810
MANO MARKS: That's a really good
question, and it's the

00:52:31.810 --> 00:52:33.350
kind of thing that
comes up a lot.

00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:39.270
And the only thing that we have
announced right now about

00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:42.400
future features is that we will
have this read-write API.

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:47.550
We can't tell you what other
features until Dylan Lorimer

00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:49.450
tells us that we can.

00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:51.460
We can't tell you what other
features are going

00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:52.380
to be part of it.

00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:54.150
But it's a really
good question.

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:56.640
I talk to developers around
the world who are really

00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.810
interested in that kind
of functionality.

00:52:58.810 --> 00:53:00.160
It's very hard to do.

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:05.530
And we actually have solved
it on our own systems.

00:53:05.530 --> 00:53:07.960
I'd love to be able to
give that to you.

00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.950
SEAN MADAY: And I would
recommend, too, stop by the

00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:11.940
Sandbox and see what some of
our partners are doing with

00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:14.530
this platform and all
of our geoplatforms.

00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:16.500
MANO MARKS: GeoEye, I think,
is there today.

00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:21.370
GeoEye provides much of our
satellite imagery today.

00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:26.530
And they use Maps Engine as a
way to work with partners and

00:53:26.530 --> 00:53:29.490
distribute their data.

00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:31.025
It's really great and
inspiring to hear

00:53:31.025 --> 00:53:33.640
what they're doing.

00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:36.500
Other questions?

00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:38.260
OK.

00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:39.510
Do you mind getting
to the mic?

00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:47.900
AUDIENCE: You presented the
styling for the points.

00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:51.070
Do you have the same for
polygons, points, lines?

00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:53.210
Is it going to be a whole
theming tool?

00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:53.940
SEAN MADAY: We do, yeah.

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:57.200
So your question was on, if I
heard you right, styling for

00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:58.120
points, lines, and polygons.

00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:01.990
Just in the interest of time, I
left off after I showed the

00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:03.370
styling of lines.

00:54:03.370 --> 00:54:07.390
But yeah, styling of polygons
is in the tool today.

00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:10.740
And we only expect that those
styling features are going to

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:12.980
become more robust in
the releases ahead.

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:16.030
So I'll slowly bring that up
as we're talking here.

00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:18.220
But yes, the answer to your
question is yes, we

00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:18.990
support that now.

00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:20.630
So here's the permanent
polygons.

00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:23.620
I have the ability to edit these
styles with both what

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:26.630
the border should look like,
thickness, color, and then the

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:30.710
fill, with not just a color,
but an opacity as well.

00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:33.810
AUDIENCE: Once the API is out,
would you be able to do that

00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:35.050
through the API?

00:54:35.050 --> 00:54:37.020
SEAN MADAY: Our goal is to
provide a rich set of features

00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:37.720
through the API.

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:42.690
So, there are no specific
announcements, but absolutely.

00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:46.370
MANO MARKS: If you see Dylan
Lorimer, ask him.

00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:48.360
Get him a couple drinks, and
maybe he'll tell you.

00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:50.690
SEAN MADAY: Tell
you everything.

00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:51.940
MANO MARKS: Any more
questions?

00:54:54.070 --> 00:54:54.900
OK, great.

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:56.750
Thank you so much.

00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:58.090
Again, we'll be out
in the Sandbox.

00:54:58.090 --> 00:54:59.340
SEAN MADAY: Thanks, everyone.
