I want set the record straight about penis
bones.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.769
Walruses have the prestigious distinction
of having the largest ones on the planet.

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.260
Penis bones – or bacula – are enigmatic
structures that are possessed by males of

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.360
various species across several mammalian orders.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.880
They aren’t true bones inasmuch as they
are actually derived from outside of the skeleton

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.730
– from connective tissue that forms at the
very tip of the penis.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.140
Despite the fact that walruses have kind of
won the evolutionary lottery of the penis

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:40.480
bone – scientists cannot come to a specific
agreement as to their exact function.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.210
The leading hypothesis as to the original
function of the baculum is in helping to maintain

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.690
erections.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.000
You can imagine that the Northern oceans (where
mammals with the largest penis bones are found)

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.809
are quite cold, and copulations most often
occur in the freezing water.

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.310
Copulation on land does happen sometimes and
it comes with its own hazards…

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.729
I mean, have you seen a walrus?

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.710
If things get a little rough (as they often
do), delicate phalluses could easily be crushed.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.810
So the bacula help to ensure that penises
remain intact and functional.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.700
Female preference is another important aspect
of penis-bone biology.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.189
In addition to facilitating the maintenance
of erections and providing penis protection,

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:31.000
there are aspects of baculum morphology that
are shaped by what the ladies like.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.119
After all, if a baculum is shaped in such
a way that it stimulates and pleasures the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.340
females, it follows that males with said bacula
will be more likely to score.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.630
Others species have smaller, but much more
intricate bacula with spines, hooks and curves.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.630
Interestingly, the penis bones of walruses,
sea lions and polar bears are termed OOSIKs

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.469
in Native Alaska cultures and they are used
as handles for tools.

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.580
This is the pretty much extent of human interaction
with penis bones, as our species no longer

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.799
possesses them - even though some of our closest
primate relatives do.

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:13.090
So unlike the animals gifted with bacula,
human males have to perform without this added

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.140
advantage.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.540
