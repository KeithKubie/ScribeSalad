Tina Fey

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.640
Fireside Chat
With Eric Schmidt

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.640
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Hi. Hello!

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.640
(Standing ovation).
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Thank you.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.640
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: I told you they would -- they

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.640
were excited.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Awesome.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.899
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: But the -- Tina, Tina Fey
grew up in Pennsylvania. She spent a lot of

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:46.410
time in Chicago, big fan of Second City.
She ultimately became the lead writer in Saturday

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.890
Night Live. And from there, architected one
of the most successful shows on television.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.850
And from there, had a huge impact in the last
few years on politics and media and so forth.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:07.119
And perhaps most important, she announced
last week she's pregnant with her second child.

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.210
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Thank you. Thank you, Eric.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.650
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Welcome to Google.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Thank you very much. It's so nice

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.700
to be here.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: I've been reading your book,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.799
in fact, I read it.
And I want to start with a reading --

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.920
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I hope it's something about one

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.960
of my periods or something.
[ Laughter ]

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:38.510
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: There's a lot in the book
about women things, which I'm not going to

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.110
quote from.
"But now every girl is expected to have Caucasian

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.610
blue eyes, full Spanish lips, a classic button
nose, hairless Asian skin with a California

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.380
tan, a Jamaican dance-hall ass, long Swedish
legs, small Japanese feet, the abs of a" -- and

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.960
I'm going to omit the rest.
"The person closest to actually achieving

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.140
this look is Kim Kardashian, who as we know
was made by Russian scientists to sabotage

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.750
our athletes. Everyone else is struggling."
[ Laughter ]

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.570
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: What does this mean?
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: This is a little section in the

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:18.820
book about the state of being a woman in 2010.
In the book, I said, when I grew up in the

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.130
'70s and '80s, you were good looking or not.
And if you weren't good-looking, you could

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.060
just, like, learn a trade and just relax.
And there's this kind of feeling now that

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.930
if you are not good-looking, you are to Frankenstein
yourself until you are. You are to buy new

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.420
teeth and hair and other assets.
And so that's what we're living with now,

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.260
Eric. That's what we're --
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So her book is wonderful.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.160
It's the funniest book you'll ever read. And
it's a book not only about her growing up

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:57.100
and all the things that happened to her as
a young woman, as well as a professional woman,

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.664
but a lot about life.
And so it has a lot of lessons in it. So,

00:02:59.664 --> 00:03:05.909
for example, stop. I've got a gun.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: The gun I gave you for our wedding

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.800
anniversary, Eric? How could you?
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: We're not married.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:16.090
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Aha, we're not married is a denial.
We've learned our first improv lesson.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.090
[ Laughter ]
[ Applause ]

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.629
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: It takes a long time to learn.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: This is the problem with an

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.620
engineer trying to learn --
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: It takes a long time to learn

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.849
those basic rules of improv.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Why don't you take us through

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.489
them. They're in the book.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I improvised at Second City, a

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:41.060
place called improv Olympic in Chicago. I
talk in the book about improv kind of having

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:48.690
changed my professional life and even sort
of my world view a little bit.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:49.959
There are some basic rules of improvisation.
When you're creating something out of nothing,

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.601
the first rule is to agree, which is to say
"yes," which we did do that successful. You

00:03:55.601 --> 00:04:01.200
said, "Freeze, I have a gun." I didn't say,
"That's not a gun. That's your finger."

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.840
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Which is what a Google person
would say.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.700
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Okay.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:13.250
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: And so we agreed. And the next
rule is yes and, which is to add on to what

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.390
you've already agreed upon.
So the gun, the gun I gave you for our wedding

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.670
anniversary. How could you?
And then we hit a brick wall, Eric.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:27.310
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: But it's funny, because it's very

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.770
-- some very famous comedians -- there's an
old story about Joan rivers was at the Second

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.460
City briefly, 1959, 1960, they used this in
class at Second City all the time. There was

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:39.580
someone who came in and said I want a divorce
was beginning the scene. She said, I want

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.910
a divorce. Whoever was with her said, what
about the children? And she said, we don't

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:49.150
have any children, which, in the moment, got
a big laugh, but killed the scene. So that's

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.360
-- it's a very --
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So my response would be --

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.390
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Human instinct.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Yes, we have children, I just

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.890
didn't tell you. That's why we're getting
divorced.

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:00.169
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Yes, I have some other children.
This is exactly why.

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:06.650
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Got it.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: For me, it was a lot about being

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:13.280
-- you have to be open to any possibility
and you're being open to the fact that -- an

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.820
idea that you stumble upon together is likely
to be more interesting than the idea that

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.400
you started with as individuals. And all that
stuff was very helpful as a writer.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.160
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So when you were growing up,
did you know that you would be funnier than

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.840
everybody else?
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: No. I mean --

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.370
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Did people tell you this when
you were 13?

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.960
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: No, people did not say, "You're
so funny."

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.239
I think mostly what comedian -- people in
comedy know at a certain age is that they

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:44.210
want to be funny. You know what I mean? You
know you're really interested you and want

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.580
to do it. Then you don't know for a long time.
I think at 13, it's -- manifests itself as

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.620
annoying.
[ Laughter ]

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.330
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: And then you hone it for, like,
25 years.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:00.360
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: And sometimes it's still annoying.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.960
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: One of the people who was,
I think, the biggest influence on you was

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:13.200
Lorne Michaels. And in the book, you have
a lot of discussion about Lorne and his rules.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.940
He has a rule, for example, that don't work
with people you can't hang out with at 3:00

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:21.200
in the morning.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Yeah. Don't ever hire anyone you

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.260
don't want to run into at 3:00 outside of
the bathroom.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:31.530
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: He has another rule about
Harvard and people who didn't go to college.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.159
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Some are things that he actually
says out loud and some are things that I just

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:34.159
sort of gathered from spending a lot of time
with him.

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:39.149
But he just somehow knew that there was a
-- the best mix for Saturday Night Live and

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:46.080
something I tried to apply at 30 Rock was
to take a mix of Harvard people or Harvard-style

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:55.060
people, very cerebral, very organized, and
then to mix them with kind of visceral, fun

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.770
sort of Chicago people.
So you take --

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.060
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: These are two rather broad

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.720
brushes, I might add.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: They are.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.830
You take -- I'm trying to think of people
-- you take Conan O'Brien and you put him

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:14.690
with Chris Farley. And then that is a mix
that makes for good sketch comedy. Because

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:21.589
when one gets too cerebral, the other pulls
it out. And it's -- it actually does work.

00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:22.595
And too much of one or the other usually is
not good.

00:07:22.595 --> 00:07:30.240
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Yeah, you have another rule.
Never tell a crazy person he's crazy. What's

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:36.151
prompted that rule?
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: It doesn't ever get you what you

00:07:36.151 --> 00:07:40.380
-- you know, if someone comes to you in a
workplace situation with sort of a strange

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:46.320
demand or -- like, they have a problem that
you yourself don't see as a problem, it's

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.080
not really useful to say, like, "You're being
crazy right now." It doesn't really solve

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.110
the situation.
[ Laughter ]

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:57.140
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Just makes them more upset.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Yeah, just makes them not trust

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:01.880
you. It's something -- because it's my instinct
that I learned to kind of -- to move away

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:07.330
from was to be, like, "Stop being crazy. Just
everybody be cool." Which is not a really

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.620
good management technique.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Okay. We'll try that. Just

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.120
be cool.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Everyone just knock it off.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.419
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: We --
[ Laughter ]

00:08:17.419 --> 00:08:26.310
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Now, I think the most common
question that you get of all is about gender

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:30.640
differences in comedy, comedy writers, comedy
shows, and so forth.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.300
And alarmingly, in your book, you actually
do say that there's a difference.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:41.060
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I admit to the -- the secret core
difference that -- between male and female

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:45.610
comedy writers. Usually I try to -- people
ask me that question a lot, what's the difference

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:50.209
between men and women in comedy and what do
they like? And usually I try to just be so

00:08:50.209 --> 00:08:54.379
boring that they lose interest in the answer
and walk away.

00:08:54.379 --> 00:08:57.779
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: But -- 'cause I always say, well,

00:08:57.779 --> 00:09:01.120
there's a tremendous amount of overlap in
the middle of what men and women and all people

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:06.660
find funny. And then at the outset, you know,
men kind of maybe like Sharks and robots doing

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:13.570
things more than women -- you know, the masturbating
bear is over here and sort of over here is

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:17.020
absolutely fabulous kind of detailed character
study things.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:25.350
But the truth is that -- the secret truth
is that times the men urinate in cups.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:28.950
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Tell me --

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:35.740
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I don't know if that happens here.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: First I've heard of it if

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:39.590
it's true here.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I said certainly not all of them,

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:44.250
but just, you know, compared to zero of the
women.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:51.250
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Can you imagine the women trying

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:52.250
to do that in their offices? It would be so
much more difficult. Although not impossible.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.520
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: I think maybe we should move

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.680
to another section of the book.
[ Laughter ]

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:03.060
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Also, the men sometimes pretend
to rape each other. The women never do that.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:07.430
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I deal in generalizations, but....

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:11.090
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Never do it.

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:16.160
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Shall we move to the next
section of the book? Okay.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.460
Did you want to add any more?
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: No. That was it.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:24.360
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Okay.
Now, this book also has a lot of information

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.830
that's very helpful, as you become enormously
famous and successful.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:33.590
And one of them for yourself was how to pose.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Yes. How to be photographed.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:38.030
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: How to be photographed. And
you've been photographed on everything. And

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:44.940
you're now widely, widely recognized. You
tell the story of -- as a comedy writer, nobody

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.800
knew who you were. And now you're recognized
everywhere.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.050
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: It's a weird thing.
And I have actually been photographed in lots

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:56.870
of kind of formal model-like settings, kind
of a lot of times now. And it's -- it is one

00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:01.610
of the most fun things you'll ever do if you
-- people like to pretend to complain about

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:06.060
it and say it's hard. It is delightful.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Okay.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:11.700
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: You are treated to, you know,
like -- you're treated like a queen, like,

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:18.520
anything you want to eat? Do you want some
kind of special coffee. You're always in some

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:24.080
beautiful loft space. And they try to put
clothes on you that are made for -- they're

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:30.120
doll clothes. You should know if you see anyone
you ever know in a magazine, their clothes

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:36.370
are gaping open in the back with large metal
clamps. I don't care who it is.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:41.131
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: What's the best way to pose?
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Best way to pose is first to -- you

00:11:41.131 --> 00:11:46.570
have to let go of any rational understanding
that what you're doing is ridiculous. So you

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:52.410
have to proceed as if it's going very well.
You need to make as many angles with your

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.570
body as possible. It's just as many -- like,
that's how you look, really, like to -- any

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:55.820
kind of (indicating).
[ Laughter ]

00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:05.880
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: You have to look in your face
try to look like you took a Benadryl, like,

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:10.450
30 minutes ago or something.
[ Laughter ]

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:18.780
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: There are a lot of tricks. But
most of it is just pretending like you have

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:25.860
to abandon your own sort of intelligence of,
like, this is insane.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.970
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Okay.
Your relationship -- It's interesting that

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:35.720
you chose Alec Baldwin, and you did -- you
and Lorne tried to hire him. He -- he initially

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:42.340
was not sure, and then he sort of said yes.
And you talk both in the book and in interviews

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.950
about your view of him.
Let me just read, because I think it's actually

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.440
worth hearing.
"Everything I learned about real acting I

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.720
learned from watching Alec Baldwin. By 'real
acting,' I mean an imitation of human behavior

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.500
that is both emotionally natural and mechanically
precise enough to elicit tears or laughing

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:01.090
from humans. He's a master. He can play the
emotion at the core of a scene. He is falling

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:05.850
in love, his mother is torturing, his mentor
has been reincarnated as a peacock while reciting

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:09.630
long speeches word for word and hitting all
the jokes with the right rhythm."

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:14.580
You like Alec Baldwin.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: He's very good at acting. Yeah,

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:20.100
I do like him.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: And the two of you carry the

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.529
show, as best I can tell.
And sort of the -- the interaction between

00:13:24.529 --> 00:13:31.170
the two of you. He, the -- just say overly
self-confident executive, and you, the very,

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:37.120
very well-meaning writer.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Mm-hmm.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.170
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Tell me about -- tell me about
how it actually works.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:45.260
Do you -- the stuff is written for you guys?
Do you guys invent it?

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.100
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Oh, no.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: He's funny by himself.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.910
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: He is funny by himself. But the
show is very much written.

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:58.290
We shoot the show on film. And a lot of shows
are shot on high-def video. But we shoot on

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:00.071
film. We sort of got in under the wire. They
don't really let people do that very much

00:14:00.071 --> 00:14:01.071
because it's more expensive. But it's also
more kind.

00:14:01.071 --> 00:14:07.620
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: And as you can tell by that under.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:17.920
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: It's time for another one
of those Benadryl pose things.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:23.589
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: So we don't have time to alter

00:14:23.589 --> 00:14:27.550
very much during our shooting day. We shoot
about 12, 14 hours a day.

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:32.700
And so we have an excellent writing staff.
And they write for him. And we do table reads

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:38.210
of the scripts about a week before. So we,
you know, read the thing aloud for a group

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:44.930
of about 25 people, and we -- so, you know,
we all have the chance to kind of respond

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:47.850
to the script then. If Alec has any thoughts
then, he gives them.

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:51.960
We do a rewrite of it. And by the time we're
rehearsing and shooting, things are pretty

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:56.660
much locked. Every now and then you do find
something fun in the moment that is that thing

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:01.279
I talk about of Harvard and humanity coming
to meet. And sometimes you have to -- you

00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:06.290
know, the Harvard brain has to think, okay,
these humans think they've found something

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:11.680
in the moment. We'll let them do it.
[ Laughter ]

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:19.310
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: And that's sort of how it goes.
Then we rehearse and we film.

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:23.700
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: The -- I wanted to talk a
little bit about -- you know, you were sort

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:28.720
of pretty famous, and then the Sarah Palin
maneuver came along.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:33.340
And what really happened was, she became a
national candidate and people began to notice

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:37.870
the resemblance.
And for a six-week period, you were number-one

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.840
topic in the national media of America.
Let's talk about how that felt.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:47.430
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Yeah. It was very weird. I went
from being what I would describe as kind of

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:52.400
comfortably famous, which was if anyone knew
me from Saturday Night Live or from 30 Rock,

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:59.920
it was because they had really watched it
and, you know -- and that jump of that kind

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:09.930
of more just arbitrary fame, it's very strange.
But --

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:14.700
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: You were originally opposed
to doing it. You didn't want her on the show;

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.640
right?
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Well, I was -- I was talking to

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.980
Lorne about doing it because it was this kind
of thing where if people just noticed that

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.750
we had a vague resemblance.
[ Laughter ]

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:28.471
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Vague.
And brown hair and glasses. I say, if she

00:16:28.471 --> 00:16:34.220
-- if Sarah Palin had chosen contact lenses
ten years ago, I would not be with you right

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.220
now.
[ Laughter ]

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.930
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Because it was that basic glasses,
brown hair thing. And people somehow knew

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:43.630
that I had been on SNL. No one seemed to notice
that I did not work there anymore.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:46.800
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: That I had a new program that

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:52.990
was -- had been on for two years. And that
even when I did work there, I only did the

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:57.100
news. But people were like brown hair, glasses.
We get it. We want it.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.750
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: But I knew that that was -- I

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:05.829
knew people who were real impressionists,
people like Darryl Hammond and Dana Carvey,

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:11.000
who, really, this is truly a gift they have.
So I was reluctant at first.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.020
But once we ended up doing it, it was really
fun. About seven weeks into it, --

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.819
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: She shows up.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: -- she wanted to come, yeah. I

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:26.890
was, again, reluctant, because it was -- the
election was getting sort of weird, and there

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:31.350
was ugly --
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Well, all of a sudden people

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:33.920
are dealing with you, because either they
think you are Sarah Palin, right, or they

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.290
think you hate Sarah Palin --
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Right. They assume that I hate

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.280
--
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: -- or all of a sudden all

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.920
the bad starts and politics comes out.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Yeah. I did find that there was

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:49.040
a weird gender difference in that people would
-- I would accidentally put on cable news

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:56.760
during the day, just to get ready to go to
SNL, and I would see someone and say -- I

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.540
saw a guy on there once talking about how
he just thought I had really conducted myself

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:03.410
badly, and she had been so gracious about
this. I was, like, I'm just doing sketches.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:08.100
And people, you know -- I think there was
a perception that it was mean in some parts

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:14.150
of the media, because -- and I think that
was because it was two women, that that was

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:18.660
the only way they could process it, was it
was mean. No one ever thought it was mean

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.830
of Will Ferrell to play George Bush. No one
ever thought it was mean of Darryl Hammond

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:29.340
to play Bill Clinton.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: And she was, in fact, gracious

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.100
to you personally.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Yeah, we had a nice chat.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:37.820
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Later, she said she complained
about your role in her campaign.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:44.580
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: We had a perfectly lovely day
together. And then later, in some documentary,

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:50.800
she felt that Katie Couric and I had exploited
her family for profit or something.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:56.470
And I say, show me the receipt!
[ Laughter ]

00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:06.130
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So we're getting ready for
-- for the next season of 30 Rock. And you

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:10.740
also have a movie that you're going to work
on.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.309
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I do?
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Yes.

00:19:12.309 --> 00:19:14.330
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Which --
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: That's what they said.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.340
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Okay. I wonder what that is.
[ Laughter ]

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.030
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Okay.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I have a couple movies I'm supposed

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:20.600
to be working on.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Okay.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:26.700
So what does -- aside from the new arrival
soon, what does the next few years -- I assume

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:32.490
if Mrs. Palin runs, you'll be back --
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I hope so. It's tricky, because

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:37.350
I don't work there. So at some point if they
want to switch it to an actual SNL employee

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:44.420
so they can do it with the frequency they
want, I would understand that. But I would

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:49.940
be available for that in 2012 if they need
that.

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.650
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: It's so fun to just go down, just

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:56.950
show up on Saturday and do one sketch and
then start drinking.

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:00.100
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: We have lots of -- lots of

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:07.020
questions from you all.
We also -- I sent a series of tweets to get

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.771
questions from people outside of Google as
well.

00:20:09.771 --> 00:20:11.240
Let me throw a few at you.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Okay.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:14.980
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: And then after a few minutes,
we'll also get some questions here from folks

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:19.680
here in the audience.
We have 47 video conferences going on in addition

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.160
to the people in this room.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Wow.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.750
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: So we have a lot of people
watching.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:25.890
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: (Waving).
[ Laughter ]

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:32.590
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: This is from Briana, a Googler.
Who's your favorite guest star on 30 Rock?

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:36.853
Favorite host from your SNL days? Why?
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: We've had so many guest stars

00:20:36.853 --> 00:20:39.710
on 30 Rock that we have been so lucky.
My favorite. I mean, we had -- there are people

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:46.590
that just to meet them was a dream come true
for me. We had Tim Conway. Everyone here maybe

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:58.430
is too young to remember who that is. But
who was on. He was a favorite of mine.

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:03.980
Jan Hooks playing Jane Krakowski's dirt-bag
mother is a favorite of mine, because I grew

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:13.290
up watching her at SNL and loving her. People
like Jon Hamm who just now is like a member

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:14.290
of the family.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Oh, he's phenomenal.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:16.860
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: And he's so funny.
Yeah, there's, like, a million of them.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:21.170
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: This is from Jenny, also a
Googler. Given how hilarious everyone on the

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:24.890
30 Rock cast is what's the average number
of takes that you have to redo because everyone

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:27.380
is cracking up.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Because everyone is laughing?

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.999
We do a lot of takes because no one knows
their lines.

00:21:29.999 --> 00:21:31.440
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: But I would say actual cracking

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:38.100
up happens only when there's also a lot of
fatigue involved.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:51.620
Jack McBrayer gets the giggles every now and
then. Alec almost never ever breaks. I would

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.870
say once a month there's a gigglefest.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Interesting. So this is professionals;

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:56.309
right.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Very professional.

00:21:56.309 --> 00:22:01.410
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: You're professionals.
This is from a fan of yours in Macedonia.

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.190
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Okay.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Which is still a country.

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:07.390
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Hi, Tina. One of the reasons

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:11.780
I love 30 Rock so much is the amazing chemistry
between you and Alec Baldwin. Who do you think

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:17.020
is or was the actor/actress you've had the
best chemistry with? Does it come naturally

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:21.950
or does it require a lot of work?
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: That's a good question.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:26.590
Well, I think it probably would be Alec, because
I've never -- well, that's not -- I guess

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:33.750
at this point, I've been on screen for more
minutes and hours than I was with Amy Poehler

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:39.990
or Jimmy Fallon. I think those things come
naturally. I don't think you can fake them.

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:41.800
Although maybe he's good at faking it. Maybe
he's --

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:51.470
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: My favorite scene is the one
with Alec Baldwin where he is -- he's obsessed

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.390
about meetings and he has to go to the meeting
about meetings.

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:55.140
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Yes. And he wants to be on the
cover of meetings magazine.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:23:00.740
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: That's my own ambition.
[ Laughter ]

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:05.510
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: This is from a fan from Auburn,
Alabama.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:07.610
Hi, Tina.
Apart from Comedy Rules, will we ever see

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:11.950
you in some serious roles for films or television?
Do you also enjoy doing serious or dramatic

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:17.250
roles if you can get them?
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I would like my career to drift

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:20.559
toward being a judge on Law and Order.
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:23:20.559 --> 00:23:28.990
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I feel like the hours and the
outfit appeal to me.

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:34.130
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I think it would be fun to do.

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:39.950
But I think I don't know that anyone would
ever let me do a wholly serious role.

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:45.610
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: This is from a fan in Michigan.
Thanks for being such an inspiration to young

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:48.890
women. You're my hero.
If you had one word of advice for aspiring

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.780
20-something female writers and entrepreneurs,
what would it be?

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.830
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Not literally one word?
[ Laughter ]

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:57.500
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Now you're behaving like a
Googler.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.350
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Yeah.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Don't be so literal.

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:14.350
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Gosh, I -- I think my advice would
be to trust your gut, to trust your gut creatively

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:22.030
and in any kind of workplace situation. 'Cause
the few times that I look back on anything

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:26.620
that, oh, I wish I would have done this differently,
it's when I had a sense to it, but I didn't

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.290
follow up on.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: That's interesting.

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:34.730
Another question from a fan in Michigan.
Sorry, from -- different one -- from a Googler

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:38.780
named ZVE. You said you incorporate actual
quotes from your daughter into 30 Rock. Quote,

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:42.470
I want to go there, unquote. Are there other
examples, how old is your daughter?

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:46.930
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: She's five and a half.
"I want to go to there" was something that

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:52.370
Liz Lemon said that she saw when she saw the
Web site for Disney World the first time.

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:53.370
And --
[ Laughter ]

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:56.980
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: In your book, you rate activities
with your daughter roughly equal to everything

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:00.690
else you've accomplished.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Yeah, for sure.

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:07.290
I look back, if I go through my phone and
there's these weird chunks of time where it's,

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:13.370
like -- because I have, like, 4,000 pictures
on my phone. And it'll be, like, pictures

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:22.120
of us at SNL doing the Sarah Palin thing,
and then taking her to her first day of preschool,

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.880
and then going to the Emmy's. And there's
things on the table. And then coming back.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.700
The phone is a good way to see what is actually
-- you're really actually doing in your life.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:34.499
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: And we want you to use a more
powerful phone.

00:25:34.499 --> 00:25:37.549
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: And we have a lot of applications

00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:40.299
that can help you with what you can go, what
you can do.

00:25:40.299 --> 00:25:42.410
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Awesome.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: This is what we do. We're

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:45.250
good at it.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Was it because I did that, you

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.730
can tell --
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: When your daughter gets older,

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:50.679
you can keep track of your daughter. Trust
me, you're going to want our phones.

00:25:50.679 --> 00:25:54.940
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Subdermal chip.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: That's been proposed. But

00:25:54.940 --> 00:26:00.740
we're not quite there yet.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I'm trying to think of what other

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:07.790
lines. She -- when she sits -- if she sits
like this, when she -- she calls this sitting

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:15.799
on her knees butt. So we use that. That makes
sense. Tracy Jordan talking about his knees

00:26:15.799 --> 00:26:20.270
butt. It usually works out very well for Tracy
Jordan's character. They have a lot of similar

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:25.120
interests. They both get really excited at
Benihana. And they have to be told they can't

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:28.380
have McDonald's every day. They're similar
people.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:31.960
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: This question is too embarrassing.
I'll let you read it.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:38.150
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: (Laughing) This is a Googler.
I don't know what these numbers and things

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:42.770
are. But this is -- this is an easy one.
Can Eric Schmidt get a guest appearance on

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:49.029
30 Rock?
I would say absolutely.

00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:50.735
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: I just wanted to prove that

00:26:50.735 --> 00:26:54.540
I did not submit that question.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Well, you could have typed this

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:56.220
fake number.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: We will give -- I did not

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.210
type that. We'll give this employee a raise,
however.

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:01.450
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Her name is Julie.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:05.940
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Julie, yes.
This -- absolutely. In a universe where our

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:12.299
guest stars have been everywhere from jack
Welch to -- which -- Bob Ballard. We tried

00:27:12.299 --> 00:27:15.590
to get the real Bob Ballard. But he wasn't
available.

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:19.690
You're just the kind of guest star that would
keep our ratings --

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:23.010
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Low.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: -- low.

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:26.260
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Next question.
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:32.080
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: This is from a fan from Fresno,
California. The entire question is, pirates

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:36.059
or ninjas? Question mark.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I've been asked this question

00:27:36.059 --> 00:27:39.470
before. Recently.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: I'm not making it up.

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:42.510
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Yes. Chasa Melton, your screen
name.

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:45.510
I think I said pirates the last time, because
I think --

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:49.990
[ Cheering. ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I think you're by the water, pirates.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:55.200
And I like the outfits better.
[ Laughter ]

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.600
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Another question. This is
from a Googler.

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:05.110
In 30 Rock flash backs, you often depict yourself
as a geek in high school. And your Mean Girls

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:09.630
script identifies more with the uncool crowd.
What's your actual experience? Is it more

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:13.520
sort of comedic value? Were you sort of geeky?
Because in the book, you describe yourself

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:20.799
as sort of growing up a little bit tentative.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Mm-hmm. I was sort of geeky. Also,

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:24.250
I think that almost everyone perceives themselves
as being on the outside in high school.

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:27.850
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: There are no insiders at high
school.

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:36.420
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Except those two kids. And they
don't look that great now. They peaked at

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:37.860
19.
Yeah, and I was very --

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:42.520
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Called revenge of the nerds.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Revenge of the nerds. Look where

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.730
we are.
[ Laughter ]

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:52.620
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Yeah, I was a -- like, an AP student,

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:55.010
on the newspaper, and Enquire.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Typical overachiever.

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:57.220
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Yeah. I mean, I was an achiever.
There were better achievers. But yeah.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:07.820
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Yeah. The -- another question
from a fan in Munich.

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:14.600
Hi, Tina. Do you sometimes Google yourself?
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: No. No. It's exceeded a level

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:19.991
where no -- really, no good will come of it.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: We encourage people to use

00:29:19.991 --> 00:29:22.210
Google.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Yeah, I use Google a lot. But

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:27.630
I don't Google myself. Because, inevitably,
terrible, terrible things come up. And I have

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:34.960
tried to explain to my parents to not -- they
have -- I think they have a Google alert on

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:38.370
my name. That's not a good thing for parents.
[ Laughter ]

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:40.150
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Wait until your child does
it.

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:42.190
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Oh, I --
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: What's mommy up to.

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:49.460
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Yeah, it's -- me and Jon Gosselin,
that's what we're worried about.

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:57.450
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: A question from a fan in Mexico.
What high-tech gadgets do you use?

00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:04.350
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Not so many. I mean, I use an
iPhone and an iPad.

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:07.272
Is that bad? That's what I use.
Do you guys make --

00:30:07.272 --> 00:30:09.210
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Come on, guys. We have lots
of Google services on these products.

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:15.000
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Yeah. I have -- yeah, I have Google
products on there.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000
And computers.
[ Laughter ]

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.260
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I use computers.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Okay.

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:25.419
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: To write scripts.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Okay.

00:30:25.419 --> 00:30:30.740
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: And that's about it.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: We're going to outfit you

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:33.940
a little bit better now that you've visited
Google.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:38.740
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: All this kind of stuff --
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Another question from a Googler.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:39.740
If you're going to be a nerd, you might as
well have all the right gear.

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:40.740
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Yes, that's true.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Any advice for new or wannabe

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:48.059
comedy writers.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I say go to Chicago, New York,

00:30:48.059 --> 00:30:53.080
or Los Angeles if you can. You can find a
lot of improv comedy in other cities. But

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:58.360
try to get to an Upright Citizens' Brigade
Theater to take class, if you can, in New

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:04.150
York or Los Angeles, or at ImprovOlympic Theater
in Chicago, Second City, and just to do it

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:08.660
as much as you can. Do it, you know, five,
six nights a week if you --

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:12.740
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Do you believe a lot of this
can be taught? Improv can be taught? The writing

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:16.750
can be taught? Comedy is both an art as well
as a science?

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:20.770
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Yeah. The basic rules can be taught.
But I have taught improv at Second City. I

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:27.419
used to be a teacher there. And you can teach
the rules to a certain point. But then about

00:31:27.419 --> 00:31:31.860
six months in, it's -- there's a -- there's
people who can truly -- who truly fit that

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:37.370
kind of work and people who don't.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: That's true of a lot of things,

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:38.370
I think.
Why don't we get some folks here asking questions.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:48.120
Go ahead, yes, ma'am.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi, Tina. Actually, my question follows

00:31:48.120 --> 00:32:05.070
nicely to the last one we just had.
I was wondering if -- I kind of assume that

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:14.990
from that first day that you took a class
at Second City to maybe, like, that first

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:28.179
day when you started at SNL, I imagine that
was a bit of a long road full of fun, but

00:32:28.179 --> 00:32:35.960
also full of a lot of challenges.
I was wondering if you could talk a little

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:43.520
bit about that experience and maybe share
any advice for somebody who wants to go down

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:49.470
a similar road.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I started class, I moved to Chicago

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:58.250
in 1992 on -- on Halloween of 1992, and started
class January. And it was a very fun road.

00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:10.390
It was cult-like, the improv world, it's all-encompassing.
Like I said, all you did was take class, try

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:18.490
to get on stage, watch other people on stage.
I mean, I think immersing yourself in it like

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:28.010
that is good.
And I do look back on things that -- I took

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:39.410
it all so seriously, even though it was nonsense
kind of business. I took it all very seriously.

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:49.919
I remember my boyfriend at the time, who is
now my husband, he was the piano player at

00:33:49.919 --> 00:34:12.359
the theater. And I was saying, I think we
should keep it a secret that we're dating

00:34:12.359 --> 00:34:29.450
because I think it will affect the team, and
people will feel -- and it was like, at improv

00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:38.119
-- we're now married for ten years. I think
we should tell them now about what was going

00:34:38.119 --> 00:34:39.389
on.
[ Laughter ]

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:52.649
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: But just find people who are as
into it as you are and just do it as much

00:34:52.649 --> 00:34:58.739
as possible.
Things that were -- did seem like a big deal

00:34:58.739 --> 00:35:09.650
at the time, now I can barely remember sort
of the politics within the touring company

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:19.010
of whose piece is going to get in. All that
stuff that seems super serious, it is serious

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:31.869
in the moment, but it will also get easier
as you go.

00:35:31.869 --> 00:35:47.539
But, yeah, anything with comedy, I think you
just have to get in front of an audience as

00:35:47.539 --> 00:35:56.309
often as you can. Because that's the only
way to know if you're doing it right.

00:35:56.309 --> 00:36:07.410
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: We would prefer you to stay
as a Google employee.

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:14.200
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; We have an office in Chicago, so....

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:21.369
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Right on.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Very good.

00:36:21.369 --> 00:36:30.339
Yes, ma'am.
&gt;&gt;&gt; So my friend Robin, she's like moved out

00:36:30.339 --> 00:36:31.979
to L.A. and she's an aspiring TV/movie writer.
It's not me.

00:36:31.979 --> 00:36:40.599
But, basically, I was just curious what differences
there are in the process for writing for TV,

00:36:40.599 --> 00:36:51.000
like, say, 30 Rock, versus writing for movies,
like, say, Mean Girls.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:00.349
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Well, let's see. I've only written
the one movie of my own. So I have sort of

00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:06.559
limited experience.
But with TV, the difference is I think you

00:37:06.559 --> 00:37:21.759
can come into it and try to get a job as a
staff writer and learn that way. With movies,

00:37:21.759 --> 00:37:31.259
you're going to maybe be writing scripts on
spec. You're going to be -- you'll be alone

00:37:31.259 --> 00:37:36.740
a lot more. I think TV is a great training
ground, if you can even -- even break in as

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:43.170
a writer's assistant is a great job to have
as the person in the room who's taking all

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:48.200
the notes, constantly, all day, you really
can learn a lot doing that. We have some -- We

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:52.130
have had two writer's assistants who now are
staff writers, one at 30 Rock, Tracey Wigfield,

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:58.490
and another guy, who's Andrew Guest, who writes
for the show Community. And so that is a really

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:05.739
great way to learn TV writing.
And movies, it's -- I think it's so tricky

00:38:05.739 --> 00:38:14.390
to break in, because I don't even know -- screen
writing, I don't know how -- I was only able

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:17.230
to get into it because of Lorne Michaels and
having come from Saturday Night Live. I got

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:22.630
into it through television.
I guess you could write and try to make your

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:29.249
own short films and build up that way would
be the -- but you're going to have to give

00:38:29.249 --> 00:38:33.079
your friends money and stuff.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Go ahead.

00:38:33.079 --> 00:38:35.969
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi, Tina Fey.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Hi.

00:38:35.969 --> 00:38:41.769
&gt;&gt;&gt; First off, thank you for being the Gilda
Radner of our generation.

00:38:41.769 --> 00:38:48.039
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Oh, gosh. Thank you.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Very well said. I agree.

00:38:48.039 --> 00:38:59.880
&gt;&gt;&gt; So I have a couple of quick questions
for you. One is, what's your best joke? Because

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:05.589
I want to steal it.
Number two, what nickname does Tracy Morgan

00:39:05.589 --> 00:39:09.890
use for you?
And number three, a fortune teller told me

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:20.549
that Jon Stewart was going to retire from
The Daily Show in 2020 and that you were going

00:39:20.549 --> 00:39:27.319
to take over. So what are your thoughts on
that?

00:39:27.319 --> 00:39:34.200
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: A fortune teller told you that?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:40.099
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: In 2020 -- let's see. It's -- I

00:39:40.099 --> 00:39:43.150
think --
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Nine years.

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:47.499
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Nine years. Thank you.
[ Laughter ]

00:39:47.499 --> 00:39:56.780
I think I'll be in -- in nine years, I think
it will actually be illegal for a woman my

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:59.020
age to be on television, so --
[ Laughter ]

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.490
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: What was the second question?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Tracy Morgan.

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:07.210
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: He calls me T Fey. Mostly T Fey.
Yeah. He doesn't have as many nicknames for

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:13.199
me -- this is one, he goes, "T Fey, you know
you're the Isus in the hood."

00:40:13.199 --> 00:40:18.150
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I don't know what that means.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:25.869
I go, "I know. I know. Thank you."
And you asked me what was my best joke in

00:40:25.869 --> 00:40:31.910
terms of something that was actually on TV
or something? Or something I --

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:39.359
&gt;&gt;&gt; Something I could use to make people laugh.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: My -- honestly, my favorite joke,

00:40:39.359 --> 00:40:48.969
just handy, everyday joke, just put a little
chocolate on your teeth and act like you don't

00:40:48.969 --> 00:40:51.910
know it's there.
[ Laughter ]

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:57.059
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Go ahead.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi, there, Tina.

00:40:57.059 --> 00:41:02.460
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Hi.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I know this season in 30 Rock was the

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:12.239
first time where you've actually been able
to do a live show. From my understanding,

00:41:12.239 --> 00:41:18.709
that was a huge accomplishment and a real
challenge for the show to be able to do.

00:41:18.709 --> 00:41:26.479
My question is what other barriers are you
hoping to break with 30 Rock or what are some

00:41:26.479 --> 00:41:31.100
of your upcoming dreams that you are hoping
to achieve with the show?

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:41.940
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: That's a good question. We did
the live show this year, it was very exciting

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:47.539
and challenging. We did it --
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Did you two; right?

00:41:47.539 --> 00:42:00.819
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: We did two. We did one for the
East Coast and one for the West Coast.

00:42:00.819 --> 00:42:11.230
And it was really, really fun to do, because
it was -- we did it in Studio 8H where Saturday

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:23.519
Night Live is done. So it was a blending of
the 30 Rock crew with the SNL crew, and it

00:42:23.519 --> 00:42:30.769
was -- and it was really challenging technically
because with SNL, you have 90 minutes and

00:42:30.769 --> 00:42:36.380
all these kind of built-in structures to the
show to -- for the show to come in at the

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:41.509
right time. They have, you know, when you
see the band playing, the band bumpers, different

00:42:41.509 --> 00:42:52.450
things, commercial parodies, things they can
use to control the timing of the show. And

00:42:52.450 --> 00:43:08.430
we had about 22 minutes, because they gave
us a little bit of extra time.

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:14.299
That was the biggest challenge, was, like,
would we get through the show before the -- before

00:43:14.299 --> 00:43:19.579
The Office just started in the middle of the
show.

00:43:19.579 --> 00:43:26.299
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: That was kind of thrilling.

00:43:26.299 --> 00:43:41.200
And we did -- another thing we did this year
that was a format change was one episode called

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:51.440
the queen of Jordan, which was set in a reality
show. That was Tracey Wigfield, who used to

00:43:51.440 --> 00:44:06.410
be a writer's assistant, wrote that.
I'm trying to think what else. People sometimes

00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:17.930
ask if we ever would do a musical episode,
which I think we're -- certainly would be

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:28.009
fun to do. But other people have done that.
I don't know. Yeah, Claymation.

00:44:28.009 --> 00:44:36.369
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I don't know. Community did Claymation.

00:44:36.369 --> 00:44:48.130
I would like to do what I keep referring to
as a Bugsy Malone episode, which is -- was

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:56.059
a movie before everyone here was born, where
it was a gangster movie. Do you remember this

00:44:56.059 --> 00:45:05.479
movie? With a young Jodie Foster in it. And
it was all children.

00:45:05.479 --> 00:45:13.329
I would like to maybe do an episode where
all our characters are played by children.

00:45:13.329 --> 00:45:15.549
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Okay.
[ Laughter ]

00:45:15.549 --> 00:45:32.000
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Or my suggestion is, have
a real Christmas party and invite all of us

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:40.380
to join your real Christmas party by television.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: That's a great idea.

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:52.279
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Okay. Go ahead.
&gt;&gt;&gt; First of all, thanks for coming. And 30

00:45:52.279 --> 00:46:04.839
Rock is one of my favorite shows on television.
I think there was an episode where I laughed

00:46:04.839 --> 00:46:16.969
for 30 minutes after it was over. I couldn't
stop to breathe. I think that was when Tracy

00:46:16.969 --> 00:46:29.170
was going on about the dogs running the Wendy's.
But my actual question was, you also had an

00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:39.459
episode where you provided some much-needed
closure to night court. And as someone who

00:46:39.459 --> 00:46:50.229
is an '80s TV nerd, I was wondering if there
were any other sitcoms from the '80s that

00:46:50.229 --> 00:47:09.869
you were going to do that with. I know it's
difficult to plot in. Obviously, that might

00:47:09.869 --> 00:47:19.769
have been a one-shot thing.
But if you couldn't answer that, then sort

00:47:19.769 --> 00:47:31.809
of like, growing up, did you watch a lot of
television? And it seems like -- reading the

00:47:31.809 --> 00:47:50.670
writing on 30 Rock, it seems like you were
also a TV fan. Maybe that's not true. I was

00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:56.829
wondering if you could comment on how that
influenced --

00:47:56.829 --> 00:48:05.029
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: No, I was a big TV fan growing
up. Night Court, Cheers, Mary Tyler Moore

00:48:05.029 --> 00:48:13.099
and Carol Burnett, all those things.
Our staff is a generation of people who really

00:48:13.099 --> 00:48:22.300
grew up on half-hour comedy, good and bad.
There's the -- 'cause there's the sort of

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:36.199
Who's the Boss, Saved by the Bell era that
I -- and Full House. I've seen a lot of Full

00:48:36.199 --> 00:48:40.759
House, and never on purpose.
[ Laughter ]

00:48:40.759 --> 00:48:48.249
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I had a summer job once at a summer

00:48:48.249 --> 00:49:03.930
theater where we would work in the costume
shop all day, and then my roommate and I had,

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:15.950
like, 45 minutes to go home before going back
to be dressers in the show. And we would go

00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:29.930
home every day and the only thing on was Full
House. And we watched it every day.

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:40.109
But, yeah, is there any TV -- other show that
you would like us to try to have on?

00:49:40.109 --> 00:49:46.059
&gt;&gt;&gt; That's tough. I mean --
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: We had -- teen witch was also

00:49:46.059 --> 00:49:51.499
a thing.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I always felt that the indigo new heart

00:49:51.499 --> 00:49:59.420
people felt it was more funny --
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Let's go to our next question.

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:03.649
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: You can get back to me.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Thank you.

00:50:03.649 --> 00:50:05.369
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Hi.

00:50:05.369 --> 00:50:10.589
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Hi, Tina. My name is Kevin.
And my question is, I recent watched Ponyo,

00:50:10.589 --> 00:50:20.989
and I noticed you were one of the voice actors
in that movie. How did you get into voice

00:50:20.989 --> 00:50:26.959
acting?
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I was asked to revoice Ponyo,

00:50:26.959 --> 00:50:36.200
because it was in Japanese at first. I was
really excited to do it because I think that

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:46.369
kind of stuff is fun and cool to do. And I
since have done just one other one that was

00:50:46.369 --> 00:51:01.299
from scratch. It's very different. This Megamind
movie you do from scratch and you're kind

00:51:01.299 --> 00:51:08.690
of improvising. But the funny and sort of
challenging thing with Ponyo was that the

00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:13.940
animation is done, and you have to -- and
they've --

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:31.400
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: You have to sync to it.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: -- you have to sync to the lip

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:37.660
flap as they call it.
And also there were a lot of fun sort of nonverbal

00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:44.579
things in Japanese where -- in English, some
of us -- we might go, like, huh? Or hmm, or

00:51:44.579 --> 00:51:51.140
weird nonverbals. In Japanese, we're, like,
yaaa. We have to figure out what kind of an

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:52.589
English language nonverbal.
[ Laughter ]

00:51:52.589 --> 00:51:57.300
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Okay. Our next question.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey, Tina. We're all so excited you're

00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:01.290
here.
But my question is in your book you go through

00:52:01.290 --> 00:52:06.730
a lot of different writers from 30 Rock and
your favorite zingers. What's your favorite

00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:08.769
one? And was it or not the Sbarro line? Because
that's my favorite.

00:52:08.769 --> 00:52:10.670
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Which was the Sbarro line?
&gt;&gt;&gt; When Alec Baldwin is talking about all

00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:11.670
the New York royalty, the Rockefellers, the
Carnegies.

00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:12.670
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: All the important New York families
will be there, the Rockefellers, the Sbarros.

00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:16.910
Right. That's not mine.
I actually meant to -- I forgot to give myself

00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:27.359
one in the book. And I had checked on the
one that I was going to give myself and confirmed

00:52:27.359 --> 00:52:29.549
with -- because sometimes you want to -- you
want to make sure that it was a joke that

00:52:29.549 --> 00:52:36.940
you wrote.
And the one I was going to give myself but

00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:45.269
I forgot was in season one, when I asked Alec,
why are you wearing a tuxedo? And he says,

00:52:45.269 --> 00:52:49.910
it's after 6:00, what am I, a farmer?
[ Laughter ]

00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:51.819
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: That's my favorite one.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: I just love the caricature

00:52:51.819 --> 00:52:52.819
of senior executives.
[ Laughter ]

00:52:52.819 --> 00:52:53.819
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Yes.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm actually really curious about

00:52:53.819 --> 00:52:55.670
your life as a parent, especially because
you're the mother of a daughter. And I'm wondering,

00:52:55.670 --> 00:53:01.819
with all the messages of princesses and damsels
in distress and whatnot, you would think about

00:53:01.819 --> 00:53:03.630
having Tina Fey as her mom might make being
intelligent and funny cool. But what I know

00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:12.270
about kids, that isn't always the case. You
can still be pressured and just soak it all

00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:14.150
up.
So being five and a half, looking at your

00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:15.849
daughter and how that's going, what are your
thoughts on parenting daughters?

00:53:15.849 --> 00:53:18.380
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: So far, my take on the princess
thing was -- and I wonder if I would be the

00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:20.880
same way if I had a son and he just really
wanted guns. Because the princess is, I'm

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:22.559
not going to fight it. We can have these princess
toys and then it will kind of -- but if I

00:53:22.559 --> 00:53:25.049
had a son and I gave him as many guns as my
daughter has princess dolls, I would be arrested.

00:53:25.049 --> 00:53:26.049
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Not in Utah.

00:53:26.049 --> 00:53:27.049
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Not in Utah.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Not in Arizona.

00:53:27.049 --> 00:53:29.029
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: But I do try to kind of question,
as we -- we play with all the princess -- and

00:53:29.029 --> 00:53:30.680
then we got in, when she was smaller, the
rhythm of she would always want to play Barbies.

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:32.269
And the game she coined was two girls fighting
over the prince, and they both want to marry

00:53:32.269 --> 00:53:35.049
the prince. And it was this game where these
two Barbies sabotage each other. And this

00:53:35.049 --> 00:53:43.589
is natural. And I would try to question it
as we play. I would say, why do they want

00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:47.670
to marry the prince? They don't have to marry
the prince. And she's like, you're wrecking

00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:51.069
it.
So I'm just hoping if I don't force it to

00:53:51.069 --> 00:53:57.020
stop, it will go away on its own.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Yes.

00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:02.900
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey, Tina, thanks for coming today. Everything
has been thought-provoking for me. I went

00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:10.839
to Harvard but grew up in Chicago.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Perfect.

00:54:10.839 --> 00:54:12.230
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: You're trying to fulfill both
quotas.

00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:13.230
&gt;&gt;&gt; I. wearing flannel but loafers. Something
to think about.

00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:15.369
The question for you is what's inspiring you
now? What are you reading?

00:54:15.369 --> 00:54:18.309
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: What am I reading now? I just
finished -- I don't get to read for pleasure

00:54:18.309 --> 00:54:22.039
very often. So I finished Steve Martin's novel
about the art world, which I enjoyed very

00:54:22.039 --> 00:54:27.599
much, An Object of Beauty. And I just bought
at the airport but I haven't started yet,

00:54:27.599 --> 00:54:32.069
Anne Lamott's newest novel. And I'm reading
a lot of baby name books.

00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:34.400
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Google has a suggester.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: They do?

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.489
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Yes.
Just type in "girl baby names."

00:54:36.489 --> 00:54:39.329
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Oh, I've done that. Yeah.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: There's a lot of choices.

00:54:39.329 --> 00:54:40.979
Yes.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi, Tina. I represent the human side of

00:54:40.979 --> 00:54:45.650
the employees that work here. So maybe not
the Harvard side.

00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:52.650
I went to a university called Salisbury, and
people confuse it with chicken-fried steak

00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:54.680
university.
So I have this friend Robin, and.

00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:56.619
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: The same friend?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah. She works in L.A. And she works

00:54:56.619 --> 00:54:57.619
at a tech company. And she -- it's probably
more like self-deprecating in terms of her

00:54:57.619 --> 00:54:58.619
personality. And Robin is concerned with how
that's perceived in the workplace and how

00:54:58.619 --> 00:54:59.619
to balance that and actually getting respect
from her coworkers.

00:54:59.619 --> 00:55:00.619
So I know that's a personality trait you have
as well, but you are so successful. So do

00:55:00.619 --> 00:55:01.619
you have any advice for Robin?
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: For Robin. Robin is a mess, by

00:55:01.619 --> 00:55:02.619
the way, because Robin -- two problems that
Robin has.

00:55:02.619 --> 00:55:03.619
No.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: She's asked for help.

00:55:03.619 --> 00:55:04.619
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: That's good. That's the first
step.

00:55:04.619 --> 00:55:05.619
I think it's one thing to have a self-deprecating
personality. But you don't want to be self-deprecating

00:55:05.619 --> 00:55:06.619
about your work abilities. And in the book,
I talk a little bit about one of the rules

00:55:06.619 --> 00:55:07.619
of improv is to make statements as opposed
to ask questions, which in improv is just,

00:55:07.619 --> 00:55:08.619
you know -- if I say, like, who are you? Why
are you here? What should we do now? Then

00:55:08.619 --> 00:55:09.619
I'm putting all the burden on you, my partner.
And I say -- sometimes that also applies to

00:55:09.619 --> 00:55:10.619
women even just with our voices in the workplace,
to speak confidently and to try to avoid that

00:55:10.619 --> 00:55:11.619
kind of, "I have an idea." I'm just like,
I don't know if it's a good idea. Just to

00:55:11.619 --> 00:55:12.619
make statements.
But I think it's -- yeah, to -- to try -- to

00:55:12.619 --> 00:55:13.619
prevent yourself from prefacing your work
with any kind of apology. You know, I have

00:55:13.619 --> 00:55:14.619
friends -- I have a friend who's writing a
pilot right now and I have another friend

00:55:14.619 --> 00:55:15.619
who was going to be working with her. And
I said, here is her deal. She's going to -- this

00:55:15.619 --> 00:55:16.619
is her routine, she'll say for 30 seconds,
I don't know, I don't think -- I think this

00:55:16.619 --> 00:55:17.619
real stinks. And you have to just let her
say that. And then she does know, and she

00:55:17.619 --> 00:55:18.619
-- it doesn't stink.
So if you can see that, if you have that behavior

00:55:18.619 --> 00:55:19.619
in yourself and you can just kind of skip
that part, you know, if you can just kind

00:55:19.619 --> 00:55:20.619
of fast-forward the pre-apology part.
Sometimes I think -- I do think sometimes

00:55:20.619 --> 00:55:21.619
what would a man do in any given situation.
And they don't apologize so much.

00:55:21.619 --> 00:55:22.619
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: They don't, like, preapologize

00:55:22.619 --> 00:55:23.619
for things.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Yes, ma'am. Why don't we have

00:55:23.619 --> 00:55:24.619
this group be the last questions.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm feeling shorter than usual, which

00:55:24.619 --> 00:55:25.619
is awesome.
So I'm a young mother myself.

00:55:25.619 --> 00:55:26.619
And for me, you know, the work-life balance
struggle hit me a lot harder than I anticipated.

00:55:26.619 --> 00:55:27.619
And I think that's a common experience across
parenthood in general, and would love to hear

00:55:27.619 --> 00:55:28.619
your experience from the comedy world and
the, you know, Hollywood world about how your

00:55:28.619 --> 00:55:29.619
life changed after having kids and how you've
structured your time to find that balance,

00:55:29.619 --> 00:55:31.482
if that's been at all possible.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Well, I think the biggest change

00:55:31.482 --> 00:55:32.482
is that your priority is just shifted and
that you want to go home. And in some ways,

00:55:32.482 --> 00:55:33.490
I think it makes you a better employee.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: You're more efficient.

00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:34.490
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: You're more efficient. I would
have spent a lot of time at SNL, you know,

00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:35.490
before I was married just sort of hanging
out in people's offices. And some of that

00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:36.490
is valuable to the creative process. But you
don't need nearly as much as you think.

00:55:36.490 --> 00:55:37.490
And so that's the thing is, you just -- you
just -- managing your time better. You're

00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:38.490
going home as soon as you can -- as soon as
you can.

00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:39.760
And I think -- someone asked me about this
recently. I don't know if you find this to

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:41.319
be true, but sometimes there's a -- we have
a reluctance to really admit the specific

00:55:41.319 --> 00:55:43.269
details, like, you're not even -- it's hard,
but when people say, yeah, but what time are

00:55:43.269 --> 00:55:45.329
you really -- like, what time do you leave
and what time do you get back? And you're

00:55:45.329 --> 00:55:46.329
like, don't worry about it. It's none of your
-- it's because you feel like people are going

00:55:46.329 --> 00:55:47.329
to judge you. And I don't -- I think it's
probably better, you know, for us to be honest

00:55:47.329 --> 00:55:49.869
with each other. But it is tricky sometimes
to say, like, yeah, these were very long hours.

00:55:49.869 --> 00:55:53.619
And I just -- you don't do much else; right?
You just kind of do your work and go home

00:55:53.619 --> 00:55:54.619
to see your kid. That's kind of -- and then
you realize, like, well, I haven't seen a

00:55:54.619 --> 00:55:55.619
movie in, like, four years. But --
&gt;&gt;&gt; Except your own; right?

00:55:55.619 --> 00:55:59.839
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Except my -- I've been made to
go to a premier of one that I worked on.

00:55:59.839 --> 00:56:00.839
But it's -- and also another thing that I
find that people don't tell you is that the

00:56:00.839 --> 00:56:01.839
amount of kind of energy that goes into the
relationship you have with your child's caregiver,

00:56:01.839 --> 00:56:02.839
whoever that is, that was one, I was like,
oh, this is a person -- this is a relationship

00:56:02.839 --> 00:56:03.839
--
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: It's a proxy. You better get

00:56:03.839 --> 00:56:04.839
it right.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: -- that needs -- this relationship

00:56:04.839 --> 00:56:09.544
takes a lot of kind of time and energy. And
that was one thing that now I feel like I've

00:56:09.544 --> 00:56:10.544
gotten better at it. When you're first doing
it, you feel kind of trapped by that. So that

00:56:10.544 --> 00:56:11.544
-- I don't know how old your child is. But
that does get a little better.

00:56:11.544 --> 00:56:12.544
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Go ahead.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi. Hi, Tina. Thank you so much for coming.

00:56:12.544 --> 00:56:13.544
It's hard not to talk to screen Tina, since
you're so big.

00:56:13.544 --> 00:56:14.544
All right. So as a person who is such a big
fan of TV all your life, you've probably seen

00:56:14.544 --> 00:56:15.544
shows that have wonderful actors and great
concept but horrible writing, like glee.

00:56:15.544 --> 00:56:16.544
And --
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: You said that, not me.

00:56:16.544 --> 00:56:17.544
&gt;&gt;&gt; I said that. Yeah, I know.
And so as a writer, I was wondering if there's

00:56:17.544 --> 00:56:18.544
a TV show in either recent history or that's
going on right now that you feel like maybe

00:56:18.544 --> 00:56:19.544
if I took this on, this would be better.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Oh, that I could fix it?

00:56:19.544 --> 00:56:20.544
&gt;&gt;&gt; If you -- you could.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I -- no. I think --

00:56:20.544 --> 00:56:21.544
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: No. I thought you were going to

00:56:21.544 --> 00:56:22.544
ask me what TV shows I thought were well written.
I was getting ready to answer that.

00:56:22.544 --> 00:56:23.544
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Well, you could answer that
question instead.

00:56:23.544 --> 00:56:24.544
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I was going to say the Larry Sanders
Show and I think Mad Men is really well written.

00:56:24.544 --> 00:56:25.544
Here, I don't get to watch -- I hear breaking
bad is --

00:56:25.544 --> 00:56:26.544
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Breaking bad is phenomenal.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I haven't actually seen it.

00:56:26.544 --> 00:56:27.544
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Yes, ma'am.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I just wanted to see if you have any similarities

00:56:27.544 --> 00:56:28.544
to Liz Lemon, because I love her.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I do --

00:56:28.544 --> 00:56:29.544
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Well, what do you think?
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: I do have a lot of similarities.

00:56:29.544 --> 00:56:30.544
I feel like Liz Lemon is -- if I sort of -- it's
sliding doors kind of version of me. If I

00:56:30.544 --> 00:56:31.544
had stayed kind of in the way I was when I
first was head writer at SNL and was throwing

00:56:31.544 --> 00:56:32.544
myself entirely into that job.
But I have a different home life than she

00:56:32.544 --> 00:56:33.544
does, which is very different. The sad thing
is, people always say, she dresses -- why

00:56:33.544 --> 00:56:34.544
is she so slovenly and you let her be so ugly.
And I was like, she dresses so much better

00:56:34.544 --> 00:56:35.544
than I would if I were going to 30 Rock to
actually write for a day. Liz -- the way Liz

00:56:35.544 --> 00:56:36.544
Lemon is dressed is how I would be if I was,
like, trying to pull it together to go to

00:56:36.544 --> 00:56:37.544
a friend's house for dinner.
[ Laughter ]

00:56:37.544 --> 00:56:38.544
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: So we're pretty similar.
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Okay.

00:56:38.544 --> 00:56:39.544
Yes, sir.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:56:39.544 --> 00:56:40.544
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Hi.
&gt;&gt;&gt; You mentioned Tim Conway, who I'm old

00:56:40.544 --> 00:56:41.544
enough to remember seeing on the Carol Burnett
show when I was a kid.

00:56:41.544 --> 00:56:42.544
And it made me think that one of the funniest
bits that I remember seeing in comedy in general

00:56:42.544 --> 00:56:43.544
was when he interacted with Harvey Korman
and they would crack in the middle and they

00:56:43.544 --> 00:56:44.544
would start laughing. And it was an in the
moment type of comedy that is obviously lacking

00:56:44.544 --> 00:56:45.544
from TV.
I suppose you experience that in improv and

00:56:45.544 --> 00:56:46.544
SNL as sketch comedy. How is it making the
transition to television where you edit those

00:56:46.544 --> 00:56:47.544
scenes out?
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Yeah. Well, those were -- I mean,

00:56:47.544 --> 00:56:48.544
those things -- the Carol Burnett show was
in front of a live studio audience. So there

00:56:48.544 --> 00:56:49.544
is a kind of immediacy. And it does happen.
Every now and then, it will happen on Saturday

00:56:49.544 --> 00:56:50.544
Night Live. And it is -- there's nothing more
satisfying. There was a sketch when I was

00:56:50.544 --> 00:56:51.544
there called Debbie Downer.
[ Applause ]

00:56:51.544 --> 00:56:52.544
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Which I didn't write. I love it.
I didn't write it or anything. But it was

00:56:52.544 --> 00:56:53.544
really funny; right?
And they all genuinely, truly broke and laughed

00:56:53.544 --> 00:56:54.544
in it. And it's one of the most joyful things
you could ever watch.

00:56:54.544 --> 00:56:55.544
The thing for comedy people is, you just -- if
it happens once in a while and it's real,

00:56:55.544 --> 00:56:56.544
it's okay. But you never want to be that person
who's kind of, like, faking it a little bit.

00:56:56.544 --> 00:56:57.544
And so you don't see it on shows like 30 Rock
because there's no audience there, so I think

00:56:57.544 --> 00:56:58.544
it would seem pretty self-indulgent if we
left it in, just, like, us --

00:56:58.544 --> 00:56:59.544
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Thank you. What I like about
Tina is you see in the arc of her life so

00:56:59.544 --> 00:57:00.544
far someone -- someone who really has started
off with an exceptional talent, which she

00:57:00.544 --> 00:57:01.544
won't admit, but used it and used it and was
disciplined in the way she approached everything.

00:57:01.544 --> 00:57:02.544
In her book, she talks about the confusion
of where to go and what to do. But ultimately,

00:57:02.544 --> 00:57:03.544
she found a path that has resulted now in
the second week of number-one book in the

00:57:03.544 --> 00:57:04.544
United States, which is pretty amazing for,
I think, a first book.

00:57:04.544 --> 00:57:05.544
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: And if you think about writer,

00:57:05.544 --> 00:57:06.544
comedy writer, creator, producer, actress,
now movie star, mother, and she's managed

00:57:06.544 --> 00:57:07.544
to merge it all together and produce just
an extraordinary outcome, I can only imagine

00:57:07.544 --> 00:57:08.544
what your next decade will be. And I'm looking
forward to watching it.

00:57:08.544 --> 00:57:09.544
So thank you. And thank you so much for coming.
&gt;&gt;Tina Fey: Thank you for having me.

00:57:09.544 --> 00:57:10.544
&gt;&gt;Eric Schmidt: Thank you.
[ Applause ]

00:57:10.544 --> 00:57:10.546
(Standing ovation)
