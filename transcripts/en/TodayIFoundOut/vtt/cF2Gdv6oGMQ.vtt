00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:14.370
The Pass That Allows People to Fly for Free
Forever

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.490
Back in 1981, in an effort to raise some quick
funds, American Airlines introduced a $250,000

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.660
pass (about $641,000 today) that would allow
customers to fly on its airlines for free

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.230
for the rest of their lives.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:36.650
In 1990, they bumped the price to $600,000
(about $1.07 million today), and then in 1993

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.290
to $1.01 million (about 1.7 million today).

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.770
Despite the sticker price, the airline has
since admitted this is one of the costliest

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.309
mistakes it has ever made.

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.730
Introduced in the summer of 1981, the unlimited
“AAirpass” was originally envisioned as,

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.239
to quote the airline’s former chief executive
Robert Crandalll, something that “firms

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.070
would buy for top employees” and it was
thought that the scheme would bring in many

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.430
millions of dollars in revenue in a very short
timespan- essentially, easy money now to grow

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.570
the company with, with future costs of having
people use these passes being negligible to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.570
absorb.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.300
However, the AAirpass’ high cost resulted
in a less than enthusiastic response from

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.570
customers and in the end, only 66 passes were
actually sold.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.470
This is a shame for consumers, because those
66 customers got an amazing deal.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.030
As Crandall later noted, “It soon became
apparent that the public was smarter than

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.030
we were.”

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.810
According to the rather loose terms of the
original AAirpass contract, customers who

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.790
purchased one were entitled to free first
class travel anywhere in the world and were

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.340
given lifetime membership to American Airline’s
Admirals Club, which grants priority boarding,

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.270
same day booking and access to lounges across
the world that offer free food and drink for

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.270
members.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.170
These benefits alone have seen some likening
the unlimited AAirpass to “owning a fleet

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.730
of private planes”.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.940
As one of the top frequent fliers, Steve Rothstein
said, “A very fun Saturday would be to wake

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.430
up early and fly to Detroit, rent a car and
go to Ontario, have lunch and spend $50 or

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.480
$100 buying Canadian things…” and then
be back by dinner.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.050
In another case, an individual travelled all
the way to London 16 times in a single month,

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.410
sometimes just staying long enough for a bite
to eat before flying back home.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.760
But it didn’t stop there.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.880
Savvy customers found ways to get even more
out of their passes.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.620
You see, under the terms of the agreement,
customers were still allowed to claim air

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.440
miles on all flights they took, allowing those
who used the service frequently (because why

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.980
wouldn’t you?) to rack up literally millions
of air miles in the space of just a handful

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.200
of years, which they could give away to family
and friends or in the cases of some customers,

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.200
sell.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.610
On top of this, because the AAirpass offered
unlimited free travel, the airline were forced

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.420
to absorb any and all fees customers incurred
while using them (including taxes), meaning

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.470
customers could literally book a dozen flights
at a dozen different times for a single day

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.260
and roll up to their airport whenever they
felt like it, knowing that there would be

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.690
no cancellation fees to pay for missing the
other flights or additional duties or taxes

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.690
to pay.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.880
But we’re not done yet.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.040
On top of all this, American Airlines offered
customers a chance to purchase a “companion

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.060
pass” at a discount price (about 40% off),
which granted all the same perks to anyone

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.960
the original holder wanted as long as they
flew together.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.790
Customers who opted for this particular upgrade
utilised it in a number of impressively creative

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.190
ways from booking an empty seat under a false
name to score more elbow room in the already

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.950
spacious first class, to ferrying friends
and often random strangers across the world

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:48.950
for free.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.630
In the case of a guy called Steven Rothstein,
he’d sometimes book two tickets for every

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.450
flight he took just to surprise people at
the airport with a free first class upgrade.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.050
If you’re wondering how customers came up
with all these ideas for bending the rules,

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.050
many of them didn’t.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.320
A lot of the aforementioned tricks like booking
multiple flights on a given day or an empty

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.780
seat were often suggested to customers by
people working for the airline itself as part

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.150
of the complimentary booking service provided
to Admirals Club members.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.700
According to an internal report from American
Airlines in 2007, the top unlimited AAirpass

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.500
holders cost the airline in excess of a million
dollars that year, each.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.290
Although, it would be interesting to actually
see how they tallied this up, because if first

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.620
class wasn’t sold out on a particular flight
an AAirpass owner took, the airline wouldn’t

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.200
actually lose money other than taxes, the
price of in-flight consumables and the like,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.260
as it’s likely many of these customers wouldn’t
have taken the flights in question had they

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.550
not had the unlimited pass.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.110
Regardless, the results of this internal report
were alarming enough that it prompted American

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.410
Airlines to sic its so-called revenue integrity
unit onto owners of the passes in attempts

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.380
to find something they’d done that constituted
a breach of the AAirpass’ terms.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.910
After poring over the contracts and doing
extensive investigations, American Airlines

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:20.380
were able to successfully revoke the passes
of a handful of the customers who’d “abused”

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.620
the system the most.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.710
For instance, American tried to coerce certain
people who’d been given a free ride courtesy

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.560
of some of the more generous AAirpass owners
into admitting that they’d paid for their

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.560
tickets.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.400
In one such case, it was noted in an internal
email from American Airlines that the individual

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.560
in question who’d been given a ticket by
AAirpass owner Jacques Vroom, “appears to

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.900
be naive, without financial wherewithal, and
most probably very anxious to return ‘home'”.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.210
So upon the young man checking in, he was
taken to a private office and a former police

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.340
officer working security for American Airlines
questioned him, then offered him a free ticket

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.930
home if he’d just admit he gave Vroom money
for a ticket.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:06.580
In another case concerning Vroom, the individual,
one Sam Mulroy, was told his flight was canceled,

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.240
but that he’d be given a new ticket, free
of charge, if he’d just say he paid Vroom

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.639
for the original ticket.

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.389
Mulroy denied paying anything.

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:19.080
When the offer of a free ticket didn’t work,
American Airlines froze Mulroy’s Frequent

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.090
Flier account.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.020
When Mulroy complained to American Airlines
and the U.S. Department of Transportation

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.950
that he felt he was being extorted by the
airline, his account was unfrozen.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.740
In the end, Vroom did indeed lose his pass
when it was discovered in a subsequent lawsuit

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.030
that he really had accepted payment for at
least a few flights.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.560
Vroom, however, claimed the payments were
for “business advice” (Vroom is a very

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.980
successful marketing consultant), not for
the tickets.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.930
However, Vroom’s lawyers noted that it shouldn’t
matter whether he accepted payments or not,

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:54.420
as American Airlines didn’t explicitly ban
the practice of selling tickets in their “unlimited”

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.210
pass contracts until three years after Vroom
purchased his.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:03.200
Other customers who lost their passes included
a retired bond broker called Willard May who’d

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.760
been very openly using his pass to ferry people
across America for a fee for about two decades

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:14.300
and the aforementioned Steven Rothstein for
things like booking empty seats for his suitcase

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.560
under the name “Bag Rothstein”.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.330
While May decided against pursuing the matter
in court, Rothstein did.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:25.080
He ultimately lost when a judge ruled he had
indeed violated the terms of his contract.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.450
(Amusingly given how it all turned out, Rothstein
once met the aforementioned American Airlines

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:35.400
chief executive Robert Crandall during a flight,
prompting the then CEO to send Rothstein a

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.880
letter saying, “I am delighted that you’ve
enjoyed your AAirpass investment.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.710
You can count on us to keep the company solid,
and to honor the deal, far into the future.”)

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.641
At least two others were also found to have
been in breach of their contracts, according

00:07:49.641 --> 00:07:53.860
to American Airlines, but their tickets were
not revoked for undisclosed reasons.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:59.370
For the curious, you can still purchase an
AAirpass today, though not too shockingly,

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:02.480
American Airlines no longer offers an unlimited
version.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.300
The last time they did so was in 2004, three
years before they’d realised exactly how

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.710
much these passes were costing them every
year.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:15.300
At that time, they offered the pass through
Neiman-Marcus for $3 million (about $3.7 million

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.220
today) per pass.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.870
Despite that this would have still been a
pretty good deal for a certain type of wealthy

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:32.169
flyer or certain businesses to have such tickets
at their disposal any time, nobody bought

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:51.140
any at that 
price point.
