00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:11.360
PS4 is way better than Xbox one.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.429
I just made half of you very angry.

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.420
Here’s why.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:25.119
Hi there, welcome to DNews, I’m Ross Everett
and I’m about to blow the lid off of super-fandom.

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.740
Think of a product you love, whether it’s
an Xbox, an iPhone, a certain brand of cracker,

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.929
as boring as that may be, anything really.

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.330
You have a positive reaction to it, it’s
good to you, and even when it’s not, you’ll

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.989
overlook it because it’s your product of
choice.

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.931
Now think about their competitors: Play Stations,
Samsungs, One Direction, arrrgghhh they make

00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:47.620
me so mad with their worse controllers and
their large screens and big eyes.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.480
But it turns out that fanboying or fangirling
over a product can be explained with some

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.040
very relatable social science.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.930
And, I’ll even tell you how to break free
of it, if you want to.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:56.930
Check it out.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.420
Social identity theory is basically the idea
that as human beings we like to belong to

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.420
a group.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.890
It gives us a sense of belonging, community,
camaraderie…

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.130
But it puts us into a group of US and THEM.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.820
And Us are always better than Them because
let’s face it, it’s us we’re talking

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.820
about.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.270
One of the ways we define ourselves is by
the stuff we own, like iPhone users or Xbox

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.180
One owners, so much so that it actually changes
us at a neural level.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.460
In fact, we actually get a positive response
in our prefrontal cortex when we look at things

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.600
we own compared to things we don’t.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.970
So when I hold up this iPhone[a] [*don’t
show apple logo*], some of you are having

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.530
a positive reaction and some of you are ready
to leave a nasty comment on this video.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.030
So why does this happen?

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.440
Why does there need to be a negative response
to them?

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.350
Well, people categorize themselves and others
by status, and clearly we want to be the higher

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.350
status.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.600
But there can’t be a high status, without
a low status group to be compared to, which

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.780
is exactly why the people who like Justin
Bieber attack people who like One Direction

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.420
in order to raise their status.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.790
Also, check this out, the more time and money
we invest into a product the more attached

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.900
we are to it and feel the need to defend it.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.270
If it wasn’t the best, would I just be an
idiot pumping my precious time and money into

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.270
the not best?

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.620
I should think not.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.100
Clearly, I am smart and have been using my
time and money well.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.880
That’s your brain defending your decisions
and inadvertently making you a fanboy.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.130
But why do we keep going back, product after
product?

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.530
The new iPhone is announced and people are
already lining up to buy it without even a

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.060
glance at their competitors.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.310
Well, that’s because of a little thing called
Choice Supportive Bias.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.100
Choice supportive bias can actually create
false positive memories around a person or

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.620
product we’ve chosen to combat buyer’s
remorse.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.030
This makes us defend our previous purchases
without any real critical thought.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.780
So, how do we break away from all this?

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.670
I don’t want to be a slave to my human brain,
or more accurately the companies taking advantage

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.750
of my human brain!

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.710
Well, step number one has already been completed.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.160
Learn about fanboyisms so you can identify
them when they’re happening.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.950
Take a step back when you feel yourself getting
riled up and really look at the facts.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.520
Allow yourself to be honest about the product
or person you’re fanboying about.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.510
And most importantly, when talking to someone
about a competing product.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.670
Make sure they ask your opinion before launching
into a tirade about why your phone or band

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.970
or game system is better and how theirs is
actually making them dumber.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.040
And, if you guys want to see a prime example
of this, you can watch this Apple Fanboy tell

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.990
you exactly why the new iPhone and Apple Watch
aren’t going to change a damn thing in this

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.990
video.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.990
It’s me.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.990
I’m the guy.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.569
