00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.700
Determine whether the data in the table is

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.970
an example of direct inverse or joint
variation.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.720
Then identify the equation that represents
the relationship.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.730
So let's just think about what direct
inverse or joint variation even means.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.360
So if you have direct variation.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.870
Direct variation.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.840
So if y varied directly with x it
literally means that y is equal to some

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.290
constant multiple of x, or if you divide
both sides of this by x it means that

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:35.020
y over x is equal to k so the ration
between y and x is a constant.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.660
And you could go the other way around.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.000
You could also say that x is equal to some

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.710
constant not, not going to be the same
constant times y.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.340
Or that x over y is going to be equal to
some other constant.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.350
So these aren't necessarily the same k.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.240
All I'm just saying is that it's a
constant relationship.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.330
These are all examples of direct
variation.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.350
In dir, or I should say inverse variation
is to

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.390
some degree the opposite depending on how
you view the opposite.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.730
And before I even talk about that, let's

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.660
think about the telltale signs of direct
variation.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.140
If x increases, y should increase.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.480
So if x increases.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.710
Let me do that in the same yellow.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.764
So the telltale signs of direct variation,
if

00:01:16.764 --> 00:01:19.988
x increases then y will increase and vice
versa.

00:01:19.988 --> 00:01:21.714
The other telltale sign is.

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:25.600
Is if you increase x by some, by some
factor.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:33.880
So, if you have x going to 3x then y
should also increase by that same factor.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.500
And we could see that with some examples.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.290
So, I mean, you could pick a K, let's say
that, let's say that K was one.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.868
So if y is equal to x, if you take, if x
goes from

00:01:42.868 --> 00:01:45.340
one to three, then y is also going to go
from one to three.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.620
So that's all we're talking about here.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.365
Let me actually, y should actually to

00:01:49.365 --> 00:01:52.000
three times y, that's what I'm talking
about.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.730
If you triple x, you're also gonna end up
tripling y.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.650
Inverse variation.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.790
You have y being equal to some constant
times one over x.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.650
So instead of an x here you have a one
over x or if you

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:13.100
multiply both sides by x you get x times y
is equal to some constant.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.790
And you could switch the x's and the y's
around as well for inverse variation.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.680
Now what are the tale tale signs?

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.580
Well if you increase x, if x goes up, then
what happens to y?

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.770
If x goes up then this becomes a smaller
value

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.460
cuz it's one over x so then y will go
down.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.710
Then y will go down.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.440
And if you take X and if you're to say
increase it

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.210
by a factor of three then what's going to
happen to Y?

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.685
Well if you increase this by a factor of

00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:47.570
three, you're actually going to decrease
this whole value by

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.140
a factor of one-third, so Y is going to

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.820
go, so then you're going to have one-third
of y.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.390
So that's, these are the tell-tale signs
for inverse variation.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.840
Now finally they talk about something
called joint variation, and

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.780
this one you won't necessarily see in
introductory algebra course.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.520
But joint variation deals with more than
one variable.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.680
So if I told you, if I told you that area
of a rectangle is equal to the width of

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.950
a rectangle times the length of rectangle,
this is an example of joint variation.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.750
Area is proportionally to two.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.540
Is the proportional to two different
quantities?

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.020
So the main tell tale sign here for joint
variation

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.786
frankly is you're gonna be dealing with
more than two variables.

00:03:28.786 --> 00:03:34.000
Joint, Joint, Joint variation.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.030
So when you look at this example, there
only gi, giving us two variables.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.570
So you can rule out joint variation just
right from the get go.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.540
Now let's look at the tell tale signs.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.880
So as x is increasing, as x goes from one
to two, what is happening to y?

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.890
Y went from 12 to six.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.020
So as x is going up by a factor of two,

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.460
y is going, is, is going by a factor of
one half.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.040
Or y is being multiplied by one half.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.770
So as x goes from one to three, it's being
multiplied by three.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:08.170
Y is being multiplied or I guess could say
is, is multiplied by one-third.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.080
So it's definitely not direct variation.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.510
As x increases, y is decreasing.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.840
So it's definitely not direct variation.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.440
And then really you can just rule out,
since we rule out the

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.870
other two, you can probably guess this is
going to be inverse variation.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.160
But we can validate it.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.390
When X increases, Y is decreasing.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.250
When X increases by a certain factor, Y is

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.720
increasing by one over that factor, which
is actually decreasing.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.040
So, if you go from one to three, if X is
being

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:40.030
multiplied by three, then Y essentially
becomes one third of its original value.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:48.310
When X is one Y is 12 when X is three Y is
four so we have inverse variation in play.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.200
Now they ask us identify the equation that
represents the relationship.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.000
Well we know with inverse variation the
product of

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.650
x and y need to be equal to some constant.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.280
So that if we take x times y over here so
lets just

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.715
multiply lets make another column here
call this the x times y column.

00:05:06.715 --> 00:05:08.000
One times 12 is 12.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.070
Two times six is 12.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.270
Three times four is 12.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.070
Four times three is 12.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.610
So, clearly in every situation, x times y
is, is a constant and it is 12.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.530
So, the equation that represents the
relationship, it is, X,

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.930
Y is equal to 12 and that is clearly an
inverse
