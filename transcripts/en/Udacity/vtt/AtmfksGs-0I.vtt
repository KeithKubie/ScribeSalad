00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.995
To create this plot, we're going to use our gg plot

00:00:02.995 --> 00:00:07.240
function.We'll pass it www likes received to the x variable, and

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.090
we'll pass likes received to the y variable. Then we'll set

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.260
our data frame equal to our pseudo Facebook users and then

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.460
we'll tell gg plot that we want that we want

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.500
a gm point or scatterplot. Now I actually forgotten something to

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.030
do here, I need to wrap my x and y variables

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.650
inside the aesthetic wrapper. So I'll add that in. Now you

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.970
might not have used the gg plot syntax,

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.070
but I highly encourage you to continue to use

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.590
it and to get practice with it throughout

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.002
this lesson. We'll be making more use of the

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:36.310
gg plot syntax in the next lesson, so

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.090
it's important that you really know it backwards and

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.170
forwards. Try making some other scatter plots with

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.650
different variables to get more familiar with the syntax.
