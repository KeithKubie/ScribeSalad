00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.760
The ultimate goal of this project is to
really go where no one has gone before.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.480
You want to generate
an authentic contribution

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.740
to some field based on
the information that you gather,

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.050
based on the models that you
construct to figure data.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.820
But what that means is that you're not
going to have the same kind of support

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.700
you might be used to
when doing this project.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.140
Eudacity coaches won't be able
to help you because you're doing

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.260
all new things that
they've never seen before.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.470
Your peer reviewer similarly.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.460
They might be able to give you
some idea about the strengths and

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.790
weaknesses of your approach, but they
don't have expert knowledge about how to

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.160
work in the domain
that you're working in.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.350
And that's actually the really exciting
thing about this final project.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.425
You're not just doing a project for

00:00:36.425 --> 00:00:40.925
a degree program that's going
to be a feather in your cap.

00:00:40.925 --> 00:00:42.535
You're really doing something authentic.

00:00:42.535 --> 00:00:44.365
You're generating authentic conclusion,

00:00:44.365 --> 00:00:47.725
an authentic analysis,
about real data out in the world.

00:00:47.725 --> 00:00:50.265
The project that you'll generate here is
something that you should be proud to

00:00:50.265 --> 00:00:52.095
walk into someone's office and
tell them about,

00:00:52.095 --> 00:00:55.095
because it really represents your
mastery of machine learning.
