00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.089
 It's painful 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:04.139
 To know quantity 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.739
 Things that are not useful and which you do, and I'll give you an example 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.740
 Well, I've done it many times before in lectures full of students that usually talked about professional development 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.250
 How long do you waste it, and then ask them to vote: How many of you spend 10 hours a day? 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.129
 Almost 10% of the students have raised their hands, and this is interesting since I have not explained to them what is in particular a waste of time 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.099
 I just asked the question and all of them did the same analysis. I did not say you lost 10 hours of your day 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.369
 I just ask to express your own behavior how many hours are lost 10 hours a day 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.370
 Almost 10% of people raised their hands 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.870
 Well what about 6 hours a day? 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.229
 80% of people have raised their hands and now to settle accounts 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.700
 Well I like to do these calculations with people but they often hate doing accounts, but I like to do them 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.700
 Well 6 hours a day 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.000
 It is 42 hours a week, to transfer 40 working hours. Well these hours work, now to move 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.690
 What is the value of your time? 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.619
 You are now a student at the university or of course worth less payoff 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.779
 But it is worth much more than that if you take advantage of one productive hour at the age of 20 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.020
 You will get the benefits of this clock until the end of your life 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.280
 And this cumulative effect of the hours that we exploit in young people and so I say 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.140
 Suppose the value of your time is $ 50 per hour, although I think more of it but suppose this 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.229
 We can say 25, but we said $ 50. That's $ 2000 a week you're wasting. Which is 100,000 per year 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.539
 This would have been your life if you had not lost 100,000 a year 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.630
 Well, but what after 40 years? 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.619
 4 million, you will be rich. You even do not learn this stop wasting your time 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.790
 Then people shake their heads ah never thought this way never. But yes 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:54.119
 Think about it this way and do not waste your life, then think why people resist this message 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:54.970
 Okay 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.009
 You really want to wake up from your stupidity and discover that you are missing half of your life 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.509
 When people waste their time they really hate doing it 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.729
 I have known many people in my clinical practice of people who constantly procrastinate, and they do 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:15.329
 Follow videos for example, but not the clips that are useful to them. Except sometimes 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.329
 But they just move unconsciously like you do when you try to kill time without concentration or indifference 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.000
 People who do it feel bad. They become depressed and feel anxious. They can not get rid of it 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.559
 They feel almost addicted. What do you say about social networking sites now. What do you do with young people? 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.949
 Sure, but there is the feeling of rot and internal corruption that accompanies it 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.380
 It's like saying you're wasting your life. That is why it is painful 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.929
 It is painful to notice this and then think, my God, how uncontrolled I am 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.839
 I do not know anything. I can not use this to organize my time. I can not stick to a schedule 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.750
 I have no goals. I do not know anything about the world 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.910
 True, maybe there is a part of me 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.959
 I feel bitterness because I have not done anything yet, and I would say that I do not care 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.419
 And this is your understanding of what I was absent from it and this makes you corrupt and and 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.709
 And trustworthy and that view that no one wants to be sure 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.060
 But 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.060
 You are the worst alternatives
