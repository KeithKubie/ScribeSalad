was necessarily the worst thing that

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260
was necessarily the worst thing that
 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.960

even the Soviets who were completely
 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.770
even the Soviets who were completely
insane and of course the Maoists are

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780
insane and of course the Maoists are
 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.590
insane and of course the Maoists are
probably even worse they weren't insane

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600
probably even worse they weren't insane
 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.090

to be bombed in order for the Soviets to
 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.560
to be bombed in order for the Soviets to

much the better as far as Stalin was

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980
much the better as far as Stalin was
 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.920
much the better as far as Stalin was
concerned and so he wasn't exactly the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930
concerned and so he wasn't exactly the
 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.220
concerned and so he wasn't exactly the
sort of person the idea of a nuclear war

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230
sort of person the idea of a nuclear war
 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.899
sort of person the idea of a nuclear war
would necessarily stop and it's

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909
would necessarily stop and it's
 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:32.550
would necessarily stop and it's
certainly possible that that's what he

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560
certainly possible that that's what he
 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.399
certainly possible that that's what he
was hoping for you know because when we

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409
was hoping for you know because when we
 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.259
was hoping for you know because when we
look at people like Stalin and Hitler we

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269
look at people like Stalin and Hitler we
 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.030
look at people like Stalin and Hitler we
think well you know they're after world

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040
think well you know they're after world
 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.949
think well you know they're after world
domination you know and you think well

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959
domination you know and you think well
 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.949
domination you know and you think well
in some sense that's kind of a positive

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959
in some sense that's kind of a positive
 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.110
in some sense that's kind of a positive
motivation right I mean no really but

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120
motivation right I mean no really but
 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.509
motivation right I mean no really but
it's like if you have a Corvette say and

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519
it's like if you have a Corvette say and
 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:49.979
it's like if you have a Corvette say and
someone steals it you could think well I

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989
someone steals it you could think well I
 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.690
someone steals it you could think well I
know why they stole it did they want to

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700
know why they stole it did they want to
 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.369
know why they stole it did they want to
have the Corvette you know what's it's

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379
have the Corvette you know what's it's
 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.309
have the Corvette you know what's it's
an understandable motivation to want

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319
an understandable motivation to want
 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.709
an understandable motivation to want
power it's not necessarily an admirable

00:02:58.709 --> 00:02:58.719
power it's not necessarily an admirable
 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:00.179
power it's not necessarily an admirable
one although sometimes power is a

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:00.189
one although sometimes power is a
 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:01.559

perfectly what a reasonable thing to

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569
perfectly what a reasonable thing to
 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.979
perfectly what a reasonable thing to
pursue but I don't have any idea why we

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989
pursue but I don't have any idea why we
 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.420
pursue but I don't have any idea why we
ever assumed that those guys were after

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430
ever assumed that those guys were after
 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.300
ever assumed that those guys were after
victory like you should never make the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310
victory like you should never make the
 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.610
victory like you should never make the
presupposition that everyone is out to

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620
presupposition that everyone is out to
 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.490
presupposition that everyone is out to
win some people are out to lose and the

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500
win some people are out to lose and the
 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.960
win some people are out to lose and the
more people they can take with them the

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970
more people they can take with them the
 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.149
more people they can take with them the
better you know and when Hitler died he

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:18.159
better you know and when Hitler died he
 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.460
better you know and when Hitler died he
committed suicide in a bunker way down

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470
committed suicide in a bunker way down
 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.469
committed suicide in a bunker way down
below Berlin while Berlin was on fire in
