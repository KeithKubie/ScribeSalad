00:00:00.093 --> 00:00:01.730
- Near the city of Magelang

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.670
on the island of Java in Indonesia

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.340
you will come upon a massive structure

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.420
in the misty rainforests.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.310
It's known as the Gereja Ayam,

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.410
or as most people call
it, the Chicken Church.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.938
It's truly a fowl site.

00:00:19.938 --> 00:00:22.771
(musical chiming)

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.900
Before we start, I just
wanna give a huge shout out

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.280
to writer Theodora Sarah Abigail

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.350
who did some original reporting
and wrote an amazing piece

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.600
on the Chicken Church for Atlas Obscura.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.230
It is linked in the
video description below

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.200
and was hugely influential
in making this video.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.520
So thank you.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.300
Rumors of this building
have been on the internet

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.710
for a long time.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.630
People thought maybe it was some kind of

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.900
crazy Dutch colonialist building,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.650
maybe it was some kind of cult,

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.890
maybe it was haunted.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.810
What it actually is, is
the product of a dream.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.080
Many of our best ideas
come to us in our dreams

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.660
and in the case of Daniel Alamsjah,

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.770
it happened in 1988.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.700
After saying his nightly prayers,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.140
he received a vision of a
dove with snow-white wings

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.710
resting atop a hill.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.890
A voice told him to
build a place of worship

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.473
for all peoples, regardless of faith.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.397
When he woke up he was like,

00:01:26.397 --> 00:01:29.490
"Yeah, I'm not actually gonna do that."

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.250
But the vision kept nagging at him.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.860
He couldn't stop thinking about it

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.270
and a couple of years later
he went to visit a coworker

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.800
who took him to this hilltop.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.760
Daniel watched the sun rise
on Rhema Hill and it happened.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.430
As soon as Daniel saw
it, he knew that this

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.930
was the hill from his dream

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.670
and after a little more praying,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.420
Daniel bought an acre of land on the hill

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.660
for 3.5 million rupiah,
or about 2,000 dollars.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.070
Keep in mind that Daniel was not

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.710
this crazy wandering
mystic or outsider artist.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.560
He worked as a project manager
for a chemical company.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.383
It's not the background you might expect

00:02:10.383 --> 00:02:14.270
for someone who went on
to build a prayer house

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.580
after having a vision.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.750
And it wasn't simple either.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.690
The first four years were just
consumed with the paperwork

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.320
of getting permissions

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.810
to actually build something like this,

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.270
but in 1992 he was able to break ground

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.340
and he got a 30-person crew together

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.180
and he started building his vision.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.550
This huge dove-shaped building,

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.990
which would be open to all kinds of people

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.030
with all sorts of different
religious beliefs.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.720
As you might see by the iconography,

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.530
a dove, a crown, Daniel's a Christian

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.550
in a country that's 80 percent Muslim.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.120
So people were a little bit
suspicious of this project

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.310
and it shows up in the
name, the Chicken Church.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.720
Is this some kind of giant
Christian cult thing?

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.600
Daniel kept trying to tell everyone,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.790
it's not a chicken, it's not a church,

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.080
it's a place for all
of us to come together.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.800
But in truth, the
complaints were the least

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.140
of Daniel's issues.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.040
In 2000, he just ran out of money.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.400
He'd already built this
enormous structure.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.480
The exterior was there,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.130
but he couldn't finish
any of the interior.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.960
He had to leave.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.260
He had to basically
abandon it in the forest

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.730
and over time, it became overgrown

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.440
with vines and trees started
growing inside of it.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.230
People came and did graffiti

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.500
and it really did start
to feel like the remnants

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.500
of some crazy chicken cult
that someone had been running.

00:03:36.297 --> 00:03:39.130
(rooster crowing)

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.480
This is where you come in

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.100
and by you, I mean, the internet.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.548
15 years later, after
Daniel had had to step away

00:03:48.548 --> 00:03:53.340
and the Chicken Church had
been largely falling into ruin,

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.290
it showed up on the internet.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.940
This incredible, strange, abandoned space.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.380
Pictures of it showed
up on Huffington Post.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.350
They showed up on Atlas Obscura.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.100
It started to make the rounds

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.325
and something kind of incredible happened.

00:04:09.325 --> 00:04:12.200
For a long time, you know, a dozen people

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.565
would show up a week.

00:04:13.565 --> 00:04:18.420
Suddenly it went from
a trickle to a flood.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.800
Daniel was making as much
as 2,000 dollars a week

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.050
from the one-dollar tickets
sold to the visitors.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.926
And over the last few years,

00:04:26.926 --> 00:04:29.600
the Chicken Church has undergone

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.320
this incredible resurgence

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.420
and it's still improving.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.410
He has turned these empty concrete rooms

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.280
into beautiful mural-covered spaces.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.440
And today, you can not only
climb through the church

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.020
and stand on the crown,

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.769
but you get a free piece of
fried cassava in the cafe

00:04:48.769 --> 00:04:51.430
located in the butt of the Chicken Church.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.750
What a good deal that is.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.520
The Chicken Church has actually come back.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.480
It's come to be what he envisioned.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.680
It is literally, in large
part thanks to the internet,

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.523
a dream come true.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.750

and tell me about what
incredible dream project

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.730
you would build in the comments.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.820
I have always wanted to
build some kind of elaborate

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.340
art installation behind a waterfall,

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.460
but I'd love to hear what your weird crazy

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.610
dream project would be.
