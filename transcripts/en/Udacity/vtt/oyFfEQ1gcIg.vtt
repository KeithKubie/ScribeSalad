00:00:00.202 --> 00:00:01.901
Here is the surface of the earth.

00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:04.213
Above the surface of the earth is air.

00:00:04.213 --> 00:00:07.311
Now air is just a bunch of molecules of nitrogen

00:00:07.311 --> 00:00:09.467
and oxygen and they are in constant motion

00:00:09.467 --> 00:00:11.318
and always bumping into each other.

00:00:11.318 --> 00:00:14.648
But all these molecules, well they have a weight

00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:17.363
and in fact we can imagine thinking of a

00:00:17.363 --> 00:00:19.011
very specific column of air. Let's think of this

00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:22.295
column of air here where we filled these imaginary walls

00:00:22.295 --> 00:00:25.015
and there is some behind and in front as well.

00:00:25.015 --> 00:00:28.147
So we're really just focusing on one column of air.

00:00:28.147 --> 00:00:31.069
Now I can actually measure the weight of this air.

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:34.509
I won't explain exactly how yet, but I can do it.

00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:36.204
I want to ask you a little question and get you thinking.

00:00:36.204 --> 00:00:39.105
Where would the weight of the air be the greatest?

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:41.763
So if I could put a scale anywhere in here

00:00:41.763 --> 00:00:44.114
and somehow measure the weight of the column of air

00:00:44.114 --> 00:00:46.670
above that scale, where it would be the greatest?

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.828
Would it be down here, near the bottom,

00:00:48.828 --> 00:00:51.627
or way up here near the top or maybe somewhere

00:00:51.627 --> 00:00:54.888
in the middle, choose the best answer.
