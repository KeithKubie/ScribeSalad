now Rogers also believed some other

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620
now Rogers also believed some other
 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.669
now Rogers also believed some other
things and this is where I think he gets

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679
things and this is where I think he gets
 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.189
things and this is where I think he gets
a little bit optimistic but but he's no

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199
a little bit optimistic but but he's no
 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.730
a little bit optimistic but but he's no
fool

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740
fool
 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.429
fool
so Rogers is one of those optimists you

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439
so Rogers is one of those optimists you
 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.330
so Rogers is one of those optimists you
really have to contend with no he

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340
really have to contend with no he
 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.429
really have to contend with no he
believed and I think this is a classical

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439
believed and I think this is a classical
 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.500
believed and I think this is a classical
Protestant believe this as well that

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510
Protestant believe this as well that
 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.839
Protestant believe this as well that
what evil was was basically the absence

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849
what evil was was basically the absence
 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.860
what evil was was basically the absence
of good and that people had a strong in

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870
of good and that people had a strong in
 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.100
of good and that people had a strong in
intrinsic impulse towards the good that

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110
intrinsic impulse towards the good that
 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.470
intrinsic impulse towards the good that
you could help them realize and the way

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480
you could help them realize and the way
 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.000
you could help them realize and the way
you helped them realize that was by

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010
you helped them realize that was by
 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.950
you helped them realize that was by
setting the preconditions for the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960
setting the preconditions for the
 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.830
setting the preconditions for the
emergence of that good and he believed

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840
emergence of that good and he believed
 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:54.380
emergence of that good and he believed
that the preconditions were the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390
that the preconditions were the
 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.490
that the preconditions were the
provision of a space for communication

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500
provision of a space for communication
 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.170
provision of a space for communication
where there was no judgment in the sense

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180
where there was no judgment in the sense
 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.800
where there was no judgment in the sense
of rejection and so here's the Rogerian

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810
of rejection and so here's the Rogerian
 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.230
of rejection and so here's the Rogerian
theory with regards to therapeutic

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240
theory with regards to therapeutic
 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.910
theory with regards to therapeutic
endeavor now the first thing is and this

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920
endeavor now the first thing is and this
 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.649
endeavor now the first thing is and this
seems critical and I think Rogers was

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659
seems critical and I think Rogers was
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.660
seems critical and I think Rogers was
right about this that the client has to

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670
right about this that the client has to
 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.130
right about this that the client has to
want to change and this is this is a

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140
want to change and this is this is a
 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.870
want to change and this is this is a
funny thing about therapy because my

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880
funny thing about therapy because my
 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.870
funny thing about therapy because my
observation has been that it's not

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880
observation has been that it's not
 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.539
observation has been that it's not
something you can impose on people

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549
something you can impose on people
 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.130
something you can impose on people
unless they've decided that things could

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
unless they've decided that things could
 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.340
unless they've decided that things could
be better and that alterations in in in

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350
be better and that alterations in in in
 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.590
be better and that alterations in in in
something they're doing might make it

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600
something they're doing might make it
 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.990
something they're doing might make it
better it's a non-starter

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000
better it's a non-starter
 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.060
better it's a non-starter
and so I've had clients who were

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070
and so I've had clients who were
 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.770
and so I've had clients who were
court-ordered to attend therapy and

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780
court-ordered to attend therapy and
 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.090
court-ordered to attend therapy and
that's just complete waste of time

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100
that's just complete waste of time
 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.039
that's just complete waste of time
especially if they're more on the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049
especially if they're more on the
 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.469
especially if they're more on the
psychopathic end of things because you

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479
psychopathic end of things because you
 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.510
psychopathic end of things because you
just if they don't want to change

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520
just if they don't want to change
 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.950
just if they don't want to change
they're not going to learn this is

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960
they're not going to learn this is
 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.950
they're not going to learn this is
actually another criterion principle and

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960
actually another criterion principle and
 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.959
actually another criterion principle and
because Rogers had an educational

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969
because Rogers had an educational
 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.550
because Rogers had an educational
philosophy as well and the educational

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560
philosophy as well and the educational
 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.100
philosophy as well and the educational
philosophy was students will not learn

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110
philosophy was students will not learn
 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.370
philosophy was students will not learn
things that are not relevant to them and

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380
things that are not relevant to them and
 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.529
things that are not relevant to them and
so one of the teachers duties was to

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539
so one of the teachers duties was to
 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.199
so one of the teachers duties was to
make the material at hand relevant

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209
make the material at hand relevant
 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:12.710
make the material at hand relevant
because

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720
because
 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.210
because
would help the student remember it why I

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220
would help the student remember it why I
 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.830
would help the student remember it why I
remembered if it's not relevance one of

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840
remembered if it's not relevance one of
 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.180
remembered if it's not relevance one of
the things I tried to do in my lectures

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190
the things I tried to do in my lectures
 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.640
the things I tried to do in my lectures
I try to tell people when I'm lecturing

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650
I try to tell people when I'm lecturing
 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.410
I try to tell people when I'm lecturing
why they should know this and the

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420
why they should know this and the
 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.570
why they should know this and the
fundamental answer always if you push it

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580
fundamental answer always if you push it
 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.870
fundamental answer always if you push it
down far enough is that if you know this

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880
down far enough is that if you know this
 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.580
down far enough is that if you know this
your life will go better and so will the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590
your life will go better and so will the
 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.590
your life will go better and so will the
life of people around you so you should

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600
life of people around you so you should
 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.120
life of people around you so you should
listen because then there's some things

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130
listen because then there's some things
 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.400
listen because then there's some things
that are sharp and pointy that you won't

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410
that are sharp and pointy that you won't
 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.930
that are sharp and pointy that you won't
run into while you're wandering around

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940
run into while you're wandering around
 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.960
run into while you're wandering around
in the fog so and that's the fundamental

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970
in the fog so and that's the fundamental
 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.060
in the fog so and that's the fundamental
issue it's necessary to know these

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070
issue it's necessary to know these
 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.910
issue it's necessary to know these
things and so if you're dealing with

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920
things and so if you're dealing with
 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.650
things and so if you're dealing with
someone who hasn't decided that there's

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660
someone who hasn't decided that there's
 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.820
someone who hasn't decided that there's
something wrong and that they have

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830
something wrong and that they have
 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.199
something wrong and that they have
something to do about it then that maybe

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209
something to do about it then that maybe
 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.550
something to do about it then that maybe
they could change and that would make

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560
they could change and that would make
 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.340
they could change and that would make
things better you're not going anywhere

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350
things better you're not going anywhere
 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.860
things better you're not going anywhere
and Rogers would also say that's

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870
and Rogers would also say that's
 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.690
and Rogers would also say that's
actually precondition for a relationship

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700
actually precondition for a relationship
 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.930
actually precondition for a relationship
period because he didn't really make

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940
period because he didn't really make
 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.340
period because he didn't really make
much of a distinction between a

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350
much of a distinction between a
 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.949
much of a distinction between a
therapeutic relationship and a genuine

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959
therapeutic relationship and a genuine
 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.390
therapeutic relationship and a genuine
relationship because he thought that

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400
relationship because he thought that
 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.280
relationship because he thought that
genuine relationships were therapeutic

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290
genuine relationships were therapeutic
 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.490
genuine relationships were therapeutic
and so one of the principles that you

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500
and so one of the principles that you
 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.140
and so one of the principles that you
can extract from that is that if you're

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150
can extract from that is that if you're
 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.390
can extract from that is that if you're
in a relationship one useful proposition

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400
in a relationship one useful proposition
 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.880
in a relationship one useful proposition
is that well you're pretty perfect but

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890
is that well you're pretty perfect but
 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.440
is that well you're pretty perfect but
you're probably not quite as perfect as

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450
you're probably not quite as perfect as
 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.050
you're probably not quite as perfect as
you could be and so it's possible that

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060
you could be and so it's possible that
 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.330
you could be and so it's possible that
your partner no matter how deeply flawed

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340
your partner no matter how deeply flawed
 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.460
your partner no matter how deeply flawed
they are might now and then have

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470
they are might now and then have
 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.320
they are might now and then have
something to say to you that would if

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330
something to say to you that would if
 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.570
something to say to you that would if
you incorporate it would bring you to an

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580
you incorporate it would bring you to an
 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.790
you incorporate it would bring you to an
even higher state of profession right

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800
even higher state of profession right
 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.009
even higher state of profession right
and so that's that means you have to

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019
and so that's that means you have to
 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.400
and so that's that means you have to
listen and it's worse than that and this

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410
listen and it's worse than that and this
 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.759
listen and it's worse than that and this
again is a Rogerian observation you

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769
again is a Rogerian observation you
 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.650
again is a Rogerian observation you
might have to help them criticize you

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660
might have to help them criticize you
 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.600
might have to help them criticize you
because maybe they're not very good at

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610
because maybe they're not very good at
 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.090
because maybe they're not very good at
it you know and so there's something

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100
it you know and so there's something
 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.890
it you know and so there's something
there trying to tell you in there's

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900
there trying to tell you in there's
 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.039
there trying to tell you in there's
stumbling way and it's it's an actual

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049
stumbling way and it's it's an actual
 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.990
stumbling way and it's it's an actual
thing but they can't articulate it and

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000
thing but they can't articulate it and
 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.670
thing but they can't articulate it and
so it'd be easy for you just to

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680
so it'd be easy for you just to
 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.990
so it'd be easy for you just to
especially if you're trying to use

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000
especially if you're trying to use
 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.880
especially if you're trying to use
languages to mentally and to get away

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890
languages to mentally and to get away
 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.160
languages to mentally and to get away
with it just to well you could even make

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170
with it just to well you could even make
 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.740
with it just to well you could even make
fun of the way they're poorly

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750
fun of the way they're poorly
 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.690
fun of the way they're poorly
articulating the problem that's a really

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700
articulating the problem that's a really
 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.009
articulating the problem that's a really
good one because then you can convince

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019
good one because then you can convince
 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.560
good one because then you can convince
them not to do such things in the future

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570
them not to do such things in the future
 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.000

different than winning the argument I

ever because you're not playing the game
 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.760
ever because you're not playing the game
of the argument you're playing the game

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770
of the argument you're playing the game

of iterated arguments across time and so

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340
of iterated arguments across time and so
 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.850
of iterated arguments across time and so
if you win an argument you just set up

if you win an argument you just set up
 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.250
if you win an argument you just set up

so from a Rotarian perspective winning

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010

now you can if you win the argument

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850
now you can if you win the argument

now you can if you win the argument
that's the rationalization issues

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680
that's the rationalization issues

that's the rationalization issues
fundamentally you don't have to change

fundamentally you don't have to change

fundamentally you don't have to change
but the fact is you do have to change

but the fact is you do have to change
 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.260
but the fact is you do have to change
because the way you are is giving rise

couples have to have conflict because

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040
couples have to have conflict because
 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.250
couples have to have conflict because
there's no difference between conflict

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260
there's no difference between conflict
 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.830
there's no difference between conflict
and thinking thinking is a form of war

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840

it's just that you and you make it an

it's just that you and you make it an

it's just that you and you make it an
interior form of war right you can't

interior form of war right you can't
 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.940

have a couple with conflict because life

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950

is different difficult and people differ

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470
is different difficult and people differ
 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.440
is different difficult and people differ
from one another so they have different

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450
from one another so they have different
 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.690
from one another so they have different
value structures and so you can't just

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700
value structures and so you can't just
 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.370
value structures and so you can't just
ignore that you have to set up a
