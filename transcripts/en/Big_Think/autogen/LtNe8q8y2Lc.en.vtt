has there been a greater demand for the
 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.800
has there been a greater demand for the
army to invest in and it means to

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810
army to invest in and it means to
 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.330
army to invest in and it means to
regulate alertness and what he means by

regulate alertness and what he means by
 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.259
regulate alertness and what he means by
this is that there's all types of the

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:37.269
this is that there's all types of the
 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.079
this is that there's all types of the
Army's requiring all types of advanced

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:40.089
Army's requiring all types of advanced
 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:42.990
Army's requiring all types of advanced
technology they have likely to the

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000

soldier if you'd be looking at a GPS

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860
soldier if you'd be looking at a GPS
 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.590
soldier if you'd be looking at a GPS
device then he'd be looking up a broad

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600
device then he'd be looking up a broad
 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.820
device then he'd be looking up a broad
broad field so like a broad view in the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830
broad field so like a broad view in the
 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.039
broad field so like a broad view in the
real world so you're going from a narrow

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:53.049
real world so you're going from a narrow
 

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:55.200
real world so you're going from a narrow
focus to a wife or focus it requires a

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210
focus to a wife or focus it requires a
 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.240
focus to a wife or focus it requires a
lot of visual attention skills

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250
lot of visual attention skills
 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.100
lot of visual attention skills
definitely air traffic controllers when

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110
definitely air traffic controllers when
 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.539
definitely air traffic controllers when
I visited the Federal Aviation

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:00.549
I visited the Federal Aviation
 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:02.160
I visited the Federal Aviation
Administration I was shocked like

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170
Administration I was shocked like
 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.039
Administration I was shocked like
there's all all interfaces going on the

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049
there's all all interfaces going on the
 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:06.179
there's all all interfaces going on the
same with pilots you're going from

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189
same with pilots you're going from
 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:08.039
same with pilots you're going from
looking at interfaces to looking out so

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049
looking at interfaces to looking out so
 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.840
looking at interfaces to looking out so
so there's a lot of things that require

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850
so there's a lot of things that require
 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.359
so there's a lot of things that require
visual attention skills and training of

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369
visual attention skills and training of
 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.219
visual attention skills and training of
that and I think that's what they're

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229
that and I think that's what they're
 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.260
that and I think that's what they're
they're interested in so when I when I

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270
they're interested in so when I when I
 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.910
they're interested in so when I when I
present it I presented to the fort

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920
present it I presented to the fort
 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.370
present it I presented to the fort
monmouth the armed forces communications

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380
monmouth the armed forces communications
 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.349
monmouth the armed forces communications
electronics association and when i

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:22.359
electronics association and when i
 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:24.239
electronics association and when i
present it to them a lot of people asked

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:24.249
present it to them a lot of people asked
 

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:26.760
present it to them a lot of people asked
me to forward their paper so i think

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770
me to forward their paper so i think
 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.469
me to forward their paper so i think
definitely more research we have to be

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479
definitely more research we have to be
 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.410
definitely more research we have to be
done looking into how acupressure trains

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420
done looking into how acupressure trains
 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.840
done looking into how acupressure trains
alertness over time if you could apply

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850
alertness over time if you could apply
 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.889
alertness over time if you could apply
acupressure for longer or shorter

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899
acupressure for longer or shorter
 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.169
acupressure for longer or shorter
periods of time how that would affect if

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179
periods of time how that would affect if
 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:38.370
periods of time how that would affect if
there's certain points that are more

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380
there's certain points that are more
 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.590
there's certain points that are more
effective so they're definitely looking

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600
effective so they're definitely looking
 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.669
effective so they're definitely looking
into that and i mean it would be a long

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679
into that and i mean it would be a long
 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.309
into that and i mean it would be a long
process for them to impose implement

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319
process for them to impose implement
 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:49.590
process for them to impose implement
acupressure training into the armed

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600
acupressure training into the armed
 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.849
acupressure training into the armed
forces but it's definitely something

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859
forces but it's definitely something
 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:52.499
forces but it's definitely something
that there's a lot of interest in that

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509
that there's a lot of interest in that
 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.619
that there's a lot of interest in that
we might one day see
