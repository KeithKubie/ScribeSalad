00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.120
Absolutely, it's a good idea to get the flu shot every year.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.060
That's the best protection that we have against the flu

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.800
because even if we have a change in the influenza virus,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:19.300
either through shift or drift, those previous vaccinations will help to protect against future viruses,

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.860
even if they're not an exact match.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.060
The flu is not a bad cold.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.340
The flu is actually a fairly dangerous illness.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.580
Tens of thousands of people die from influenza on an annual basis.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.560
We can't say that about the cold.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.320
Rarely, is there fever associated with a cold.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.920
Flu, on the other hand, a primary symptom is fever.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.040
And then there are also body aches. There's a cough, which may develop into pneumonia.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.640
But those are the primary symptoms that we see with the flu

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.980
The other difference between a cold and the flu is that most people can continue to work with a cold

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.580
The flu knocks you flat on your back. Generally you are out from work for 2-3 days.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.380
The best time of year to get a flu vaccine is probably as soon as it's available

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.320
... because then you're most protected for whenever the flu season starts.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.300
There are some risks associated with the influenza vaccination; however, the flu shot cannot give you the flu.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:26.300
These are inactivated or killed, the virus vaccines, and so the shots do not transmit the flu.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:35.000
They do, on occasion, make you feel like you've gotten the flu--there are some aches. There may even be a low-grade fever, but it's not the full-blown flu.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.360
People who do have egg allergies should tell their provider they have an egg allergy.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.000
And then their provider should give them one of the two vaccines that is safe for them to receive.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.140
Not only can pregnant women get the flu shot, but they should get the flu shot.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.180
It is safe in pregnancy. It's a huge risk for pregnant women if they get the flu

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.620
... because they are at an increased risk of dying from it, and it is perfectly safe for the fetus.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.020
The newborn baby will be protected from the flu because the mother's immune system generates antibodies.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.540
Those antibodies are actually transmitted over to the fetus, and they last about the first six months of the baby's life.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.460
There are very few people who cannot get the flu vaccination.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:22.140
Anyone who has had a serious reaction to a previous flu immunization should not get a flu shot.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.720
There are two primary vaccines that are used for the general population.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.740
One that covers three, primary circulating viral strains

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.860
... and then there's one that actually adds in a fourth.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.860
There are two vaccines available for folks who are 65 and older.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.420
That's a high-dose vaccine, so it's essentially double the dose of the regular vaccine.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.540
And then there's one that's called FLUAD, and so it has an adjuvant in it.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.880
And this adjuvant actually is a general stimulator of the immune system so that it will generate a better response to the flu viruses that are there.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.200
And then there is the one that is called the flu mist.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.320
That is what we call a live attenuated virus that is for use primarily in kids who do not want to get a shot.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.180
But if there are adults who are averse to getting shots, they can use the flu mist as well.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.460
It is important to note that people who have weakened immune systems should not receive the flu mist.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.780
Antivirals for influenza are most effective when they're started within the first 24 hours of symptoms.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:33.660
And so if you have a fever and body aches associated with the cough, and certainly fever or body aches, that would be a clue that you should go to your doctor to seek antiviral therapy.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:41.860
So one of the best things to do during flu season in order to avoid getting the flu is to wash your hands or clean your hands frequently.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.840
Especially if you're going to be out in a public place, frequent hand cleaning and hand washing is very important in those settings.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.660
So, masks may be effective in preventing the flu. It's not entirely clear that they are.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:02.780
I'm aware of two research studies. One was done in Australia during flu season, and that showed that masks actually did not prevent influenza.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:09.400
There was a second study that was done in China, and that showed that the masks were effective in preventing influenza.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:19.560
I think if masks are effective, it's because people use them properly; then, the mask provides a barrier from people touching their mouth and their nose.
