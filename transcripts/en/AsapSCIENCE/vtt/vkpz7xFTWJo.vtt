00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
Booze

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.800
Alcohol, one of the most commonly used and abused drugs in the world

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.300
comes in a variety of forms and does one thing quickly and well.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.300
It changes the way you feel

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.000
But to what do we owe these feelings of release and freedom?

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.800
How could ingestion of one simple substance

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.800
so drastically change not only your actions

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.400
but thoughts and perception.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.300
As alcohol enters the body and makes it's way to your brain,

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.000
it begins to interact with your neurons or brain cells.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.000
In our previous video on marijuana which you can click here

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
we explain the actions of neurons and their chemical messengers called neurotransmitters.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.500
But there are two main types of neurotransmitters

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.400
that these neurons use to communicate, or send electrical signals.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.400
Excitatory neurons use glutamate, well inhibitory neurons  use GABA.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.000
The yin and yang if you will.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.800
Much like the zeroes and ones of a computer, these two messengers have contrasting roles.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.380
Glutamate begins a wave of excitation while GABA not only inhibits this flow,

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.500
but helps to organize and differentiate the results in your brain.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.160
And just like a computer, these signals can be combined in enormous complexity to form actions and thoughts.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.980
So how does alcohol affect these two signals? Turns out it suppresses glutamate transmission

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.280
and enhances GABA transmission, so you get less excitation and more inhibition.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.340
And because glutamate sites become less effective, information flow becomes slow,

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.860
and only the largest signals can make it through.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.840
This means you feel less, percieve less, notice less, and remember less.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.240
In conjunction the increased GABA hushes the excessive background noise of activity

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.500
fine tuning and clarifying your thoughts, but to an excessive degree.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.040
This is why you may have heard that alcohol is a depressant.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.520
But inhibition of your neurons is not the same as social inhibition.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.760
Instead, it simply cleans up and removes extraneous activity by removing less significant excitation.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.080
Without normal GABA transmission the excessive excitatory action,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.140
would resemble a epileptic seizure

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.340
There'd be no clarity of thought.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.180
While drunk, your GABA channels are wide opened.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.960
Combined with the lack of glutamate, you begin to think very little but with great clarity.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.040
It's what causes the momentums attitude of a drunk, often repeating the same idea

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.040
or proclamation over and over.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.780
Thinking clearly about almost nothing.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.040
Hmm

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.040
Got a burning question you want answered?

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.040
