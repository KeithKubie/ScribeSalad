CHRIS VANDER MAY:
Hi there folks.

00:00:16.638 --> 00:00:17.718
I am Chris Vander May.

00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:19.218
I am a Senior Product Manager
here at Google, working

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:21.358
on the Enterprise Team.

00:00:21.358 --> 00:00:24.540
And, we have, we're going
to have a little fireside

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.158
chat about Enterprise.

00:00:27.158 --> 00:00:30.120
I'm going to switch over to
the Waves, so we're going

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.018
to have a Wave going here.

00:00:32.178 --> 00:00:36.500
So, feel free to you add
things to the Wave, and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.400
we'll try to get to them.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.660
But, before we get started,
maybe I'll just have the rest

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.200
of the folks here on the
stage introduce themselves.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.540
EVAN GILBERT: Hi,
I'm Evan Gilbert.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.540
I'm an Engineer in our
Marketplace Efforts.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.340
DAVID GLAZER: I'm David Glazer,
I play number 5 for the San

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.100
Jose Sharks, and do some
engineering for our

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.920
developer product.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.460
SCOTT McMULLAN: I'm
Scott McMullan.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.960
I work on the Enterprise
Partner Team and

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.880
Marketplace Team.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.952
RYAN BOYD: And, Ryan Boyd.

00:00:59.952 --> 00:01:02.040
I'm a Developer Advocate
Engineer working on

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.140
the Marketplace.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.460
CHRIS VANDER MAY: So, thank
you all for coming out.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.560
Let me ask maybe a couple
questions just to

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.500
get us started.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.220
So, David, one of the things
that didn't get talked about

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.200
that today in the keynote
was some of the recent

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.480
announcements on storage.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.320
Can you just give us, you know,
a brief summary of what was

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.620
announced today, and how
it impacts Enterprise.
32
00:01:27,74 --&gt; 00:01:27,2
DAVID GLAZER: Yeah.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.040
I mean the short answer is
it is not yet relevant to

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.540
Enterprise, but will be.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.760
So, there was an announcement
today that we have a preview

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.660
of a Google storage for
developers offering out.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.700
Which, lets people that want to
store bulk data in Google's

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.840
Cloud do so with a
very simple API.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.146
Upload, download, get at your
40
00:01:47,146 --&gt; 00:01:47,06
data.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.420
And, when I say it's not yet
relevant to the Enterprise,

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.920
is as you saw with the
announcement of Google

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.738
App Engine for business.

00:01:54.738 --> 00:02:00.318
There's a bunch of work, and
packaging, and integrations

00:02:00.318 --> 00:02:03.180
that you need to do to take a
product that's good technology,

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.480
and have it be good
Enterprise ready technology.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.120
That has not been done for
this preview product.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.180
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Scott,
contextual gadgets just

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.460
launched yesterday and Gmail.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.440
Can you give us an idea of
what the Enterprise use cases

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.800
are for contextual gadgets?

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.580
SCOTT McMULLAN: Sure.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.338
Contextual gadgets for Gmail,
one of my favorite, favorite,

00:02:24.338 --> 00:02:27.498
favorite extension points,
we've been very excited to get

00:02:27.498 --> 00:02:28.938
these out for a long time.

00:02:28.938 --> 00:02:31.698
The reason I'm so excited about
them is, because, let's face

00:02:31.698 --> 00:02:34.138
it, folks spend a lot
of time in e-mail.

00:02:34.138 --> 00:02:35.960
And, they get a lot of the
inbound and they want to get

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.098
more efficient at that.

00:02:37.098 --> 00:02:40.798
And, so contextual gadgets can
be used, and we already see

00:02:40.798 --> 00:02:43.798
they're being used for
everything from, you know, I

00:02:43.798 --> 00:02:45.398
have an invoice that
needs to be approve.

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:49.098
I need a simple
approve/deny button.

00:02:49.098 --> 00:02:52.800
Let's make that easy, let's put
that information right in your

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.138
Gmail flow, and let's talk
to the system that actually

00:02:55.138 --> 00:02:56.080
would approve the invoice.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.618
To salespeople who are doing
biz dev, we want to figure out

00:03:01.618 --> 00:03:05.098
where they got, you know, they
got a lead, do I know this

00:03:05.098 --> 00:03:05.698
person, who knows it.

00:03:05.698 --> 00:03:08.278
So, reach out in the
social networks.

00:03:08.278 --> 00:03:10.740
Pretty much, any time you get
an e-mail, there's probably

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.120
some additional relevant
information from some sort

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.360
of Enterprise contact.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.860
You can bring the bear to make
a decision better, and people

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.098
are starting to experiment
with that already.

00:03:21.098 --> 00:03:21.578
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Cool.

00:03:21.698 --> 00:03:21.818
OK.

00:03:21.818 --> 00:03:24.918
Let's go to the Wave for
maybe a couple of questions.

00:03:31.738 --> 00:03:34.218
It be interested in a Google
Apps account as an individual

00:03:34.218 --> 00:03:37.378
bringing all of my personal
Google services together

00:03:37.378 --> 00:03:39.860
into a more closed and
manageable system.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.478
Both, with a potential to
transition easily to a

00:03:42.478 --> 00:03:43.058
professional service.

00:03:43.058 --> 00:03:46.558
Thoughts on this?

00:03:46.558 --> 00:03:48.058
So, anybody in
particular wanted to --

00:03:48.058 --> 00:03:48.918
SCOTT McMULLAN: Can
you read that again?

00:03:48.918 --> 00:03:50.418
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Yeah.

00:03:50.418 --> 00:03:55.300
I would be interested in -- so
this individual is looking for

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.618
a Google Apps account to bring
all, I think, all of the sort

00:03:58.618 --> 00:04:02.360
of personal services like
PICASSO and so forth, together

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.898
and transition that into
something like Google Apps.

00:04:08.898 --> 00:04:10.898
DAVID GLAZER: So, the good
news is we've wanted that

00:04:10.898 --> 00:04:12.918
ourselves for a long time.

00:04:12.918 --> 00:04:15.678
And, I forget exactly when we
announced it, but a month or

00:04:15.678 --> 00:04:17.458
so ago, we said, yes, we --

00:04:17.458 --> 00:04:18.458
SCOTT McMULLAN: Last week.

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:19.478
DAVID GLAZER: Last week.
99
00:04:19,478 --&gt; 00:04:19,338
OK.

00:04:19.338 --> 00:04:21.080
It felt like a month or so.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.720
SCOTT McMULLAN: A long week.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.740
DAVID GLAZER: Yeah,
it's been a long week.

00:04:23.398 --> 00:04:28.880
But yes, there's a little color
on it for anyone who's

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.660
interested, is internally there
has always been a distinction,

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.220
you know, deep in the system
between Google accounts, that

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.040
are part of a Google accounts
for your domain offering and

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.998
Google accounts that are just
used for regular

00:04:39.998 --> 00:04:41.078
consumer usage.

00:04:41.078 --> 00:04:43.940
And, the distinction was there
for an important reason, which

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.040
is, in the case of the business
the accounts need to have a

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.518
third party who have some
oversight over them.

00:04:49.518 --> 00:04:52.820
There's an admin that has the
ability to create accounts, to

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.380
turn off accounts, to reset
passwords, to do things like.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.700
And, to control what users can
do with the accounts in the

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.658
context of that work context.

00:05:02.538 --> 00:05:06.600
That rippled further than ideal
into what services you could

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.398
use, and that's being
undone, and that's why we

00:05:09.398 --> 00:05:09.880
announced last week.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.498
So, hopefully that's what
the questioner wanted.

00:05:13.498 --> 00:05:14.638
CHRIS VANDER MAY: I've
got another one here.

00:05:15.498 --> 00:05:19.520
Which is a little bit, maybe
not super germane to developer,

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.860
but we'll take in any way.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.700
When Enterprise is start moving
to the Cloud, with all the

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.398
period short or long, with
a mixed environment,

00:05:26.398 --> 00:05:27.478
clouded on-premise.

00:05:28.378 --> 00:05:29.678
What's the advice in
order to migrate.

00:05:30.758 --> 00:05:33.018
He first e-mailed, then how
can I select e-mail address

00:05:33.018 --> 00:05:36.618
from CRM on premise.

00:05:36.458 --> 00:05:39.078
Maybe this is one that I will
tackle, since I work a bit

00:05:39.078 --> 00:05:42.898
with the Enterprise
Deployment Teams.

00:05:42.898 --> 00:05:49.898
So, generally speaking,
your order to migrate will

00:05:49.898 --> 00:05:50.260
depend on your Enterprise.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:57.160
So, it does make sense to move
individual users completely

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.060
at a single time.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.878
And, if you do run in
co-existent mode, things like

00:06:03.878 --> 00:06:06.078
these gadgets, contextual
gadgets, that Scott was talking

00:06:06.078 --> 00:06:10.060
about, will certainly remain
relevant, and easy to use

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.118
for those new users.

00:06:12.118 --> 00:06:16.398
And, beyond that, it's really
a question of how your

00:06:16.398 --> 00:06:17.338
calendaring works.

00:06:17.338 --> 00:06:19.318
RYAN BOYD: And, we do actually
have ways that you can connect

00:06:19.318 --> 00:06:22.558
to the Cloud applications, to
your on-premise applications.

00:06:22.818 --> 00:06:25.118
There's a that technology
called the secure data

00:06:25.118 --> 00:06:28.098
connector, which allows you to
create a secure tunnel from

00:06:28.098 --> 00:06:29.838
Cloud applications to
your on-premise apps.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.698
And, make sure that you have
all the data in the right

00:06:32.698 --> 00:06:33.798
context, whether it be in
something like gadgets

00:06:33.798 --> 00:06:36.160
or an app engine.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.800
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Are there
any questions from the floor?

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:55.740
We're happy to take them too.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:56.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.196
RYAN BOYD:

00:06:56.248 --> 00:06:57.958
Tell him to repeat the
question, so that way in the

00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.120
future if we can actually ask
people to go to the

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.178
microphones, that
will be great.

00:07:01.178 --> 00:07:03.838
CHRIS VANDER MAY: So, the
question was is there any plan

00:07:03.838 --> 00:07:07.652
to have a container, where you
can have a parent company and a

00:07:07.652 --> 00:07:11.278
series of child companies
in Google Apps.

00:07:11.278 --> 00:07:14.240
What are we saying about
that at this point.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.000
It's something that we
recognize is very important,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.958
and we're working on it.

00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:20.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.120
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Yes.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.268
Absolutely.

00:07:21.416 --> 00:07:23.620
It's been available in post
[? ED ?], but multi-domain

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.160
management has not yet, and
is not today, available

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.398
in Google Apps.

00:07:30.398 --> 00:07:32.698
AUDIENCE: I'm not sure
if I've just something.

00:07:32.698 --> 00:07:35.138
So, apologies if this is buried
somewhere in docs, and I just

00:07:35.138 --> 00:07:37.758
haven't looked in
the right place.

00:07:37.758 --> 00:07:41.198
We're doing synchronization
things between our application

00:07:41.198 --> 00:07:43.680
which stores a contact data,
and wanting to push those data

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.660
into the contacts within,
obviously, an apps arrangement.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.940
The contacts as we see them
on our end, because we're

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.638
dealing with business
information is shared.

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:55.480
So, that contact, that person,
is somebody that every user,

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.220
you know, is able to
see and work with.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.498
But, when it comes to pushing
them into the Google platform,

00:07:59.498 --> 00:08:04.618
that's name spaces as far as
we've been able to see tied to

00:08:04.618 --> 00:08:08.138
individual users that are
performing thesynchronization.

00:08:08.138 --> 00:08:10.518
I know, in the case of Docs and
things like that, you can have

00:08:10.518 --> 00:08:14.198
like global readable areas if
you're on the premium
183
00:08:14,198 --&gt; 00:08:14,12
or paid versions.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.798
Is it the same thing
with contacts, or if

00:08:16.798 --> 00:08:18.098
I missed something, or is
that actually a gap in the

00:08:18.098 --> 00:08:19.318
product at the moment?

00:08:19.318 --> 00:08:21.458
Like a shared contact list.

00:08:21.458 --> 00:08:25.024
RYAN BOYD: For the premier
version of Google Apps, there

00:08:25.024 --> 00:08:29.700
is actually a Shared Contacts
API, which allows you to put

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.620
contacts in there that are
accessible to the

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.898
entire domain.

00:08:31.898 --> 00:08:32.880
Were you aware of that?

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.280
AUDIENCE: No, I wasn't.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.640
That's the bit I thought
I might have missed.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.698
Thanks for clarifying it.

00:08:36.698 --> 00:08:37.666
RYAN BOYD: It's definitely
there and you should

00:08:37.666 --> 00:08:37.760
check it out.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.298
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:08:38.298 --> 00:08:39.558
DAVID GLAZER: We
use it at Google.

00:08:41.058 --> 00:08:44.338
It would be hard to get work
done at Google without having

00:08:44.338 --> 00:08:47.200
the, you know, the whole 20
plus thousand people available

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.160
in auto-complete, for
example, and they are.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.066
AUDIENCE: Excellent.

00:08:51.066 --> 00:08:52.020
Thanks.

00:08:53.832 --> 00:08:54.740
CHRIS VANDER MAY: OK.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:58.060
Maybe I'll go back to
the panel for a second.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.240
Let you cogitate.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:08:59.480
Or, no.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.560
Yes, I'm going to
go to the panel.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.260
I got siked out.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.340
Let's see, David how do you
think App Engine for Business

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.380
is going to change the way
that developers are building

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.820
Enterprise applications.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:15.480
DAVID GLAZER: The short
answer is it will give

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.280
them more choice.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.640
And, we think it's going to
give them a choice that they're

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.460
going to find really attractive
for many of their apps.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.018
Did any of you have a chance to
attend the talk that Ben Fried

00:09:28.018 --> 00:09:30.460
gave earlier today on how
Google was using Google

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.860
App Engine internally?

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.280
Just hands, just curious,
how many of you.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.380
OK.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.260
Good 20 or so people.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.720
The, you know, what certainly,
what we found internally is

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:47.980
that there's a large class of
applications for which having

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.560
the power of App Engine to hide
the details from you is perfect

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.160
fit for many internal
applications.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.138
And, it's a perfect fit,
because internal applications

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:59.898
don't always have a huge budget
in terms of engineering time.

00:09:59.898 --> 00:10:03.398
They don't always have a long,
or a known long, life cycle.

00:10:03.398 --> 00:10:06.480
So, it's hard to know how much
to invest in them up front.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.880
And, therefore people are
limited in how much time

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.860
they can spend in actually
creating one of these apps.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.240
And, if they have to spend a
week or two getting it

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.300
deployed, and managing the
overhead of actually getting it

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.600
out there, and they only have a
week or two to build it, that

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.460
means half their budget
is going to plumbing.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.980
If you're building Gmail,
you have an awful lot

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:27.060
of development budget.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.038
And, if you have to spend a
week or two or a month or

00:10:30.038 --> 00:10:31.058
two on plumbing, it's OK.

00:10:31.058 --> 00:10:34.340
You're amortizing it over
a, you know, multiple

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.678
years of engineering.

00:10:35.678 --> 00:10:37.012
But, if you're building app
where you got weeks to invest

00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:42.658
in it, the beauty of App Engine
is it takes minutes to do the

00:10:42.658 --> 00:10:44.100
plumbing and the deployment.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:48.498
So, for the apps where it fits
the programming model, which is

00:10:48.498 --> 00:10:51.940
a growing number of apps, I
think it's going to be a big

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.540
attractive way to do it.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:55.000
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Well,
let's go to the floor.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.040
Yes?

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.560
AUDIENCE: An announcement, a
couple days ago about Google

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:06.440
Apps Script having access
to on premises SQL.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.760
I couldn't find any
documentation on it.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:13.460
I'm assuming that's through
SDC and the FATE server

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.100
in the absence of --

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:15.640
DAVID GLAZER: JR are
you still in the room?

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.200
I saw you earlier.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.000
Doesn't look like it.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.100
But, the perfect person to
answer you question had stuck

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.820
his head in earlier, but no.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.780
RYAN BOYD: I shouldn't
think quite yet, but

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:28.220
it was through SDC.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:32.400
I mean, I think that's the
eventual goal of that sort of

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.100
access, is to go through SDC.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.780
I think at this point
it's making direct

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.680
connections through SQL.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.360
But, yeah, on the documentation
side it's definitely -- the

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.540
search for Google Apps Script.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.660
At least the last time searched
for that, like a week or two

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:49.200
ago, it was actually that the
first result in the wonderful

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.280
Google search engine.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.800
But, you should take a look,
and if you don't find the docs,

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.860
come see me after this, and
I'll definitely help

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.820
you try to find it.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.880
DAVID GLAZER: There's a session
on app script, I'm looking now

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.440
if it was today or tomorrow.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.000
And, that would be a great
place to learn more

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.778
aspect -- it's tomorrow.

00:12:06.778 --> 00:12:08.618
So, there's a session tomorrow
on app script, where the right

00:12:08.618 --> 00:12:10.898
people will be probably
answering your question

00:12:10.898 --> 00:12:11.878
in the presentation.

00:12:11.878 --> 00:12:16.300
And, if not, you'll know
what their faces look like.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.060
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Yes, next.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.340
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.740
A prior session was
about the Buzz API.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:27.560
And, is Buzz going to
be available with

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.140
Google Apps soon.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:35.138
And, it's going to be
available, is there a way for

00:12:35.138 --> 00:12:41.360
a company to be testers for
Buzz in Google Apps and

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.740
host their domains?

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:45.060
CHRIS VANDER MAY:
I'll take this one.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.760
You know, we can't really talk
too much about the future

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.240
of that particular product.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.240
And, so I can't say when
that would be available,

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.740
or even what the specific
implementation would be.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:13:01.040
But, over time, we are working
very hard on giving admins the

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.320
ability to delegate authority
to various features.

00:13:04.618 --> 00:13:07.800
And, to grant more granular
management capabilities

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:07.960
within a domain.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.318
So, it certainly aligned with
the direction we're going,

00:13:10.318 --> 00:13:11.118
but I can't comment on that.

00:13:11.118 --> 00:13:13.498
DAVID GLAZER: There's
two things we can say,

00:13:13.498 --> 00:13:14.518
because we've said them.

00:13:14.518 --> 00:13:17.418
One is that absolutely Buzz
is going to be available to

00:13:17.418 --> 00:13:20.060
domains with admin control.

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.060
That was part of the plan from
the day we launched Buzz.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.278
And, so that's still very true.

00:13:24.278 --> 00:13:27.760
And, the second is that we use
it internally in that way.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.918
So, it's already in the stage
where Googlers are the

00:13:30.918 --> 00:13:33.480
only domain this is
using it that way.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.216
But it is in use, this
is not a wish this is

00:13:35.216 --> 00:13:37.400
code.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.684
AUDIENCE: And, is there a
way for a company to apply

00:13:39.684 --> 00:13:41.580
--

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.680
DAVID GLAZER: We haven't done
any trust, or test, or program

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.100
or via program for domains.

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:51.100
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:51.900
CHRIS VANDER MAY: OK.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.360
I have a question for Evan.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.820
Evan, what sort of
security concerns should

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:57.780
developers think about.

00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:58.080
Specifically for
Enterprise Apps.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.500
EVAN GILBERT: Yeah, absolutely.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.758
One of the things we're doing
with Google, with our

00:14:03.758 --> 00:14:06.100
marketplace and the apps that
plug into Google, is they have

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.520
broad access to data that is
for the Google customers.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.020
And, with that, there are a
couple things you need to do.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:16.100
One is you need to think
about security very closely.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.020
Your customers are trusting you
with their core data in their

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.660
Enterprise, and you need to
treat that data as if it were

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.600
your own, or possibly
even better.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.760
And, the second thing with
that is don't ask for

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.720
more data than you need.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.864
We're going to roll out more
features over time that will

00:14:30.864 --> 00:14:34.360
let you get access, just
the data you need to

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.198
interact with Google.

00:14:35.198 --> 00:14:37.838
So, if you don't need
access to a user's dock

00:14:37.838 --> 00:14:38.818
list, don't take it.

00:14:38.818 --> 00:14:39.678
Because, all it does is
creates a liability

00:14:39.678 --> 00:14:43.520
for you in the future.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:43.912
CHRIS VANDER MAY:
Great, thanks Evan.

00:14:44.128 --> 00:14:47.040
Let me go to a question
from moderator.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:52.558
Where does Google invest the
largest dev effort with an apps

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:54.118
in Enterprise, just so we
systems integrators can

00:14:54.118 --> 00:14:57.620
adjust our strategy?

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:02.200
Well, David, what's your
take on this as an

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.540
Engineering Director?

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.660
DAVID GLAZER: There's two
halves to the question.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:09.632
And, you know, one is where do

00:15:09.632 --> 00:15:13.878
we invest our engineering
energy in Google Apps that are

00:15:13.878 --> 00:15:14.158
relevant to the Enterprise.

00:15:14.158 --> 00:15:17.700
And, the other is where do
we invest our Enterprise

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:17.878
specific energy.

00:15:17.878 --> 00:15:20.018
So, let me say what
I mean by that.

00:15:20.018 --> 00:15:21.638
And, I'll try to answer them.

00:15:21.638 --> 00:15:24.940
I'm killing time here by
taking the question apart.

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:29.660
The most of the offerings
of Google Apps for the

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.620
Enterprise are the
offerings of Google Apps.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.800
Most of Gmail for your
domain is Gmail.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.880
Most of Google Calendar for
your domain is Google Calendar.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.740
And, you know, so most of the
investment in Google Apps for

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.980
the Enterprise is actually
not Enterprise specific.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:48.980
The bulk of the engineering is
relevant to all of our hundreds

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:53.840
of millions of users, including
the Enterprise specific users.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.000
Then there is another set of
work which is the minority of

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.340
the total work, which is what
are we doing to take the

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:04.820
general offering and make it
relevant the Enterprise.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.400
And, that probably is two big
categories -- there might be

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.460
another one I'm missing -- the
two big categories are

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:16.260
administration and inter-op,
are the two categories.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.700
Administration means all the
things to recognize that there

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.000
is now a third party with
an interest in your data.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.820
So, whereas if you use Google
Calendar in your personal

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.738
account, there's you
and there's Google.

00:16:26.738 --> 00:16:29.320
And, that's the conversation.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.960
Whereas, if you use Google
Calendar at your work account,

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.838
there's you, there's Google,
and there's your CIO, your

00:16:34.838 --> 00:16:37.018
IT Admin, whoever that is.

00:16:37.018 --> 00:16:41.940
So, all of the applications
that are Enterprise

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.360
relevant always have
some level of control.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.440
A simple example, most of you
probably know this, a simple

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:54.538
example is are you allowed to
share a document with somebody

00:16:54.538 --> 00:16:55.700
outside of your domain or not.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.398
And, that's a choice that the
admin is given to restrict

00:16:58.398 --> 00:17:00.060
the choices the users have.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:05.140
So, that's one whole category
is admin controls over the

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.900
suite of apps -- turning apps
on and off, turning features

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.100
on and off, things like that.

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:10.800
The other category is inter-op.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:15.138
And, you know, Chris maybe you
can say more about the kinds

00:17:15.138 --> 00:17:16.158
of things we do there.

00:17:16.158 --> 00:17:19.260
But, this is, you know,
this is very -- I think

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.040
of it as very bushy work.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:24.200
It's not deep work, it's
lots, and lots, and lots of

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.160
small important features.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.780
It's making the contacts
work well with the Outlook

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.718
contacts schema in detail.

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:33.478
It's a - I don't know do
you have other examples of

00:17:33.478 --> 00:17:34.680
inter-op kinds of things?

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.660
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Sure, we do a
bunch of a inter-op related

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.358
work primarily to help domains
get there data out

00:17:41.358 --> 00:17:42.338
of legacy systems.

00:17:42.338 --> 00:17:45.120
Like domains that are trying to
move from Exchange, or move

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:50.318
from Lotus Notes, or want to
share a Google Calendar,

00:17:50.318 --> 00:17:51.018
free/busy information.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.200
Some of the users
with other users.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.500
So, we do do things
in that space.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.640
DAVID GLAZER: And, the last one
I'll add is the area that I at

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.040
least want to be the biggest
area of where we invest in our

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.280
Enterprise apps is the
code that you write.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.700
And, that means, that's the
intent of the apps marketplace

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.260
is to put the hooks into our
apps, so that you all

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.866
can extend them.

00:18:14.892 --> 00:18:17.840
And, I think the contextual
gadgets that were released

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.660
yesterday, that we just
talked about, is a

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.380
perfect example of that.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:25.420
I would like to see the bigger
amount of velocity of new

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.860
features, new Enterprise
specific features being added,

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.780
to be coming from you all
out there in the ecosystem.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.280
Building on top of the
platform that we add.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.660
Because, Google tends to be
very well organized, and very

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:40.338
good at building things that
many, many, many people want.

00:18:40.338 --> 00:18:43.020
And, we're not as well
structured to build things that

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.632
only thousands and tens of
thousands of people want.

00:18:46.826 --> 00:18:48.100
But, things that tens of
thousands of people want are

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.300
very attractive businesses and
very important areas that

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:55.600
aren't our sweet spot.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:56.520
CHRIS VANDER MAY:
Thanks, David.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.840
Let me go to Scott
for one question.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.380
Would you just talk a little
bit about the marketplace?

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.420
David touched on it.

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:07.858
What's progress in the Google
Apps marketplace been like.

00:19:07.358 --> 00:19:09.000
SCOTT McMULLAN: We've
been very pleased.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.618
We've been out for
about two months.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:15.000
We've seen over a million
customers, or over a million

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.140
users, get access to
marketplace apps through

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.140
installation there.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:22.440
And, I think one of the coolest
things most satisfying for my

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:27.180
perspective has been kind of
the breadth of applications

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:31.620
that have been adopted a lot.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.220
So, we don't release a lot
of very specific numbers.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:36.020
But, if you look at the types
of applications that our

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.860
customers are coming to the
marketplace looking around for

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:41.400
and actually installing it and
trying out, it really ranges

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:46.600
from, you know, single user
productivity tools like an

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.160
Aviary for photo
editing online.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.100
Which, is something that
someone in the Marketing

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.680
Department may pull down all
the way, you know, to an ERP

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:56.800
Suite, to a lot of this
attraction, CRM and

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.700
projected management.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:02.420
So, it's a breadth of kind of
interests has been satisfying.

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:07.200
So, it goes well for us to
continue to work with a

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.720
broader section of vendors.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.600
And, really to try to --
to David's point -- make

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.558
Google Apps much more of a
platform that it is today.

00:20:15.558 --> 00:20:17.738
We definitely got to start
that, but we really want to tap

00:20:17.738 --> 00:20:21.460
into the creativity of you
know, both customers who want

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.080
to build things for themselves,
as well as other ISPs who want

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:29.040
to build things for sale.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:29.800
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Please.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.838
Question from the floor.
464
00:20:30,838 --&gt; 00:20:30,14
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:36.460
I was curious how the Google
Chrome Store that was announced

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:40.598
today fits with the Apps
Store for Google Apps.

00:20:40.598 --> 00:20:42.400
Is there any synergy
there that's planned?

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.160
Are they totally separate?

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:49.100
Is this like a consumer versus
Enterprise kind of separation?

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.080
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Yeah,
I'm happy to take

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.400
that as product guy.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.440
You know, there's a very
clear separation in

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.760
these two marketplaces.

00:20:56.998 --> 00:21:00.218
The things that you buy your
business or your organization

00:21:00.218 --> 00:21:02.818
that works in a Google Apps
domain, you're going to get

00:21:02.818 --> 00:21:05.098
those in the Google
Apps marketplace.

00:21:05.098 --> 00:21:08.280
Things that are web apps that
are consumer focused, those are

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.380
in the Chrome Apps Store, and
they're designed to

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:10.020
work in Chrome.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:15.490
There's not a Chrome focus
per se in the Google

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:16.000
Apps marketplace.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.400
And, it is definitely
much more B2B.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.180
SCOTT McMULLAN: I was just
going to say I mean there's

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.120
definitely, you know, an
organizational purchase

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.798
and a consumer purchase.

00:21:27.798 --> 00:21:30.078
But, then there's that kind
of Prosumer, power user.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.400
We got a lot of folks in
the marketplace today.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.660
For example, SlideRocket, you
know, again as an example of a

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:36.740
high-end presentation tool.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:40.200
You may just want to go out
and use it for yourself.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:40.360
Finally, you love it.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.600
And, then introduce it
to your organization.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.700
So, having multiple kind of
channels in ways that the

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:50.760
customers can acquire things
from the web is really, give

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:55.000
us a lot of upside and choice
for users across the board.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.800
Consumer to business,
everything in between.

00:21:58.058 --> 00:21:59.540
DAVID GLAZER: Just two
small points to add.

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:05.480
One is, we talked about it
internally on the same page,

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.600
and how we described it.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.590
And, one of the analogies, that
work for me anyway, was you go

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:11.420
to Home Depot, there's the
contractors desk where they buy

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.720
their lumber, and then there's
the desks where the rest

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.280
of us by our lumber.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.740
And, similar products with some
commonalities, but different

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.840
businesses, different kind of
transactions, different

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.400
needs; therefore, different
interfaces to buy them.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:29.838
My other point is that for the
places where the developer

00:22:29.838 --> 00:22:32.838
needs are the same, such as
what standard are we goig to

00:22:32.838 --> 00:22:34.180
use to figure out who the user
is, you know, what standard

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.180
are we going to use
for permissions.

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:38.760
Going to be based on the same
underlying security technology,

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.360
the open technology an
open idea, and so on.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:46.580
So, places where it makes sense
to share it, it will be shared.

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.740
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Any
questions from the floor?

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.400
AUDIENCE: Hello, can you talk
about your plans to enable

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.558
enterprises to manage their
internal deployment

00:22:53.558 --> 00:22:58.680
of Android devices?

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.520
CHRIS VANDER MAY: I think you
should wait until tomorrow to

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.640
talk about Android
a little bit.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.260
But, I would say that, you
know, there is device

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:12.240
management for iPhones in
Google Apps, so you can see

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:17.080
a clear trend right there.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.972
AUDIENCE:
524
00:23:18,972 --&gt; 00:23:18,92
Hi.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:19.236
I know you cannot

00:23:19.236 --> 00:23:20.202
tell too much about

00:23:20.202 --> 00:23:20.558
dates and plans.

00:23:20.558 --> 00:23:24.318
But, can you tell us a little
bit about what you're planning

00:23:24.318 --> 00:23:27.558
with Google Voice, and maybe
additional communication

00:23:27.558 --> 00:23:29.044
options like multi-video
conference and this kind of

00:23:29.044 --> 00:23:32.640
--?

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:33.160
CHRIS VANDER MAY: No.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:33.720
DAVID GLAZER: No.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.124
RYAN BOYD:

00:23:35.124 --> 00:23:37.540
Can say that there are
some telephony apps

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:38.180
in the marketplace.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:41.500
And, there are other
solutions out there that are

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.020
looking to integrate with
Google Apps though.

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:43.476
EVAN GILBERT:

00:23:43.476 --> 00:23:47.480
Sorry.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.260
AUDIENCE: Just a quick question
around Google Groups, and kind

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:54.280
of where that's headed, you
know, in terms of is it

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:58.420
something that they're going to
be APIs released, or is it

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:01.280
something that might merge
with other products?

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:05.740
Is there directional strategy
at least in an Enterprise of

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:10.040
taking Microsoft Exchange
public folders and

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.360
having a tool

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.840
to get that data into an
email enable container?

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:18.260
RYAN BOYD: We did actually
launch new groups for Google

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.280
Apps, and the Groups API,
that's just part of the

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.860
provisioning API
for Google Apps.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:25.480
It does allow you to have some
management control over the

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.946
Google Groups and set up a
554
00:24:27,946 --&gt; 00:24:27,46
new Google Groups, and
that sort of things.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:29.120
You might want to
check that out.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:33.180
AUDIENCE: With more rounds, so
right now the API let's you

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.940
manage the name of the group,
but not actually get to

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.120
any of the content.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:37.600
RYAN BOYD: OK.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:42.000
I'm actually not aware
of any APIs for getting

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.960
the content currently.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.660
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Generally
what we suggest to people that

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:47.220
want to do this type of thing
is that you can actually

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.400
use the site's API.
565
00:24:48,4 --&gt; 00:24:48,06
You can create sites.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.978
You can add data in the sites.

00:24:50.978 --> 00:24:51.078
In [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:24:51.078 --> 00:24:54.600
a very rich way to
manage content.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.060
And, we've actually had
developers build sotware that

00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:00.880
works in sites, OfficeSync is
one example of a piece of

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.920
software that saves
documents to sites.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.240
So, that's one
place you can go.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.260
Beyond that, the specific
things that we are planning

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:13.838
to docs, I, sorry to
Groups I'm not aware of.

00:25:13.838 --> 00:25:15.180
RYAN BOYD: And, actually you
might also want to check out

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:18.470
there's a session tomorrow,
might not seem relevant by

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:22.020
the m but on gadgets
and Google Apps.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.700
And, in that session the
speaker does go through a

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.580
ticket tracking app that
he built as a demo.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:31.140
And, one thing that he does
sets up a group, but has the

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:34.520
email go to App Engine as a
place to then process

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.560
the emails and manage
some of the emails.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.740
So, depending on your actual
application, there may be some

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:42.780
other solutions available.

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:47.060
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Take a
question from the moderator.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:52.220
how do we explain the keynote
emphasis of HTML5, and then the

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.660
use of Google Sites as is?

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:54.720
Any plans.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:04.760
So, I'm not entirely sure I
understand the question, but

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.300
Philippe is in the room.

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:10.000
So, Philippe, OK, can you
maybe clarify for us?

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:33.760
RYAN BOYD: Can you get the mic.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.160
AUDIENCE: And that's in that
product developed so much

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.678
over the last month or so,

00:26:37.716 --> 00:26:37.874
so Iwas wondering

00:26:37.874 --> 00:26:41.000
if there are any plans to --

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.020
DAVID GLAZER: Now, there's
someone who thinks on the

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.780
velocity the we like.

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.880
The product hasn't improved
in a month and he's

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.460
inpatient, so are we.

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.660
OK, now I understand
the question.

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.820
You know, obviously sites
uses its standard HTML.

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:56.360
It's a standard
web application.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.340
It runs all of our browsers.

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.000
All of that.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.818
What I think the center of your
questions you're saying, how

00:27:01.818 --> 00:27:03.338
come it's not using the
coolest, newest features, how

00:27:03.338 --> 00:27:06.660
come it's not taking advantage
of things that worked

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.140
possible two months ago, but
might be possible now.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:12.820
I think, I don't have a
specific answer in terms of

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:15.480
Google Sites, but every
product team has their set

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.960
of priorities where they
look to enhance things.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.560
And, looks for the ones
that add the most

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:21.820
value to their users.

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.780
We do not have a hot company
goal to say, hey we're going

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.118
to use this new technology
because it shiny.

00:27:28.758 --> 00:27:31.238
An example that was shown in
the keynote -- was it in the

00:27:31.238 --> 00:27:32.678
keynote this morning,
the Gmail one?

00:27:32.678 --> 00:27:34.080
Yeah that was in the
keynote this morning.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.080
When you're sending a mail with
an attachment, right, there's

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.400
a simple piece of HTML5 the
ability to drag and drop from

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.058
the desktop, that meets a very
pressing need in the product.

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:49.640
And, so, that was a those
a high priority one.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.540
I think there probably are some
good enhancement possibilities

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:52.880
for Google Sites.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.940
I don't know where they
are on that teams list.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:56.380
So, I don't have anything
specific to say.

00:27:56.380 --> 00:28:01.720
I just want to be clear that it
does support HTML, obviously.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.380
And, priorities are driven by
what the team believes are user

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:09.540
of value, not necessarily by
using the newest technology.

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.100
EVAN GILBERT: I was going to
say quickly, I'm not sure if

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.876
the goal of Sites is
necessarily to be

00:28:12.876 --> 00:28:13.560
the most advanced HTML Editor.

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:17.340
It's a lot about collaboration
and making it easier to built

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:21.660
websites, but not necessarily
to be the not cutting

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:26.340
edge of web technology.

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:26.760
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Yes?

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.260
AUDIENCE: Hey guys,
thanks for doing this.

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:31.320
I love the idea of Google
Apps as a platform that's

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.000
extensible by the ecosystem.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.858
Can you help us think through
how that's going to applying

00:28:36.858 --> 00:28:38.700
on mobile devices, in
particular Android?

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:43.000
Should we be thinking about
that for merely as a web

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.880
experience, or via kind of
Google client for Google Apps?

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:49.140
How should we be thinking about
extending Google Apps in a way

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:49.660
that's going to be applicable
on a mobile device?

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:55.080
CHRIS VANDER MAY: I think
Sergey just said that the

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.618
native client and the web
browser were going to

00:28:58.618 --> 00:28:59.000
converge at some point.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.680
And, he's, you know, so
apparently he's just

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.858
defining the future.

00:29:03.618 --> 00:29:06.600
So, I guess don't worry
about it until it

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:07.578
all gets cleaned up.

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.440
David, what were you
going to say there?

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:14.720
DAVID GLAZER: The first thing
that came to mind is something

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.360
that Vic pointed out in his
opening remarks this morning.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:22.780
Which is open standards and
open communities and freedom

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:24.760
to choose is often messy.

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:27.720
And, it's a fun messy, because
it's the messy that's what

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.760
keeps us all getting out
of bed in the morning.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.078
I think the particular area
you're asking is it's kind of

00:29:33.078 --> 00:29:36.660
fun to watch the evolution of
these different tracks, and

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:38.312
crossover between them and
the hybrid apps that

00:29:38.312 --> 00:29:39.980
are getting built.

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:47.960
And, yeah, you know, and where
the moving trade off point

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:51.760
between the benefits of
buildings a pure HTML5

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.160
application versus an
application that takes

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:57.000
advantage of device
specific capabilities.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.420
All I''m doing is agreeing
strongly with the premise of

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:03.720
your question in saying that I
don't think there's a master

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.490
road map that anyone in
industry, let alone anyone in

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:09.660
Google could say for exactly
how those will trade off.

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:13.300
Certainly, personally, my rule
is when you can do the things

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:17.780
you want to do it HTML5, you
get much more reach, and much

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:20.900
more predictable long-term
reach by doing that.

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:26.620
But, not everything
can be done there.

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:28.520
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Ryan, so you
spent a bunch of time working

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.460
with developers in the
Google Apps marketplace.

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:35.760
What are some major takeaways
that you've gotten from

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.578
developers, or major stumbling
blocks that you've encounter

00:30:38.578 --> 00:30:40.180
that they should be aware of?

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.220
RYAN BOYD: Sure.

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:44.700
I mean so basically integrated
with the marketplaces is

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:45.700
quite simple overall.

00:30:45.078 --> 00:30:48.800
It's basically integrating
single sign on with open ID.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.600
A lot of open standards.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:51.680
There are a lot of
libraries out there.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.080
Some people are trying
to write their own.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.380
And, that not only has
security problems assoicated

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.360
with it, but also has
usability problems.

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.740
So, you know, use some of the
tools that are out there to

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:02.960
make this really easy for you.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.980
We've had marketplace
developers launch, or

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.440
create their applications
in like three days.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.258
And, then we've had ones that
have taken a little bit longer.

00:31:10.258 --> 00:31:12.920
But, there are a lot of
libraries out there to

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:13.980
help you with that.

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:17.540
You know, I'd also say like
test your applications, talk

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:20.420
to your customers about the
different use cases for your

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:23.640
application, and make
sure to support those

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.860
existing customers.

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:26.960
The existing customers are
often going to be the ones

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.320
that are going to install
your application first.

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.040
You're probably going to notify
them as soon as you launch

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:30.680
in the marketplace.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.180
Because, they've been
asking for the Google Apps

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.340
integration for a while.

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:35.820
Take those existing
customers into account.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:40.280
Create good experiences for
people when they install the

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:43.220
application to not only sign
up as a new user of the

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:47.560
application, but also link up
with the existing account.

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:47.580
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Great.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:51.060
Let's take a question
from the floor.

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.140
AUDIENCE: Hi guys,
thanks for your time.

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:55.520
Could you talk a little bit
about the strategic vision for

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.778
technologies like Wave or Apps
in a widget form, and how they

00:31:58.778 --> 00:32:01.220
fit in with Enterprise
integration portal platforms --

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.538
like the Life Ray, the Weblogic
and the SharePoints

00:32:03.538 --> 00:32:04.218
of the world?

00:32:04.218 --> 00:32:07.120
CHRIS VANDER MAY: I'd love
to take a stab at this.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:12.700
You know, there are probably as
many ways of getting a job done

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.780
as there are different
kinds of businesses.

00:32:16.238 --> 00:32:20.040
And, what we're finding is that
technologiees like Waves and

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:24.660
Gmail allows businesses
to accomplish different

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:26.558
tasks more efficiently.

00:32:26.558 --> 00:32:29.900
So, Wave is great when you have
a conversation that needs to

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:35.020
sort of evolve organically, and
go from a chat to email threads

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.880
to discussions, to documents.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:41.980
And, we find that -- so Google
tends to use it when we do

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:42.940
offsite, when we do
an event like this.

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:43.538
And, that type of thing.

00:32:43.538 --> 00:32:47.240
So, it becomes very, very
valuable in that context.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.498
Whereas, you know, when you're
dealing with customers,

00:32:50.498 --> 00:32:51.618
you know, you

00:32:51.618 --> 00:32:55.178
get incoming email So, and
you have to respond to that.

00:32:55.178 --> 00:32:57.980
And, one of our goals, Sergey
always said that he wants

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:01.500
email from Google to
make you seem smarter.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.740
And, that's why these
contextual gadgets

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:04.620
are interesting.

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:08.940
Because, now developers,
yourselves, can write gadgets

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.648
that interact with email and
help you seem smarter, whether

00:33:11.648 --> 00:33:15.780
it's CRM or whatever.

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:18.180
That sort of extensibility
built on top of Google.

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.960
So, there's two dimensions.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.480
You know, sort of the, there's
the how your business

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.760
works, and there's the
extensibility dimension.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.960
I think what's interesting
is that when you look at

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.420
Wave, you'll see robots,
you'll see gadgets.

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:32.492
You can add things to Wave.

00:33:32.126 --> 00:33:35.174
We're continuing to add
extension points to Gmail.

00:33:35.468 --> 00:33:37.880
You've seen left app extension
points, contextual gadget.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:43.018
You can add gadgets in
other containers to

00:33:43.018 --> 00:33:46.520
calendar, to sites.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.260
So, for example, one of the
developers in the marketplace

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:54.080
is using Google Sites
as a repository for

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:54.620
virtual machines.

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.218
So, you can go and you can
select a virtual machine.

00:33:58.218 --> 00:33:59.098
Is Skybook the name
of this company?

00:33:59.098 --> 00:34:00.640
SCOTT McMULLAN: Skytap.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:00.740
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Thank you.
762
00:34:01,72 --&gt; 00:34:01,66
Skytap.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.200
I want to make sure
Skytap got a shout out.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.320
So, using it as example.

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:09.060
But, you can go to your Google
Site, see all your virtual

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.660
machines, select it, and then
run that VM right

00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:13.298
inside a site.

00:34:13.298 --> 00:34:16.980
So, the notion here is that
we will continue to add more

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:18.818
and more places to extend.

00:34:19.058 --> 00:34:21.358
And, there's lots of
real estate for us.

00:34:21.358 --> 00:34:24.038
We have the document list that
hasn't been extended yet.

00:34:24.978 --> 00:34:28.340
Lot of options within our
spreadsheets program,

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:29.560
we have App Script.

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:32.698
But, there will be more
that will come along.

00:34:32.698 --> 00:34:38.500
So, we want to provide baseline
functionality that helps

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.600
you run your business more
efficiently, and keep your

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.838
data and safe cloud place.

00:34:43.838 --> 00:34:46.780
And, then extend
ideally through third
779
00:34:46,78 --&gt; 00:34:46,5
party development.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.678
So, that's sort
of our approach.

00:34:48.678 --> 00:34:50.978
RYAN BOYD: I'm going to kind
off add to my previous answer.

00:34:50.978 --> 00:34:54.260
This another really good advice
for developers, that we

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.980
actually heard from a lot of
our vendors in the marketplace.

00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:58.520
In partiuclar, you've probably
seen a quote, or you may have

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:01.298
seen a quote from Smartsheet,
where they're really finding

00:35:01.298 --> 00:35:04.238
that their customers demand
this deeper integration.

00:35:04.238 --> 00:35:06.578
Their customers find that
integration with contacts or

00:35:06.578 --> 00:35:09.700
calendar, that sort of thing,
make their applications easier

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.660
to use and more efficient
for their businesses.

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:15.218
So, yes single sign on is like
the minimum bar for the

00:35:15.218 --> 00:35:16.738
marketplace in terms
of integration.

00:35:16.738 --> 00:35:18.378
But, you really want
to go a lot further.

00:35:18.378 --> 00:35:25.458
And, and customers will have
those request for you.

00:35:25.458 --> 00:35:27.658
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Did that
answer your question?

00:35:27.658 --> 00:35:27.818
AUDIENCE: It did, yeah.

00:35:27.818 --> 00:35:28.958
Can I ask a quick follow on?

00:35:28.958 --> 00:35:29.632
Do you

00:35:29.632 --> 00:35:31.858
see yourselves gravitating, or
continuing to gravitate, more

00:35:31.858 --> 00:35:34.978
towards the dashboard analogy,
or more of a construct,

00:35:34.978 --> 00:35:37.188
deconstructed widget approach,
or to take sort of a

00:35:37.188 --> 00:35:42.738
forked path and go both
directions at once?

00:35:42.738 --> 00:35:45.698
DAVID GLAZER: You want to take
a crack at that, because you've

00:35:45.698 --> 00:35:48.958
taught me most of how I think
about that particulars?

00:35:48.958 --> 00:35:50.138
EVAN GILBERT: So, just to
clarify the question.

00:35:50.138 --> 00:35:55.118
Dashboard versus widgets,
more general widgets.

00:35:55.118 --> 00:36:00.260
Yes, so if I choose one or the
more general widgets, we want

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.838
to have what we dow with
Google everywhere.

00:36:02.838 --> 00:36:05.980
And, the way it works isn't
always a dashboard, its work

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:06.858
isn't always a dashboard.

00:36:06.858 --> 00:36:08.398
I think contextual gadgets
inside our gadgets in Gmail

00:36:08.398 --> 00:36:10.698
are a great examples.

00:36:10.818 --> 00:36:13.778
And, we also want to start
finding ways both to bring, you

00:36:13.778 --> 00:36:15.918
know, your app into Google as
well as to bring Google

00:36:15.918 --> 00:36:17.118
into your applications.

00:36:17.118 --> 00:36:18.820
So, I think we'll see more of
that, because it's just too

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:21.100
hard to roll your own
set of UI widgets.

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:24.300
We don't it want everyone
who works at Google build

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:28.998
their own UI widgets.

00:36:28.998 --> 00:36:30.860
SCOTT McMULLAN: I'm curious
about just in general, the

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:35.280
audience in the room, how many
folks are interested in kind of

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.358
building, you know, building
web apps from the ground up for

00:36:38.358 --> 00:36:42.978
their businesses or for their
customers, for the sake of

00:36:42.978 --> 00:36:45.018
having a web application versus
integrating a kind of an

00:36:45.018 --> 00:36:47.878
application layer
on top of that?

00:36:48.978 --> 00:36:52.328
so, application platform at the
Google Apps layer versus kind

00:36:52.328 --> 00:36:57.198
of more classic web platform
and the service, infrastructure

00:36:57.198 --> 00:36:59.718
as a service style.

00:36:59.718 --> 00:37:00.800
Conversations about Google.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:01.806
DAVID GLAZER: Let's try
to to break that into

00:37:01.806 --> 00:37:02.658
a yes or no questions.

00:37:02.658 --> 00:37:02.958
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:02.958 --> 00:37:06.638
SCOTT McMULLAN: Can we have
an open conversation here.

00:37:06.638 --> 00:37:07.638
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:06.638 --> 00:37:09.358
DAVID GLAZER: Three fingers for
"A," and two fingers

00:37:09.358 --> 00:37:14.178
for "B" and -- how
many of you are, you know, one

00:37:14.178 --> 00:37:15.998
of the things that you're
interested in that you're

00:37:15.998 --> 00:37:19.518
thinking about doing over the
next quarter is building an

00:37:19.518 --> 00:37:23.658
application, a web application,
pretty much from scratch using

00:37:23.658 --> 00:37:25.478
platform technology
from Google?

00:37:25.478 --> 00:37:27.440
Whether it be App Engine,
some of our APIs, but just

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.098
building a new application.

00:37:29.098 --> 00:37:30.138
And, you're thinking of
building it on top of

00:37:30.138 --> 00:37:32.400
Google technology.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.840
How many of you are
in that category?

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:38.460
RYAN BOYD: May I ask how many
of you are looking at doing

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:40.998
that for internal usage within
your own company versus --

00:37:40.998 --> 00:37:43.738
yeah, let's break it
to the yes or no.

00:37:43.738 --> 00:37:44.158
Internal usage?

00:37:45.638 --> 00:37:46.078
OK.

00:37:46.078 --> 00:37:48.078
How many of you are trying to
launch that to the whole web

00:37:48.078 --> 00:37:51.178
and get a lot of customers?

00:37:51.178 --> 00:37:51.538
Great.

00:37:51.538 --> 00:37:51.958
Thank you.

00:37:51.958 --> 00:37:53.238
DAVID GLAZER: And, how many of
you are -- well first of all,

00:37:53.238 --> 00:37:56.238
how many of you have an app in
the Google Apps marketplace?

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.218
CHRIS VANDER MAY: See this is
how we do market research.

00:37:59.218 --> 00:38:00.558
SCOTT McMULLAN: Yeah.

00:38:00.558 --> 00:38:02.178
DAVID GLAZER: Keep those
hands up for a second.

00:38:02.178 --> 00:38:04.278
And, how many of you intend
to have an app in the

00:38:04.278 --> 00:38:06.680
marketplace within 6 months?

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:06.702
OK.

00:38:06.702 --> 00:38:07.748
Thank you.

00:38:08.794 --> 00:38:09.816
CHRIS VANDER MAY:

00:38:09.816 --> 00:38:11.462
How many of you would like
to go to dinner later?

00:38:11.664 --> 00:38:13.918
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:13.918 --> 00:38:17.300
RYAN BOYD: And, I definitely
encourage everyone to reach out

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.838
to the vendors that are in the
sandbox if you're thinking

00:38:19.838 --> 00:38:20.760
about building an app
in the marketplace.

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.660
They have a lot of great
experience, and are happy to

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:26.728
talk with you about what
they've done, and the, you

00:38:26.728 --> 00:38:29.498
know, the different challenges
and how they overcame them.

00:38:29.498 --> 00:38:31.938
And, what the great benefit
is of the marketplace.

00:38:31.938 --> 00:38:35.398
DAVID GLAZER: I'm going to make
one obvious observation, just

00:38:35.398 --> 00:38:36.698
from that last pair
of questions.

00:38:36.698 --> 00:38:38.978
But, I think all of you in
the room probably know this,

00:38:38.978 --> 00:38:41.818
but I've gotten asked it
enough mostly by press.

00:38:41.878 --> 00:38:45.478
The two first questions that we
started with about building on

00:38:45.478 --> 00:38:49.800
Google's platform technologies,
and distributing an integrated

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.040
app through the marketplace are
intentionally and by principle

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.100
and design, separate questions.

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:58.200
The marketplace doesn't require
you to use our platform, the

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.938
platform doesn't require you
to use our marketplace.

00:39:00.938 --> 00:39:03.238
We think those are good
areas that should not

00:39:03.238 --> 00:39:03.840
be tied together.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.280
They should work well together.

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:10.538
But, they should not be
required to be tied together.

00:39:10.438 --> 00:39:13.618
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Let
me try one for Scott.

00:39:13.618 --> 00:39:16.698
You've been spending a bunch of
time talking with developers.

00:39:16.698 --> 00:39:19.440
What sort of verticals are
going to be the most

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:24.098
interesting for developers?

00:39:24.098 --> 00:39:26.158
SCOTT McMULLAN: Yeah
profitable ones.

00:39:27.358 --> 00:39:29.798
Right now I'd say that
anything, things that

00:39:29.798 --> 00:39:31.038
are customer facing.

00:39:31.698 --> 00:39:38.698
Things that have been
historically asked of us.

00:39:38.698 --> 00:39:41.458
So, I don't want to use
the word CRM, you know.

00:39:41.458 --> 00:39:43.260
So, CRM, help desk.

00:39:44.078 --> 00:39:46.468
Things that help you interact
with your customers collect

00:39:46.468 --> 00:39:48.098
money and prospects.

00:39:48.098 --> 00:39:51.780
And, that's a pretty broad
category, but those types of

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:53.440
things have been strong folds.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.880
I would say, in addition to a
set of more admin focused

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:01.498
tools, we've got a handful of
vendors who are really working

00:40:01.498 --> 00:40:05.160
with the IT shops, who are
adopting Google Apps, and are

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:08.838
extending our capabilities, you
know, around contacts

00:40:08.838 --> 00:40:11.540
integration, migration,
management.

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:16.078
And, so things that help our
customers get more flexible

00:40:16.078 --> 00:40:20.260
deployments have
also done well.

00:40:20.618 --> 00:40:23.078
DAVID GLAZER: I'll tell you
that if I were, you know, just

00:40:23.078 --> 00:40:25.360
thinking out loud, but if I
were trying to answer that

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:28.460
question for my small company,
and I were looking to do it, I

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:32.980
would look for an opportunity
to some one-off work for some

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:33.720
company whose already
bought Google Apps.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.740
And, I'll go to them and
say, hey, I want to solve a

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:37.160
problem of yours internally.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.590
I want to build a one-off.

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:39.498
I'll try to nail it.

00:40:39.498 --> 00:40:41.118
And, then I'll see
if it generalizes.

00:40:41.638 --> 00:40:43.298
And, that's just where
I would look for it.

00:40:43.298 --> 00:40:48.260
So, you know, some of the apps
that Google's IT Department has

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:51.380
built for our own internal use,
some of those feel like they

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:52.078
probably are generalizable.

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:54.158
And, Google's not going
to generalize them.

00:40:54.158 --> 00:40:57.158
But, somebody else, you
know, very well might.

00:40:57.158 --> 00:40:59.938
And, I would look for those
kinds of things, where you know

00:40:59.938 --> 00:41:04.638
you've nailed somebody's
problem, and then expand.

00:41:04.638 --> 00:41:06.520
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Well, Evan, I
know you spend a non-trivial

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:10.240
amount of time participating
with standards boards,

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.800
and thinking about
things like that.

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:16.520
What standards should we be
paying attention to from the

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:20.178
perspective of things are going
to evolve, we need to let

00:41:20.178 --> 00:41:23.380
developers get more involved in
them, or are they going to be

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.678
more meaningful over
the next two years?

00:41:25.678 --> 00:41:26.378
EVAN GILBERT: Yeah.

00:41:26.378 --> 00:41:27.220
Really good question.

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:30.018
So, the core of working
with the marketplace,

00:41:30.018 --> 00:41:31.118
is [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:41:31.118 --> 00:41:31.498
integration.

00:41:32.678 --> 00:41:35.498
You have to know who the user
is to get anything done.

00:41:35.498 --> 00:41:37.418
And, closely related to
that is calling your APIs.

00:41:37.418 --> 00:41:39.138
So, you need to go call back
into Google, to get access to

00:41:39.138 --> 00:41:41.180
contacts, to get access to
emails to get access

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.578
to documents.

00:41:42.578 --> 00:41:44.478
So, the two technologies,
they are OpenID and OWA.

00:41:44.478 --> 00:41:46.898
And there's actually a
generation of OWA coming out

00:41:46.898 --> 00:41:50.358
right now, OWA 2.0, which would
make your lives a lot easier.

00:41:50.698 --> 00:41:53.038
You know, we have libraries to
hide a lot of the messy details

00:41:53.038 --> 00:41:56.158
that oftentimes these libraries
themselves are not quite as

00:41:56.158 --> 00:41:57.698
polished as they could be.

00:41:57.698 --> 00:42:00.578
So, good stuff is coming
down the pipleline.

00:42:00.578 --> 00:42:03.920
And, also for embedding
into Google, gadgets are

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:04.718
obviously key technology.

00:42:04.718 --> 00:42:07.298
You'll note that all these
are open technologies.

00:42:07.298 --> 00:42:10.740
Basically, we don't like doing
proprietary ways of integrative

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:13.918
with Google, because we think
that's not very hopeful

00:42:13.918 --> 00:42:15.398
to the web at large.

00:42:15.398 --> 00:42:17.118
And, it ends up being
self-defeating, because

00:42:17.118 --> 00:42:20.938
people don't go to
proprietary platforms.

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:23.258
DAVID GLAZER: How many people
here have implemented OpenID

00:42:23.258 --> 00:42:27.698
or OWA into an application?

00:42:27.698 --> 00:42:31.438
How many people could explain
how OpenID or OWA work, whether

00:42:31.438 --> 00:42:33.980
or not you've used it?

00:42:33.158 --> 00:42:34.218
RYAN BOYD: A lot of less hands.

00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:38.878
DAVID GLAZER: That ratio
is not surprising.

00:42:38.558 --> 00:42:42.358
I -- when did I start
using the phrase?

00:42:42.358 --> 00:42:44.238
Probably about 9 months ago.

00:42:44.238 --> 00:42:47.178
I started going to the teams
and say, I want an objective

00:42:47.178 --> 00:42:49.800
auth I can understand.

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.078
And, I said, OK, you don't
have to explain it everybody.

00:42:51.078 --> 00:42:53.300
I want you to explain it to me.

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:57.860
And, they got to me eventually,
but it didn't mean anything,

00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:00.678
because I had 9 months
to be indoctrinated.

00:43:01.518 --> 00:43:04.738
But, m general comment on the
state of those particular

00:43:04.738 --> 00:43:07.138
standards is they have
been too complex.

00:43:07.138 --> 00:43:10.440
That is one of the reasons
that, you know, not every hand

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:11.580
went up, saying I've used it.

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:13.960
It's like if I said, how many
of you have used electricity.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:14.360
Every hand goes up.

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:17.740
That wouldn't have been true
when electricity was as young

00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:19.658
a technology as OWA is.

00:43:19.658 --> 00:43:21.278
RYAN BOYD: I don't think
I'll be alive any longer.

00:43:21.278 --> 00:43:24.038
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:24.038 --> 00:43:28.680
DAVID GLAZER: But, I will say
that OWA 2.0 is actually really

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.480
is threatening to succeed at
auth I can understand and

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:32.884
anyone else can understand in

00:43:32.884 --> 00:43:33.480
the small amount of time.

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:36.980
It ain't there yet,
but, you know, it's

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:37.080
getting pretty close.

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:40.540
And, the basic premise of, hey,
there's locks, there's keys,

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:43.440
OWA 2.0 is a way for your
app to ask for a key.

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.478
And, you can use the
key to open any lock.

00:43:45.478 --> 00:43:46.840
Sounds good.

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:49.140
There's a few details I glossed
over, but it's getting close.

00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:51.800
And, it will be something
next year that you'll all

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:52.238
be able to raise your hand.

00:43:52.238 --> 00:43:53.560
EVAN GILBERT: And,
actually a follow on.

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.218
If you understand cookies, then
you're a long way towards

00:43:55.218 --> 00:43:56.020
understanding OWA 2.0.

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:59.058
RYAN BOYD: So, to plug my
session for tomorrow.

00:43:59.058 --> 00:44:02.218
I'm doing a session with one
of our OAuth engineers,

00:44:02.218 --> 00:44:03.858
Dave Primmer tommorow.

00:44:03.858 --> 00:44:04.598
Whose apparently
in the audience.

00:44:05.538 --> 00:44:05.940
Right there.

00:44:06.518 --> 00:44:11.618
And, we're going to try to
explain OpenID and OWA to you.

00:44:11.618 --> 00:44:13.900
And, we're going to be like
going through some of the

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:15.860
different use cases,
and how they apply.

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:17.340
We're not going deep into the
protocols, But, trying to say

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:20.000
there's all these different
flavors of OpenID and OWA,

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.740
when should you use them.

00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:23.900
That's often been a question
that we've been asked by

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:25.658
the marketplace vendors.

00:44:25.558 --> 00:44:27.818
And, then we're going to go
through like the evolution as

00:44:27.818 --> 00:44:32.580
the process gets easier for
endusers, as each of these

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.820
technologies have been rolled
out in the different flavors.

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:37.238
And, we hope that it
continues to get easier.

00:44:37.238 --> 00:44:38.978
I think there is internet
identity workshop earlier

00:44:38.978 --> 00:44:41.158
this week, where these
standards are evolving.

00:44:41.158 --> 00:44:42.800
I'm sure you can look
up Wiki notes on how

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:46.198
things are going there.

00:44:46.198 --> 00:44:50.538
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Any other
questions from the floor?
1020
00:44:50,538 --&gt; 00:44:50,198
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Alright.

00:44:50.198 --> 00:44:51.280
Oh a prompted one.

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.900
SCOTT McMULLAN: You got to
keep asking that Chris.
1023
00:44:53,9 --&gt; 00:44:53,242
CHRIS VANDER MAY: I know.

00:44:53.312 --> 00:44:54.138
Go for it.

00:44:54.138 --> 00:44:57.618
AUDIENCE: OK, so,
totally non-technical,

00:44:57.618 --> 00:44:59.838
non-strategic question.

00:44:59.838 --> 00:45:05.618
With the growth of Google Apps
for Enterprise, are there plans

00:45:05.618 --> 00:45:09.178
to add an administrator
track to Google I/O?

00:45:10.078 --> 00:45:15.898
Or, perhaps, start an
administrator conference?

00:45:16.058 --> 00:45:19.820
DAVID GLAZER: I see a person in
the audience who would probably

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:21.420
have something to do with
making that happen,

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:21.940
looking thoughtful.

00:45:22.478 --> 00:45:24.900
It's a good idea, I
haven't heard it before.

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:28.058
I think in general, we're
finding that the breadth of

00:45:28.058 --> 00:45:31.900
topics that are covered here is
getting very large, very broad.

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:34.380
And, so there have been
conversations about how to

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:38.738
shard it without losing the
ability for you all to sort of

00:45:38.738 --> 00:45:41.418
cross-pollinate with the things
that aren't your day job.

00:45:41.418 --> 00:45:43.218
So, we're trying to
balance those two.

00:45:43.218 --> 00:45:46.358
But, specifically would be for
administrators of Google Apps

00:45:46.358 --> 00:45:49.458
is the general area that
you think would be worth

00:45:49.458 --> 00:45:50.158
some focused attention.

00:45:50.158 --> 00:46:20.218
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:20.218 --> 00:46:20.374
DAVID GLAZER:

00:46:20.374 --> 00:46:21.400
So, let's do the
market research.

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:24.658
Of the people in this room, not
quite a random sample, how many

00:46:24.658 --> 00:46:27.238
of you would find Google I/O
next year more interesting

00:46:27.238 --> 00:46:31.078
if there were an
administrator track?

00:46:31.078 --> 00:46:31.418
OK.

00:46:31.418 --> 00:46:33.218
SCOTT McMULLAN: Well
considering last year we didn't

00:46:33.218 --> 00:46:36.658
actually have an Enterprise
track at all, I think a

00:46:36.658 --> 00:46:39.080
year is a long time.

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:41.078
I think we should hope
to have that next year.

00:46:41.078 --> 00:46:41.938
CHRIS VANDER MAY: That's
a great suggestion.

00:46:41.938 --> 00:46:42.558
Thank you.

00:46:42.558 --> 00:46:45.998
Anybody else has a suggestion
that you would like to throw

00:46:45.998 --> 00:46:47.358
our way, and watch us wince?

00:46:47.358 --> 00:46:48.898
No, go for it.

00:46:48.558 --> 00:46:49.598
RYAN BOYD: You look
like you have one.

00:46:49.598 --> 00:46:52.558
Can you go to the mic?

00:46:52.558 --> 00:46:54.780
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Should
I walk down the isle and

00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:54.818
do my Jerry Springer?

00:46:54.818 --> 00:47:01.198
AUDIENCE: I'm noticing in the
universal navigation more menu

00:47:01.198 --> 00:47:06.958
now the apps that you installed
are in a determined sort

00:47:06.958 --> 00:47:08.938
order, alphabetical.

00:47:08.938 --> 00:47:10.858
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Isn't that
funny what happens when you

00:47:10.858 --> 00:47:12.460
don't write a requirement?

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:15.498
AUDIENCE: It was reversed
alphabetical for a week or two.

00:47:15.498 --> 00:47:18.178
RYAN BOYD: It was, yeah.

00:47:18.178 --> 00:47:20.678
AUDIENCE: I'd like to have
some control over the

00:47:20.678 --> 00:47:22.478
naming of the apps.

00:47:22.478 --> 00:47:26.740
So, if you installed Acme app.

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:27.432
EVAN GILBERT: Just put
a z in front of it and

00:47:27.432 --> 00:47:29.538
you'll be all set.

00:47:29.538 --> 00:47:31.738
CHRIS VANDER MAY: You're
talking as an administrator.

00:47:31.738 --> 00:47:32.978
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and this
is not to overcome the

00:47:32.978 --> 00:47:33.718
sorting problem so much.

00:47:33.718 --> 00:47:37.974
It's just the branding
of the tool

00:47:37.974 --> 00:47:41.438
that we provide for business
use in the organization.

00:47:42.418 --> 00:47:47.678
We'd like to have some control
over that in the menu list.

00:47:47.678 --> 00:47:48.858
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Thanks
for that suggestion.

00:47:48.858 --> 00:47:49.050
It's a great one.

00:47:49.524 --> 00:47:52.638
It's something that we will
definitely put on the list.

00:47:52.638 --> 00:47:53.780
EVAN GILBERT: I say it's also a
good sign that we should have

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:55.676
enough apps now that people are
using, so that you need

00:47:55.676 --> 00:47:58.238
to sorrt the word
through and through.

00:47:58.238 --> 00:48:02.340
AUDIENCE: This is another kind
of administraty or PE question.

00:48:02.638 --> 00:48:06.500
I know for our domain, we
were using Google Accounts

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:08.478
before Google Apps existed.

00:48:08.478 --> 00:48:13.198
And, for some of us, like my
email address has a Google

00:48:13.198 --> 00:48:16.698
account and a Google Apps
account at the same time.

00:48:16.698 --> 00:48:19.838
And, depending on where I log
in, and the order in which

00:48:19.838 --> 00:48:23.598
I log in, I would receive
vastly different things.

00:48:23.598 --> 00:48:27.340
I have no idea who to ask
for help about this.

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:31.560
But, you guys are
stuck on stage, so --

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:34.078
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Yeah,
we're sorry about that.

00:48:34.078 --> 00:48:36.218
So, this is what Dave was
referring to earlier.

00:48:36.218 --> 00:48:38.818
There's this name space
conflict between

00:48:38.818 --> 00:48:40.780
those two areas.

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:43.380
And, we're working very
hard to resolve that.

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:45.418
So, that this will all
sort of magically work.

00:48:46.958 --> 00:48:50.778
And, you should look at it
magically working soon.

00:48:50.778 --> 00:48:52.680
And, you won't have
to do anything.

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:53.660
DAVID GLAZER: Yeah.

00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:56.720
I will say that we are making
Googlers suffer a lot of

00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:58.460
pain, so we get it right.

00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:00.180
Before, you have to
suffer more pain.

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:03.260
Google has the most of
those conflict accounts

00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:04.720
of any domain out there.

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:05.440
We ran the stats.

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:07.240
We knew this was going
to be a heart problem

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:08.420
and ran the report.

00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:11.270
And, Google.com was far and
away the biggest instance

00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:13.140
of people with those
collision accounts.

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:17.398
And, we found a few ways
not to reconcile them.

00:49:17.398 --> 00:49:21.158
Let's put it that way.

00:49:21.158 --> 00:49:22.478
CHRIS VANDER MAY:
So, we're sorry.

00:49:22.478 --> 00:49:22.966
We're working on it.

00:49:22.966 --> 00:49:25.738
Yes?
1120
00:49:25,738 --&gt; 00:49:25,098
AUDIENCE:

00:49:25.098 --> 00:49:25.280
Hi.

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:28.438
Since we're asking
administrator questions, here's

00:49:28.438 --> 00:49:29.458
a hypothetical for you.

00:49:29.458 --> 00:49:32.720
Let's say that you're an
administrator in Enterprise,

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.140
and you're trying to
evangelize, and you're trying

00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:37.580
to encourage people to move
away from your legacy systems

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:40.258
and onto a more of a
cloud based approach.

00:49:40.258 --> 00:49:45.958
And, from your Enterprise
-- OK, woops there

00:49:45.958 --> 00:49:46.138
goes the hypothetical.

00:49:47.378 --> 00:49:50.058
But, I have, people have been
telling me, the two biggest

00:49:50.058 --> 00:49:53.418
concerns I'm getting from
people are one, they don't

00:49:53.418 --> 00:49:56.238
trust the concept of
cloud completely (i.e.

00:49:56.238 --> 00:49:58.878
I don't trust storing in
someplace that's not, that

00:49:58.878 --> 00:50:00.898
I can't physically touch).

00:50:00.898 --> 00:50:03.618
And, then the second concern
is a privacy concern..

00:50:03.618 --> 00:50:06.998
You know, where, I don't trust
a third company to have access

00:50:06.998 --> 00:50:09.878
to my data, even though
they said they're not

00:50:09.878 --> 00:50:12.698
going to touch it.

00:50:12.698 --> 00:50:15.278
And, I'm sure you've come
across these questions before.

00:50:16.018 --> 00:50:19.358
How would you, what will be the
best way to explain and ease

00:50:19.358 --> 00:50:22.658
those concerns to someone, who
to say is non-technical,

00:50:22.658 --> 00:50:25.338
but signs checks.

00:50:25.338 --> 00:50:28.798
DAVID GLAZER: So, the advice I
would give your friend, who

00:50:28.798 --> 00:50:30.278
hypothetically -- [LAUGHTER].

00:50:30.878 --> 00:50:33.498
The first thing I'd say is
those are very legitimate

00:50:33.498 --> 00:50:36.498
concerns, those are the right
questions that we all should

00:50:36.498 --> 00:50:39.758
you, know, be asking even
when we forget to ask them.

00:50:39.758 --> 00:50:42.520
Because, you know, the
exosure is very real.

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:45.718
The hypothetical risk is there.

00:50:45.718 --> 00:50:48.518
So, you know, although it's
tempting for us here to make

00:50:48.518 --> 00:50:52.658
fun of those concerns -- I find
it tempting sometimes when I'm

00:50:52.658 --> 00:50:54.338
impatient -- that's
the wrong answer.

00:50:54.338 --> 00:50:54.638
Right?

00:50:54.638 --> 00:50:56.698
Those are legitimate concerns.

00:50:56.698 --> 00:50:59.560
I usually do by analogy
is how I start.

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:05.858
And, my preferred analogy to
start with is -- so what you're

00:51:05.858 --> 00:51:07.658
telling me is you don't
have a bank account.

00:51:07.658 --> 00:51:09.378
And, you keep your money under
your mattress, because you

00:51:09.378 --> 00:51:12.178
don't trust someone else to
manage information that's

00:51:12.178 --> 00:51:15.318
important to you, and that you
would worry about it being

00:51:15.318 --> 00:51:18.118
exposed to the rest
of the world.

00:51:18.118 --> 00:51:21.078
And, 60 years ago, 70 years
ago, that would have been a

00:51:21.078 --> 00:51:23.898
legitimate topic
of conversation.
1164
00:51:23,898 --&gt; 00:51:23,158
Right?

00:51:23.158 --> 00:51:26.278
It's like is it safer to
keep my money under my

00:51:26.278 --> 00:51:27.418
mattress, or in a bank.

00:51:27.418 --> 00:51:30.198
You know, maybe 100 years
ago, right, to get --

00:51:30.198 --> 00:51:31.278
EVAN GILBERT: Years
from now mail.

00:51:31.278 --> 00:51:33.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:36.498
DAVID GLAZER: But, that's a
place where over time the

00:51:36.498 --> 00:51:40.738
standards, the habits, and
the level of trust and the

00:51:40.738 --> 00:51:45.800
practices that made that
trust worthy have grown.

00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:50.738
And, now it is obviously more
secure and more say to keep my

00:51:50.738 --> 00:51:54.218
money in a bank, than it is
with a third party, with many

00:51:54.218 --> 00:51:56.098
third parties, than it is to
keep it under my mattress.

00:51:58.018 --> 00:52:01.718
And, I think that trend is
happening in many, many

00:52:01.718 --> 00:52:02.800
areas of our lives.

00:52:03.098 --> 00:52:03.398
Right.

00:52:03.398 --> 00:52:08.218
You know, the slightly tired
one now, but about the same

00:52:08.218 --> 00:52:11.080
time frame one from Nicholas
Carr's book, The Big Switch is.

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:13.120
So, you obviously have your
own generator, because you

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:15.740
don't trust the third party
to provide your power.

00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:16.040
Right.

00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:18.880
That doesn't quite hit the
privacy concerns, but it does

00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:20.960
hit some of the same ones.

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:24.380
And, I think that reasoning by
analogy to say, hey, it's a

00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:25.980
very legitimate question.

00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:29.958
But it's a question of when in
this case, with this third

00:52:29.958 --> 00:52:32.838
party, for this data,
it's a good deal.

00:52:32.838 --> 00:52:35.880
And, the answer more and
more is it is a good deal.

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:39.558
And, then my last answer which,
depending who I'm talking

00:52:39.558 --> 00:52:40.638
to, is very useful.

00:52:40.178 --> 00:52:43.158
I've had this conversation with
my wife, and my daughter's

00:52:43.158 --> 00:52:44.738
school is a customer
of Google Apps.

00:52:44.738 --> 00:52:46.038
And, so you know, I've
had it with people

00:52:46.038 --> 00:52:47.498
who aren't technical.

00:52:47.738 --> 00:52:52.978
My last answer is we at Google
do not do anything that's not

00:52:52.978 --> 00:52:56.418
available to you all, as Google
Apps users, to secure

00:52:56.418 --> 00:52:57.498
our Google Apps data.

00:52:57.498 --> 00:53:01.778
We keep all of our
announcements, all of our

00:53:01.778 --> 00:53:04.078
product plans, all of our
competitive information,

00:53:04.078 --> 00:53:05.380
you know, all of that.

00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:09.540
All of that's exchanged by
Gmail, you know, all of that

00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:11.280
is in Google Docs, all
of the presentations.

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:14.000
And, they're secured with
the same mechanisms that

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:17.158
we offer to all of you.

00:53:17.158 --> 00:53:17.978
CHRIS VANDER MAY: I think
there's one other dimension

00:53:17.978 --> 00:53:21.898
there too that I'll add to
this, which is that, you know,

00:53:21.898 --> 00:53:26.040
as developers you have the same
problems that Google does in

00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:27.420
terms of selling Google Apps.

00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:29.400
We have to address
these same issues.

00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:31.780
So as you go to cloud
services, you have to

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:32.398
address these same issues.

00:53:32.458 --> 00:53:36.098
So, I think David's answers are
good, but you may need to start

00:53:36.098 --> 00:53:38.478
looking at ways in which
you can validate the

00:53:38.478 --> 00:53:39.458
strength of your bank.

00:53:40.538 --> 00:53:43.340
We went through, we did
SAS 70 Type I and Type

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:44.900
II certification.

00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:47.780
Type II is where you get
somebody from a third party to

00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:52.638
come and say did you do Type
I, and then they say, yes.

00:53:52.638 --> 00:53:53.998
So, it's valuable.

00:53:54.998 --> 00:53:57.938
But, obviously, we did have a
third party come in and look

00:53:57.938 --> 00:53:59.238
at the way in which we
maintained passwords.

00:53:59.238 --> 00:54:03.438
And, which, you know, just show
that data is obfuscated at

00:54:03.438 --> 00:54:04.218
rest and things like that.

00:54:04.218 --> 00:54:08.960
So, really paying attention to
best practices, and insecurity,

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:12.040
and all those things are
certainly paramount.

00:54:13.898 --> 00:54:15.478
EVAN GILBERT: And, actually
some obvious ones from the

00:54:15.478 --> 00:54:16.738
security question before, even.

00:54:16.398 --> 00:54:18.438
Keep your secret, very secret.

00:54:18.438 --> 00:54:20.218
Make sure no one gets
access to them.

00:54:20.198 --> 00:54:23.178
Log access to data, so you
know who's talking to what.

00:54:23.518 --> 00:54:25.998
And, try to only give
data out when people are

00:54:25.998 --> 00:54:26.498
online at their computer.

00:54:26.498 --> 00:54:29.398
That's something we're doing at
Google a lot more now, is

00:54:29.398 --> 00:54:31.368
saying if you don't have an
active login session from a

00:54:31.368 --> 00:54:34.640
user who's been there with
OpenID in the last x minutes,

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:37.118
then you shouldn't have access
to data unless you have this

00:54:37.118 --> 00:54:39.238
super duper master key,which
is hidden away and

00:54:39.238 --> 00:54:39.438
locked in a safe.

00:54:41.818 --> 00:54:42.438
CHRIS VANDER MAY: No
more sticky notes.

00:54:42.438 --> 00:54:42.678
OK. next.

00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:46.778
AUDIENCE: So as a follow on to
that, there's some environments

00:54:46.778 --> 00:54:51.178
where -- I work in the defense
and intelligence space, and

00:54:51.178 --> 00:54:51.918
that can't go to the
public cloud right?

00:54:51.918 --> 00:54:53.438
I have to do in internalizing.

00:54:53.438 --> 00:54:59.498
Are you guys thinking about
offering these platforms in a,

00:54:59.498 --> 00:55:01.898
you know, in a way we can bring
it in inside the firewall?

00:55:04.918 --> 00:55:07.620
CHRIS VANDER MAY: We are
intentionally not deploying

00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:11.638
Google Apps onto small hardware
devices and things like that.

00:55:11.638 --> 00:55:13.658
Because, that is not the cloud.

00:55:14.578 --> 00:55:17.728
We don't get the same economies
of scale that we do when we get

00:55:17.728 --> 00:55:19.058
to replicate data across three
different data centers,

00:55:19.058 --> 00:55:21.518
you know, in real time.

00:55:22.758 --> 00:55:27.158
However, you know, when you
look at the Feds, now defense

00:55:27.158 --> 00:55:30.918
is probably a different deal,
you know, or you lok at

00:55:30.918 --> 00:55:34.320
healthcare, some information
like HIPAA data, is very,

00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:34.740
very special data.

00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:36.840
And, it needs to be
treated differently.

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.600
And, you know, you just
shouldn't ever send that

00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:40.600
information in email periods.

00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:43.020
It does not matter who
your cloud provider is.

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:45.678
You just should not be
sending HIPAA data out.

00:55:45.678 --> 00:55:49.718
So, you know, similarly there
are additional requirements by

00:55:49.718 --> 00:55:51.800
the federal government, to do
things like make sure there

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:54.840
are very specific kinds
of background checks.

00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:57.678
All of us went through
background checks beore we got

00:55:57.678 --> 00:55:59.678
hired at Google, as did all the
people that run our servers.

00:55:59.678 --> 00:56:02.540
But, there are some very
specific types of background

00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:05.220
checks that you have to go
through if you hold

00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:09.558
defense data, as you
probably are aware.

00:56:09.858 --> 00:56:12.918
So, you know, those types of
issues, I think are going to

00:56:12.918 --> 00:56:14.360
get -- my hope is that actually
they get ironed out a

00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:15.980
little bit more overtime.

00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:21.488
And, we see, you know, the
government able to move more,

00:56:21.488 --> 00:56:22.738
and more to the cloud.

00:56:22.738 --> 00:56:26.698
You know, I think it's a
great opportunity actually.

00:56:26.698 --> 00:56:28.038
EVAN GILBERT: Yeah, it's also
worth noting that one of our

00:56:28.038 --> 00:56:31.764
goals is not to force you to
move all of you data into the

00:56:31.764 --> 00:56:32.658
cloud in order to get
value out of Google.

00:56:32.658 --> 00:56:35.478
So, you know, you use your
email with Google but continue

00:56:35.478 --> 00:56:38.820
to keep your privacy sensitive
data, even behind your

00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:41.560
firewall, and connect with SCC
to it, and variations of that.

00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:43.040
You can keep your data stored
in a separate system with

00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.420
its own privacy guarantees.

00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:47.178
And, use Google for login
if you want to, or not

00:56:47.178 --> 00:56:48.246
use Google for login.

00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:51.124
So, there are many ways you can
combine something that has

00:56:51.124 --> 00:56:54.678
different security guidelines
with what you do with Google.

00:56:54.678 --> 00:56:57.638
AUDIENCE: You know, I
guess, if you don't mind.

00:56:57.638 --> 00:56:59.618
So, a scenario I have in my --
you're right, I think, you

00:56:59.618 --> 00:57:01.978
know, federal civilian agencies
are going towards

00:57:01.978 --> 00:57:02.118
the public cloud.

00:57:02.118 --> 00:57:03.840
Staff getting more
comfortable with that.

00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:06.740
Defense, hopefully,
might follow on, start

00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:07.858
considering more.

00:57:07.858 --> 00:57:10.018
But, in some spaces, we have
environments that don't have

00:57:10.018 --> 00:57:11.638
internet connectivity, let's
say, but we've got multiple

00:57:11.638 --> 00:57:15.158
data set, we've got private
clouds going on, but they want

00:57:15.158 --> 00:57:17.138
this kind of functionality.

00:57:17.138 --> 00:57:18.840
So, I'm guessing
the answer's no.

00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:20.178
CHRIS VANDER MAY: It's
really not on our road map.

00:57:20.598 --> 00:57:23.918
I mean, there are things that
we're really, really good at,

00:57:23.918 --> 00:57:24.718
building data centers
is one of them.

00:57:25.218 --> 00:57:29.478
And, you know, we do deploy
Google search appliance, which

00:57:29.478 --> 00:57:31.480
can run behind your firewall.

00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:34.418
But, that's a very different
subset of technology.

00:57:34.418 --> 00:57:35.618
AUDIENCE: Alright.

00:57:34.418 --> 00:57:35.418
Thank you.

00:57:36.418 --> 00:57:37.418
AUDIENCE:

00:57:37.418 --> 00:57:38.380
Also, on the same topic.

00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:42.320
I'm actually out of D.C., and
my former life, at those

00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:43.860
background checks, and
many government clients.

00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:48.600
But, in my new life, I watched
yesterday with our gadget,

00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:52.640
WayFind and then Two Clicks,
we had two-legged O-auth to

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:52.738
all of the people's email.

00:57:53.578 --> 00:57:56.478
And, not to say they were not
doing all the right things for

00:57:56.478 --> 00:57:58.218
that, but it's a scary thought.

00:57:58.378 --> 00:58:00.318
That, in Two Clicks, you
know, everything is there.

00:58:00.578 --> 00:58:02.642
You guys are doing all the
right stuff, but our little

00:58:02.642 --> 00:58:04.298
startup is doing all
the right things.

00:58:04.298 --> 00:58:09.658
And, I would consider -- and I
brought up in the panel of four

00:58:09.658 --> 00:58:13.220
with Ryan and Steve about,
you know, certain people

00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:14.260
having access to it as
opposed to everybody.

00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:17.338
Like for example, I actually
ask client that were work with

00:58:17.338 --> 00:58:20.458
that I know are testing apps at
their companies, and they

00:58:20.458 --> 00:58:22.438
might have 100,000 users.

00:58:22.438 --> 00:58:24.758
But, you know, if they're
installing a gadget, wouldn't

00:58:24.758 --> 00:58:28.938
it be nice if 1 person could
try it out or 5, as opposed to

00:58:28.938 --> 00:58:29.898
everybody, or even
just a few people.

00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:33.858
But, not from their practical,
like should I pay for 50 users

00:58:33.858 --> 00:58:36.880
perspective, more from the like
is this legit, do I trust

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.458
this kind of perspective.

00:58:38.458 --> 00:58:41.118
And, also in the apps set up
itself, in terms of in the

00:58:41.118 --> 00:58:44.260
marketplace, things that relate
to security that go beyond

00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:47.058
just, you know, their
privacy policy.

00:58:47.058 --> 00:58:49.218
I was just curious if you're
planning on moving in

00:58:49.218 --> 00:58:50.798
that direction at all.

00:58:50.798 --> 00:58:51.318
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Yes.

00:58:51.798 --> 00:58:52.840
Very strongly.

00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:55.540
We're planning a whole bunch
of things in that area.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.000
We would really like to lead
the industry in this space.

00:58:59.878 --> 00:59:01.978
You know, we recognize that as
more and more of data is stored

00:59:01.978 --> 00:59:06.898
in the cloud, you need to be
able to allow people to get

00:59:06.898 --> 00:59:10.058
access to it, manipulate it, or
allow those applications to

00:59:10.058 --> 00:59:13.360
only touch objects that
they create, and so forth.

00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:15.598
Or, as Evan was pointing,
only touch them when

00:59:15.598 --> 00:59:16.338
you're in session.

00:59:16.338 --> 00:59:18.858
So, these types of things
are very, very, very

00:59:18.858 --> 00:59:19.678
important to us.

00:59:19.678 --> 00:59:25.638
And, we've got a bunch
of stuff in the works.

00:59:25.638 --> 00:59:26.760
And, we're almost out of time.

00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:29.578
So, we've got 40 seconds.

00:59:29.578 --> 00:59:31.078
We can let you go early.

00:59:31.078 --> 00:59:31.798
EVAN GILBERT: Speed round.

00:59:31.798 --> 00:59:33.598
CHRIS VANDER MAY: Or, we
can do a speed round.

00:59:33.598 --> 00:59:37.318
I once saw Michael Moore do a
speed round, it was amazing.

00:59:37.318 --> 00:59:39.318
Well thank you for coming
today, I really appreciate it.

00:59:39.318 --> 00:59:42.018
Thank you to my panel Evan, and
David, and Scott, and Ryan.

00:59:43.258 --> 00:59:44.738
And, enjoy the rest
of Google I/O.

00:59:44.738 --> 00:59:45.838
Have fun.
