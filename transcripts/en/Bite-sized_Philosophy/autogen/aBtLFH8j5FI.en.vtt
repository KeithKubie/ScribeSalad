proper sacrifices you might fail that's
why I like the ambiguity in the story of

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850
why I like the ambiguity in the story of
 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.730
why I like the ambiguity in the story of
Cain and Abel because we're never really

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740
Cain and Abel because we're never really
 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.100
Cain and Abel because we're never really
told why God rejects Cain's offerings

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110
told why God rejects Cain's offerings
 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.960
told why God rejects Cain's offerings
there's hints that Cain maybe isn't

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970
there's hints that Cain maybe isn't
 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.880
there's hints that Cain maybe isn't
doing as good a job as he should and he

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890
doing as good a job as he should and he
 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.380
doing as good a job as he should and he
certainly gets bitter about it but

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390
certainly gets bitter about it but
 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.050
certainly gets bitter about it but
there's no smoking pistol it doesn't say

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060
there's no smoking pistol it doesn't say
 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.090
there's no smoking pistol it doesn't say
well Cain is a bad guy he made terrible

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100
well Cain is a bad guy he made terrible
 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.490
well Cain is a bad guy he made terrible
sacrifices so God rejected him you never

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500
sacrifices so God rejected him you never

know Cain might have been working pretty

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330
know Cain might have been working pretty
 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.940

damn hard and things still didn't work

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950
damn hard and things still didn't work
 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.770

out for him and I think that ambiguity

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780
out for him and I think that ambiguity
 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.110
out for him and I think that ambiguity
is appropriate in the story because that

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120
is appropriate in the story because that
 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.260
is appropriate in the story because that
ambiguity ambiguity is in life if you do

you could quit and so that means that

you could quit and so that means that

psychologist we we have this notion of

psychologist we we have this notion of
 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.120

the transcendent ideal right that seems
 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.159
the transcendent ideal right that seems
to be pervasive across cultures well

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169
to be pervasive across cultures well
 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:46.300
to be pervasive across cultures well
maybe that's the ultimate manifestation

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310
maybe that's the ultimate manifestation
 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.000
maybe that's the ultimate manifestation
of the human proclivity to be able to

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010
of the human proclivity to be able to
 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.190
of the human proclivity to be able to
posit an ideal at all and to move

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200
posit an ideal at all and to move
 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.070
posit an ideal at all and to move
forward you pause an ideal okay that you

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080
forward you pause an ideal okay that you
 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.810
forward you pause an ideal okay that you
need that to move forward well if you

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820
need that to move forward well if you
 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.909
need that to move forward well if you
can posit an ideal why can't you pause

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919
can posit an ideal why can't you pause
 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.159
can posit an ideal why can't you pause
it the ultimate ideal well if you can

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169
it the ultimate ideal well if you can

then instantly you've got a religious

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820
then instantly you've got a religious
 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.510
then instantly you've got a religious
sensibility instantly and so maybe

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520
sensibility instantly and so maybe

that's the kind of puzzle like as a

that's the kind of puzzle like as a

that's the kind of puzzle like as a
biologist what the hell is the basis of

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.510
biologist what the hell is the basis of
 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.080
biologist what the hell is the basis of
the religious instinct because the idea

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090
the religious instinct because the idea
 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.210
the religious instinct because the idea
that it's mere superstition like we can

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220
that it's mere superstition like we can
 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.279
that it's mere superstition like we can
just dispense with that that's wrong

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289
just dispense with that that's wrong
 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:17.650
just dispense with that that's wrong
it's a human Universal you can evoke

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:17.660
it's a human Universal you can evoke
 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.450
it's a human Universal you can evoke
religious experiences all sorts of ways

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460
religious experiences all sorts of ways
 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.520
religious experiences all sorts of ways
so we're not going to play that game

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530
so we're not going to play that game
 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.170
so we're not going to play that game
there's there's some reason that that

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180
there's there's some reason that that
 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.020
there's there's some reason that that
instinct exists and the first thing to

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.030
instinct exists and the first thing to
 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.640
instinct exists and the first thing to
do with it is to try to reduce it to

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650
do with it is to try to reduce it to
 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.800
do with it is to try to reduce it to
something that's biological and leave it

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810
something that's biological and leave it
 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.659
something that's biological and leave it
at that not to mess with the metaphysics

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:31.669
at that not to mess with the metaphysics
 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:33.279
at that not to mess with the metaphysics
but it certainly could be the case that

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:33.289
but it certainly could be the case that
 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:35.560
but it certainly could be the case that
it's the ultimate extension of our

it's the ultimate extension of our
 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.170
it's the ultimate extension of our
capacity to posit an ideal and we also

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180
capacity to posit an ideal and we also
 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.370

might say well that's good enough

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380
might say well that's good enough
 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.290
might say well that's good enough
because

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300
because
 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.300
because
well the ideal moves you forward it

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.310
well the ideal moves you forward it
 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.740
well the ideal moves you forward it
fills your life with meaning there's no

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:44.750
fills your life with meaning there's no
 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.540
fills your life with meaning there's no
doubt about that because it is in the

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550
doubt about that because it is in the
 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.100
doubt about that because it is in the
movement towards your ideal that life's

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110
movement towards your ideal that life's
 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.130
movement towards your ideal that life's
meaning is to be attained and then the

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:51.140
meaning is to be attained and then the
 

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.780
meaning is to be attained and then the
question is well how much meaning is

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:52.790
question is well how much meaning is
 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.580
question is well how much meaning is
there in moving forward towards an

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:54.590
there in moving forward towards an
 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.560
there in moving forward towards an
ultimate ideal well more meaning even

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:56.570
ultimate ideal well more meaning even
 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.820
ultimate ideal well more meaning even
though it's more difficult how much well

00:06:59.820 --> 00:06:59.830
though it's more difficult how much well
 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.910
though it's more difficult how much well
that's the open question
