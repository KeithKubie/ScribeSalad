00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.920
Lithium ion batteries changed our world by
delivering us hours of energy in a small lightweight

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.920
package.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.389
But ya know what, my phone battery only lasts
a day and THAT’S NOT ENOUGH!

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:13.059
I NEED MORE!!!

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.800
Luckily, scientists are already on it, and
have been working for decades on a new battery

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.750
design that could could last up to 8 times
longer, leaving lithium in the dust.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.640
Introducing: Fluoride batteries!!

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.280
Okay, before you yell at me in the comments-
NO these aren’t ready yet.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.600
You’re not going to be able to watch this
video and then buy a fluoride battery online.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.379
Science is slow, everything takes time, BUT
this is a huge exciting breakthrough and I

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:36.969
have the right to be excited.

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:42.039
First, a quick vocab breakdown: Fluoride is
the negative ion of the element fluorine,

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:46.930
that’s also why compounds containing fluorine
(like the sodium fluoride in toothpaste) are

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.410
called fluorides.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.100
Fluoride batteries have been of interest since
the 1970s when researchers first started experimenting

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.730
with the material in solid state designs.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.909
And though the tests only worked under extremely
high temperatures, fluoride held their interest

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.680
due to its capacity to create a battery with
a high energy density- it could store more

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.920
charge in the same amount of space.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.960
A typical lithium-ion battery has 3 parts.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.700
An anode and a cathode separated by an electrolyte.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.590
As the battery discharges, positive lithium
ions flow from the anode, across the electrolyte,

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.350
into the cathode.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.500
This leaves free electrons in the anode that
create your current.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.549
When you charge your lithium battery, the
reverse happens- ions in the cathode flow

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.289
back into the anode.

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.259
Fluoride batteries work a little differently.

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.909
Instead of relying on the transfer of positive
lithium ions, fluoride batteries use negative

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.170
fluoride ions to generate their current.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.950
The reason these batteries have such a high
energy density comes down to the molecular

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.590
structure of metal fluorides.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.929
In a metal fluoride, the ratio of fluorine
atoms to metal atoms is high.

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:53.539
For example in copper fluoride, two fluorine
atoms are combined with just one copper atom.

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.880
That means for every copper atom, you get
two fluoride ions that can move 2 electrons.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.060
In a typical lithium battery, however, you
only get 1 lithium atom for every two oxygens

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.439
1 cobalt.

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:10.619
That means for every two oxygen atoms and
1 cobalt atom there’s only one lithium ion,

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.110
that can only move 1 electron.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.030
The copper fluoride gives you more ions that
can move more electrons-- and does it without

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.819
increasing overall mass.

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.430
That means batteries of the same weight can
hold more charge, aaaand last up to 8 times

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.430
longer.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.850
On top of improved energy density, replacing
lithium with fluoride might also makes these

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.370
batteries less likely to overheat.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.120
Some scientists also say the materials needed
to make a fluoride battery could be more environmentally

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.760
friendly to harvest than the lithium and cobalt
we currently use.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.580
But all of these great benefits rest on us
being able to get fluoride batteries to work,

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.230
and until this latest breakthrough- we could
only really do that with solid electrolytes

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.390
that functioned upwards of 150 degrees celsius.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.150
Now though, scientists NASA, Caltech, and
Honda have developed a new flouride-conducting

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.400
liquid electrolyte that functions at room
temperature.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.819
They paired it with a copper lanthanum trifluoride
cathode and a metal anode, and created a prototype

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.209
fluoride battery that discharged-- and recharged(!!)-
at room temperature.

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.489
It’s a big deal, y’all.

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.620
Buuut now for the reason why you can’t buy
them yet.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.439
This concept proved room temperature fluoride
batteries are possible, but they’ll still

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:25.019
need to be tinkered with and streamlined to
get that super high energy density they promise.

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.100
There are also some other complications that
need to be worked out, like the fact that

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.519
a complicated coating is required so the electrolyte
doesn’t literally dissolve the metal electrode.

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:40.310
All of that aside, it is a HUGE step towards
a functional, scalable fluoride battery.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.890
And while it will take time to work out the
kinks, this could be the start of a whole

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.590
new era for energy storage- and I for one
am *HERE *FOR*IT*!

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.769
