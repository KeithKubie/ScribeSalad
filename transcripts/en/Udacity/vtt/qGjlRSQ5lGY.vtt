00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.310
So why do we care about a variation

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.520
in a protein or enzyme called Tyrosinase? With Tyrosinase

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.730
is the rate limiting step in the production

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.390
of melanin. There are many steps to making the

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.330
pigment in melanin. And some of the first

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.030
are converting a molecule called Tyrosine. Actually Tyrosine, the

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.260
very amino acid we've learned about and is

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.340
in our amino acid alphabet, into another molecule called

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.830
dopa, and from dopa into dopaquinone. Tyrosinase

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.320
performs this function, but it's pretty slow,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.555
actually. Compared to all the other steps you need to get melanin. This is the

00:00:35.555 --> 00:00:38.350
part that takes the longest. So this

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.630
single nucleotide variation up here. The cytosine to

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.610
an adenine. The change in amino acid

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.250
from serine to tyrosine, ironically enough, causes, right,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.875
that's a missense mutation now. Which causes Tyrosinase to work 40 to

00:00:55.875 --> 00:01:01.360
50% slower than it normally does. So if this is true

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.740
we would expect to see a decrease in overall melanin because we're going to make

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.560
it a lot slower. If we have less melanin

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.800
we're going to have lighter skin. If we have lighter skin,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.650
we're going to have UV rays that are able to

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.520
get into the cells. So that they can simulate vitamin

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.700
D production. So this particular mutation will give

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.470
you lighter skin. Where as this sequence promotes darker

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.450
skin. Now there are actually several other genes

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.425
that affect skin pigmentation and they all have multiple

00:01:28.425 --> 00:01:31.380
alleles that explain all kinds of intermediate pigmentation

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.420
as well as red haired individuals. But this is

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.260
just one example of how a single nucleotide

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.790
variation in the coding region, causing a missense mutation

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.610
from a Serine to Tyrosine, slows the enzymes

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.830
function by 40 or 50%, allowing for less

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.670
pigment in the skin, thus letting more sunlight

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.540
in. To produce vitamin D. Of course the

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.890
flip side of this is the more sunlight you let in the more risk you are

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.590
for DNA damage. And that's why light-skinned people

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.980
when they're in really UV intense regions are much

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.470
higher risk for skin cancer than dark pigmented people. Let's go talk to

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.633
somebody who knows quite a bit about living in hot, UV rich equatorial regions.
