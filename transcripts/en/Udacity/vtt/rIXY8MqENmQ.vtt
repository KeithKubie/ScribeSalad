00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.318
Thinking back to what I just said about rational numbers and rational

00:00:03.318 --> 00:00:07.023
expressions, especially in relation to the denominator, what number is x not

00:00:07.023 --> 00:00:10.840
allowed to equal in this particular inequality? Again, this doesn't have to do

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.818
with the actual solutions. Stating this answer doesn't require actually figuring

00:00:14.818 --> 00:00:18.494
out the solution to this question. I am merely asking you, right off the bat,

00:00:18.494 --> 00:00:20.743
what can we say that x is not allowed to equal?
