00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.940
Dear gentlemen, Science has a confession.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.300
Your life actually began as a female.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.180
Well, phenotypically or physically speaking that is,

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.120
though some prefer to call this stage gender neutral.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.420
As you might know,

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.999
two people mate, they each combine half of their
genetic information together;

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:19.449
23 chromosomes each. One pair of these
chromosomes helps to determine your sex.

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.920
If you're female you contain two X
chromosomes one from your mother and one

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.730
from your father

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.900
while males have one X and one Y
chromosome. At the moment of conception

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.420
you were of course male or female based
on your jeans

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.530
but the Y chromosome doesn't kick in
right away. In fact, the first five to six

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.149
weeks of embryonic development are
attributed to the X chromosome alone

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.610
and females grow from embryo to fully
developed to the influence of

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.629
only the X chromosome. So what does the Y
chromosome do?

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.640
Once activated, one of the genes on the Y
chromosome

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.230
known as the SRY gene has two functions:
to inhibit certain features of the X

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.870
chromosome

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.379
and to impose through dominance the
physiological traits that a male must

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:56.899
have.

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.469
The ovaries descend and become the testes
and the labia fuses to create the scrotum.

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.700
If you're a male, take a look. Though it's
more pronounced in some and then

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.240
others, you'll likely notice a line or
ridge of tissue on the scrotum

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.420
which is called the 'scrotal raphe'. The
skin of the scrotum and penis

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.280
are zipped up like a zipper as the
layers of cells develop in the embryo.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.170
And the mail variant of the clitoris?

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.210
Yep, that's the penis. If the Y chromosome
does not become activated for some

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.650
reason

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.540
then the female phenotype or physical
appearance will persist in a male.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.659
Power added, this is also part of the
reason males have nipples.

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.720
The nipples form before the activation
of the Y chromosome

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.040
and SRY gene and thus remain through
development and life.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.759
But, you don't develop breasts. Sorry. Got a
burning question you want answered?
