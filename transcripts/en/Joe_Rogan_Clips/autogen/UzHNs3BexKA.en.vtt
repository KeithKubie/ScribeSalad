what I mean really come on what is it
most likely there was interaction

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080
most likely there was interaction
 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.320
most likely there was interaction
between human beings and something

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330
between human beings and something
 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.689
between human beings and something
called the Gigantopithecus for thousands

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699
called the Gigantopithecus for thousands
 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.460
called the Gigantopithecus for thousands
and thousands of years it's a giant

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470
and thousands of years it's a giant
 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.280
and thousands of years it's a giant
bipedal hominid that existed in Asia

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290
bipedal hominid that existed in Asia
 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.860
bipedal hominid that existed in Asia
that was between eight and ten feet tall

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870
that was between eight and ten feet tall
 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.380
that was between eight and ten feet tall
it was real and it was basically in like

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390
it was real and it was basically in like
 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.180
it was real and it was basically in like
the orangutan family it looks almost

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190
the orangutan family it looks almost
 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.639
the orangutan family it looks almost
orangutan like but enormous and that was

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649
orangutan like but enormous and that was
 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.200
orangutan like but enormous and that was
a real thing okay and they didn't find

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210
a real thing okay and they didn't find
 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.270
a real thing okay and they didn't find
out about this until like the 1920s they

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280
out about this until like the 1920s they
 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.639
out about this until like the 1920s they
found a tooth in an apothecary shop in

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649
found a tooth in an apothecary shop in
 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.700
found a tooth in an apothecary shop in
China and an anthropologist examined

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710
China and an anthropologist examined
 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.900
China and an anthropologist examined
this tooth it was like where the fuck

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910
this tooth it was like where the fuck
 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.060
this tooth it was like where the fuck
did you get this and they they took them

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070
did you get this and they they took them
 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.560
did you get this and they they took them
to the site and they dug up more things

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570
to the site and they dug up more things
 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.689
to the site and they dug up more things
and bones and jaw bones and they

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699
and bones and jaw bones and they
 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.639
and bones and jaw bones and they
determined from the jawbone I'm sorry if

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649
determined from the jawbone I'm sorry if
 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.740
determined from the jawbone I'm sorry if
I'm fucking this up scientists but they

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750
I'm fucking this up scientists but they
 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.119
I'm fucking this up scientists but they
determined from the jawbone that they

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129
determined from the jawbone that they
 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.890
determined from the jawbone that they
think it was bipedal that it stood up on

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900
think it was bipedal that it stood up on
 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.010
think it was bipedal that it stood up on
two legs and so then they said well how

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020
two legs and so then they said well how
 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.810
two legs and so then they said well how
big would this thing be and then in the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820
big would this thing be and then in the
 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.460
big would this thing be and then in the
proportionate yeah I like the feel about

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470
proportionate yeah I like the feel about
 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.170
proportionate yeah I like the feel about
you've seen what one a real one looks

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180
you've seen what one a real one looks
 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.450
you've seen what one a real one looks
like yeah I just sometimes I when they

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460
like yeah I just sometimes I when they
 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.219
like yeah I just sometimes I when they
say like Oh up in Michigan I'm like is

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229
say like Oh up in Michigan I'm like is
 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.510
say like Oh up in Michigan I'm like is
it really like what are they seeing

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
it really like what are they seeing
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.480
it really like what are they seeing
bullshit most of the people seeing

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490
bullshit most of the people seeing
 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.460
bullshit most of the people seeing
shadows and the trees they want to

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470
shadows and the trees they want to
 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.990

believe it's Bigfoot there's some bears

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000
believe it's Bigfoot there's some bears
 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.359
believe it's Bigfoot there's some bears
that are walking on two legs but if

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369
that are walking on two legs but if
 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.340
that are walking on two legs but if
there was a thing what's really

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350
there was a thing what's really
 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.510
there was a thing what's really
interesting is that's where it would be

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520
interesting is that's where it would be
 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.640
interesting is that's where it would be
because if it did come across the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650
because if it did come across the
 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.770
because if it did come across the
layering the the bearing a land bridge

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780
layering the the bearing a land bridge
 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.260
layering the the bearing a land bridge
like they believed humans did if that

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270
like they believed humans did if that
 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.600
like they believed humans did if that
did happen the many animals met and

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610
did happen the many animals met and
 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.300
did happen the many animals met and
navigated from there to here that way

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310
navigated from there to here that way
 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.899
navigated from there to here that way
that's where Alaska and the Pacific

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909
that's where Alaska and the Pacific
 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.030
that's where Alaska and the Pacific
Northwest that would be the the natural

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040
Northwest that would be the the natural
 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.590
Northwest that would be the the natural
path and then if you think about how

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600
path and then if you think about how
 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.109
path and then if you think about how
densely wooded that area is that would

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119
densely wooded that area is that would
 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.940
densely wooded that area is that would
be a natural habitat for something

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950
be a natural habitat for something
 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.039
be a natural habitat for something
that's hiding from people the problem is

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049
that's hiding from people the problem is
 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.990
that's hiding from people the problem is
you can't hide from shit anymore it's

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000
you can't hide from shit anymore it's
 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.940
you can't hide from shit anymore it's

trail cameras now that are incredibly

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170
trail cameras now that are incredibly
 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.699
trail cameras now that are incredibly
accurate they're so like it's so

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709
accurate they're so like it's so
 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.259

high-definition super clear and the
 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.240
high-definition super clear and the
audios clear they would catch one of

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250
