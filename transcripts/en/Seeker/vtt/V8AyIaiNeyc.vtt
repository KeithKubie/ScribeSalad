00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.700
There is an animal out there
they will steal your shoes,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.480
can play catch with
a ball, and can

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.400
look at you with
intelligent eyes.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.555
But you probably wouldn't
want this one as a pet.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.220
Hey, guys, Trace here for D
News to open your mind a bit.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.620
What's in a brain?

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.420
That which we call a mind
by any other configuration

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.020
we'd think is sweet,
or so it turns out.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.110
In case you're not into
paraphrasing Shakespeare,

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.610
it's come to light that
many of our assumptions

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.870
about large brains
have been off the mark.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.710
The human brain is
a centralized organ

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.680
inside the head that
controls and manages

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.430
all the functions
of the human body.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.750
Everything happens in here.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.050
Involuntary, voluntary,
emotion or logic--

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.920
it's all made in one spot.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.520
The human brain is
a pretty large size

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.980
considering our body.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.830
It's almost twice as
large as it should be.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.080
We're pretty smart with
this centralized CPU.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.330
But what if we networked
a bunch of brains?

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.040
Would we be even smarter?

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.660
Right now, we can solve puzzles
and mazes, we can open jars,

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.430
we use tools, we
can steal things,

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.090
we can hide from predators,
we can play with toys,

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.269
we can recognize faces,
and a bunch of other stuff.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.880
But an octopus?

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.870
It can do all that too.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:08.850
Are you surprised?

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.860
Slowly, humans have been finding
out that the animals around us

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.390
are a lot smarter
than we thought.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.640
And the lowly octopus is kind
of like an animal genius.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.910
The cephalopod and the human
share a common ancestor

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.940
from 750 million years back,
a worm with eye spots-- gross.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.130
But while the human keeps
the brain in one place,

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.120
the octopus doesn't.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.570
They only have 500 million
neurons, about 1/20

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.842
of what our brains have.

00:01:31.842 --> 00:01:33.300
But the cephalopod
brain works more

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.060
like an internet of brains.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.830
While their main CPU is
only the size of a walnut,

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.160
each of their eight arms
contains packets of neurons

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.870
too.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.780
These networked
smaller brain somehow

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.220
enabler a cephalopod to approach
the power of one central brain.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.590
Researchers think each of
the collections of neurons

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.150
in the cephalopod's arms
can carry out instructions

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.030
independently and
think for themselves.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.440
The suckers can attach
to things, exert forces,

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.100
and even smell stuff.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.860
For example, octopi have learned
how to open jars and even

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.810
those little child-proof
drug bottles that

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.700
cause problems for
some adult humans.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.400
Plus, these octopi aren't
taught to use tools.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.380
They're solitary.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.570
They don't have social groups
and only live for five years.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.340
If you left a
four-year-old human along

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.860
with a prescription bottle full
of candy, what would happen?

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.515
Cephalopod?

00:02:18.515 --> 00:02:19.640
Have that thing right open.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.310
Not long ago, we considered
animals just dumb things

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.190
here for toys and entertainment.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.950
But the closer we
look, the more we

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.960
find that as they
evolved alongside us,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.760
they gained some skills that
seem pretty intelligent.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.902
Tool use, forethought,
reasoning,

00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:34.360
and puzzle-solving
skills have been

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.470
observed in elephants,
chimpanzees, dolphins, birds,

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.200
and octipi.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.327
We may have made this awesome
giant brain do a lot for us.

00:02:43.327 --> 00:02:45.410
But some of these animals
we share the planet with

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.929
are not so far behind.

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:48.720
So what do you think
of the humble octopus?

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.761
Smarter than you thought?

00:02:49.761 --> 00:02:50.739
Are you surprised?
