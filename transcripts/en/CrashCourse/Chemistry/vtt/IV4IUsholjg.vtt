00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.740
Aaah, the controlled flow of electrons, making
possible laptops and phones and cars and pacemakers.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.480
Batteries, just like everything else in life,
is just chemistry raised to the power of awesome.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.020
The kind of chemistry that happens inside
of a battery is called electrochemistry

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.130
because it involves reactions that produce
or consume free electrons.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.840
Specifically, they are oxidation or redox
reactions, the ones where electrons are exchanged.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.460
I've told you about redox reactions before
and if you haven't seen that episode yet,

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.000
you should probably go watch that before you
watch this.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.420
Don't worry, I will still be here when you
get back.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.790
Now, when the flow of electrons in these kinds
of reactions are sent through a conductor,

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.000
like a piece of metal,
it can be used to do all sorts of work.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.890
Like, for example, this kind of work.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.640
The amount of work that can be done depends on how strong the push or pull on electrons is between the two reactants.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.570
This is the reaction's electrical potential,
but to its friends, it's known simply as voltage.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.320
Basically, if the voltage is high, each electron can do a lot more work than if the voltage is low.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.260
Many of the wonderful things in our modern
lives are based on one simple premise:

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.280
putting a device between the two halves of
just such a reaction;

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.440
the half that donates electrons,
and the half that accepts them.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.340
By harnessing that energy, a lot of the coolest
things you've done today,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.600
up to and including watching this episode
of Crash Course Chemistry, has been made possible.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:30.020
[Theme Music]

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.520
Part of what makes redox reactions so powerful,
and powerfully excellent, is that they are complicated.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.580
Because in each reaction, there's at least
two things going on:

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.030
there's the part of the reaction where the
electrons are being released

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.240
and another part where they're being eagerly
demanded.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.500
So when we deal with electrochemistry, we
usually think of reactions in terms of half reactions.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.720
Let's start with a typical redox reaction that happens in this alkaline battery as an example.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.540
In here elemental zinc is going to react with
manganese dioxide, also known as manganese

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.220
four oxide, to produce manganese three oxide
and zinc oxide.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.900
When you break this down in to half reactions,

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.750
first you have elemental zinc with an oxidation
number of 0 being oxidized to zinc 2 ion.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.539
At the same time manganese 4 is being reduced
to manganese 3.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.150
When we balance the half reactions,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.010
we see that two electrons are released during
the oxidation of each zinc atom,

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.090
and one electron is consumed by each manganese
4 atom.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.790
The water and hydroxide ions, by the way,
come from a solution of potassium hydroxide.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.810
Which is a basic, or alkaline compound.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.900
Which is why we call these things alkaline
batteries.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.879
Now if each of these half reactions occurred
in contact with the other one,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.319
they'd just spontaneously go to equilibrium releasing energy as a bunch of heat which wouldn't be very helpful.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.620
So batteries are designed to harness that energy by isolating the half reactions from each other.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.780
This allows excess electrons to build up in
the negative terminal, called the cathode,

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.620
while an electron vacuum of sorts occurs in
the positive terminal, the anode.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.739
Electrons can then cross from one half reaction
to the other,

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.739
only when we connect the cathode and the anode
of the battery via conductors.

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.899
So the current can be used to do work.
Which I can do by licking this 9 volt battery.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.840
Ahhh!
[laughs]

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.880
In these batteries, the zinc is in the center surrounded by a layer of cellulose that allows ions to pass through.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.650
The manganese oxide is in the outer layer
that surrounds the zinc core,

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.250
but the cellulose barrier doesn't allow the
zinc and the manganese to mix.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.320
Alkaline batteries are a type of galvanic
cell.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.560
Which is generally defined as an apparatus that generates electrical energy from a redox reaction.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.540
Here's another example of a galvanic cell,

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.870
one where the interesting part is the flow
of whole ions instead of the flow of electrons.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.850
In this case, wires connect metal rods that
are suspended in the solution.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.750
They're are the anode and cathode here.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.210
What's noteworthy, is that the metal atoms
are actually consumed.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.440
They're used up from the anode rod as they're
oxidized, and the metal slowly wears away.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.280
Meanwhile, the opposite happens at the cathode rod, where metal ions from the solution gain electrons

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.900
and precipitate on to the cathode as pure
metal, gradually growing larger.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.540
The circuit is completed by the wire, but
also by a salt bridge,

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.000
which is also a U-shaped tube that contains
a salt solution

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.489
that allows the metal ions to go from the
anode to the cathode.

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.799
So, now you know how batteries work: developing
and transferring a charge using electrochemistry.

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.549
But before any redox reaction can be used
to text your boyfriend or girlfriend or whatever,

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.219
we need to know how much voltage it can generate.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.979
Fortunately all of those amazing chemists who have come before us have done a lot of the work once again.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.560
The voltage generated by many half reactions is already known and can be found in most textbooks or online.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.280
And as I mentioned earlier, voltage is really just a way of expressing the electrical potential of each half reaction.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.360
The difference between the chemical demand
for the electrons in one half,

00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:41.629
versus the tendency to lose them in the other.

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:45.651
These measurements are done at standard conditions, which we discussed in the enthalpy and entropy episodes.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.159
And by convention they are written as if the
substance is being reduced, not oxidized.

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:54.599
For this reason the value is known as the
standard reduction potential of a substance.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.360
To see how reduction potentials work in half
reactions and combine in an overall reaction,

00:04:59.369 --> 00:05:03.930
let's consider a galvanic cell where zinc
is oxidized and copper ions are reduced.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.909
Keep in mind that potentials are determined
at standard state:

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:11.159
25 degrees Celsius and 1 molar solutions of
the copper and zinc ions.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.700
Our cell needs to be set up under the same conditions or the voltage will be a bit different than expected.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.020
The half reactions show more clearly what
the electrons are doing.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.300
We can see that the zinc is oxidized and the
copper is reduced.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.160
Now all standard reduction potentials are measured relative to the reduction of hydrogen ions to hydrogen gas,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.800
which is set at zero, just as a baseline.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.360
When copper is reduced, for example, it generates
0.34 volts more than hydrogen does,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.199
so we say its standard reduction potential
is +0.34 volts.

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.779
The standard reduction potential for zinc
is -0.76 volts,

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:48.439
but because zinc is oxidized in this reaction,
we can't use the reduction potential directly.

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:52.360
Instead, as a general rule, when you convert
a reduction half reaction to oxidation,

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.669
the sign of the voltage is simply reversed.

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.369
So, the -0.76 volts for the reduction potential
of zinc

00:05:58.369 --> 00:06:02.999
becomes +0.76 volts for the oxidation potential
of zinc ions.

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:07.289
And the electrical potential for the whole
reaction, called the standard cell potential,

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:10.819
is just the sum of the standard potentials
of both half reactions.

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:13.099
In this case, that would be 1.1 volts.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:19.099
Now I gotta point out here that the electrical potential of a redox reaction is related to its equilibrium constant.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:24.600
There's actually a way to determine the equilibrium constant from a measured voltage, and vice versa.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.800
Both of these constants have a lot to do with the energy the reaction can release, or its Gibbs free energy.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.219
But in brief, the higher the voltage, the
more electrical energy can be produced.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:39.340
So if the voltage is positive, it means that under standard state conditions, the reaction will spontaneously go forward.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.340
If the sign is negative, the reaction will
proceed backward.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.460
And it totally makes sense, when you think about it, that reactions like this are used to make battery cells.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.349
The reactions in batteries need to be spontaneous

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:53.929
because their whole purpose is to release
energy, not consume it.

00:06:53.929 --> 00:06:57.439
So what if we don't want to power a phone
or a laptop or a toy shuttle.

00:06:57.439 --> 00:07:01.959
What if instead we want to plate an iron car
bumper with chrome?

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:04.959
This cannot be done with a spontaneous reaction.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:10.319
Instead, a different electrochemical process is needed, one that you've probably heard of: electroplating.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.499
This is done by immersing an object in a solution that contains an excess of ions of the coating metal.

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:20.050
A bar of the coating metal, in this case chromium,
is used as the anode,

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.939
and the item to be plated, the iron bumper,
acts as the cathode

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:27.679
When an electric current is applied, a redox
reaction occurs in the solution

00:07:27.679 --> 00:07:30.919
and atoms of the coating metal are deposited
on the cathode.

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:35.649
This is essentially the opposite of a galvanic
cell, known as an electrolytic cell,

00:07:35.649 --> 00:07:42.339
and it performs electrolysis, which uses electricity,
electro-, to do the breaking apart, -lysis.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:47.760
In this case molecules in the solution are being broken down so that the metal atoms can be deposited on the surface.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:52.779
Electrolysis is used for lots of other things too, like coating jewelry or flatware with gold or silver,

00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:55.919
refining metals or separating mixtures of
metal ions.

00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:58.860
Also, converting water into hydrogen gas and
oxygen.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.969
So if you didn't already understand how much
impact chemistry has in our daily lives,

00:08:02.969 --> 00:08:05.099
you certainly should be able to see it now.

00:08:05.099 --> 00:08:07.339
Not only are all the materials around you
made of chemicals,

00:08:07.339 --> 00:08:12.489
but even the electrical devices that power
our lives depend on the reactions of electrochemistry.

00:08:12.489 --> 00:08:15.089
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

00:08:15.089 --> 00:08:19.399
If you were listening, you learned that electrochemical
reactions are redox reactions

00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:22.189
that we describe in terms of half reactions.

00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:25.389
You learned how an alkaline battery works
and what's inside of it,

00:08:25.389 --> 00:08:28.379
what a galvanic cell is and how it can be
set up

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:34.260
and how to calculate the voltage that can be generated by a half reaction, the standard reduction potential,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.900
and by the overall reaction, the standard
cell potential.

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:41.240
You also learned how electrolysis and electroplating
work.
