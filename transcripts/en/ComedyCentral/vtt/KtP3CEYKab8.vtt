00:00:01.301 --> 00:00:03.070
HAVE TO GET PRETTY PHYSICAL
RIGHT NOW.

00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:04.738
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE
I'VE GOTTEN PHYSICAL.

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:06.640
- DUDE, DON'T EVEN WORRY
ABOUT IT, I BROUGHT WEAPONS.

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:08.575
I BROUGHT WEAPONS.
- REALLY? OKAY.

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:10.244
- LOOK, CHECK IT OUT.
I GOT A SLINGSHOT.

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:11.678
- COOL, I'LL TAKE THAT.
I'LL TAKE THAT,

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:13.013
UNLESS YOU HAVE
A GRENADE LAUNCHER.

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:14.348
- WELL--WELL,
I HAVE SOMETHING BETTER.

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:15.816
I HAVE THE TETANUS BALL.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.551
IT'S A TENNIS BALL
WITH RUSTY NAILS IN IT.

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:19.052
- OKAY, I'M GONNA WANT
THE SLINGSHOT

00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:21.221
'CAUSE THIS LOOKS
PRETTY [bleep] STUPID.

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:22.656
WHAT ARE YOU--
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO THROW--

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.358
HOW ARE YOU GONNA PICK
THAT BACK UP, MAN?

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.326
YOU'RE GONNA--YOU'RE GONNA
TETANUS-IZE YOURSELF.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.128
- NO, NO, SEE, THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.863
I HAVE A PROTECTOR GLOVE
THAT YOU WEAR,

00:00:29.897 --> 00:00:32.299
SO MAYBE--MAYBE YOU SHOULD THINK
THAT OVER BEFORE YOU CALL--

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:33.967
- VERY, VERY SMART MOVE.
- THANK YOU.

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:35.435
- BUT ALSO,
I WILL TAKE THE SLINGSHOOT.

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.104
- WELL, NO,
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:38.839
BECAUSE YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO SLING-SHOOT.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.407
- WELL,
DID YOU SEE MY PRACTICE RUNS?

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.875
- WELL, I DID,
AND IT DIDN'T LOOK RIGHT.

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:43.377
- NO, IT LOOKED PRETTY GOOD.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.678
- OKAY. YOU HAVE NO AMMO,
SO YOU CAN'T--

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.079
- GIVE ME! GIVE ME!
- NO, FINE.

00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:47.481
- AAH!

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:49.983
ADAM?
OH, OH, MY, OH, MY--

00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:52.052

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:53.987
- HELP! HELP ME!

00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:55.389
- UH, YEAH,
JUST GIVE ME THE SLINGSHOT.

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:58.625
AND HOLD THE BACK.
- NICE TRY! CUT ME DOWN!

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.627
[screaming]

00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:04.231
- ALL RIGHT, JUST--
WELL, DON'T BREAK YOUR NECK!

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:06.466
HELP!
MY FRIEND IS CHOKING!

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.701
DERS?

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.303
- BLAKE?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:11.238
- WHAT? YOU'RE THE CHEATER?
- YEAH, I'M THE CHEATER, OKAY?

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:12.573
AT THE STORE THE OTHER DAY,

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:14.641
SHE GAVE ME
A OVER-THE-PANTS H.J.

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:17.611
AND, DUDE, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
WHAT I DID IN MY PANTS.

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:19.146
- REALLY?
- UNREAL.

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.281
I JUST, LIKE,
BARFED OUT OF MY THING.

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:22.983
- NO WAY.
HOW MANY OUNCES ARE WE TALKING?

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.886
LIKE A, LIKE A GUSHER'S WORTH?
OR LIKE A CAPRI SUN?

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.521
- LIKE FIVE BUSTS
OF I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH.

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:29.089
- OH, THAT'S WHY YOU WERE
WEARING SKI PANTS.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:30.724
YOU WERE DEALING
WITH THE STAIN PROBABLY.

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.292
DUDE, NOW I GET IT.

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:34.127
OH!
ADAM, ADAM!

00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:36.096
ADAM'S CHOKING, HE'S DYING, MAN.
WE GOT TO CUT HIM DOWN.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.364
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING--
- COME ON, COME ON!

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:38.565
- WHAT?
- GO, GO, GO!

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:39.967
GET SOMETHING SHARP,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.268
- HERE, HERE, HERE, HERE,

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:42.636
- OH, COME ON.
HURRY, HURRY, HURRY.

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:44.338
COME ON, COME ON!
HE'S RIGHT THROUGH HERE!

00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:45.873
- WAIT, MAN, YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO RUN WITH THESE.

00:01:45.906 --> 00:01:48.108
- I KNOW! NO!
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:49.476
- JUST DROP THE STUPID THING!
- OH, MY GOD.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.911

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:52.246

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.916
- THEY'RE NOT CUTTING!

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:59.119
- NO, NO, NO!
MY LITTLE BABY!

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:02.956
MY LITTLE BABY! MY LITTLE ANGEL!
[crying]

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:05.526
- OH, MY GOD. I GOT A BIG KNIFE!

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:07.261

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:09.196
- [screaming]
- OH!

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.064
[Blake and Adam wailing]

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:12.466
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.768
- I THOUGHT WE LOST YA.
- [crying] OH, GOD!

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:16.904
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
- OH, MY GOD! I ALMOST DIED!

00:02:16.937 --> 00:02:18.338
- I KNOW.
- I ALMOST DIED!

00:02:18.372 --> 00:02:20.073
THAT WAS SO SCARY!

00:02:20.107 --> 00:02:22.142
THANK YOU FOR SAVING ME!
- IT'S OKAY, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

00:02:22.176 --> 00:02:24.344
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
- I HAD A REALIZATION.

00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:26.547
I'VE BEEN ALIVE FOR 24 YEARS,

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.283
AND I HAVEN'T EVEN DONE ANYTHING
WITH MY LIFE.

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:30.751
- DON'T SAY THAT. COME ON.
- YOU HAVE TOO.

00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:32.653
- I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING!
- COME ON.

00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:35.455
- I'VE NEVER EVEN JET SKIED
OFF A WATERFALL.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.291
- HEY, NO ONE'S DONE THAT.
- YEAH, NOT MANY DO.

00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:40.093
- I'VE NEVER EVEN HOT-AIR
BALLOONED AROUND THE WORLD.

00:02:40.127 --> 00:02:41.828
- IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE.
- YES.

00:02:41.862 --> 00:02:44.464
- [crying]
I'VE NEVER...

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:48.502
EVEN SEEN <i>THE EXPENDABLES.</i>

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:50.804
- WE DID, THOUGH.
ON VALENTINE'S DAY.

00:02:50.838 --> 00:02:53.674
- WHATEVER THE POINT IS,
I NEED TO DO MORE BADASS STUFF!

00:02:53.707 --> 00:02:55.943
AND WATCH MORE CLASSIC MOVIES.

00:02:55.976 --> 00:02:57.978
I HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN
<i>BEAUTY AND THE BEAST</i>

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.314
IN, LIKE, SEVEN YEARS,
AND THAT WAS MY FAVORITE MOVIE.

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:01.915
- OKAY.
- AND I'M BLOWING IT!
