00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.179
How do Smoke Detectors Work

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.979
At their core, smoke alarms are very simple
devices that need only two functions: a way

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:10.349
of detecting smoke and a way of alerting people
to the problem.

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.330
From new technology involving lasers to old
world technology that relies on a lonely individual

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.230
sitting in a tower on the side of a mountain
just waiting to see smoke, all do the same

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.949
thing in different ways.

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.359
The two most commonly used smoke alarms (mainly
because they are inexpensive) are photoelectric

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.580
and ionization detector alarms.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.210
The difference between the two lies in how
they detect smoke particles.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.030
Depending on the conditions of the fire, one
type is usually better than the other.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.320
Many other kinds of detectors exist that are
more expensive and often situation specific

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.310
(such as needing to protect classified documents
or computer servers).

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.470
These tend to be much more sensitive and allow
for many different levels of detection and

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.470
alarm.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.110
The most common of these is aspiration detectors.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.280
Photoelectric detectors use a beam of light
sent from a light-emitting diode (LED) that

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.370
is detected by a photocell.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.820
There is a common misconception that the photocell
receives light at all times from the LED,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.820
and when smoke gets in the way, the alarm
is triggered (similar to the way a door alarm

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.190
at convenience stores often works).

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.710
This misconception ignores one glaring problem.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.470
It would require a large amount of smoke to
block the light from the photocell, making

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.220
it extremely insensitive.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.600
A person would be dead from smoke inhalation
long before the detector would ever go off.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.340
What is actually happening in the photoelectric
fire alarms is the LED sends a beam of light,

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.430
usually down a T-shaped chamber.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.850
Sitting at the bottom of the T is the photocell.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.410
When smoke enters the chamber, some of the
light is scattered by the particles, with

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.220
some of the rays getting sent down to the
photocell.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.500
When this photocell detects light, it generates
an electrical current that triggers the alarm

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.080
at a certain threshold.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.310
Once that current stops (the smoke is cleared)
the alarm will stop.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.240
Photoelectric detectors are better at detecting
slow, smoldering, and therefore generally

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.580
smokier, fires.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.260
Ionization detectors use ionizing radiation
from a material known as Americium-241.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.420
Ionizing radiation is simply radiation from
substances that can free electrons from an

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.410
atom or molecule, the net result being ions
that have a specific electric charge of either

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.170
positive or negative.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.390
The detectors use a small amount of Americium-241
contained in a small chamber.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.350
This chamber is made up of two oppositely
charged metal plates that are kept a small

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.650
distance apart.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.020
When the alpha particles interact with the
air in the chamber, they produce ions.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.030
The positively charged plate attracts the
negative ions, and the negatively charged

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.140
plate attracts the positive ions.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.520
This system creates a small electric current.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.700
When smoke enters the chamber, the particles
attach themselves to the charged ions and

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.870
restore them back to a neutral electrical
state.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.780
This disrupts the electric current and an
alarm is triggered.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.130
Hot air can also change the rate at which
ionization occurs within the chamber and this

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.660
will also trigger the alarm.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.160
Ionization detectors are much more common
than photoelectric detectors because they

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.550
are less expensive and better at detecting
smaller amounts of smoke that come from fast

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.069
flaming fires.

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.069
If you’re worried about your house having
so called “nuclear radiation” in it, don’t.

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.709
The small amount of radiation found in the
detector is practically harmless, being predominantly

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.099
alpha radiation.

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.330
This type cannot even penetrate a piece of
paper and is blocked by just several centimeters

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.350
of air.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.050
The only danger comes from if you inhale the
particles.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.940
So no taking apart the ionization chamber
and huffing the air in it to try to develop

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.940
superpowers.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.879
Lung tissue damage, increasing your risk of
lung cancer, and other such health problems

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.680
may not be the superpower you were hoping
for.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.300
Plus the superhero name “Wheezy” won’t
exactly instill fear on the hearts of evil

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.890
doers the world over.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.270
The differing strengths of these two main
types of sensors has led to the creation of

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.960
detectors that employ both types of systems.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.970
This allows for the rapid detection of both
small smoldering fires, and fast moving ones.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.300
The less common Aspirating smoke detectors
use a fan to draw in air from the surrounding

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.130
environment; next, a system of filtering,
sensing, and analyzing the air sample is employed.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.270
Depending on the environment needing protection,
this system can be as sensitive (some as much

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:08.030
as 1,000 times as much as a standard photoelectric
or ionization detector) or advanced as the

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.830
situation requires.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.770
Should the system detect any type of negative
environment, such as very small amounts of

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.280
smoke, small changes in temperature, or flickering
light (as from a flame) it can notify appropriate

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.459
personnel in many different ways.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.919
Multiple levels of warning can trigger different
responses depending on the stage of the fire,

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.230
from simply notifying personnel of a pending
problem to communicating with a fire alarm

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.389
control panel to adjust air conditioning or
release different types of fire suppressing

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.830
agents, or all of the above.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.669
Bonus Facts:
• Americium-241 is a man-made metal discovered

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.020
by Glenn Seaborg in 1944.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.180
It is produced when plutonium atoms absorb
neutrons in nuclear reactors.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.620
It has a half-life of 432 years.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.009
• The first detection system that had the
ability to sense smoke was created by Greinacher

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:57.039
from Berne in 1922.

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:01.400
The first Underwriters laboratory listing
for a smoke detection device was obtained

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:07.289
by Walter Kidde in 1929 and was used to release
a total flooding CO2 system for shipboard

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.639
uses.

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:14.270
• The first ionization chamber for the purposes
of detecting smoke was inadvertently discovered

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.659
by Walter Jaeger in the 1930s while he was
attempting to develop a poison gas detector.

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:25.020
In the early 1940s, Jaeger and Meili got together
and created the first addition of an ionization

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.979
detector that we use today.

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.270
This first attempt used an enormous power
supply and required a 220v system.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:38.129
It wasn’t until the 1960s that Americium-241
was used, requiring much less voltage.

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:43.259
In 1964, First Alert was able to develop a
24v ionization detector.

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:47.550
The widespread use of smoke detectors in households
wasn’t feasible until a year later when

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.960
Duane Pearsall and Stanley Peterson created
a single station photoelectric detector that

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.559
was powered by a battery.

00:05:55.559 --> 00:06:01.990
• 96% of all homes in the US have at least
one smoke alarm; 75% have one that actually

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.990
works.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.139
About 66% of deaths from home fires were the
result of homes that had no working smoke

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:09.139
detector.

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:13.159
Smoke alarms that fail are usually the result
of disconnected or dead batteries, the latter

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:16.409
of which comprises 25% of all smoke alarm
failures.

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:21.360
As such, the NFPA recommends that you check
your smoke detector and change out the batteries

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.529
twice a year.

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:26.490
For those who live in areas that have day-light
saving time, it is recommended that you do

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:41.579
this when you change your clocks.
