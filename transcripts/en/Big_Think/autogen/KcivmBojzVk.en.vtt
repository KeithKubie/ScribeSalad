teleport molecules maybe water carbon

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330
teleport molecules maybe water carbon
 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.380
teleport molecules maybe water carbon
dioxide after that who knows maybe even

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390
dioxide after that who knows maybe even
 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.340
dioxide after that who knows maybe even
DNA maybe organic molecules now to

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350
DNA maybe organic molecules now to
 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.040

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050
teleport a human raises all the ethical
 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.800
teleport a human raises all the ethical
questions that you mentioned because the

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:42.810
questions that you mentioned because the
 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.120
questions that you mentioned because the
original first of all has to be

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130
original first of all has to be
 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.940

teleportation so if you get Captain Kirk

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400
teleportation so if you get Captain Kirk
 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.340
teleportation so if you get Captain Kirk
zapped him across the room you've now

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350
zapped him across the room you've now
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.920
zapped him across the room you've now
seen Captain Kirk die you've seen this

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930
seen Captain Kirk die you've seen this
 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.530
seen Captain Kirk die you've seen this
atoms fall apart but here's this other

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540
atoms fall apart but here's this other
 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.600
atoms fall apart but here's this other
Captain Kirk on the other side of the

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610
Captain Kirk on the other side of the
 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.510
Captain Kirk on the other side of the
room who has the same bad jokes who has

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520
room who has the same bad jokes who has
 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.030

the same character all the personality

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040
the same character all the personality
 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.609
the same character all the personality
quirks as the original Captain Kirk so

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619
quirks as the original Captain Kirk so
 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.359
quirks as the original Captain Kirk so
the impostor says no I'm real I have the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369
the impostor says no I'm real I have the
 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.300
the impostor says no I'm real I have the
memories the personality the quarks I am

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310
memories the personality the quarks I am
 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.760
memories the personality the quarks I am
Captain Kirk well you just saw the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770
Captain Kirk well you just saw the
 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.099
Captain Kirk well you just saw the
original die and if you believe in a

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:19.109
original die and if you believe in a
 

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:21.560
original die and if you believe in a
soul that soul went to heaven or maybe

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570
soul that soul went to heaven or maybe
 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.529
soul that soul went to heaven or maybe
the other place but that person is dead

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539
the other place but that person is dead
 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.840
the other place but that person is dead
so who's this impostor over there that

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850
so who's this impostor over there that
 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.120
so who's this impostor over there that
the imposter have a soul so it raises

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130
the imposter have a soul so it raises
 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.599
the imposter have a soul so it raises
the question are we nothing but

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609
the question are we nothing but
 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:34.849
the question are we nothing but
information is the soul the essence of

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859
information is the soul the essence of
 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:38.149
information is the soul the essence of
who we are nothing but information well

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159
who we are nothing but information well
 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.609
who we are nothing but information well
I'm a physicist we don't know the answer

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619
I'm a physicist we don't know the answer
 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.889
I'm a physicist we don't know the answer
to that all we're saying is it is

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899
to that all we're saying is it is
 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.289
to that all we're saying is it is
physically possible to teleport an

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299
physically possible to teleport an
 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.419
physically possible to teleport an
entire human being across the room or

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429
entire human being across the room or
 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.730
entire human being across the room or
maybe onto Mars it is physically

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740
maybe onto Mars it is physically
 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.190
maybe onto Mars it is physically
possible to do that and it raises a

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200
possible to do that and it raises a
 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.709
possible to do that and it raises a
valid question what happened to the soul

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719
valid question what happened to the soul
 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:58.910
valid question what happened to the soul
if your original copy died and somebody

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920
if your original copy died and somebody
 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.429
if your original copy died and somebody
out there has all your memories what

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439
out there has all your memories what
 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.889
out there has all your memories what
does that mean and the answer is we

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899
does that mean and the answer is we
 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.259
does that mean and the answer is we
don't know
