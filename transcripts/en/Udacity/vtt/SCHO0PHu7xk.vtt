00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.770
Okay. So now we've established that there are

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.450
two different versions of the ABO gene sequence at

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.750
this 796 position in the human population. And

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.625
it turns out that the variation that results in

00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:13.720
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.980
this amino acid position, codes for blood type A

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.605
in human beings. So if you have anything that produces

00:00:20.605 --> 00:00:20.660
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.420
here. This is associated with blood type A in

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.550
humans. But if you have the variation that results in

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.320
a methionine, or an M at this position, for

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.290
an amino acid, then that results in a B blood

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.610
type for humans. So we might call one of

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.690
these variations the A version, and the other one the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.110
B version. But in genetics, we actually have a word

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.110
to describe these kinds of variants. We call them alleles.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.940
An allele is just another word for variant.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.980
Alleles are just variations of genes. The gene

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.760
is the ABO gene. But, we have two

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.400
different variants. We have one variant with an adenine

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.005
or an A at position 796, and another variant with a thymine or T at position

00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:11.260
796. So we could call this an allele with an A that causes B blood type. And an

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.130
allele T that causes the A blood type. As

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.040
you can imagine we could have many different alleles.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.480
We can change nucleotides all over the place, anywhere

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.280
we want and that's effectively producing different alleles, because

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.340
they're variations in the gene. So we're going to start

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.800
simple, and talk about one or two variations, one

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.480
or two alleles. But for any trait, any gene,

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.350
you can build up to virtually, as many alleles

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.490
as there are positions in the gene. What I've

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.140
done is listed the actual type A, blood type A

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.830
alleles, and the blood type B alleles. Changing from

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.760
a CGC to a GGC, a GGC to an AGC.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.110
And I've done the same thing for the amino

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.680
acids that are associated with these alleles. The type A

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.480
alleles for leucine to methionine, glycine to alanine, arginine

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.350
to glycine, glycine to serine, uhhh the change from type

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.750
A to the type B alleles. What I want you to do

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.160
is tell me which of the variants, the genetic variants are associated

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.509
with the changes in the amino acids. I've numbered them one, two,

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.730
three, and four. And I want you put the number in the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.920
correct box here, that shows the, the correct amino acid change with

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.250
the correct change in the genetic sequence here. Remember, use the genetic

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.430
code, I'm not putting it on the screen here because there's not

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.580
enough room, but you can click on a link in the instructor's notes

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.290
to, get a bigger version.
