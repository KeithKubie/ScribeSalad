00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
Good morning, all.
Good morning. I hope you guys did

00:00:07.777 --> 00:00:11.710
not spend all of last night
celebrating the Red Sox victory,

00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:19.955
but there is one more tonight. OK.
Let's see. I trust the quiz went

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:26.933
OK. What I will do today is take
off from where we left

00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:34.377
off on Tuesday.
And continue our discussion of the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.266
large signal and small signal
analysis of our amplifier.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.133
Today the focus will be on "Small
Signal Analysis".

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.400
So let me start by reviewing some of

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.400
the material. And,
as you know, our MOSFET amplifier

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.066
looks like this.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.733
One of the things you will notice in
circuits, as I have been mentioning

00:01:35.454 --> 00:01:39.320
all along in this course,
is that certain kinds of patterns

00:01:40.908 --> 00:01:45.308
keep repeating time and time again.
And this is one such pattern. A

00:01:46.362 --> 00:01:50.628
three terminal device like the
MOSFET with an input and the drain

00:01:51.816 --> 00:01:56.549
to source port connected to RL and
VS in series in the following manner,

00:01:57.272 --> 00:02:01.272
this is a very common pattern.
There are several other common

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.266
patterns. The voltage divider is a
common pattern.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.400
We keep running into that again and
again and again.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.533
The Thevenin form,
a voltage source in series with the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.266
resistor is another very common form.
The Norton equivalent form,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
which is a current source in
parallel with a resistor is also

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.400
very common. And it behooves all of
us to be very familiar with the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.933
analyses of these things.
Voltage dividers in particular are

00:02:30.214 --> 00:02:34.347
just so common that you need to be
able to look at it and boom,

00:02:34.642 --> 00:02:38.442
be able to write down the expression
for voltage dividers.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.136
I would also encourage you to go
and look at current dividers.

00:02:43.498 --> 00:02:47.764
When you have two resistors in
parallel and you have some current

00:02:47.926 --> 00:02:48.163
flowing into the resistors to find
out the current in one branch versus

00:02:52.355 --> 00:02:56.221
the other very quickly.
The expression is very analogous to

00:02:56.785 --> 00:03:00.785
the voltage divider expression.
And some of these very common

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.233
patterns are highlighted in the
summary pages in the course notes,

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.500
so it is good to keep track of those
and be extremely familiar with those

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.166
patterns to the point where if you
see it you should be able to jump up

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.700
and shout out the answer just by
looking at it without having to do

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.633
any math. So here was an amplifier.
And then we noticed that when the

00:03:29.882 --> 00:03:29.918
MOSFET was in saturation it behaved
like a current source.

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:34.148
And this circuit would give us
amplification while the MOSFET was

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.276
in saturation.
So we agreed to adhere to the

00:03:41.174 --> 00:03:41.743
saturation discipline which simply
said that I was going to use my

00:03:44.938 --> 00:03:45.707
circuit in a way that the MOSFET
would always remain in saturation in

00:03:48.702 --> 00:03:49.602
building things like amplifiers and
so on. And by doing that throughout

00:03:52.468 --> 00:03:52.835
the analysis I could make the
assumption that the MOSFET was in

00:03:56.234 --> 00:03:58.967
saturation. I didn't
have to go through --

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.666
Analysis became easier.
I didn't have to figure out now,

00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:04.332
what region is the MOSFET in? Well,
because of my discipline it is

00:04:08.571 --> 00:04:08.685
always going to be in saturation.
But in turn what we had to do was

00:04:12.857 --> 00:04:14.990
conduct a large signal analysis.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.378
Again, in follow on courses you will
be given circuits like this.

00:04:25.888 --> 00:04:29.488
In fact, this very circuit with a
very high likelihood.

00:04:29.776 --> 00:04:30.154
And you will be looking at more
complicated models of the MOSFET.

00:04:33.664 --> 00:04:36.664
Or you will be given the MOSFET
like this and,

00:04:37.552 --> 00:04:41.418
let's say in that course the
designers do not adhere to the

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.973
saturation discipline,
in which case you have to first

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.706
figure out is my MOSFET in its
triode region or in the saturation

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.063
region? And depending on the region
it is in you have to apply different

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.910
equations. So it is one step more
complicated than in 002.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.733
In 002 we simplified our lives by
following a discipline.

00:05:01.124 --> 00:05:05.057
And let me tell you that following
a discipline is quite OK.

00:05:05.248 --> 00:05:05.257
When it simplifies our lives and we
can do good things with it,

00:05:09.372 --> 00:05:09.581
it is quite OK to do that. We are
not wimps or anything like that.

00:05:13.496 --> 00:05:14.036
It is quite OK to have a discipline
and agree that we are going to play

00:05:17.622 --> 00:05:17.896
in this region of the playground and
build circuits in that manner.

00:05:21.748 --> 00:05:21.888
By doing so, we could assume the
MOSFET was in saturation all the

00:05:25.874 --> 00:05:29.407
time. And analysis simply used a
current source model.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.533
By the same token,
what becomes important is to figure

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.133
out what are the boundaries of valid
operation of the MOSFET in

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.933
saturation? To do that we conducted
a large signal analysis.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.466
And it had two components to it.
One of course was to figure out the

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.200
output versus input response.
And what this usually does is that

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.933
it does a nonlinear analysis
of this circuit.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.266
If it is a linear circuit it is a
linear analysis.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.466
And figures out what the values of
the various voltages and currents

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.266
are in the circuit as a function of
the applied inputs and chosen

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.133
parameters. And the second step we
said was to figure out valid

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.266
operating ranges --

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
-- for input and corresponding
ranges for the other dependent

00:06:32.636 --> 00:06:35.902
parameters such as VO.
You could also find out the

00:06:38.272 --> 00:06:42.205
corresponding operating range for
the current IDS and so on.

00:06:43.908 --> 00:06:47.374
So by doing this you could first
analyze the circuit,

00:06:49.544 --> 00:06:54.010
find out the "bias" parameters,
find out the values of VI and VO and

00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:57.781
so on.
And then you could say all right,

00:07:00.833 --> 00:07:05.633
provided, as long as VI stays within
these bounds my assumption that this

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:10.099
is in saturation will hold and
everything will be fine.

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:16.498
The reading for this is Chapter 8.
And today we will take the next

00:07:17.831 --> 00:07:22.097
step and revisit small signal
analysis. In the demo that I showed

00:07:23.498 --> 00:07:27.698
you at the end of last lecture,
I showed you an input triangular

00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:31.766
wave.
And the input triangular wave gave

00:07:34.214 --> 00:07:37.480
rise to an output.
And we noticed that we did have

00:07:38.642 --> 00:07:41.575
amplification,
I had a small input and a much

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.203
bigger output.
I did have amplification when the

00:07:47.498 --> 00:07:50.964
MOSFET was in saturation but it was
highly nonlinear.

00:07:51.926 --> 00:07:55.992
The input was a triangular wave and
the output was some funny,

00:07:56.355 --> 00:07:56.392
it kind of looked like a sinusoid
whose extremities had been whacked

00:08:00.784 --> 00:08:04.850
down and kind of flattened.
And its upward going peak had been

00:08:05.454 --> 00:08:08.920
shrunk. So it was a kind of weird
nonlinear behavior.

00:08:10.362 --> 00:08:14.962
I will show that to you again later
on. And so it amplified but it was

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:18.536
nonlinear. And remember our goal of
two weeks ago?

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.180
We set out to build a linear
amplifier. So today we will walk

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.890
down that path and talk about
building a linear amplifier.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.333
So to very quickly revisit the input
versus output characteristic,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.800
VI versus VO, this is VT and this is
VS, this is what things looked like.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.333
Also to quickly review the valid
ranges, until some point here the

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
amplifier was in saturation,
the MOSFET was in saturation and

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.266
somewhere here I had VO being equal
to VI minus a threshold drop.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.466
At that point the MOSFET went into
its triode region and I no longer

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:20.450
was following the saturation
discipline. So therefore this is my

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.366
valid region of operation.
We also know that the output was

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:32.016
given by VS minus K (VI-VT)
all squared RL over 2.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.400
Again assuming the MOSFET is in
saturation. It is very important to

00:09:40.554 --> 00:09:44.820
keep stating this because this is
true only when the MOSFET is in

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:50.643
saturation, when I am following the
discipline. Notice that this is a

00:09:51.666 --> 00:09:55.466
nonlinear relationship.
So VO depends on some funny square

00:09:57.222 --> 00:10:00.888
law dependence on VI.
The key here is how do we go about

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.600
building our amplifier?
Take a look at this point here.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.666
At this point here let's say I have
a VI input. Corresponding output is

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.533
VO. Focus is this point.
And left to itself this was a

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.333
nonlinear curve.
Remember the trick that we used in

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.733
our nonlinear Expo Dweeb example?
We used the Zen Method.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.233
Remember the Zen Method?
We said look, this is nonlinear,

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:42.033
but if you can focus your mind on
this little piece of the curve here

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.633
this looks more or less linear.
If I look at a small itty-bitty

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.900
portion of the curve and I do the
Zen thing, and kind of zoom in on

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.766
here. This looked more or less
linear. This means that if I could

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.766
work with very small signals and
apply the signal in a way that I

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:07.033
also had a DC offset of some sort.
Then I would be in a region of the

00:11:07.181 --> 00:11:11.314
curve, I would be delineating a
small region of the curve which

00:11:11.544 --> 00:11:15.477
would be more or less linear.
This was a small signal trick.

00:11:15.908 --> 00:11:20.241
And what we will do here is simply
revisit the small signal model.

00:11:20.272 --> 00:11:24.538
Most of what I am going to do from
here on will be more or less a

00:11:24.636 --> 00:11:28.369
repeat of what you saw for the light
emitting expo dweeb.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Just that here I have a three
terminal device,

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:38.756
with a little bit more complication.
The equation is different. I don't

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:43.180
have to resort to a Taylor series
expansion. I will just do a

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:48.136
complete expansion of this
expression and develop the small

00:11:49.362 --> 00:11:52.828
signal values for you.
Recall the small signal model.

00:11:54.454 --> 00:11:58.587
It had the following steps.
The first step will operate at some

00:12:01.714 --> 00:12:05.114
bias point, VI,
VO, and of course some corresponding

00:12:11.142 --> 00:12:15.208
point IDS. This is Page 3.
And then superimpose a small signal

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:23.970
VI on top of the big fat bias.
Remember the "boost"?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.533
So VI is the boost.
Boom. And above VI,

00:12:36.332 --> 00:12:40.932
I have small signal VI that I apply.
And our claim is that response of

00:12:42.666 --> 00:12:45.532
the amplifier to VI is
approximately linear.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.333
The key trick with this is that for

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.433
my small signal model here,
this is Page 3 here, and Page 2.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:15.100
The key trick here is that with the
small signal model,

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.566
I operate my amplifier at some
operating point,

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.766
VO, VI. I superimpose a small
signal VI on top of small VI on top

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:30.033
of big VI. And then I claim that
the response to VI is

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.300
approximately linear.
And let me just embellish that curve

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.200
a little bit more.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.666
Notice that in this situation this
was my VI, which is my bias voltage,

00:13:48.666 --> 00:13:53.199
this is VO, which is the output bias,
and of course not shown on this

00:13:54.332 --> 00:13:57.665
graph is the output operating
current which is IDS.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.466
One nice way of thinking about this
is to redraw this and think that

00:14:06.362 --> 00:14:10.695
your coordinate axes have kind of
shifted in the following manner.

00:14:12.725 --> 00:14:16.125
This is VI. This is also on your
Page 3. This is VT.

00:14:19.089 --> 00:14:22.289
Remember this was the operating
point, VO and VI.

00:14:25.453 --> 00:14:29.453
And notice that we were operating
in this small regime of our

00:14:31.817 --> 00:14:35.483
transfer curve here.
And in effect what we are saying is

00:14:37.777 --> 00:14:42.043
that I am going to apply small
variations about VI and call those

00:14:43.332 --> 00:14:47.598
variations delta VI or small VI.
And the resulting variations are

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:52.621
going to look like delta VO.
Also referred to as small V,

00:14:54.444 --> 00:14:57.444
small O. So I will have small
variations here.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.866
And they give rise to corresponding
small variations there.

00:15:05.454 --> 00:15:09.787
One way to view this is as if we
are working with a new coordinate

00:15:10.908 --> 00:15:15.508
system. Another way to view this is
that so the capital VI and capital

00:15:16.362 --> 00:15:20.695
VO correspond to my VI and VO as the
total voltages in my circuit,

00:15:21.816 --> 00:15:26.282
but at this bias point I can think
of another coordinate system here

00:15:27.271 --> 00:15:31.204
with small VI and VO out there.
And for small changes to VI,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.600
I can figure out the corresponding
small changes to VO.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.200
Just that all the analysis I
perform here is going to be linear.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.466
And I will prove it to you in a
couple of different ways in the next

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.600
few seconds. When I am doing small
signal analysis I am operating here

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.333
in this regime at some bias point.
You have also seen this before.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.600
How do I get a bias? This is my
amplifier RL and VS.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.933
This is Page 4. VO.
The way I get a bias is I apply

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.666
some DC voltage VI and superimpose
on top of that my small signal small

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.066
VI. This is my DC bias that has
boosted up the signal to

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.466
an interesting value.
And because of that what I can get

00:16:34.666 --> 00:16:38.799
is by varying VI as a small signal
with a very small amplitude,

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:43.665
I am going to get a linear response
here. And I can draw

00:16:45.333 --> 00:16:46.733
that for you as well.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.200
This is my bias point here.
And if I vary my signal like so then

00:17:00.666 --> 00:17:05.132
my output should look like this.
This is point VI, this is point VO,

00:17:07.998 --> 00:17:12.598
and this is my small signal VI and
this is my small signal VO and this

00:17:15.331 --> 00:17:18.331
is capital VO.
So this small thing here is VI.

00:17:22.665 --> 00:17:25.198
I would like to show you a little
demo.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.866
I will start with the same demo I
showed you the last time.

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:38.570
I showed you the amplifier.
In the demo I am going to apply a

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.473
triangular wave.
And initially I start with a large

00:17:43.712 --> 00:17:47.645
signal. And you will see that the
output looks really corny,

00:17:48.284 --> 00:17:52.684
is going to look something like this.
That's large signal response.

00:17:52.856 --> 00:17:56.989
And then I will begin playing with
the input making it smaller,

00:17:57.428 --> 00:18:00.028
and you can see how it looks
yourselves.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.600
There you go. So this is where I
stopped the last time.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.333
The last lecture I applied this
input, time is going to the right,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.466
and the purple curve in the
background is the output.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.466
It looks much more like a sinusoid
with some flattening of its tips.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.866
Nothing like an interesting
triangular wave.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.533
What I will do next is that let me
make sure I have enough of a boost

00:18:36.768 --> 00:18:41.434
here, enough of a DC voltage so that
I am operating at some point here.

00:18:41.536 --> 00:18:45.536
I believe I already have that.
Notice that I can shift up the

00:18:46.305 --> 00:18:49.305
triangular wave input,
or I can shift it down.

00:18:51.075 --> 00:18:54.741
So let me bias it here.
I have chosen a VI that's about,

00:18:55.845 --> 00:18:59.845
I forget how many volts per division
it is, but I have chosen

00:19:00.615 --> 00:19:03.681
some VI here.
And I biased it such that this is

00:19:05.071 --> 00:19:08.804
the input. You get a nonlinear
response. It is amplified.

00:19:09.213 --> 00:19:09.671
It is much bigger. What I will do
next is make VI that I apply smaller

00:19:13.355 --> 00:19:16.755
and smaller. I have already done
the boosting. Boom,

00:19:17.497 --> 00:19:20.963
that's a boost. So I have boosted
up your VI already.

00:19:21.639 --> 00:19:21.895
Next is I am going to shrink it,
and hopefully you will see that if

00:19:25.783 --> 00:19:29.916
all that I am saying is truthful
here you will see a triangular

00:19:29.927 --> 00:19:31.860
response.
Let's go try it out.

00:19:35.111 --> 00:19:39.111
Watch the yellow. I am going to
shrink the yellow and make it

00:19:41.333 --> 00:19:44.666
smaller and smaller.
There you go. It is great when

00:19:47.555 --> 00:19:52.221
nature works like you expect it to.
I have never seen a triangular wave

00:19:53.777 --> 00:19:57.443
looks so pretty in my life.
It is awesome. Look at this.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.400
Here is a tiny triangular wave.
And the output is also a triangular

00:20:06.666 --> 00:20:10.866
wave but it is much more linear.
Yes. Question? What's that? The

00:20:13.332 --> 00:20:17.998
question is that the output here is
only as big as the input used to be

00:20:19.998 --> 00:20:23.998
before. That's a good question.
What I have done here is I am

00:20:26.666 --> 00:20:31.399
showing you a laboratory experiment.
And let's assume that this input is

00:20:31.875 --> 00:20:35.341
the input I am getting from some
sensor in the field.

00:20:35.625 --> 00:20:36.075
Assume that this is my input,
not what I had before. Assume that

00:20:39.375 --> 00:20:39.825
this is my input to begin with and
this is the amplified output.

00:20:43.125 --> 00:20:46.325
What I can also do is I can also
change the bias.

00:20:46.875 --> 00:20:47.791
And we will see this at the end of
the lecture, in the last ten minutes

00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:51.141
of lecture. How do you select a
bias point? By changing your bias

00:20:54.375 --> 00:20:54.891
point you can change the properties
of an amplifier to give you a

00:20:58.125 --> 00:21:01.258
preview of upcoming attractions.
Let me ask you,

00:21:01.818 --> 00:21:02.048
what do you think should happen if I
change the bias point?

00:21:05.454 --> 00:21:06.218
I have not shown you the math yet,
so intuitively what do you think

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:12.290
should happen?
If I increase the bias what do you

00:21:12.726 --> 00:21:12.756
think is going to happen?
Yes. Good insight. Higher bias

00:21:16.362 --> 00:21:16.857
will be more amplification.
Let's see if our friend is correct.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.666
Let me set a higher bias.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.066
Not necessarily,

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.900
I guess. You're actually right,
by the way. I am playing a trick on

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:49.500
everybody here.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.400
As I change my input bias.
Notice that under certain

00:22:06.428 --> 00:22:10.428
conditions my output becomes smaller
and gets more distorted.

00:22:10.856 --> 00:22:15.256
Under other conditions what is
going to happen to my output is that

00:22:15.284 --> 00:22:19.150
it is becoming smaller and is going
to get distorted again.

00:22:19.712 --> 00:22:23.845
So there are a bunch of funny
effects happening that reflect on

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:27.273
the bias point,
but for an appropriate choice of

00:22:28.569 --> 00:22:28.604
bias point as I increase the bias
the amplification should increase.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
And I will show you that in a few
minutes. But it is a complicated

00:22:36.333 --> 00:22:37.533
relationship. Yes.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.933
This is finally getting fun.
Here is the question. Professor

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:48.866
Agarwal, we love your song and dance,
but if you really want to get a high

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:52.333
signal at the output and you want to
amplify your big input signal

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.466
how do you do it?
So the question is let's say I have

00:23:00.307 --> 00:23:04.707
an input that is this big here,
if it is this big, I have shown you

00:23:04.921 --> 00:23:09.454
how I can get things that are this
big, but what if my input was this

00:23:09.536 --> 00:23:12.869
big? How do I get an output that is
this big? Well,

00:23:14.152 --> 00:23:18.552
I will use one of those learned by
questioning methods and have you

00:23:18.768 --> 00:23:21.834
tell me the answer.
Someone tell me the answer.

00:23:23.384 --> 00:23:26.317
How do I do that? Yes. Use
another amplifier.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.333
So the answer is I will use one
amplifier to go from here to here.

00:23:34.199 --> 00:23:38.665
And the suggestion is use another
amplifier to go from here to here.

00:23:40.399 --> 00:23:44.799
And, in fact, I believe that you
may have a problem in your problem

00:23:46.599 --> 00:23:50.665
set where you will do that.
And so you have only yourselves to

00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:55.132
blame. So how do you
make this work?

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.400
What you have to do is this VI has
to be much smaller than the bias

00:24:03.768 --> 00:24:06.968
point VI on this one.
I have to build a different

00:24:08.536 --> 00:24:12.936
amplifier, choose a different set of
parameters such that VI prime,

00:24:13.305 --> 00:24:17.838
which is the VI for this guy, is
much less than V capital I prime for

00:24:18.075 --> 00:24:22.608
this guy. It's a design question.
You need to design it in a way that

00:24:22.845 --> 00:24:27.378
the signals of interest need to be
much smaller than the bias voltage

00:24:27.615 --> 00:24:31.081
of this amplifier.
So you may have to use much higher

00:24:32.416 --> 00:24:35.082
supply voltages.
My amplifier, I believe,

00:24:37.248 --> 00:24:41.981
has a 4 volt supply or 5 volt supply.
You might have to use an amplifier

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:46.013
with a much bigger supply,
different values of RL and so on.

00:24:46.914 --> 00:24:51.447
And I know that the course notes
also have some exercises and problem

00:24:51.748 --> 00:24:56.081
sets that discuss that in more
detail. Yes. This is even more fun.

00:24:56.582 --> 00:25:01.048
The question is, good question.
The question is why do you need this

00:25:02.099 --> 00:25:06.099
guy here? Just use this guy,
right? Why do you need this guy?

00:25:08.299 --> 00:25:11.432
Big guys rule, right? Who needs
the little guys?

00:25:14.499 --> 00:25:18.765
Well, let me use the Socratic
method again. Why don't you give me

00:25:20.699 --> 00:25:24.899
the answer? You guys are smart.
Why do you need little guys? Why

00:25:26.899 --> 00:25:30.565
do you need the small guy here?
Anybody with the answer?

00:25:34.142 --> 00:25:37.742
Yeah. The big guy may not be as
sensitive. I like that.

00:25:42.428 --> 00:25:46.428
You know what? He is almost
correct. I will show you why in a

00:25:50.713 --> 00:25:53.646
second. Anything else?
Any other reason? Yes.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.333
Bingo. That is another good answer.

00:26:10.444 --> 00:26:14.844
So let me address both the answers.
The answer given was that look,

00:26:15.332 --> 00:26:19.265
this amplifier is amplifying the
signal by a certain amount,

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:23.953
by a factor of 7. And I have
designed this such that this

00:26:25.109 --> 00:26:27.909
amplifies a signal by
a factor of maybe 10.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
So in all I am getting an
amplification of 70.

00:26:33.624 --> 00:26:33.666
This would be a great design
question for lab next year.

00:26:37.248 --> 00:26:38.024
I give you a bunch of components
and ask you to design an amplifier

00:26:40.872 --> 00:26:41.381
given the constraints with the
highest amount of amplification.

00:26:44.496 --> 00:26:47.696
It turns out that when you design
your amplifier,

00:26:48.122 --> 00:26:51.588
in order to meet the saturation
discipline and so on,

00:26:51.747 --> 00:26:52.854
you have to choose values of RL and
VS and stuff like that and be within

00:26:55.373 --> 00:26:55.746
power constraints so the amplifier
doesn't blow up and stuff.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.123
And by the end of it all you are
going to get a measly 7X gain out of

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:02.865
it. The same way here,
to be able to deal with a very small

00:27:05.821 --> 00:27:08.354
signal here and get some
amplification,

00:27:09.233 --> 00:27:09.487
another set of values and you get
10X. So they multiply.

00:27:12.645 --> 00:27:13.499
It is much harder to build one
amplifier with a much larger gain.

00:27:16.057 --> 00:27:16.911
You know what? I just realized
that we will be looking at this in

00:27:19.469 --> 00:27:20.323
the last five or seven minutes of
lecture. I am going to show you

00:27:22.881 --> 00:27:24.135
what the amplification depends upon.
It depends upon K. It depends upon

00:27:26.293 --> 00:27:30.093
RL. It depends upon VI.
Now the question is I have had all

00:27:30.133 --> 00:27:34.199
this time to think about how to
stitch in sensitive into this,

00:27:34.399 --> 00:27:34.533
and I believe I can. It turns out
that when you have large voltages

00:27:38.665 --> 00:27:38.865
and so on and you have practical
devices, it turns out that the more

00:27:42.931 --> 00:27:46.997
current you pump through devices
they tend to produce noise of

00:27:47.197 --> 00:27:50.463
various kinds.
So very powerful amplifiers are not

00:27:51.463 --> 00:27:51.661
very good at dealing with really
tiny signals because they have some

00:27:55.731 --> 00:27:59.797
inherent noise capabilities.
And so I guess that is sensitive.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.133
It is sensitive to noise.
Another question? Yes.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.733
Ask me the question again.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.066
I didn't follow.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.600
Let me just explain it.
It turns out that I will not be

00:28:38.732 --> 00:28:39.466
able to pass this through the big
amplifier to begin with because it

00:28:42.464 --> 00:28:45.997
is just going to give me a gain of
just a factor of 7.

00:28:46.196 --> 00:28:46.995
However, if I have a signal that is
this big to begin with then I may

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:53.530
just need this amplifier.
I don't need the smaller guy.

00:28:53.664 --> 00:28:54.530
If my signal was this big to begin
with, if I had a strong sensor that

00:28:57.398 --> 00:28:57.664
produced a strong signal to begin
with, yeah, I can deal with

00:29:01.132 --> 00:29:04.265
just a single stage.
I don't need to two stages.

00:29:05.076 --> 00:29:09.076
It is all a matter of design.
And it is actually a fun design

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:12.896
exercise. Given a budget,
dollars, right? You go to your

00:29:13.384 --> 00:29:13.630
supply room and look at the parts
that you have and you go to build

00:29:17.538 --> 00:29:20.938
what you have to build with the
parts that you have.

00:29:21.692 --> 00:29:22.004
And so sometimes you need to build
two amplifiers to get the gain or

00:29:25.846 --> 00:29:29.112
build a signal amplifier.
It's all a design thing.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:30.333
All right. Moving on to Page 7.
That brings us to the small signal

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
model.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.733
Page 5.
What I showed you up on the little

00:29:59.272 --> 00:30:03.672
demo was that provided the signal
input in this example VI was much

00:30:05.816 --> 00:30:09.416
smaller than capital VI out there as
I shrank my input,

00:30:12.361 --> 00:30:16.494
I was able to get a more or less
linear response at the output.

00:30:18.907 --> 00:30:23.507
And so to repeat my notation at the
input, the total input is a sum of

00:30:25.453 --> 00:30:28.853
the operating point input plus a
small signal input.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.466
This is called the total variable.
This is called the DC bias. It is

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:44.636
also called the operating point
voltage. And this is called my

00:30:49.142 --> 00:30:52.208
small signal input.
It is also variously called

00:30:57.713 --> 00:31:01.046
incremental input.
This is more a mathematical term

00:31:04.799 --> 00:31:08.599
relating to incremental analysis or
perturbation analysis.

00:31:10.399 --> 00:31:14.599
So VI, call it small signal,
call it small perturbation, call it

00:31:15.999 --> 00:31:20.199
increment, whatever you want.
Similarly, at the output I have my

00:31:21.599 --> 00:31:26.199
total variable at the output a sum
of the output operating voltage and

00:31:27.199 --> 00:31:31.065
the small signal voltage.
I do not like using Os in symbols

00:31:33.444 --> 00:31:38.244
because big O and small O is simply
a function of how big you write them.

00:31:40.332 --> 00:31:43.398
It is not super clear.
And in terms of a graph,

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:51.753
let me plot the input and output for
you. Let's say this is the total

00:31:54.109 --> 00:31:58.042
input and that is the total output.
I may have some bias VI.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.733
And corresponding to that I may have
some bias VO. Hold that thought for

00:32:06.636 --> 00:32:10.836
a second while I give you a preview
of something that we will be

00:32:12.272 --> 00:32:16.338
covering in about three or four
weeks. Notice that as I couple

00:32:17.908 --> 00:32:21.508
amplifiers together,
the output operating point voltage

00:32:23.544 --> 00:32:28.144
of this amplifier in this connection
becomes the input operating point

00:32:29.181 --> 00:32:33.714
voltage of this amplifier, right?
So when they connect this output to

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:34.533
this input, the output operating
point voltage becomes coupled to the

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:38.200
input here so it becomes the input
operating point voltage here.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:42.533
Now I have a nightmare on my hands.
As I adjust the bias of this guy,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:46.133
the bias of this guy changes,
too. The two are dependent. It is

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.600
a pain in the neck.
And we being engineers find ways to

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.600
simplify our lives.
And you will learn another trick in

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.133
about three or four weeks.
And that trick will let you decouple

00:33:02.727 --> 00:33:07.327
these two stages in a way that you
can design this stage in isolation,

00:33:08.181 --> 00:33:12.581
go have a cup of coffee and then
come back to this stage and design

00:33:13.635 --> 00:33:17.368
this stage in isolation.
For those of you who want to run

00:33:19.089 --> 00:33:23.689
ahead and think about how to do it,
think about it. What trick can you

00:33:24.544 --> 00:33:27.144
use to get them in isolation?
Moving on.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.200
What I would like to do next is
address this from a mathematical

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
point of view.
And much as I did for the light

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.466
emitting expo dweeb analyze this
mathematically and show you that if

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.400
VI is much smaller than capital VI,
I indeed get a linear response.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.466
This time around I won't use Taylor
series because it turns out that

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.466
this expression can
be expanded fully.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.533
So you don't have to buy into Taylor
series and so on.

00:34:05.332 --> 00:34:08.732
I am going to list everything down
for you. We know,

00:34:10.664 --> 00:34:14.797
to begin with, that VO for the
amplifier is VS-RLK/2 (VI-VT)^2.

00:34:15.998 --> 00:34:19.798
What I am going to do for this,
much as I did for the LED,

00:34:21.331 --> 00:34:25.931
what I'm going to do is derive for
you the output as a function of the

00:34:26.665 --> 00:34:29.131
input when the input
VI is very small.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.666
In other words,
when I substitute for VI,

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:42.799
V capital I squared plus small VI.
Much as I did for the expo dweeb, I

00:34:44.399 --> 00:34:48.932
want to substitute for VI a big DC
VI. So VI is much smaller than VI.

00:34:50.599 --> 00:34:54.065
And show you for yourselves that
the output response,

00:34:56.799 --> 00:35:00.065
V small O is going to be linearly
connected to VI.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.133
Notice that, let me write another
equation here.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.933
This is a total variable.
This simply says that if the input

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.666
is VI then the output is going to be
VO, which means that the operating

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.200
point input voltage should satisfy
this equation,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000
correct? In other words,
the operating point output voltage V

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.733
capital O should equal
VS-RLK/2 (VI-VT)^2.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.266
This is at VI equals capital VI.
This is very simple but may seem

00:35:39.199 --> 00:35:43.532
confusing. All this is saying is
that look, this equation gives me

00:35:45.399 --> 00:35:50.065
the relationship between VI and VO.
Therefore, if I apply capital VI as

00:35:51.599 --> 00:35:55.799
the input, I'm given that my
corresponding output is capital VO,

00:35:57.799 --> 00:36:00.532
so they must satisfy this equation,
right?

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.200
Those are bias point values and that
must satisfy this equation.

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:14.966
Simple. I know that. So hold that
thought. Stash it away in the back

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.066
of your minds.
Now let me go through a bunch of

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:27.300
grubby math and substitute for VI in
this expression here.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.066
Let me go ahead and do that.
VS-RLK/2((VI+vi)-VT)^2. When I do

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.466
something that is other than math I
will wake you up.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.866
I will just keep doing a bunch of
steps that are pure math.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.400
No cheating. No nothing.
Watch my fingers. When I do

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.466
anything that is not obvious math I
will wake you up.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.400
Next I am going to simply move VT
over and rewrite this as follows,

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:11.583
RLK/2((VI-VT)+vi)^2. Again, I
haven't done anything interesting so

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:18.900
far. I have just substituted this.
I am just juggling things around

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:24.883
just to pass away some time,
I guess. All right.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.600
Next what I am going to do is simply
expand this out and write it this

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.800
way RLK/2, expand that out and treat
this as one unit VS -

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.466
RLK/2((VI-VT)^2+2(VI-VT)vi+vi^2).
Nothing fancy here.

00:38:07.166 --> 00:38:11.499
This is like the honest board.
Nothing fancy here. Standard stuff.

00:38:13.498 --> 00:38:17.831
Only math. I will move to this
blackboard here where I do some fun

00:38:19.832 --> 00:38:20.832
EE stuff. Yes.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.866
Good. At least one person
isn't asleep here.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
Thank you. So just math here.
Nothing fancy. Plain old simple

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:44.716
math. I have not done any trickery.
I still have all my ten fingers.

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:50.566
Now what I am going to do,
now watch me. I am not using Taylor

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:57.083
series here because this expression
lends itself to this analysis.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.666
Notice VI squared here.
I made the assumption that VI is

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:09.133
much smaller than capital VI,
so what I can do is assuming that VT

00:39:10.599 --> 00:39:15.332
is small enough that VI minus VT is
still a big number compared to small

00:39:16.399 --> 00:39:21.065
VI, what I can do is ignore this in
comparison to the capital VI terms.

00:39:22.199 --> 00:39:26.532
So I have a capital VI term here.
I am going to ignore VI squared.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.400
So, for example,
if capital VI was 5 volts and small

00:39:33.272 --> 00:39:36.538
VI was 100 millivolts 0.
, so 0.1 squared is 0.01.

00:39:38.544 --> 00:39:42.544
So it is comparing 0.01 to 5.
So I am off by a factor of 500.

00:39:43.816 --> 00:39:47.816
So now watch me. Now I begin
playing some fun and games here.

00:39:49.088 --> 00:39:53.088
I eliminate this, and because I
eliminate that it now becomes

00:39:54.362 --> 00:39:57.762
approximately equal.
What I do in addition is let me

00:40:02.142 --> 00:40:05.742
write down the output.
The total variable is the sum of

00:40:12.427 --> 00:40:16.560
the DC bias and some variation of
the output. And let me simply

00:40:22.713 --> 00:40:27.046
expand that term and write it down
again. VS-RLK/2(VI-VT)^2-RLK/2.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.200
I get a two here.
And I get VI-VT. I won't forget

00:40:37.832 --> 00:40:41.165
the VI this time.
Again, from here to there nothing

00:40:42.664 --> 00:40:46.197
fancy. This is the one step where I
have used a trick.

00:40:47.498 --> 00:40:50.964
I have said small VI is much
smaller than capital VI,

00:40:52.331 --> 00:40:56.197
and so I have simply expanded this
out and written it here.

00:40:57.165 --> 00:40:59.898
So do you see the obvious next
trick here?

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.800
From star look at this guy.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.466
I can cancel this out from star
because I know that at the operating

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.466
point these two expressions are
equal, and so therefore I can cancel

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.666
out the operating point
voltage and this.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.466
What I am left with is small VO is
simply minus RLK(VI-VT) times vi.

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:46.600
Only one place where I did
something funny.

00:41:54.599 --> 00:41:58.332
Other than that it is purely math.
So this is what I get.

00:42:02.909 --> 00:42:06.909
Notice that this whole thing is a
constant, minus RLK(VI-VT).

00:42:08.727 --> 00:42:13.127
This whole thing is a constant.
And so VO is equal to some constant

00:42:14.545 --> 00:42:18.811
times VI. Let me just define some
terms for you that you will use

00:42:20.363 --> 00:42:23.563
again and again.
For reasons that will be obvious

00:42:26.181 --> 00:42:29.514
next lecture, I am going to call
this term here GM.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000
I am going to call this term a

00:42:39.666 --> 00:42:43.266
constant, K(VI - VT).
It is a constant for a given bias

00:42:44.998 --> 00:42:47.931
point voltage.
So I am going to call that GM.

00:42:50.331 --> 00:42:53.397
And then I am going to call this
whole thing A.

00:42:55.665 --> 00:42:58.198
And of course this is VI.
There you go.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.733
I have my linear amplifier.
A is the gain times small VI.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.533
And the gain has these terms in it.
I just call this GM. You will see

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.266
why later. But notice that the gain
relates to RL.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.600
The size of the load resistor RL,
how big it is, 1K, 10K, whatever. K,

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.866
this is a MOSFET parameter,
and VI minus VT.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.133
That is a constant for a given bias
point voltage and small VI.

00:43:36.333 --> 00:43:37.799
So VO equals small VI.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.866
I won't give you a graphical
interpretation,

00:43:51.666 --> 00:43:56.199
but I encourage you to go and look
at Figure 8.9 in the course notes.

00:43:56.332 --> 00:44:00.465
And it gives you a graphical
interpretation of that expression.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.066
Move to Page 7.
Another way of looking at this,

00:44:07.362 --> 00:44:11.628
another way of mathematically
analyzing it, here I went through a

00:44:13.725 --> 00:44:18.458
full blown expansion and pretty much
deriving the small signal response.

00:44:20.089 --> 00:44:22.889
What I can also do is take a
shortcut here.

00:44:26.453 --> 00:44:30.653
So let me just give you the
shortcut. You might find this handy.

00:44:32.817 --> 00:44:36.217
VO=VS-KRL/2(VI-VT)^2.
And my shortcut is as follows.

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:42.216
My small signal response is simply
this relationship.

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:48.183
I find the slope at the point
capital VI and multiply by the

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:53.750
increment. Slope times the
increment gives me the incremental

00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:59.116
change in VO as follows.
d/dI (VS-KRL/2(VI-VT)^2) evaluated

00:45:01.699 --> 00:45:04.165
at vI=VI times vi.
This is math again.

00:45:09.099 --> 00:45:13.099
I want to find out the change in VO
for a small change in VI,

00:45:16.499 --> 00:45:20.965
and I do that by taking the first
derivative of this with respect to

00:45:23.899 --> 00:45:28.032
VI substituting V capital I and
multiplying by the small change

00:45:31.299 --> 00:45:34.965
delta VI or small VI.
So this is simply the slope of the

00:45:38.375 --> 00:45:41.841
VO versus VI curve at VI.
And so therefore taking the

00:45:45.125 --> 00:45:48.991
derivative here of this.
This is a constant so it vanishes.

00:45:51.875 --> 00:45:55.875
But twice 2 to cancel out, so I get
KRL(VI-VT) times small vi

00:45:58.625 --> 00:46:01.491
evaluated at capital VI.
So I get twice KRL,

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.200
VI evaluated at capital VI,
so it is VI minus VT times small VI.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.933
Same thing. Oh, and I have a minus
sign here.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.800
I get the same expression that I
derived for you up there,

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:41.000
and this is just taking the slope
and going with it.

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:47.666
And this, as I mentioned before,
this is A. The last few minutes let

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:53.266
me kind of pull everything together
and also hit upon something that

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:57.000
many of your questions
are touched upon.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.466
And that all relates to how to
choose the bias point.

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:09.766
So here I have taken an analysis
approach. When teaching we often

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.333
teach you are given something,
you analyze it, but as you begin to

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:20.900
master it you can begin to design
things where you can ask a lot of

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.133
questions and so on.
And here what we have is an

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.366
analysis given a value
of RLK, VI and so on.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.933
How to choose the bias point becomes
more of a design issue.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:37.600
If you are designing an amplifier,
you asked me the question, how do I

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.466
choose two small amplifiers versus
one big amplifier,

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.533
that sort of stuff?
It boils down to how do you choose

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.400
the bias point?
How do you choose VI?

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:53.200
How do you choose RL and so on?
What I would like to do is touch

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.400
upon some of these things.
First of all, gain or the

00:48:01.583 --> 00:48:04.649
amplification.
One of the most important design

00:48:06.749 --> 00:48:11.215
perimeters for an amplifier is what
is the gain? Let's say you get a

00:48:11.915 --> 00:48:16.581
job at Maxim Integrated Technologies,
and they say we would like you to

00:48:17.081 --> 00:48:21.681
build a linear power amplifier for
cell phones. You can say I know how

00:48:22.248 --> 00:48:25.914
to do that. And then they say the
next stage needs a 100

00:48:27.415 --> 00:48:30.615
millivolt input.
While this thing coming from the

00:48:32.333 --> 00:48:36.266
antenna is only a few tens or a few
hundreds of a microvolt.

00:48:36.999 --> 00:48:41.132
So you sit down and say oh,
my gosh, I need an amplification of

00:48:41.665 --> 00:48:45.731
so much, and you go design an
amplifier. So gain tends to be a

00:48:46.331 --> 00:48:48.797
key parameter.
And notice that gain is

00:48:50.998 --> 00:48:53.998
proportional to RL.
It relates to VI minus VT,

00:48:55.665 --> 00:48:58.798
so proportional to VI.
It is also related to RL.

00:49:01.666 --> 00:49:06.199
The second point is the gain point
determines where I bias something.

00:49:08.998 --> 00:49:13.531
If I choose my bias too high I get
distortion, or if I choose my bias

00:49:16.332 --> 00:49:17.998
too low I get distortion.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:27.600
So depending on how I choose my bias
point, as a signal goes up it may

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.666
begin clipping or begin distorting.
And I will show you a demo the next

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.266
time on that particular example.
So bias point will determine how

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.266
big of a signal you can send without
getting too much distortion.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.933
And the other thing is that,
relates to how big of an input,

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.933
what is a valid input range? So
let's say you have a signal.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.866
And you want that signal to have
both positive and negative

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:08.766
excursions of the same value.
Then, depending on where you choose

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.933
a bias point, your input range may
become smaller or larger.

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:13.733
And we will go through these in the
context of and amplifier and look at

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.533
some design issues in
the next lecture.
