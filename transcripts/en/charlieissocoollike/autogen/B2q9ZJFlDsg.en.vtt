to define although we know that fun

wouldn't really describe the experience

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500
wouldn't really describe the experience
 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.290
wouldn't really describe the experience
as fun although someone else's

as fun although someone else's
 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.979

experience might be different however

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989
experience might be different however
 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.110

although fun is subjective we all

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120
although fun is subjective we all
 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.240

now dopamine evolved as a reward for
 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.590
now dopamine evolved as a reward for
behavior that benefited our survival so

releases dopamine as if to say great job

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030
releases dopamine as if to say great job

do more of that

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990
do more of that
 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.140
do more of that
but science also shows us that it is

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150
but science also shows us that it is
 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.850
but science also shows us that it is
possible to have too much of a good

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860
possible to have too much of a good
 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.429

might feel fun to win at first but when
we repeatedly flood our brain with

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189
we repeatedly flood our brain with
 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.219
we repeatedly flood our brain with
dopamine and high dosages it can

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229
dopamine and high dosages it can
 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.990

actually change the structure of our

actually change the structure of our
 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.870
actually change the structure of our
brain and thus our behavior this is what

which definitely is not fun

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500
which definitely is not fun
 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.100
which definitely is not fun
but provided that it's not excessive fun

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110
but provided that it's not excessive fun
 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.680
but provided that it's not excessive fun
can definitely be good for you it can

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690
can definitely be good for you it can
 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.140

pretty fun right here's a fun fact if

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390
pretty fun right here's a fun fact if
 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.850
pretty fun right here's a fun fact if
you can convince your brain that you're

you can convince your brain that you're
 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.100

learned something and if you're looking
 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.240
learned something and if you're looking
to learn more science with the help of

to learn more science with the help of
 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.880
to learn more science with the help of
fun why not try brilliant the people who

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890
fun why not try brilliant the people who
