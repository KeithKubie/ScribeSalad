00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.760
Ian can rake a lawn and bag
the leaves in 5 hours.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.030
Kyandre can rake the same lawn
and bag the leaves in 3 hours.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.510
Working together, how long would
it take them to rake the

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.670
lawn and bag the leaves?

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.390
So the best way to think about
this is think about how many

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.850
bags per hour each
of them can do.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.520
And then we could add the number
of bags per hour they

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.190
could produce, and then use that
to figure out how many

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.770
hours per bag.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.735
So this first piece of
information, Ian can rake a

00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:35.920
lawn and bag the leaves
in 5 hours.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.980
So Ian is 5 hours per bag.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.880
Or you could view this if
we invert it, as 1/5

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.190
of a bag per hour.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.310
Or 1 bag every 5 hours.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.950
This and this is saying
the exact same thing.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.230
We can do the same thing
for Kyandre.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.970
In his or her case-- I'm not
sure whether Kyandre is a boy

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.350
or girl's name.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.410
He-- well I'll say she.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.710
She'll take 3 hours per bag.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.230
So it's 3 hours per bag.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.500
Or that's another way of saying
she can do, if you

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:31.080
invert this, 1/3 of
a bag per hour.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.650
You could just view it
as 3 hours per 1 bag.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.010
You invert it and you get
1 bag per 3 hours.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.250
1 bag for 3 hours.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.500
This is 5 hours per 1 bag.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.340
Same thing as 1 bag
per 5 hours.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.050
You're just inverting the ratio,
not really changing the

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.150
information.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.340
Now, what's their
combined rate?

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:57.490
Well, Ian can do 1/5 of a bag
per hour and Kyandre can do

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.350
1/3 of a bag per hour.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.440
So what is this going
to be equal to?

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.030
Well, we find a common
denominator here.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.110
Least common multiple
of 5 and 3 is 15.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.710
So let's put it over 15.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.110
So 1/5 is the same thing as
3/15 of a bag per hour.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.630
Want to keep the units
here bag per hour.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:26.310
And then 1/3 is the same thing
as 5/15 bags per hour.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.360
So when you add them you
get-- 3 plus 5 is 8.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.500
So this is equal to 8/15
bags per hour.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.700
When I say bag, I mean all the
stuff: rake, lawn, and bag.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.380
The whole task's per hour.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.350
8/15 of a task per hour.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.570
So working together, how long
would it take them to rake the

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.020
lawn and bag the leaves?

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.510
Well, this is how many of the
bagging they can do per hour.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.740
You could invert this.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:59.930
So if you invert that, you get
this is equal to 15 over 8

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:07.640
hours per bag.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.280
Or if we want to write this as
a mixed number, this is equal

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.860
to 1 and 7/8 hours per bag.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.560
Let me write it like this.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.856
1 and 7/8 hours per bag.

00:03:23.856 --> 00:03:27.040
And if we really want to get a
sense of what 7/8 is in terms

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.520
of hours, we can multiply
it by minutes.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:37.730
So 7/8 hours times 60
minutes per hour.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.910
Let's see what we can do here.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.850
60 and 8 are both
divisible by 4.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.460
8 divided by 4 is 2.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.090
60 divided by 4 is 15.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.410
7 times 15 is-- 7
times 10 is 70.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.720
Plus 35 is 105.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.040
So this is equal to
105/2 minutes.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.030
Which is equal to what?

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.930
52.5 minutes.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:17.279
So as a combined effort, it will
take them 1 hour and 52.5

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.930
minutes to do it together.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.529
And we're done.
