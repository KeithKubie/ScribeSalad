00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.150
So, congratulations. You've built a web crawler. You've learned to

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.590
crawl. We're not quite at flying yet, but this is a

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.960
lot that you've learned in just three units. And by learning

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.560
about lists, we can build any other structure we want starting

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.350
from lists. And we'll see lots of other things that we

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.660
do in the next unit, as well as the units that

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.400
follow that. That use lists. We haven't quite finished building a

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.410
search engine. We have a way of getting a great start

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.630
towards our purpose, finding all these pages to crawl. What we

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.120
need in Unit Four is the way to get the content from

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.232
those pages, by starting from our seed page, and following the

00:00:35.232 --> 00:00:38.640
crawl web procedure that you wrote. And then we'll use that to

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.280
build an index, so we can respond to queries when someone's

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.480
doing a search for a particular term. The other thing we'll do

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.320
in Unit Four is, we'll learn more about how the Internet and

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.450
the web work. I'm here with Anna Patterson who's built a bunch

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.270
of search engines, including building the world's

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.940
largest index of the web. And now

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.200
works for Google. And we've just finished building a very simple web crawler. I

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.810
want Anna to tell us something about how things are different if you want to

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.534
build a web crawler that works with the scale that Google has to deal with.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.080
&gt;&gt; So there's three main issues with scaling up

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.470
a web crawler. One is the normal politeness that

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.890
you need on the Web. The second one is

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.810
how you get a bunch of machines involved in crawling,

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.710
not just one. And the last issue is how to consume a lot of bandwidth so

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.700
that you keep the expensive resource busy. While

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.500
still being polite. So, on politeness, there's a line

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.220
in the robots.txt that each domain tells you

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.990
how often you can crawl that domain. There's a

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.480
number of problems with that, which is that

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.360
multiple domains can be hosted with a hosted service,

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.850
and they can be hosted even on one machine.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.920
So even though you're being polite to one domain, you're

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.470
really actually really hurting a hosting service, or you're hurting

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.300
a machine. So you have to make plans in order

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.560
to not hit one machine or one domain too

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.180
hard. The next thing is, that if you crawl on

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.990
just one machine. It, the state is very good, and

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.160
it's really easy to keep the state of the crawl

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.080
on the one machine. But then it's hard to

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.030
make a very big search engine, because you get as

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.790
much as one machine will crawl. So of course in

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.950
practice, you crawl on thousands of machines. Now, if you're

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.720
going to obey politeness, that means that each of your

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.610
thousand machines, needs to tell the other ones, what it

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.650
has crawled and what it's about to crawl and what

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.260
it, going to crawl in 20 minutes, right? All of this

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.460
communication overhead can actually slow down the crawler,

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.100
which actually hurts your aim of having a

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.190
big search engine. The last part is that

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.250
you want to max out your bandwidth. So one thing

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.390
that people do instead of trying to lessen

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.690
the communication, is they pre-process the corpus that

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.750
they already have. So when you've crawled a

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.600
set of pages you can process them and extract

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.900
out all the links that they point to. You can then normalize those links so

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.060
that Yahoo.com and dubdubdub.yahoo.com wind up being the

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.700
same string, and now you can farm those

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.660
strings out to your thousand machines, and

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.940
now they don't have to communicate because they

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.800
know they're not going to hit the same domain.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.790
However, they could accidentally hit the same hosting

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.790
service and the same machine, but you can

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.420
take care of that ahead of time as well.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.130
&gt;&gt; Thanks a lot Anna. I hope those of you who think about unleashing

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.690
your web crawler on the world, pay

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.680
careful attention to what she said about politeness.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.859
&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me, and students, good luck on your search engines.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.020
&gt;&gt; So I hope we'll see you back

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.860
soon. You'll have a homework for Unit three that's

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.160
going to be quite challenging, and I look

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.930
forward to seeing all of your answers to it.
