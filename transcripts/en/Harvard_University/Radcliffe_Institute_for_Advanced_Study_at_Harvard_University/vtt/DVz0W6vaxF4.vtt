00:00:04.667 --> 00:00:05.750
- Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.070
I'm Tomiko Brown-Nagin,
the Dean of the Radcliffe

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.930
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.750
I'm so happy to see you
today and to welcome you

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.060
to today's Kim and Judy Davis
dean's lecture in the arts.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.420
This event is part of a series
established by Kim and Judy

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.780
Davis to feature leading
artists, scholars,

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.710
and scientists in public
talks here at Radcliffe.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.509
I'm so glad to see Kim
Davis in the audience today.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.240
Kim, thank you so much
for your generous support.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.370
I'd also like to
acknowledge and thank

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.550
members of the Radcliffe
Institute Leadership Society

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.260
and all of our
dedicated annual donors.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.260
Thank you.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.180
This afternoon's
program features

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.320
Xu Bing, a prolific
and versatile artist

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.270
working at the
forefront of Chinese

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.150
and global contemporary art.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.810
Xu has presented his work,
which includes mixed media

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.690
installations,
prints, and sculptures

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.900
and recently film at major
venues around the world,

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.540
including here at Harvard.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.650
I'm thrilled to welcome
Xu back to campus.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.390
In installations of often
all unsparing scale,

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.620
Xu's art confronts us with the
instability of our perceptions

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.270
and our assumptions.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.760
As it does so,
Xu's art addresses

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.560
some of the
fundamental challenges

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.810
of contemporary society--

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.980
the precarious connections
between language and truth,

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.970
the difficulties of translation
across cultural and linguistic

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.050
boundaries, and the status
of the image in an era

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.750
of omnipresent surveillance.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.070
Let me share just
a few examples.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.860
Perhaps Xu's most
iconic work is Book

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.070
from the Sky, a monumental
installation that

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.180
complicates the relationship
between tradition, authority,

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.560
and meaning.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.680
This work earned Xu
international acclaim,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.120
including a MacArthur
Foundation Genius award.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.890
Created over four years
and finished in 1991,

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.590
Book from the Sky features
books, hanging scrolls,

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.140
and wall panels, all
of which Xu produced

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.920
using traditional Chinese
block carving, typesetting,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.620
and book binding techniques.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.980
While Book for the Sky
invites reading, no part of it

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.110
can actually be read.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.300
This is because the
text features thousands

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.780
of glyphs that closely
resemble Chinese characters

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.760
but have been carefully
designed to be

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.550
devoid of semantic meaning.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.400
By drawing us in this
way, Book from the Sky

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.590
exposes the fragility
of perception

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.050
and of the written word itself.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.370
We're left to wonder how much
our habitual acts of reading

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.580
and recognition rely only
on surface level appearance.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.180
Xu's art also addresses the
relationship between meaning

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.660
and translation and how a
work impacts one audience

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.160
differently from another.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.790
For example, in Square
Word Calligraphy,

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.610
Xu developed a system
of creating pictograms

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.920
of written English words that
resemble Chinese characters.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.220
To English language
readers these pictograms

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.450
appear indecipherable but are
perfectly readable upon closer

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.040
inspection.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.980
By contrast to Chinese
readers, the characters

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.980
might seem legible
at first glance

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.760
but they are in
fact indecipherable.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.200
In another series of works
titled Background Story,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.630
Xu explores recognition
and misrecognition

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.760
in visual traditions.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.790
He presents what seem
to be traditional ink

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.660
paintings of landscapes, but
as viewers approach the works,

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.570
they come to see
that each painting is

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.990
in fact a shadow and light
box insulation created

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:07.110
from carefully arranged
trash and natural debris.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.650
And finally, Xu's reset feature
length film, Dragonfly Eyes,

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.910
which the Harvard film archive
screened yesterday evening,

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.360
continues his career
long exploration

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:26.210
of meaning and perception
in a fascinating new format.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.510
In just a few minutes,
we'll hear directly from Xu.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.520
He'll present brief
remarks and then

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.060
engage in a discussion with
two Harvard faculty members

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.930
on the full range of
his work, its impact

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.550
on contemporary arts, and
the overarching question what

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.480
counts as art today.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.300
Throughout his
distinguished career,

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.240
shoos Xu has pushed boundaries
of what's considered fine art.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.930
He's received numerous awards,
including the MacArthur Genius

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.660
Grant that I mentioned
earlier and a medal of arts

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.730
from the US State Department.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.600
Currently, he serves as a
professor at the Central Art

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.100
Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing
and as the Andrew DY Professor

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.580
at Large at Cornell University.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.950
Xu's conversation
partners this afternoon

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.460
are Jennifer Roberts
and Eugene Wang.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.950
Jennifer is the
Johnson-Kulukundis family

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.890
faculty director of
arts here at Radcliffe

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.470
and the Elizabeth
Cary Agassi professor

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.280
of the humanities in the
faculty of Arts and Sciences.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.550
Eugene is the Abby Aldrich
Rockefeller Professor

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.180
of Asian Arts in the FAS, as
well as a former Radcliffe

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.470
Fellow.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.240
I'm delighted to have
both of them here today.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.440
Now please join me in warmly
welcoming Xu Bing to the stage.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:59.508
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:59.508 --> 00:06:03.360
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.940
- Thank you, Dean Brown-Nagin,
for your introduction.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.180
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.670
- The fact that Harvard
invited me to give this talk,

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.420
I feel like I have to
thank a lot of people.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.840
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.540
- We also have to thank Mr. Kim.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:31.800
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.480
- And also professor Eugene Wan.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.820
He did a lot for this event.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.280
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.250
- As well as Professor Roberts.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.140
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.640
- And a lot of other people,
of course, but mostly I

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.950
want to thank everyone
for coming today.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:53.565
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:06:53.565 --> 00:06:57.587
- So today, , mainly we're going
to be engaging in a dialogue.

00:06:57.587 --> 00:07:03.890
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.760
- But before doing
that, I thought

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.000
that I would take 15 minutes to
give you a brief introduction

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.500
to my works.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.120
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.016
- Because I'm not that famous,
so there's a lot of my works

00:07:18.016 --> 00:07:19.890
that maybe a lot of you
aren't familiar with.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:28.757
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:07:28.757 --> 00:07:31.090
- So actually currently at
the Ullens Center in Beijing,

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.597
I have a relatively
large exhibition

00:07:33.597 --> 00:07:34.680
that's going on right now.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:40.320
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.680
- This exhibition is exhibiting
about 40 years worth my work.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:55.390
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.060
- So after doing
this exhibition,

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:01.200
I started to think about what is
it exactly that an artist does

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:01.920
with his life?

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:12.480
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.390
- So I discovered that actually
what an artist is doing

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:19.650
his entire life is
creating a kind of insular

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:26.070
or insulated a garden or
a courtyard of himself.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:39.510
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:42.600
- So within this garden, an
artist work, his previous work,

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.830
his current work,
it's continually,

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:50.460
sort of, mutually
re-activating and triggering,

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.970
stimulating each other.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:09:10.880
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.890
- So for example, there are
elements of your earlier work

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.340
that in later works it kind
of comes to the forefront,

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.800
and people only realize
after seeing your later work

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.660
that actually the
same elements already

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.520
existed in your earlier work.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.390
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:30.390
- But this type of thing only--

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.370
is only implicated
through later work.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:46.180
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.360
- Even though formally
speaking earlier work

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.640
might be really different
from later work,

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.120
but actually earlier work
serves as a commentary

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.560
or interpretation of later work.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:02.280
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.470
- I started off
learning printmaking,

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:08.170
and I received my education in
the People's Republic of China.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:12.820
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.480
- I wanted to briefly
first introduce this.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.800
This work is called a
five series of repetition.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.720
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.590
- So what this word is I was
examining the repetitive nature

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:30.620
of print-making.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:43.370
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:46.990
- So I've always been, sort of,
examining why does print-making

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:50.890
exist as an art form and
alongside things like oil

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.810
painting and other
forms of painting.

00:10:53.810 --> 00:11:12.340
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.370
- So it's the same block, but
on the left this was before

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.010
anything had been carved .

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.630
And then the middle it's when
a few things had been carved.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.910
And then later more
things have been carved.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.500
And this was-- this
is the same block,

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:27.217
but it was all printed in a
series on a piece of paper.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:35.080
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.200
- And I continue to carve
and continue to print.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.180
It's actually all
just one block.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:44.260
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.620
- Though in normal conception,
the one on the left

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.980
should be what we consider
a completed print.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.690
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.850
- But I continue to carve.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:55.860
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.592
- And then the images
start to disappear.

00:11:58.592 --> 00:12:03.630
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.630
- And so in the end it becomes
a work where there's nothing

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:07.830
there and just white.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:11.710
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.380
- So it's a process
of transforming

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:17.330
from a black nothingness
to a white nothingness.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:24.530
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:27.410
- So this type of
plurality is something

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:29.746
that I think has
a special power.

00:12:29.746 --> 00:12:38.330
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.040
- It's the same reason why the
New York Times, for example,

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.480
has such power, because
it has this plurality.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.520
It has this series
repetitive nature.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.280
That's why it can be
distributed around the world.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:13:01.100
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.790
- That's why cell phones,
for example, today--

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:05.600
cell phone interfaces
have such power,

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.355
because they can be
endlessly repeated.

00:13:08.355 --> 00:13:17.220
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:20.900
- So contemporary society has
a particular characteristic,

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.170
which is that it takes us
into this space where things

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.210
are endlessly reproduced.

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:33.020
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.760
- A lot of Avant
Garde disciplines

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:38.570
when they go into this
Avant Garde sort of area,

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:42.730
it all has to do with repetitive
nature, including biology.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:47.960
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.980
- This is a Book of the
Sky, which dean has already

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:52.580
introduced.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:14:00.350
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.510
- This was an
installation, but it was

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.210
composed of many, many words.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:11.210
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:13.350
- These words look a lot
like Chinese characters,

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:16.760
but there isn't a single one of
them that can be actually read.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:21.680
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.760
- And I was very
assiduous about this,

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.590
so every single character
was hand-carved and printed.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:35.660
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.480
- Because I wanted this
book to have a lot of,

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.120
sort of, gravitas so that
people, when they read it,

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.120
they wouldn't be able to
believe that all this effort

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.730
and it becomes a book
that you can't read.

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:55.380
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.560
- So in 1990, I came
to the United States

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:02.530
and my work then was all
slightly smaller installations.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:08.740
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:10.830
- But then I realized
wherever you live

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:15.230
and wherever a problem exists
that there art exists to.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:21.410
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.240
- So back then a
lot of my work had

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.490
to do with language and
culture and the clash

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:27.240
between languages and cultures.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:37.195
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:15:37.195 --> 00:15:41.360
- For this work I used something
that was written by a Columbia

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.640
professor, and then
I asked someone

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.920
to translate it into English.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:52.100
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.380
- And then from English,
then it was translated

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:55.610
into other languages--

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:56.650
French, Italian.

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:59.374
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:15:59.374 --> 00:16:01.040
- And then from that
language translated

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.800
into German and other languages.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:12.980
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.770
- And then into
Japanese and other types

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:20.870
of languages, so basically just
endless series of translation

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.430
and then at the very
end back into Chinese.

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:31.190
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.800
- So at that time I was trying
to investigate this sort

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.780
of cultural misunderstanding.

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.390
How does that happen?

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:41.780
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:45.460
- This was in the
year 2000 at the MOMA.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:50.570
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:54.020
- So actually because this was
introduced just now earlier you

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.152
already know how to read this.

00:16:56.152 --> 00:17:02.918
- A-R-T F-O-R T-H-E P-E-O-P-L-E.

00:17:02.918 --> 00:17:05.185
- People.

00:17:05.185 --> 00:17:07.700
Art for--

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:18.829
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:23.220
- And this idea actually came in
1993 and '94, and then later I

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.619
also turned the gallery
into an art classroom.

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:35.379
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:17:35.379 --> 00:17:37.920
- So finally when you actually
try to write these characters,

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.711
you realize that these
characters that look

00:17:39.711 --> 00:17:42.960
like Chinese calligraphy, oh,
actually, I can read them.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:53.060
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.682
- So for this classroom
I created a textbook,

00:17:55.682 --> 00:17:57.390
and it looks like it's
a Chinese textbook

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.550
but actually it's
an English one.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:09.480
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.340
- So this is a early sketch.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:15.630
It shows how I went from
the alphabet to the strokes.

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:22.020
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.060
- This is me experimenting
with whether or not

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.240
I could create a character
for the longest English word

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.150
possible.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:32.870
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:34.530
- So actually it's
all a group, so it

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.140
goes from the top to
bottom from left and right.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:41.514
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:18:41.514 --> 00:18:42.930
- So then I became
a calligrapher,

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:45.300
and a lot of people asked me
to write different things.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:19:04.860
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.540
- So actually this
particular work

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.880
has a commonality with all
the rest of my work, which

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.030
is that I always
really like to push

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:15.510
the way we think, the way
people think into a corner,

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:16.737
into a dead end.

00:19:16.737 --> 00:19:21.510
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:25.230
- And in this corner, all of
our old ways of thinking--

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.030
they don't function anymore.

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:36.290
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:39.264
- So for example, we have ideas
or concepts about what makes--

00:19:39.264 --> 00:19:39.930
what is English?

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:40.710
What is Chinese?

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:42.990
But with this type of
calligraphy, neither of those

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:44.220
function.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.832
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:19:47.832 --> 00:19:49.290
- Because when
you're writing this,

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:50.520
you really don't
know whether you're

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.645
writing English or Chinese.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.580
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.640
- So next there was a work
called Book from the Ground.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:11.100
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.230
- So this book was written with
emojis, icons, punctuation.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:22.270
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:24.860
- It's actually a story
book that narrates

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.860
a person's life in 24 hours.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:31.730
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.350
- You can try to read it.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:34.320
Someone woke up.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.720
He went to the bathroom.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.062
- And he couldn't
make it, right.

00:20:38.062 --> 00:20:41.756
- But he was constipated.

00:20:41.756 --> 00:20:45.399
- In the thinking, the problem,
my stomach has problem,

00:20:45.399 --> 00:20:46.940
and then he feel
[INAUDIBLE],, right.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.010
He's a play the--

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:49.840
- Social media.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.740
- Oh, social media.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.652
Now he's finished, right.

00:20:54.652 --> 00:21:03.140
So I mean, even looking back
then the flash, yeah, flash.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:07.940
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:12.340
- This was collected
from airplane bathrooms.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:16.630
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:19.430
- So none of these icons,
none of these emojis,

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:20.930
I didn't design
any of them myself.

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:22.160
I just collected them.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:27.260
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:30.200
- Because it was my
belief that only collected

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.780
icons or emojis had this
sort of essence of language.

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:43.070
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:46.610
- Because it was the extent
of globalization these days.

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:50.120
It's like a new type of
pictograph is emerging.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:58.080
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.050
- So this is the exact
opposite or inverse

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:02.600
of the Book from the Sky,
because that one no one

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.500
could read it and this
one everyone can read it.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:12.110
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.690
- These two books were-- these
two works were very different

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:16.530
but they have one
thing in common,

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:18.740
which is that they
treat everyone equally.

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.460
They're equal to everyone.

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:26.510
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:30.210
- They both go beyond
our preconceived cultural

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:31.770
hierarchies.

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:41.300
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:45.150
- So this is from the Ullens
Center where I had my exhibit.

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:47.630
What I did was we moved--

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:50.720
we basically recreated
what my workshop

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.040
looked like when we were
creating Book from the Ground.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:23:02.960
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.840
- So the material, the raw
material for this project

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.090
grew and grew, because
actually what I like to do

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:11.510
is I like to use materials that
are in the process of becoming,

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:13.560
that are in the
process of growing.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:20.940
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.670
- So we also did
all of the software

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:25.100
where you can input
English or Chinese

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:28.150
and then icons come out.

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:30.250
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.120
- This was something
that was at the MOMA--

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.040
an exhibit that was at
the MOMA a few years ago.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:39.105
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:23:39.105 --> 00:23:44.510
- So for me I like to take
one theme, a one thing idea,

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:48.130
and repeatedly explore it.

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:56.000
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:56.930
- So this was--

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:58.820
we used this to
create a pop up book.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:23.450
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:25.330
- He's actually--
the function of--

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:28.360
the function of folks has
been replaced by touchscreens.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:32.020
So actually physical books they
are very important in the sense

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:38.150
that they preserve this
tactile sort of feeling.

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:45.197
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:24:45.197 --> 00:24:47.780
- So this story at this point
is talking about a guy getting--

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:50.196
he got drunk at the bar and
his friend is taking him home,

00:24:50.196 --> 00:24:52.690
but the friend
can't find his keys.

00:24:52.690 --> 00:25:11.702
- [SPEAKING CHINESE] So

00:25:11.702 --> 00:25:13.660
- This is from a project
called Where the Dust,

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.100
where does the
dust itself settle.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:17.650
And that the previous picture
was a picture from outside

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.980
of my workshop, my office,
and my studio in New York.

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:23.410
And I witnessed the
twin towers falling.

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:26.600
And as an artist, you don't
know how to cope with that.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:34.370
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:36.970
- So then I went downtown and
I collected a bag of dust,

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:40.270
because at that time all
of the lower Manhattan

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:41.400
was covered in dust.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:54.220
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:57.430
- So we took the dust and
blew it onto the exhibit--

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:58.900
exhibition hall.

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.630
And then after we did that,
we took away the stencils.

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:06.170
And then what remained
were two lines of words.

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:09.870
- As there is nothing from
the first, where does the dust

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:11.190
itself collect?

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:13.690
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:19.780
- This is a seventh century zen
saying, Chan saying from China.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:23.990
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:26.530
- And next this work is
called Background Story.

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:30.607
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:26:30.607 --> 00:26:32.440
- This is a new work
that's also being shown

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.350
at the Ullens Center right now.

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:41.290
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:43.480
- This painting that we
see is actually a painting

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.912
that doesn't really exist.

00:26:45.912 --> 00:26:53.380
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.650
- It's actually the
result of us adjusting

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:58.020
the lighting and
the space behind it,

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:02.530
and then the painting shows
itself on the surface in front.

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:08.640
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:13.585
- We made this glass
into this frosted glass.

00:27:13.585 --> 00:27:17.020
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.330
- So this is a painting
from Zhang Daqian.

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:24.630
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:28.960
- But it was constructed using
different colored plastic bags.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:31.500
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.400
- This was at the Beijing
Plastic Collection Center.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:39.010
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:40.770
- So a lot of
factories in Beijing

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:44.640
have now been turned
into art institutions.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:54.510
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:59.010
- So using the plastics there
I reproduced a blue green--

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:03.180
traditional Chinese blue
green landscape painting.

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:13.920
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.820
- So actually classical Chinese
blue green landscape painting

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:19.500
was actually almost
like a warning

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.200
to us today that, actually,
we can use plastic bags

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.530
to create the same thing.

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:26.180
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.902
- This is just some detailing.

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:39.124
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:28:39.124 --> 00:28:40.540
- So actually the
painting that we

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:42.370
see before us isn't on paper.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:43.750
It's not an oil painting either.

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:47.500
It's not really a painting
that exists materially.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:29:01.691
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:29:01.691 --> 00:29:03.940
- So in my artwork, what I
really like to do is I like

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:09.040
to work very hard to create a
type of reality that's actually

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:13.240
an illusion that doesn't--
it doesn't actually exist.

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:20.080
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:25.520
- So this was created
using 660,000 cigarettes.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:30.720
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:34.700
- So if someone smokes two
packs a day, in 45 years

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.450
this is how many he
would be smoking.

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:50.660
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:52.970
- So this was actually
a touring exhibition.

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:55.270
So it went to Virginia,
went to different places.

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:58.300
And actually every place
that it exhibited at

00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.880
had a history with tobacco.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:06.012
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:30:06.012 --> 00:30:10.120
- And at every location based
on the history of tobacco

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.810
there that there was a
new work that was created.

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:24.220
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.470
- So this is, sort
of, tiger skin design.

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:27.580
It's very interesting.

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:30.040
From one place you look at it,
it looks like a tiger skin.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.623
But you walk to the other end,
and it looks like a zebra skin.

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:39.999
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:30:39.999 --> 00:30:41.790
- And next there was
a work called Phoenix.

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:48.460
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:49.790
- So this was very large.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:52.570
This is my first work
after I got back to China.

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:55.250
Each one was 30 meters long.

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:57.220
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:58.990
- Because in China
everything's huge.

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:05.329
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:31:05.329 --> 00:31:07.120
- Well, actually the
World Financial Center

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.330
commissioned this work.

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:14.570
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:16.870
- But when he arrived at
the construction site,

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:21.670
he was very deeply impacted by
the situation of the workers.

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:34.870
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:38.050
- So then I thought would it be
possible to take the, sort of,

00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:40.330
scraps left from
construction and the tools

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:42.100
that construction
workers use and use

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.490
that to create a work that
would hang in this big new--

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:47.110
brand new building.

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:55.940
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:58.450
- So actually hidden within
a lot of these materials

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:01.960
were LED lights so
that when night falls

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.540
you can see the lights.

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:21.671
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:32:21.671 --> 00:32:23.170
- But because in
China, as you know,

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:25.315
everything is always
changing, and then we

00:32:25.315 --> 00:32:26.519
had the Beijing Olympics.

00:32:26.519 --> 00:32:28.810
And then after that there
was a global economic crisis.

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:30.184
And then basically
the people who

00:32:30.184 --> 00:32:32.110
commissioned it
no longer thought

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:33.592
that art was so important.

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:40.507
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:32:40.507 --> 00:32:43.090
- So then they looked at him and
said, oh, this work, kind of,

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:43.930
looks incomplete.

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:45.346
Shouldn't you,
like, maybe in case

00:32:45.346 --> 00:32:47.690
it in Crystal or something.

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:55.480
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:59.440
- So in the end, this work
was not hung in that building,

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.380
and so it, kind of,
toured around the world.

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:04.700
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.390
- So this is in New
York in a cathedral.

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:12.600
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.550
- And then it went to Venice.

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:18.050
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:20.580
- So Venice at night
is very beautiful.

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:24.310
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:25.920
- But not a lot
of people saw it,

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:29.570
because in Venice
things close at 7:00 PM.

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:41.290
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:42.690
- But this was
the very last part

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:45.510
of my exhibition at
the Ullens Center.

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:49.440
And so each of these computers
show a contemporaneous footage

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.170
from surveillance cameras.

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:56.670
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:33:56.670 --> 00:34:01.530
- Including surveillance
footage from the museum itself.

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:11.469
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:14.190
- So just a brief introduction
then to Dragonfly Eyes,

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:17.610
which will take up the
majority of conversation today.

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:20.219
And I'll just show a
two minute trailer.

00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:29.719
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:32.190
- This is dragonfly.

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:38.800
Dragonfly has 28,000 eyes
blinking 40,000 times

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:39.730
per second.

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:46.007
Hour by hour, checking.

00:34:46.007 --> 00:34:52.630
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:55.787
- Second by second, deleting.

00:34:55.787 --> 00:34:58.320
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.650
- Searching, identifying.

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:18.038
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:35:18.038 --> 00:35:21.524
- Scenes, roles, characters.

00:35:21.524 --> 00:35:28.040
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.310
- This is a man.

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:33.752
He will be seen
300 times each day.

00:35:33.752 --> 00:35:35.200
This is a woman.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.860
Her privacy is all used up.

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:42.858
The man and the woman meet.

00:35:42.858 --> 00:35:57.596
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:35:57.596 --> 00:36:02.145
- He and she leave data.

00:36:02.145 --> 00:36:07.965
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:36:07.965 --> 00:36:09.990
- A lay Buddhist.

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:13.659
A non-believer?

00:36:13.659 --> 00:36:38.510
[CRASH]

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:57.452
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:36:57.452 --> 00:37:00.030
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:04.910
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:06.660
- This is a narrative
fiction film.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.510
And the film is 81 minutes long.

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:16.130
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:18.830
- What's special about this
film is that every frame of it

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:20.600
really happened.

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:27.200
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.870
- It's different from any
fiction film that we have

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:31.250
watched before,
because fiction--

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:34.210
all other fiction
films are fabricated.

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:48.900
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.330
- So considering time,
maybe we should move on

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:52.390
to the conversation.

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:56.300
But it is true, in fact,
that all of my previous work

00:37:56.300 --> 00:38:00.660
has a very intimate relationship
with Dragonfly Eyes.

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:15.130
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:18.340
- This is I consider
an artwork of mine,

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:22.080
and basically I use
the format of a film.

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:41.420
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:44.350
- So basically I like to--
this is what I like to do with

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:44.850
my work.

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:48.290
I like to work really
seriously doing something,

00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:50.600
and then what I'm
actually trying to say

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.670
is not actually the
thing that I made.

00:38:53.670 --> 00:39:00.240
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:01.820
- For example, with
this film there's

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.550
no way for us to really
judge is this a documentary

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:07.320
or is this a narrative film.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.200
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.700
- Because it's more
real than a documentary.

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:19.244
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:39:19.244 --> 00:39:21.410
- Because with documentaries
what you're doing often

00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:24.386
is can you just repeat
what happened or you

00:39:24.386 --> 00:39:25.760
interview someone
or you say, oh,

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.635
can you walk through
that door one more time.

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:31.580
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:36.170
- So within that-- inherent
in that is an unrealness.

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:44.089
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:39:44.089 --> 00:39:45.630
- So we screened
that film yesterday.

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:47.338
I'm sure everyone has
a lot of questions.

00:39:47.338 --> 00:39:49.497
So let's proceed on
to the discussion.

00:39:49.497 --> 00:39:50.330
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:51.200
- Thank you.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:40:00.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:09.550
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:10.050
- Thank you.

00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:11.970
That was wonderful.

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:15.360
Once again, thank you to
everyone for coming today.

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:21.150
I want to extend a
very special thanks

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:24.059
to Joy Chen who is our
translator and interpreter

00:40:24.059 --> 00:40:24.600
this evening.

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.528
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:31.725 --> 00:40:35.220
As we've seen so
much of Xu Bing's art

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:39.884
contends with complexities of
translation, so it's actually,

00:40:39.884 --> 00:40:41.550
I think, wonderful
that we have a chance

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:44.460
to experience this
in an embodied way

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:45.790
tonight in this discussion.

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:47.910
So thank you so much, Joy.

00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:48.768
So we have about--

00:40:51.319 --> 00:40:52.860
why don't we ask
questions, and we'll

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.550
talk for about 15 or 20 minutes.

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:58.860
And then we'll move to
questions from the audience.

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:00.840
And maybe I'll start.

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:03.510
Many of us are, I
think, still reeling

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:06.960
from the incredible screening
of Dragonfly Eyes last night

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.940
at the Harvard Film Archive.

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:11.610
And thanks to the Harvard
Film Archive and its director

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:15.600
Haden Guest for arranging this.

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:20.920
I wanted to ask Xu if
you could say something

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:28.130
about your discovery and use of
facial recognition technology

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:30.440
in surveillance
video, which I imagine

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:34.160
must have been extremely
important for you

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.590
both because so
much of your work

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:40.460
seems to be about recognition
and the difficulty

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:45.110
of recognizing or that moment
when a form snaps into meaning

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:48.020
in a particular reader
or viewer's mind.

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:53.030
And that also so much of your
prior work has to do with,

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:57.530
as you've put it, the
semiotic and schematic quality

00:41:57.530 --> 00:42:00.800
of Chinese art and images.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.300
And just yesterday
in the print room

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:05.617
you had said that
in Chinese art,

00:42:05.617 --> 00:42:07.700
the character for a tree
and an image for the tree

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.560
are the same.

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:13.880
And throughout your film, we
have these video images that

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.530
are being rapidly labeled--

00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:19.070
automatically labeled by
the recognition technology.

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:21.590
So I wonder if you could just
talk a little bit about how

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:24.260
you've used that, how
it came into the film,

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:25.645
and how it worked.

00:42:25.645 --> 00:43:09.800
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:20.660
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:23.500
- So it took about five years
for us to make this film,

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.970
and within these five years,
surveillance technology

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:30.140
was continually, sort of,
improving and developing.

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:37.040
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:39.290
- So as an artist,
I really wanted

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:43.550
to make sure that every frame we
used was surveillance footage.

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:50.870
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:55.220
- So you have the idea
that in two years, sort of,

00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:58.100
those devices in cars that
record what's happening

00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:00.160
within the car, those appeared.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:04.070
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:06.140
- And then body
cams that cops wear.

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.830
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:10.130
- Go Pro, the Go
Pro that you wear.

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:13.819
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:44:13.819 --> 00:44:15.860
- And then with the advent
of these technologies,

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:18.660
it changes our previous
conception of surveillance.

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:26.164
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:44:26.164 --> 00:44:27.830
- Because in the past,
surveillance was,

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:29.510
kind of, stationary
in one place.

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:32.372
But now surveillance moves
as well, moves with us.

00:44:32.372 --> 00:44:33.580
It has to do with our bodies.

00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:39.894
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:44:39.894 --> 00:44:41.810
- And then towards the
end, facial recognition

00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:44.030
developed very rapidly.

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:52.404
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:44:52.404 --> 00:44:53.820
- So you can see
that in our film,

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:57.110
there are many layers,
different ways of treating

00:44:57.110 --> 00:44:58.849
this very complicated
phenomenon that's

00:44:58.849 --> 00:44:59.890
happening in our society.

00:44:59.890 --> 00:45:16.460
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:19.252
- So it's almost like a Chinese
Theater or a Chinese drama.

00:45:19.252 --> 00:45:20.960
You have these twists
and turns, and it's

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:24.160
like using this technology
to try to parse out

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:25.450
the different elements.

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:42.920
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:47.000
- So then that's why we
use this, sort of, square

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.610
and the search function and
then that is accompanied

00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:51.050
by a computer's voice.

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:53.490
And this computer's
voice has a, sort of,

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:55.310
a dumbed-down quality to it.

00:45:55.310 --> 00:46:00.150
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:02.880
- So it says things
like man, woman, car.

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:09.190
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:11.570
- But we discovered that
this type of simplicity

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:15.080
actually shares something
with classical Chinese poetry

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:15.935
or Japanese haikus.

00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:26.620
- OK, Xu Bing, welcome
back to the Harvard.

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:28.180
You've been here
a number of times,

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:32.230
and each time is a quite
meaningful experience.

00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:35.320
And so I want to just
take this occasion--

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:38.170
it's such a rare occasion
where I have you,

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:41.620
one of the most celebrated
print-makers in the world,

00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:44.230
and also I have Jennifer
who studies prints

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:46.750
and one of the eminent
scholar of print.

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:52.720
So it's a rare occasion
that I can use your own word

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:57.340
to corner you or corner
your thinking to push you

00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:58.660
to the corner I think.

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:01.330
So I know you.

00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:06.070
I follow your career,
and for decades, we've

00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:07.120
been old friends.

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:10.540
And one thing I
often tell people

00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:15.403
is that as a print-maker,
Xu Bing is a control freak.

00:47:15.403 --> 00:47:17.926
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:29.740
You always want to make
sure that all the steps that

00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:32.590
lead to the final product
should not go wrong.

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:38.270
I remember you were
making that how

00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:43.610
to have the cocoon spin
out web that can eventually

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:45.020
cover a computer set.

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:53.830
That has to involve ordering
certain kind of spring worms

00:47:53.830 --> 00:47:54.505
from Texas.

00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:03.990
They'll come-- they have to
arrive at a certain time,

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:06.530
and the timing will be so
perfect so that they can spin.

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:17.430
So knowing you with that kind
of control freak mentality, how

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:21.840
you have to work with
a medium that is--

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:24.310
could potential get out of hand.

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:31.432
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:48:31.432 --> 00:48:36.870
Especially when this film
is a film without involving

00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:41.030
your team taking a single shot.

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:44.980
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:49.520
So I imagine that you would
like the fact that there

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:54.740
were emergent properties from
this medium or production

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:56.820
process.

00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:57.950
- That he likes--

00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:59.532
- Yeah, you like that fact.

00:48:59.532 --> 00:49:06.635
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:49:06.635 --> 00:49:12.950
And that in some ways is a
departure from your earlier

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:15.686
printmaking self.

00:49:15.686 --> 00:49:21.225
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:49:21.225 --> 00:49:25.440
And also I found this
kind of intriguing

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:30.600
that as a print-maker,
you use hand a lot.

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:36.262
And now you let your hand idle.

00:49:36.262 --> 00:49:41.080
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:43.840
Yesterday, we were in
the viewing session,

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:49.480
and when you demonstrate how
the carvers work their wrist,

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:53.140
your hand was dancing
in the air all the time.

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:55.540
And that was quite
amazing movement.

00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:58.430
I can't help marveling at that.

00:49:58.430 --> 00:50:02.790
So now it's the eye taking over.

00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:04.130
Hand is idle.

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:09.521
Do you feel a sense of loss?

00:50:09.521 --> 00:50:12.320
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:16.010
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:18.080
- Very good question,
Professor Wang.

00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:26.900
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:30.110
- So, in fact, I did go through
a very rigorous conservatory

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:34.020
training, art school training.

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:41.950
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:45.670
- So my training in printmaking
was very helpful to me.

00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:59.390
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:02.670
- Because printmaking is a
very indirect form of art.

00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:06.020
So it requires a lot
of control to break

00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:08.380
through the limitations
of the form.

00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:19.310
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:22.170
- So if you're not
particular about every step,

00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:25.920
then the end result
will be just a mess.

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:33.690
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:35.810
- But I have a
personal preference,

00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:40.170
which is that I like to do
things that are challenging.

00:51:40.170 --> 00:51:43.260
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:45.870
- If it's something that anyone
can do or everyone can do,

00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:48.110
then it's not worth me doing it.

00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:57.020
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:59.890
- So even works like
the silkworm work

00:51:59.890 --> 00:52:01.880
that you mentioned,
it looks like it's

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.320
very, sort of, spontaneous.

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:06.230
But actually it
acquired a lot of work.

00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:10.709
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:52:10.709 --> 00:52:12.500
- Because we had to
control it so that when

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:14.450
the exhibit opened,
these silk worms

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:16.270
are actually spinning silk.

00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:22.640
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:26.690
- But every type or species
of silkworm when it starts

00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:28.380
producing silk, it's different.

00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:47.820
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:49.200
- So what did we do?

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:52.400
We had to order first a
specific species of silkworms

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:54.990
and then actually feed
them and let them grow

00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:58.490
and then record when they start
producing silk and all of that.

00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:03.760
And then use that
to do the work.

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:27.730
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:29.880
- So I've exhibited
all over the world,

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:33.690
and basically what people say
about me is I'm too picky.

00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:36.500
Because basically, if I
go into an installation

00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:38.135
and I don't feel
right in the space,

00:53:38.135 --> 00:53:39.885
then I go back and
check the measurements.

00:53:39.885 --> 00:53:45.740
Then definitely it's always true
that they didn't adhere exactly

00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:47.210
to the measurements.

00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:55.816
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:53:55.816 --> 00:53:57.690
- So to a lot of people
maybe they would say,

00:53:57.690 --> 00:53:59.260
oh, it's just a little
bit of a difference.

00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:00.009
It doesn't matter.

00:54:00.009 --> 00:54:05.100
But to me, it effects the
overall effect of the work.

00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:12.532
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:54:12.532 --> 00:54:16.170
- So actually Dragonfly
Eyes has a, sort of,

00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:20.950
internal connection to my
previous printmaking work.

00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:31.900
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:33.880
- So it's about
taking this limit--

00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:36.610
a limitation and
then transforming it

00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:37.670
into something special.

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:44.640
- We have just a
couple more minutes

00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:46.950
before we move to the audience.

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:50.415
Perhaps, a good final
question from us

00:54:50.415 --> 00:54:54.780
would be just to ask you
where you see your work going

00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:59.730
now and in the future and about
how Dragonfly Eyes has perhaps

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:01.542
changed the trajectory
of your work.

00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:15.080
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:23.710
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:27.600
- You can see that my work
takes a lot of different forms,

00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:29.830
and that's because
I don't really

00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:33.130
take art style that seriously.

00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:42.520
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:44.910
- Because I want to say
something no one's said before.

00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:47.680
And if I want to say it in
a proper way and a way that

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:52.040
really gets at it, it has
to be in an interesting way.

00:55:52.040 --> 00:56:02.400
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:05.110
- And the formats and
styles that the old masters

00:56:05.110 --> 00:56:08.260
used, for example, to
express their ideas, that

00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:11.470
was particular to their time
and what they wanted to say.

00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:18.580
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:22.040
- Including my own artistic
language from my older works,

00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:26.510
I can't just co-op that
into my current work either.

00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:39.900
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:43.360
- Because to me my art has
to do with your sensitivity

00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:48.850
to the present moment and
then how you take old forms

00:56:48.850 --> 00:56:51.460
and transform that using
your current sensitivity

00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:53.930
to the contemporary society.

00:56:53.930 --> 00:57:10.440
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:13.530
- And it's necessarily the
case that contemporary society,

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:17.620
the way things are right now
within that there is more--

00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:21.600
there are more avenues for
creativity and the more

00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:24.320
inspiration can be found
in the present moment.

00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:33.930
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:57:33.930 --> 00:57:37.850
- So regarding what I'm doing
next, actually, I don't know.

00:57:37.850 --> 00:57:41.890
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:57:41.890 --> 00:57:44.970
- But I trust that I
have something to say.

00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:50.326
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:57:50.326 --> 00:57:52.200
- Because this world is
changing too quickly.

00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:56.440
There are too many questions
that need us-- need answers.

00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:00.330
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:02.810
- To me, art is not something
you get from planning.

00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:07.680
- Very good.

00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:13.870
OK, the magic microphone is
coming up to the center aisle.

00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:17.260
I wanted to-- we want to
open the floor to about 15

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:20.266
or 20 minutes of questions.

00:58:20.266 --> 00:58:22.390
I know many of you were at
the screening last night

00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:25.640
and may have
questions about that.

00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:27.430
If you do have a
question for Xu Bing,

00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:30.740
please come up to
the microphone here.

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:35.260
And please identify yourself
prior to asking your question.

00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:37.980
And we'll have questions for
15 minutes or so and then

00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:39.070
a reception downstairs.

00:58:39.070 --> 00:58:39.770
- No problem.

00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:42.070
My name is Claribel Santiago.

00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:46.150
When you lived in New York
and you witnessed personally

00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:50.710
your journey of
9/11 and you said

00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:54.730
that changed you as an artist,
did that change you to--

00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:59.200
now to just focus--

00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:06.640
not focused, but now look for
the pain of others in your art

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:07.860
now?

00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:17.210
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:23.770
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:59:23.770 --> 00:59:25.630
- So actually at the
time I witnessed--

00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:29.070
I saw with my own eyes
the twin towers falling.

00:59:29.070 --> 00:59:35.890
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:59:35.890 --> 00:59:40.840
- But actually what I thought
of in the moment was the scene

00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:43.590
on Chang'an Street on June 4th--

00:59:43.590 --> 00:59:45.690
the June 4th incident.

00:59:45.690 --> 00:59:51.070
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:59:51.070 --> 00:59:52.870
- And in that moment,
I thought, wow,

00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:56.357
from this moment on this world
is really going to change.

00:59:56.357 --> 01:00:02.040
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:05.050
- Because when we left
Beijing back then, we had--

01:00:05.050 --> 01:00:07.220
back then Beijing wasn't safe.

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:12.400
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:16.000
- And now New York has become
a place that isn't safe.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:32.176
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:00:32.176 --> 01:00:33.550
- But what really
impacted me was

01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:36.580
when I walked out of my
building the next day,

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:41.680
I felt like the entire
balance of the ecosystem was--

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.440
it was all array, because
suddenly these two

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.460
big buildings were not there.

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:55.420
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:58.750
- There was an article, a
report then also of a parent

01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:01.810
telling their child, oh, if you
can't find your way home just

01:01:01.810 --> 01:01:03.170
look for the twin towers.

01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:05.410
And with that, you'll be
able to find your way home.

01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:11.830
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:13.360
- But faced with
such an incident,

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:15.896
you really don't
know what to do.

01:01:15.896 --> 01:01:25.640
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.310
- But because I have this habit
of collecting raw materials,

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:31.472
so then I went down to the
site and collected some dust.

01:01:31.472 --> 01:01:32.930
But actually at
that time, I didn't

01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:34.138
know what I would do with it.

01:01:39.450 --> 01:02:10.339
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:02:10.339 --> 01:02:12.130
- Would you like to
translate her question?

01:02:12.130 --> 01:02:15.880
Summarize what she asked so that
the audience know what you--

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:17.127
your question.

01:02:17.127 --> 01:02:19.929
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:02:19.929 --> 01:02:23.170
- So her question is
about why he didn't

01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:25.225
include a particular work.

01:02:25.225 --> 01:02:28.000
The English title is
like the-- is it utopia?

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.390
No, it's the--

01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:31.690
It's the peach
blossom, but it's--

01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:33.880
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.520
- Anyway, her question
was why did you not

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:39.905
include that work in
your introduction today.

01:02:39.905 --> 01:02:42.280
Is it, because you don't see
it as being in the same vein

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:44.990
as the other works.

01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:52.890
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:02:52.890 --> 01:02:54.410
- So I actually have a lot--

01:02:54.410 --> 01:02:57.850
I have produced a lot of work,
so I already went over time.

01:02:57.850 --> 01:03:02.940
So it wasn't possible
to include everything.

01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:04.190
- So, hi, how are you?

01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:07.520
So welcome to Harvard,
and I actually

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:09.650
saw your exhibition
in Metropolitan

01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:11.490
and also in Beijing.

01:03:11.490 --> 01:03:13.430
I was really honored
to have you here.

01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:19.580
And my question is in China
actually the freedom of speech

01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:22.980
become a little bit more
restrict in the recent years.

01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:26.510
And as an artist,
artist want to be free

01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:29.430
and want to have the freedom
to do whatever they want to do.

01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:32.330
But when you are
approaching your art,

01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:35.422
how do you have that
consideration when

01:03:35.422 --> 01:03:36.630
you are approaching your art?

01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:40.580
Would you like
modify it in some way

01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:45.750
or soften the stand you
have in your art work.

01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:49.490
The second question
is your attitude

01:03:49.490 --> 01:03:54.560
to or your evaluation of Ai
Weiwei, which is a very--

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:59.840
like a political artist
and what's your attitude

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:03.680
to his art work and his career.

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:04.320
Thank you.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:17.090
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:04:17.090 --> 01:04:21.470
- So it's true that China is a
very political kind of society.

01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:24.480
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:28.070
- But actually America
is that way too.

01:04:28.070 --> 01:04:42.420
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:44.600
- So as an artist, even
if you're not directly

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:48.120
dealing with political
things in your work,

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:51.200
it's always inevitable that
you have this undercurrent

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.480
of politics in your work.

01:04:53.480 --> 01:05:04.686
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:05:04.686 --> 01:05:06.940
- So every artist has a
different personality,

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:11.460
and for example, Ai Weiwei is
a more direct kind of person.

01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:14.464
So he's-- he'll deal with issues
more directly, and he'll--

01:05:14.464 --> 01:05:16.130
he's the type of
person who wants to get

01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:18.210
into a fight with you directly.

01:05:18.210 --> 01:05:22.170
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:05:22.170 --> 01:05:25.010
- But other artists have other
personalities where maybe you

01:05:25.010 --> 01:05:28.750
want to deal with problems in
a other way-- in another way.

01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:30.990
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:34.960
- So it's just different.

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.550
- Hi, my name's Kalis.

01:05:36.550 --> 01:05:39.770
Thank you Xu Bing for coming to
Harvard and giving this talk.

01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:42.986
My question is what do you think
this movie-- or what are your--

01:05:42.986 --> 01:05:44.860
what are your thoughts
on what this movie has

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:48.010
to say about contemporary
Chinese society.

01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:50.497
And like I know it
probably couldn't

01:05:50.497 --> 01:05:52.330
be made in the United
States, and if it was,

01:05:52.330 --> 01:05:53.270
it would be very different.

01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:54.940
But what do you think
about this movie

01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:58.240
makes it uniquely Chinese
and exemplifying something

01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:59.740
about contemporary
society in China.

01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:11.160
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:13.190
- So actually the
target for this movie

01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:16.690
Dragonfly Eyes is
the entire world.

01:06:16.690 --> 01:06:23.330
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:06:23.330 --> 01:06:24.830
- Because actually
our world today

01:06:24.830 --> 01:06:30.460
has become a gigantic
camera studio.

01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:35.660
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:37.850
- It's a lot like
the social imaginings

01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:41.180
that we found in
The Truman Show.

01:06:43.970 --> 01:06:50.300
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:51.800
- So in this film,
I actually didn't

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:55.020
want to directly talk
about surveillance.

01:06:55.020 --> 01:07:07.640
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:11.220
- Because the very fact
that someone can take solely

01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:13.220
surveillance footage and
make a narrative film--

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:17.420
and make a film out of it, that
already says something about

01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:19.760
the state of our society.

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:27.240
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:30.770
- And I didn't want
to directly talk

01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:34.394
about this kind
of Orwellian 1984.

01:07:34.394 --> 01:07:40.550
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:42.940
- Because to me this type
of concept everyone knows.

01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:46.650
So there is-- it's not
necessary to talk about it.

01:07:46.650 --> 01:07:55.140
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:57.140
- But to me what I
wanted to express

01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:59.330
was that to me actually
we've already entered

01:07:59.330 --> 01:08:01.850
into a post surveillance era.

01:08:01.850 --> 01:08:13.220
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:17.090
- Because at least in China,
most of the surveillance--

01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:19.790
the footage that's being
taken, it's all been controlled

01:08:19.790 --> 01:08:23.250
by private companies
as well as individuals.

01:08:23.250 --> 01:08:31.340
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:33.620
- So actually 99 % percent
of the footage that you see

01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:35.990
in this film, it's all
stuff that was uploaded

01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:38.710
by individuals or by
these private companies.

01:08:38.710 --> 01:08:52.310
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:08:52.310 --> 01:08:55.430
- So actually, the use
of surveillance footage

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:59.240
has really expanded into
the individual's hands,

01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:04.000
and it has gone way beyond
what Orwell imagined in 1984.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:14.870
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:17.300
- But actually this is
something that most people don't

01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:19.460
recognize, and actually
this is what I wanted

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:21.578
to talk about in the film.

01:09:25.310 --> 01:10:04.550
- [SPEAKING CHINESE] So my
question is how do you define

01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:07.280
the relationship and the
connection between painting

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:08.220
and words?

01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:10.182
Thank you.

01:10:10.182 --> 01:10:17.550
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:20.870
- So in China it's true that
words and images have a very

01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:21.920
special relationship.

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:26.400
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.350
- So you write the
character for mountain

01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:31.570
and you're actually
painting a mountain as well.

01:10:31.570 --> 01:10:48.339
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:10:48.339 --> 01:10:50.630
- So it seems that these days
young people what they're

01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:54.170
looking for is a very
direct, a very simple way

01:10:54.170 --> 01:10:56.720
of communicating--

01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:59.510
a way of communicating that
doesn't require much learning

01:10:59.510 --> 01:11:00.620
preferably.

01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:17.915
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:11:17.915 --> 01:11:21.410
- So for example, the Book
from the Ground, actually,

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:24.860
I had the idea for this
work about 16, 17 years ago.

01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:28.350
But at the time not
enough emojis and icons

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:30.930
existed to make it.

01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:43.210
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:11:43.210 --> 01:11:45.620
- So this type of thing
developed very quickly,

01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:47.720
and to a certain
extent, you could

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:50.330
say that it really is
replacing traditional language,

01:11:50.330 --> 01:11:51.120
traditional words.

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:58.940
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:01.160
- So you can say that
the icons that you

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:03.390
find in Book from the
Ground, they really do

01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:06.738
possess a very strong
language element to them.

01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:14.660
- Xu Bing, thank you
very much for being here.

01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:15.760
It's an honor.

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:17.890
My name is Paula Billups.

01:12:17.890 --> 01:12:22.840
You spoke in your
talk about the garden

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:27.460
that an artist builds around
themselves so that eventually

01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:29.530
you find that you're
surrounded by your work

01:12:29.530 --> 01:12:31.120
and that the past
and the present

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:34.900
begin to speak to each other.

01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:37.390
Now that you're
furthering your career

01:12:37.390 --> 01:12:38.470
and you're on the other--

01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:41.560
you're on maybe in
the middle of that,

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:46.990
do you feel that you can
predict what you're yet older

01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:49.220
self will be saying to you now?

01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:50.890
Are you still having
those conversations

01:12:50.890 --> 01:12:53.150
between past and present?

01:12:53.150 --> 01:12:57.370
How do you view that sense
of garden, that sense

01:12:57.370 --> 01:12:59.307
of the circle around you?

01:13:03.283 --> 01:13:06.490
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:13:06.490 --> 01:13:10.400
- In fact, this type of
feeling of speaking to yourself

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.350
is strengthened.

01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:20.380
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:22.570
- So actually the
cultural DNA that everyone

01:13:22.570 --> 01:13:26.370
possesses with them is
very deeply embedded.

01:13:26.370 --> 01:13:28.590
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:30.700
- But when you need
it, it emerges.

01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:33.832
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:13:33.832 --> 01:13:35.540
- Sometimes it emerges,
and it helps you.

01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:37.460
Sometimes it's harmful to you.

01:13:37.460 --> 01:14:03.700
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:07.141
- So it's like, for example,
in my wood block work earlier,

01:14:07.141 --> 01:14:09.766
printing work, I realized that
I was really interested in this,

01:14:09.766 --> 01:14:11.920
sort of, the layout of
the earth and the way

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:13.667
you organize things.

01:14:13.667 --> 01:14:16.000
And then I realized that was
because during the Cultural

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.810
Revolution I was involved a
lot of the layout of newspapers

01:14:19.810 --> 01:14:20.560
and magazines.

01:14:24.170 --> 01:14:34.240
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:39.100
- So it's more like my work now,
that's the way through which I

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:42.790
look at my past and say, oh, so
actually those elements already

01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:43.960
existed back then.

01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:47.030
But I only know-- recognize it
like through my current work.

01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:55.235
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:14:55.235 --> 01:14:58.840
- So actually in a way what
an artist ends up doing,

01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:01.040
it's kind of faded in a way.

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:02.710
There's a faded quality to it.

01:15:02.710 --> 01:15:03.710
There's a destiny to it.

01:15:03.710 --> 01:15:11.150
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:15:11.150 --> 01:15:13.570
- So for example, say I really
like a certain style, not

01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:14.625
my style.

01:15:14.625 --> 01:15:16.750
But if that's not-- it that
does not belong to you,

01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:20.190
no matter how hard you work
at it it's not going to work.

01:15:20.190 --> 01:15:22.570
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:15:22.570 --> 01:15:25.126
- What belongs to you even
if you try to throw it away,

01:15:25.126 --> 01:15:26.160
it won't go.

01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:34.330
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:36.220
- Like when I was
making Book from the Sky

01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:38.110
I really wanted
to make something

01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:42.300
that would be in alignment
with contemporary Western art.

01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:46.510
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:49.440
- Because I wanted to escape
from our socialist art.

01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:54.940
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:57.990
- But to go into a new art form,
I didn't know what that was.

01:15:57.990 --> 01:16:09.012
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:16:09.012 --> 01:16:10.720
- And under those
circumstances, what you

01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:14.840
end up producing is the most
real expression of who you are.

01:16:20.490 --> 01:16:22.600
- Hi, thank you for coming.

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:25.170
My name's Indigo [INAUDIBLE],,
and I saw your Phoenixes

01:16:25.170 --> 01:16:26.710
in New York about
five years ago.

01:16:26.710 --> 01:16:28.410
And it's one of the
things that, like,

01:16:28.410 --> 01:16:30.830
really just kind of blew
me away at the time.

01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:33.036
And I think the
thing that I'm really

01:16:33.036 --> 01:16:34.410
interested in in
all of your work

01:16:34.410 --> 01:16:36.660
is the labor that goes
into it that I think

01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:39.750
it's almost like hidden
by how put together

01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:41.380
and how complete they are.

01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:44.042
And I really wanted to know
what your, like, values

01:16:44.042 --> 01:16:46.500
were in regards to that labor
and how it's, kind of, become

01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:48.720
a vehicle for the
content and the ways

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:51.422
in which you conceptualize
that in your work.

01:16:51.422 --> 01:16:53.250
Thank you.

01:16:53.250 --> 01:16:56.390
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

01:16:56.390 --> 01:17:16.000
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
- So I always require
that in all of my works

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.830
the core concept has
to be very sturdy.

01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:28.726
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:17:28.726 --> 01:17:30.850
- And once that's clear,
the core concept is clear,

01:17:30.850 --> 01:17:34.340
then you have to give it
your all to realize it.

01:17:34.340 --> 01:18:02.020
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:05.110
- So like Professor Wang
mentioned earlier about

01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:08.650
how with this new work the
hand, kind of, lays idle.

01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:11.140
But actually it's just a
different type of labor.

01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:13.250
It just requires maybe
the hand is not moving,

01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:15.850
but it requires a large
amount of labor as well.

01:18:15.850 --> 01:18:23.080
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:25.160
- So for-- in order
to make this film,

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:31.000
we downloaded 11,000
hours of footage.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:41.750
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:43.360
- Because this
type of technique,

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.960
no one has ever used it before.

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:46.200
So we really just--

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:48.130
we didn't know how
to go about it.

01:18:48.130 --> 01:19:00.670
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:19:00.670 --> 01:19:04.810
- But I trusted that
within this mass volume

01:19:04.810 --> 01:19:07.020
of data that was being
collected locally

01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:10.290
that we would be able to find
what we needed to tell a story.

01:19:10.290 --> 01:19:28.360
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:29.950
- So in the beginning,
it was almost

01:19:29.950 --> 01:19:31.450
like we were creating libraries.

01:19:31.450 --> 01:19:34.630
So we were categorizing things
by like a temple and then

01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:36.680
big temple, small
temple, northern temple,

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:38.740
southern temple, oh, two
monks walking this way,

01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:40.014
three monks walking that way.

01:19:40.014 --> 01:19:41.680
And we categorized
everything like that,

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:44.230
because we didn't know what
footage we would need yet.

01:19:44.230 --> 01:20:16.000
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.360
- So in the process of making
the film it was a continuous

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:22.529
back and forth between the
editors and the screenwriters,

01:20:22.529 --> 01:20:24.820
because sometimes you-- the
screenwriters have a really

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:27.137
great idea but you can't
find the material for it.

01:20:27.137 --> 01:20:28.720
And sometimes the
editor will discover

01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:30.680
something that
wasn't in the script

01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:32.960
but that's really interesting.

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:46.555
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:20:46.555 --> 01:20:49.670
- So at the end when the
story was almost complete,

01:20:49.670 --> 01:20:51.010
we were missing one shot.

01:20:51.010 --> 01:20:56.200
And this one shot was shot of
a rainy night on a mountainside

01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:58.210
and you see a car
driving by, but we

01:20:58.210 --> 01:21:00.380
couldn't find this footage.

01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:02.530
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:21:02.530 --> 01:21:04.620
- So first we had to check
the weather forecast.

01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:06.200
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:07.700
- Where is it going
to rain tonight?

01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:18.460
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:19.990
- So we'd work for
so long that we

01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:22.550
knew where we would be able
to find that sort of image,

01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:25.120
and so we focused on
that particular spot

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:26.920
and waited to see
if did it really--

01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:28.753
every morning, like,
did it rain that night?

01:21:28.753 --> 01:21:30.430
Did a car pass by?

01:21:30.430 --> 01:21:32.200
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:34.330
- And this requires
a lot of labor.

01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:39.880
- OK, I think we have time
for one more short question,

01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:41.290
and then we'll move on.

01:21:41.290 --> 01:21:43.050
- I'll keep it short.

01:21:43.050 --> 01:22:17.650
- [SPEAKING CHINESE] So my
question was there are a lot

01:22:17.650 --> 01:22:19.650
of intersection between
commercial opportunities

01:22:19.650 --> 01:22:21.240
and art in China.

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:23.400
Art is not only limited
to galleries anymore,

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:28.950
but art are in shopping malls
and other commercial spaces.

01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:33.980
So I'm just wondering what are
Xu Bing's thoughts on that.

01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:47.880

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.680
- Art has a lot of
different functions.

01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:52.430
So sometimes it's
to beautify a space,

01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:56.670
and sometimes it
can be a commodity.

01:22:56.670 --> 01:23:11.140
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:13.610
- So sometimes I think
why is it that I'm

01:23:13.610 --> 01:23:15.440
able to sell my artwork?

01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:16.820
Why are collectors interested?

01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:18.500
I mean, really, like,
a lot of my works

01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:21.060
are just a bunch of scraps.

01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:41.900
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:44.630
- But then I think maybe
what they're collecting,

01:23:44.630 --> 01:23:47.750
what museums and collectors
are collecting is that--

01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:51.650
is the special kind of concept
or way of thinking that is

01:23:51.650 --> 01:23:54.110
expressed through my artwork.

01:23:54.110 --> 01:24:13.950
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

01:24:13.950 --> 01:24:17.540
- So there are artists, street
artists who, sort of, paint

01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:19.370
and sell as they go.

01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:21.204
And that's also-- that
exists for a purpose.

01:24:21.204 --> 01:24:22.703
And then there's
maybe other artists

01:24:22.703 --> 01:24:24.875
who their whole life they
just sell one concept.

01:24:27.945 --> 01:24:32.220
- OK, great we have
more time for discussion

01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:34.830
downstairs in the reception,
which follows this event.

01:24:34.830 --> 01:24:38.760
So it's just down in the
first floor of this building.

01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:42.310
I want to thank, again,
Joy, Xu Bing, and Eugene.

01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:44.410
Thank you so much, and
thanks to all of you.

01:24:44.410 --> 01:24:47.460
