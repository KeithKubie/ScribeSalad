This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Squarespace.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.430
Surfers think catching a gnarly wave is radical?

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.600
Thanks to some science we can ride air currents
at almost the speed of sound with 200 ton

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.300
surfboards in the sky.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.750
How’s that for radical?

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.230
Hey silver surfers, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.940
British airways flight 114 recently made a
transatlantic crossing almost an hour quicker

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.720
than usual, and was clocking ground speeds
of 745 miles per hour, or nearly 1,200 kph.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.600
It’s been making news because that is a
frankly ludicrous speed, considering the speed

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.359
of sound at that altitude is somewhere around
1100 kph.

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:42.829
But when you take into account the airspeed,
that is the speed the airplane is traveling

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.510
through the air around it, instead of the
groundspeed it didn’t actually break the

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.399
sound barrier, which is a good thing because
the Boeing 777 really wasn’t designed for

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:52.399
that.

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.889
Fortunately for everyone stuck in coach, the
aircraft was riding a particularly ferocious

00:00:55.889 --> 00:01:00.019
jet stream that was at times over 320 kilometers
per hour.

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:01.910
But why do we have jet streams?

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.940
First of all jet streams are not unique to
earth.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.350
We’ve observed them on Jupiter and Saturn.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.570
Here on Earth jet streams form in the troposphere,
the lowest atmospheric level, and there can

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.811
be many that swirl and flow and join and split.

00:01:13.811 --> 00:01:17.869
Most of them head from west to east, so if
you’ve flown from North America to Europe,

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.469
you’ve probably noticed your flight is shorter
in that direction.

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:24.930
The one you and flight 114 cruised on is the
northern hemisphere’s polar jet stream.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.689
The polar jet streams are from 7 to 12 kilometer
up, but each hemisphere also has weaker subtropical

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.789
jet streams that are 10 to 16 kilometers up.

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.960
Jet streams form at boundary layers between
warm air and cold air.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.340
The higher pressure cold air pushes into the
low pressure area, and in the winter the pressure

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.729
differences are greater so you get stronger
winds.

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.369
But the wind doesn’t just move in a straight
line from pole to tropics because of the coriolis

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:49.369
effect.

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.670
Basically the planet spinning underneath the
moving air deflects it east.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.450
Higher in the troposphere there’s less friction
so these winds can go unbroken for thousands

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.100
of miles and voila, jet steam.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.479
Throw in modern air travel and if you’re
lucky you can get where you want to go at

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:03.479
almost the speed of sound.

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.580
Switching gears for a second, we'd like to
thank Squarespace for this episode of DNews.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.900
Squarespace recently launched the latest version
of their platform, Squarespace Seven, which

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.360
has a completely redesigned interface, integrations

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.100
and an incredible feature called Cover Pages.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.030
Go Anywhere.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.160
If you don’t think I’ve gone basic enough
to explain why there are jet streams, Trace

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.380
explains air itself here.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.170
Also, you were probably one of those kids
who kept asking why all the time, huh?

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.640
I like it, keep it up.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.770
So planning a world trip, would you head westerly
to ride the current, or east to west to feel

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:45.840
like a time traveler?

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.430
Tough call, but me, I like cruising into the
sunset for hours.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.870
Let us know in the comments and I’ll see
you next time on DNews.
