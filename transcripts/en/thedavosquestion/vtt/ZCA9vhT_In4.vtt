&gt;&gt; [Music playing]

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.139
&gt;&gt; It's a big, big question.
Not easy.

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.699
&gt;&gt; So the Davos question has been asked.

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:12.731
&gt;&gt; Hello, Davos people.

00:00:12.731 --> 00:00:14.691
&gt;&gt; The Davos question --

00:00:14.691 --> 00:00:15.691
&gt;&gt; Davos question.

00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:17.040
&gt;&gt; [Speaking in foreign language]

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.040
&gt;&gt; [Speaking in foreign language]

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.440
&gt;&gt; Today I would like to mention this Davos
question.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.440
&gt;&gt; The Davos question.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.440
&gt;&gt; I'd like to answer --

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.440
&gt;&gt; The Davos question

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.620
&gt;&gt; The Davos question.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.190
&gt;&gt; I'm replying to the Davos question.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.349
&gt;&gt; What one thing --

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:27.349
&gt;&gt; -- Do you think --

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:28.349
&gt;&gt; -- That countries --

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.349
&gt;&gt; -- Companies --

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:30.349
&gt;&gt; -- Or individuals must do --

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:31.349
&gt;&gt; -- To make the world --

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.349
&gt;&gt; -- A better place --

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.539
&gt;&gt; -- In 2008?

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.840
&gt;&gt; There's different countries, different
companies, and different

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.130
individuals.
So I don't know about 6 billion or something.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.440
6 billion with a "b".
This is kinda difficult because everyone's

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.059
gonna have different
answers.

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.370
&gt;&gt; [People talking all at once]

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.750
&gt;&gt; Loads, and loads, and loads, and loads
of different answer because

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.260
everyone got their own individual perspective
of how they see things

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.390
and how they see the world.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.140
&gt;&gt; We need to find a way to stop the poverty
rate from going up and

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.180
make it go down!

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.329
&gt;&gt; Why does our world not have a safe blood
supply?

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:10.859
&gt;&gt; Covering the globe with, uh, high speed
two-way.

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:11.859
That's where we gotta go.

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:13.490
&gt;&gt; Invest in kids.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.119
&gt;&gt; Water shortage will be a key challenge
facing the world in the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.279
first half of the twenty-first century.

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:24.640
&gt;&gt; By investing in renewable energy, perhaps
we can save many of the

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.990
species that are dying because of the impact
we cause to the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.460
environment but more importantly we will also
avoid struggles and war,

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.330
and is that not what we want for our children?
A world in which we can work together in peace?

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.280
&gt;&gt; As a writer, as a human being, I think
that everybody in the world

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.889
is commited to improve the state of the world.

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:55.270
&gt;&gt; We have to be able to communicate the best
that we can from

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.409
generation to generation, and build upon the
past, and improve upon

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.409
the past.

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.200
&gt;&gt; Try to open your mind to what other people
are saying and let's

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.030
share our ideas and let's progress.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.389
