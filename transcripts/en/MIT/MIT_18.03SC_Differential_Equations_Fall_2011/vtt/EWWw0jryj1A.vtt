00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Well, let's get started.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The topic for today is --

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.604
Sorry.
Thank you.

00:00:59.604 --> 00:01:05.019
For today and the next two
lectures, we are going to be

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.334
studying Fourier series.
Today will be an introduction

00:01:10.334 --> 00:01:15.047
explaining what they are.
And, I calculate them,

00:01:15.047 --> 00:01:21.164
but I thought before we do that
I ought to least give a couple

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:26.779
minutes oversight of why and
where we're going with them,

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:34.000
and why they're coming into the
course at this place at all.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.830
So, the situation up to now is
that we've been trying to solve

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.566
equations of the form y double
prime plus a y prime,

00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:50.250
constant coefficient
second-order equations,

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.125
and the f of t was the input.
So, we are considering

00:01:55.125 --> 00:02:00.000
inhomogeneous equations.
This is the input.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.129
And so far, the response,
then, is the solution equals

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:09.290
the corresponding solution,
y of t,

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:15.193
maybe with some given initial
conditions to pick out a special

00:02:15.193 --> 00:02:20.612
one we call the response,
the response to that particular

00:02:20.612 --> 00:02:23.709
input.
And now, over the last few

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:30.000
days, the inputs have been,
however, extremely special.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
For input, the basic input has
been an exponential,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.800
or sines and cosines.
And, the trouble is that we

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.000
learn how to solve those.
But the point is that those

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.800
seem extremely special.
Now, the point of Fourier

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:57.000
series is to show you that they
are not as special as they look.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.555
The reason is that,
let's put it this way,

00:03:01.555 --> 00:03:07.444
that any reasonable f of t
which is periodic,

00:03:07.444 --> 00:03:12.111
it doesn't have to be even very
reasonable.

00:03:12.111 --> 00:03:15.666
It can be somewhat
discontinuous,

00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:19.555
although not terribly
discontinuous,

00:03:19.555 --> 00:03:26.111
which is periodic with period,
maybe not the minimal period,

00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:32.370
but some period two pi.
Of course, sine t

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.772
and cosine t have the
exact period two pi,

00:03:36.772 --> 00:03:41.597
but if I change the frequency
to an integer frequency like

00:03:41.597 --> 00:03:45.407
sine 2t or sine 26 t,

00:03:45.407 --> 00:03:49.894
two pie would still be a
period, although would not be

00:03:49.894 --> 00:03:53.195
the period.
The period would be shorter.

00:03:53.195 --> 00:03:56.497
The point is,
such a thing can always be

00:03:56.497 --> 00:04:02.000
represented as an infinite sum
of sines and cosines.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.341
So, it's going to look like
this.

00:04:04.341 --> 00:04:07.926
There's a constant term you
have to put out front.

00:04:07.926 --> 00:04:10.707
And then, the rest,
instead of writing,

00:04:10.707 --> 00:04:14.292
it's rather long to write
unless you use summation

00:04:14.292 --> 00:04:15.756
notation.
So, I will.

00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:20.365
So, it's a sum from n equal one
to infinity integer values of n,

00:04:20.365 --> 00:04:23.146
in other words,
of a sine and a cosine.

00:04:23.146 --> 00:04:25.926
It's customary to put the
cosine first,

00:04:25.926 --> 00:04:29.731
and with the frequency,
the n indicates the frequency

00:04:29.731 --> 00:04:35.794
of the thing.
And, the bn is sine nt.

00:04:35.794 --> 00:04:40.766
Now, why does that solve the

00:04:40.766 --> 00:04:47.046
problem of general inputs for
periodic functions,

00:04:47.046 --> 00:04:54.242
at least if the period is two
pi or some fraction of it?

00:04:54.242 --> 00:05:00.000
Well, you could think of it
this way.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:11.538
I'll make a little table.
I'll make a little table.

00:05:11.538 --> 00:05:21.692
Let's look at,
let's put over here the input,

00:05:21.692 --> 00:05:30.000
and here, I'll put the
response.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.743
Okay, suppose the input is the
function sine nt.

00:05:34.743 --> 00:05:38.844
Well, in other words,
if you just solve the problem,

00:05:38.844 --> 00:05:43.507
you put a sine nt
here, you know how to get the

00:05:43.507 --> 00:05:47.527
answer, find a particular
solution, in other words.

00:05:47.527 --> 00:05:51.467
In fact, you do it by
converting this to a complex

00:05:51.467 --> 00:05:55.889
exponential, and then all the
rigmarole we've been going

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:58.703
through.
So, let's call the response

00:05:58.703 --> 00:06:02.000
something.
Let's call it y.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.487
I'd better index it by n
because it, of course,

00:06:05.487 --> 00:06:09.278
is a response to this
particular periodic function.

00:06:09.278 --> 00:06:12.993
So, n of t,
and if the input is cosine nt,

00:06:12.993 --> 00:06:16.557
that also will have
a response, yn.

00:06:16.557 --> 00:06:20.424
Now, I really can't call them
both by the same name.

00:06:20.424 --> 00:06:25.125
So, why don't we put a little s
up here to indicate that that's

00:06:25.125 --> 00:06:29.219
the response to the sine.
And here, I'll put a little c

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:32.327
to indicate what the answer to
the cosine.

00:06:32.327 --> 00:06:36.573
You're feeding cosine nt,
what you get out is

00:06:36.573 --> 00:06:39.926
this function.
Now what?

00:06:39.926 --> 00:06:44.250
Well, by the way,
notice that if n is zero,

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.573
it's going to take care of a
constant term,

00:06:48.573 --> 00:06:50.529
too.
In other words,

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:56.705
the reason there is a constant
term out front is because that

00:06:56.705 --> 00:07:02.573
corresponds to cosine of zero t,
which is one.

00:07:02.573 --> 00:07:08.544
Now, suppose I input instead an
cosine nt.

00:07:08.544 --> 00:07:14.000
All you do is multiply the
answer by an.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.664
Same here.
Multiply the input by bn.

00:07:16.664 --> 00:07:20.926
You multiply the response.
That's because the equation is

00:07:20.926 --> 00:07:24.656
a linear equation.
And now, what am I going to do?

00:07:24.656 --> 00:07:28.461
I'm going to add them up.
If I add them up from the

00:07:28.461 --> 00:07:32.572
different ends and take a count
also, the n equals zero

00:07:32.572 --> 00:07:35.692
corresponding to this first
constant term,

00:07:35.692 --> 00:07:40.259
the sum of all these according
to my Fourier formula is going

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:45.223
to be f of t.
What's the sum of this,

00:07:45.223 --> 00:07:50.249
the corresponding responses?
Well, that's going to be

00:07:50.249 --> 00:07:56.144
summation a n y n c t 
plus b n y n,

00:07:56.144 --> 00:07:59.334
the response to the
sine.

00:07:59.334 --> 00:08:05.037
That will be the sum from one
to infinity, and there will be

00:08:05.037 --> 00:08:10.771
some sort of constant term here.
Let's just call it c1.

00:08:10.771 --> 00:08:14.475
So, in other words,
if this input produces that

00:08:14.475 --> 00:08:18.742
response, and these are things
which we can calculate,

00:08:18.742 --> 00:08:22.285
we're led by this formula,
Fourier's formula,

00:08:22.285 --> 00:08:27.358
to the response to things which
otherwise we would have not been

00:08:27.358 --> 00:08:31.142
able to calculate,
namely, any periodic function

00:08:31.142 --> 00:08:35.088
of period two pi will have,
the procedure will be,

00:08:35.088 --> 00:08:40.000
you've got a periodic function
of period two pi.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.909
Find its Fourier series,
and I'll show you how to do

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:46.592
that today.
Find its Fourier series,

00:08:46.592 --> 00:08:50.885
and then the response to that
general f of t will be this

00:08:50.885 --> 00:08:55.331
infinite series of functions,
where these things are things

00:08:55.331 --> 00:08:57.860
you already know how to
calculate.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:02.000
They are the responses to sines
and cosines.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.369
And, you just formed the sum
with those coefficients.

00:09:06.369 --> 00:09:10.823
Now, why does that work?
It works by the superposition

00:09:10.823 --> 00:09:13.092
principle.
So, this is true.

00:09:13.092 --> 00:09:17.966
The reason I can do the adding
and multiplying by constant,

00:09:17.966 --> 00:09:21.075
I'm using the superposition
principle.

00:09:21.075 --> 00:09:25.613
If this input produces that
response, then the sum of a

00:09:25.613 --> 00:09:32.000
bunch of inputs produces the sum
of the corresponding responses.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.310
And, why is that?
Why can I use the superposition

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:43.043
principle?
Because the ODE is linear.

00:09:43.043 --> 00:09:47.513
It's okay, since the ODE is
linear.

00:09:47.513 --> 00:09:51.589
That's what makes all this
work.

00:09:51.589 --> 00:09:59.609
Now, so what we're going to do
today is I will show you how to

00:09:59.609 --> 00:10:07.125
calculate those Fourier series.
I will not be able to use it to

00:10:07.125 --> 00:10:09.867
actually solve any differential
equation.

00:10:09.867 --> 00:10:13.706
It will take us pretty much all
the period to show how to

00:10:13.706 --> 00:10:17.340
calculate a Fourier series.
And, okay, so I'm going to

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.945
solve differential equations on
Monday.

00:10:19.945 --> 00:10:22.482
Wrong.
I probably won't even get to it

00:10:22.482 --> 00:10:26.801
then because the calculation of
a Fourier series is a sufficient

00:10:26.801 --> 00:10:30.846
amount of work that you really
want to know all the possible

00:10:30.846 --> 00:10:35.036
tricks and shortcuts there are.
Unfortunately,

00:10:35.036 --> 00:10:37.330
they are not very clever
tricks.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:41.622
They are just obvious things.
But, it will take me a period

00:10:41.622 --> 00:10:45.766
to point out those obvious
things, obvious in my sense if

00:10:45.766 --> 00:10:47.690
not in yours.
And, finally,

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.502
the third day,
we'll solve differential

00:10:50.502 --> 00:10:53.388
equations.
I will actually carry out the

00:10:53.388 --> 00:10:56.201
program.
But the main thing we're going

00:10:56.201 --> 00:11:00.345
to get out of it is another
approach to resonance because

00:11:00.345 --> 00:11:05.007
the things that we are going to
be interested in are picking out

00:11:05.007 --> 00:11:08.781
which of these terms may
possibly produce resonance,

00:11:08.781 --> 00:11:13.000
and therefore a very crazy
response.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.679
Some of the terms in the
response suddenly get a much

00:11:16.679 --> 00:11:21.067
bigger amplitude than this than
you would normally have thought

00:11:21.067 --> 00:11:24.889
they had because it's picking
out resonant terms in the

00:11:24.889 --> 00:11:28.569
Fourier series of the input.
Okay, well, that's a big

00:11:28.569 --> 00:11:30.550
mouthfu.
Let's get started on

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:33.098
calculating.
So, the program today is

00:11:33.098 --> 00:11:40.340
calculate the Fourier series.
Given f of t periodic,

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:47.340
having two pi as a period,
find its Fourier series.

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:52.940
How, in other words,
do I calculate those

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:57.000
coefficients,
an and bn.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.451
Now, the answer is not
immediately apparent,

00:12:00.451 --> 00:12:03.020
and it's really quite
remarkable.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.990
I think it's quite remarkable,
anyway.

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:10.004
It's one of the basic things of
higher mathematics.

00:12:10.004 --> 00:12:14.339
And, what it depends upon are
certain things called the

00:12:14.339 --> 00:12:18.433
orthogonality relations.
So, this is the place where

00:12:18.433 --> 00:12:21.644
you've got to learn what such
things are.

00:12:21.644 --> 00:12:25.979
Well, I think it would be a
good idea to have a general

00:12:25.979 --> 00:12:29.752
definition, rather than
immediately get into the

00:12:29.752 --> 00:12:34.878
specifics.
So, I'm going to call u of x,

00:12:34.878 --> 00:12:39.504
u of t, I think I will use,

00:12:39.504 --> 00:12:45.775
since Fourier analysis is most
often applied when the variable

00:12:45.775 --> 00:12:51.738
is time, I think I will stick to
independent variable t all

00:12:51.738 --> 00:12:56.056
period long, if I remember to,
at any rate.

00:12:56.056 --> 00:13:01.607
So, these are two continuous,
or not very discontinuous

00:13:01.607 --> 00:13:07.589
functions on minus pi.
Let's make them periodic.

00:13:07.589 --> 00:13:12.042
Let's say two pi is a period.
So, functions,

00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:16.600
for example like those guys,
sine t, sine nt,

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.535
sine 22t,

00:13:20.535 --> 00:13:23.953
and so on, say two pi is a
period.

00:13:23.953 --> 00:13:28.821
Well, I want them really on the
whole real axis,

00:13:28.821 --> 00:13:34.000
not there.
Define for all real numbers.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.293
Then, I say that they are
orthogonal, perpendicular.

00:13:39.293 --> 00:13:44.794
But nobody says perpendicular.
Orthogonal is the word,

00:13:44.794 --> 00:13:49.777
orthogonal on the interval
minus pi to pi

00:13:49.777 --> 00:13:54.448
if the integral,
so, two are orthogonal.

00:13:54.448 --> 00:14:00.156
Well, these two functions,
if the integral from minus pi

00:14:00.156 --> 00:14:06.073
to pi of u of t v of t,
the product is zero,

00:14:06.073 --> 00:14:12.093
that's called the orthogonality
condition on minus pi to pi.

00:14:12.093 --> 00:14:16.725
Now, well, it's just the

00:14:16.725 --> 00:14:19.313
definition.
I would love to go into a

00:14:19.313 --> 00:14:23.196
little song and dance now on
what the definition really

00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:27.366
means, and what its application,
why the word orthogonal is

00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:31.464
used, because it really does
have something to do with two

00:14:31.464 --> 00:14:35.777
vectors being orthogonal in the
sense in which you live it in

00:14:35.777 --> 00:14:39.385
18.02.
I'll have to put that on the

00:14:39.385 --> 00:14:43.559
ice for the moment,
and whether I get to it or not

00:14:43.559 --> 00:14:48.500
depends on how fast I talk.
But, you probably prefer I talk

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.885
slowly.
So, let's compromise.

00:14:50.885 --> 00:14:55.655
Anyway, that's the condition.
And now, what I say is that

00:14:55.655 --> 00:14:58.892
that Fourier,
that blue Fourier series,

00:14:58.892 --> 00:15:01.631
--
-- what finding the

00:15:01.631 --> 00:15:06.696
coefficients an and bn depends
upon is this theorem that the

00:15:06.696 --> 00:15:11.417
collection of functions,
as I look at this collection of

00:15:11.417 --> 00:15:16.482
functions, sine nt
for any value of the integer,

00:15:16.482 --> 00:15:21.719
n, of course I can assume n is
a positive integer because sine

00:15:21.719 --> 00:15:26.870
of minus nt is the same as sine
of nt.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.389
And, cosine mt,
let's give it a different,

00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:34.939
so I don't want you to think
they are exactly the same

00:15:34.939 --> 00:15:40.206
integers.
So, this is a big collection of

00:15:40.206 --> 00:15:45.172
functions, as n runs from one to
infinity-- Here,

00:15:45.172 --> 00:15:51.275
I could let m be run from zero
to infinity because cosine of

00:15:51.275 --> 00:15:54.793
zero t means something.

00:15:54.793 --> 00:15:59.241
It's a constant,
one-- that any two distinct

00:15:59.241 --> 00:16:04.413
ones, two distinct,
you know, how can two things be

00:16:04.413 --> 00:16:08.500
not different?
Well, you know,

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:12.000
you talk about two coincident
roots.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.100
I'm just killing,
doing a little overkill.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:22.299
Any two distinct ones of these,
two distinct members of the set

00:16:22.299 --> 00:16:25.799
of this collection of,
I don't know,

00:16:25.799 --> 00:16:31.000
there's no way to say that,
any two distinct ones are

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.899
orthogonal on this interval.
Of course, they all have two pi

00:16:36.899 --> 00:16:43.200
as a period for all of them.
So, they form into this general

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.529
category that I'm talking about,
but any two distinct ones are

00:16:47.529 --> 00:16:51.219
orthogonal on the interval for
minus pi to pi.

00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:53.703
So, if I integrate from minus

00:16:53.703 --> 00:16:57.251
pi to pi sine of three t times
cosine of four t dt,

00:16:57.251 --> 00:17:00.374
answer is zero.

00:17:00.374 --> 00:17:05.440
If I integrate sine of 3t times

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.533
the sine of 60t,
answer is zero.

00:17:09.533 --> 00:17:13.862
The same thing with two
cosines, or a sine and a cosine.

00:17:13.862 --> 00:17:17.956
The only time you don't get
zero is if you integrate,

00:17:17.956 --> 00:17:20.947
if you make the two functions
the same.

00:17:20.947 --> 00:17:25.276
Now, how do you know that you
could not possibly get the

00:17:25.276 --> 00:17:30.000
answer is zero if the two
functions are the same?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.140
If the two functions are the
same, then I'm integrating a

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:38.354
square.
A square is always positive.

00:17:38.354 --> 00:17:43.219
I'm integrating a square.
A square is always positive,

00:17:43.219 --> 00:17:47.167
and therefore I cannot get the
answer, zero.

00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:51.940
But, in the other cases,
I might get the answer zero.

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.878
And the theorem is you always
do.

00:17:54.878 --> 00:18:00.427
Okay, so, why is this?
Well, there are three ways to

00:18:00.427 --> 00:18:03.525
prove this.
It's like many fundamental

00:18:03.525 --> 00:18:07.544
facts in mathematics.
There are different ways of

00:18:07.544 --> 00:18:10.976
going about it.
By the way, along with the

00:18:10.976 --> 00:18:14.660
theorem, I probably should have
included, so,

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:18.260
I'm far away.
But you might as well include,

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:23.116
because we're going to need it.
What happens if you use the

00:18:23.116 --> 00:18:26.213
same function?
If I take U equal to V,

00:18:26.213 --> 00:18:29.144
and in that case,
as I've indicated,

00:18:29.144 --> 00:18:34.000
you're not going to get the
answer, zero.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.471
But, what you will get is,
so, in other words,

00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:41.097
I'm just asking,
what is the sine of 

00:18:41.097 --> 00:18:44.724
n t squared.
That's a case where two of them

00:18:44.724 --> 00:18:47.578
are the same.
I use the same function.

00:18:47.578 --> 00:18:50.047
What's that?
Well, the answer is,

00:18:50.047 --> 00:18:54.830
it's the same as what you will
get if you integrate the cosine,

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:58.456
cosine squared n t dt.

00:18:58.456 --> 00:19:02.428
And, the answer to either one

00:19:02.428 --> 00:19:06.114
of these is pi.
That's something you know how

00:19:06.114 --> 00:19:09.631
to do from 18.01 or the
equivalent thereof.

00:19:09.631 --> 00:19:14.741
You can integrate sine squared.
It's one of the things you had

00:19:14.741 --> 00:19:19.850
to learn for whatever exam you
took on methods of integration.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:23.703
Anyway, so I'm not going to
calculate this out.

00:19:23.703 --> 00:19:27.472
The answer turns out to be pi.
All right, now,

00:19:27.472 --> 00:19:33.000
the ways to prove it are you
can use trig identities.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.119
And, I'm asking you in one of
the early problems in the

00:19:37.119 --> 00:19:41.163
problem set, identities,
identities for the product of

00:19:41.163 --> 00:19:44.367
sine and cosine,
expressing it in a form in

00:19:44.367 --> 00:19:48.869
which it's easy to integrate,
and you can prove it that way.

00:19:48.869 --> 00:19:51.997
Or, you can use,
if you have forgotten the

00:19:51.997 --> 00:19:56.422
trigonometric identities and
want to get some more exercise

00:19:56.422 --> 00:20:01.000
with complex-- you can use
complex exponentials.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.481
So, I'm asking you how to,
in another part of the same

00:20:05.481 --> 00:20:09.877
problem I'm asking you how to do
it, do one of these,

00:20:09.877 --> 00:20:13.174
at any rate,
using complex exponentials.

00:20:13.174 --> 00:20:18.078
And now, I'm going to use a
mysterious third method another

00:20:18.078 --> 00:20:20.530
way.
I'm going to use the ODE.

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:24.504
I'm going to do that because
this is the method.

00:20:24.504 --> 00:20:30.000
It's not just sines and cosines
which are orthogonal.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.228
There are masses of orthogonal
functions out there.

00:20:33.228 --> 00:20:36.328
And, the way they are
discovered, and the way you

00:20:36.328 --> 00:20:40.396
prove they're orthogonal is not
with trig identities and complex

00:20:40.396 --> 00:20:44.206
exponentials because those only
work with sines and cosines.

00:20:44.206 --> 00:20:46.466
It is, instead,
by going back to the

00:20:46.466 --> 00:20:48.856
differential equation that they
solve.

00:20:48.856 --> 00:20:52.214
And that's, therefore,
the method here that I'm going

00:20:52.214 --> 00:20:56.282
to use here because this is the
method which generalizes to many

00:20:56.282 --> 00:20:59.769
other differential equations
other than the simple ones

00:20:59.769 --> 00:21:05.000
satisfied by sines and cosines.
But anyway, that is the source.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.537
So, the way the proof of these
orthogonality conditions goes,

00:21:09.537 --> 00:21:14.000
so I'm not going to do that.
And, I'm going to assume that m

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.310
is different from n so that I'm
not in either of these two

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:20.428
cases.
What it depends on is,

00:21:20.428 --> 00:21:23.907
what's the differential
equation that all these

00:21:23.907 --> 00:21:26.932
functions satisfy?
Well, it's a different

00:21:26.932 --> 00:21:30.789
differential equation depending
upon the value of n,

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:35.007
--
-- but they look at essentially

00:21:35.007 --> 00:21:38.791
the same.
These satisfy the differential

00:21:38.791 --> 00:21:43.641
equation, in other words,
what they have in common.

00:21:43.641 --> 00:21:48.007
The differential equation is,
let's call it u.

00:21:48.007 --> 00:21:52.276
It looks better.
It's going to look better if

00:21:52.276 --> 00:21:56.253
you let me call it u.
u double prime plus,

00:21:56.253 --> 00:22:00.522
well, n squared,
so for the function sine n t

00:22:00.522 --> 00:22:05.179
cosine n t, satisfy u double

00:22:05.179 --> 00:22:11.000
prime plus n squared times u.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.413
In other words,
the frequency is n,

00:22:13.413 --> 00:22:16.040
and therefore,
this is a square of the

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.092
frequency is what you put here,
equals zero.

00:22:19.092 --> 00:22:22.145
In other words,
what these functions have in

00:22:22.145 --> 00:22:26.333
common is that they satisfy
differential equations that look

00:22:26.333 --> 00:22:28.817
like that.
And the only thing that's

00:22:28.817 --> 00:22:32.509
allowed to vary is the
frequency, which is allowed to

00:22:32.509 --> 00:22:36.891
change.
The frequency is in this

00:22:36.891 --> 00:22:42.313
coefficient of u.
Now, the remarkable thing is

00:22:42.313 --> 00:22:49.301
that's all you need to know.
The fact that they satisfy the

00:22:49.301 --> 00:22:55.566
differential equation,
that's all you need to know to

00:22:55.566 --> 00:22:59.903
prove the orthogonality
relationship.

00:22:59.903 --> 00:23:06.501
Okay, let's try to do it.
Well, I need some notation.

00:23:06.501 --> 00:23:11.875
So, I'm going to let un and vm
be any two of the functions.

00:23:11.875 --> 00:23:16.137
In other words,
I'll assume m is different from

00:23:16.137 --> 00:23:17.434
n.
For example,

00:23:17.434 --> 00:23:22.530
this one could be sine nt,
and that could be

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:26.884
sine of mt,
or this could be sine nt

00:23:26.884 --> 00:23:33.000
and that could be
cosine of mt.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.790
You get the idea.
Any two of those in the

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:40.046
subscript indicates whether what
the n or the m is that are in

00:23:40.046 --> 00:23:42.558
that.
Any two, and I mean really two,

00:23:42.558 --> 00:23:45.348
distinct, well,
if I say that m is not n,

00:23:45.348 --> 00:23:48.209
then they positively have to be
different.

00:23:48.209 --> 00:23:51.209
So, again, it's overkill with
my two's-ness.

00:23:51.209 --> 00:23:53.860
And, what I'm going to
calculate, well,

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.023
first of all,
from the equation,

00:23:56.023 --> 00:24:00.000
I'm going to write the equation
this way.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:07.094
It says that u double prime is
equal to minus n squared u.

00:24:07.094 --> 00:24:11.557
That's true for any of these

00:24:11.557 --> 00:24:13.960
guys.
Of course, here,

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:20.940
it would be v double prime is
equal to minus m squared 

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:26.203
times v.
You have to make those simple

00:24:26.203 --> 00:24:30.781
adjustments.
And now, what we're going to

00:24:30.781 --> 00:24:37.303
calculate is the integral from
minus pi to pi of un double

00:24:37.303 --> 00:24:43.482
prime times vm dt.

00:24:43.482 --> 00:24:48.047
Now, just bear with me.

00:24:48.047 --> 00:24:53.031
Why am I going to do that?
I can't explain what I'm going

00:24:53.031 --> 00:24:56.146
to do that.
But you won't ask me the

00:24:56.146 --> 00:24:59.884
question in five minutes.
But the point is,

00:24:59.884 --> 00:25:05.267
this is highly un-symmetric.
The u is differentiated twice.

00:25:05.267 --> 00:25:08.365
The v isn't.
So, those two functions-- but

00:25:08.365 --> 00:25:12.899
there is a way of turning them
into an expression which looks

00:25:12.899 --> 00:25:16.224
extremely symmetric,
where they are the same.

00:25:16.224 --> 00:25:20.608
And the way to do that is I
want to get rid of one of these

00:25:20.608 --> 00:25:25.142
primes here and put one on here.
The way to do that is if you

00:25:25.142 --> 00:25:29.827
want to integrate one of these
guys, and differentiate this one

00:25:29.827 --> 00:25:33.984
to make them look the same,
that's called integration by

00:25:33.984 --> 00:25:38.140
parts, the most important
theoretical method you learned

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:42.372
in 18.01 even though you didn't
know that it was the most

00:25:42.372 --> 00:25:47.830
important theoretical method.
Okay, we're going to use it now

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:51.431
as a basis for Fourier series.
Okay, so I'm going to integrate

00:25:51.431 --> 00:25:53.616
by parts.
Now, the first thing you do,

00:25:53.616 --> 00:25:56.922
of course, when you integrate
by parts is you just do the

00:25:56.922 --> 00:25:59.343
integration.
You don't do differentiation.

00:25:59.343 --> 00:26:02.000
So, the first thing looks like
this.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.021
And, that's to be evaluated
between negative pi and pi.

00:26:08.021 --> 00:26:12.928
In doing integration by parts
between limits,

00:26:12.928 --> 00:26:16.496
minus what you get by doing
both.

00:26:16.496 --> 00:26:20.399
You do both,
the integration and the

00:26:20.399 --> 00:26:24.971
differentiation.
And, again, evaluate that

00:26:24.971 --> 00:26:29.766
between limits.
Now, I'm just going to BS my

00:26:29.766 --> 00:26:34.158
way through this.
This is zero.

00:26:34.158 --> 00:26:39.150
I don't care what the un's,
which un you picked and which

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:43.161
vm you picked.
The answer here is always going

00:26:43.161 --> 00:26:46.727
to be zero.
Instead of wasting six boards

00:26:46.727 --> 00:26:51.540
trying to write out the
argument, let me wave my hands.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.125
Okay, it's clear,
for example,

00:26:54.125 --> 00:26:57.601
that a v is a sine, sine mt.

00:26:57.601 --> 00:27:02.860
Of course it's zero because the
sine vanishes at both pi and

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:06.810
minus pi.
If the un were a cosine,

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:09.977
after I differentiate it,
it became a sine.

00:27:09.977 --> 00:27:14.125
And so, now it's this side guy
that's zero at both ends.

00:27:14.125 --> 00:27:18.650
So, the only case in which we
might have a little doubt is if

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:21.893
this is a cosine,
and after differentiation,

00:27:21.893 --> 00:27:24.684
this is also a cosine.
In other words,

00:27:24.684 --> 00:27:28.681
it might look like cosine,
after, this cosine nt times

00:27:28.681 --> 00:27:34.511
cosine mt.
But, I claim that that's zero,

00:27:34.511 --> 00:27:35.181
too.
Why?

00:27:35.181 --> 00:27:39.619
Because the cosines are even
functions, and therefore,

00:27:39.619 --> 00:27:42.717
they have the same value at
both ends.

00:27:42.717 --> 00:27:46.318
So, if I subtract the value
evaluated at pi,

00:27:46.318 --> 00:27:51.342
and subtract the value of minus
pi, again zero because I have

00:27:51.342 --> 00:27:56.282
the same value at both ends.
So, by this entirely convincing

00:27:56.282 --> 00:28:00.971
argument, no matter what
combination of sines and cosines

00:28:00.971 --> 00:28:07.000
I have here, the answer to that
part will always be zero.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.327
So, by calculation,
but thought calculation;

00:28:11.327 --> 00:28:16.056
it's just a waste of time to
write anything out.

00:28:16.056 --> 00:28:20.484
You stare at it until you agree
that it's so.

00:28:20.484 --> 00:28:25.415
And now, I've taken,
by this integration by parts,

00:28:25.415 --> 00:28:30.345
I've taken this highly
un-symmetric expression and

00:28:30.345 --> 00:28:35.578
turned it into something in
which the u and the v are

00:28:35.578 --> 00:28:40.705
treated exactly alike.
Well, good, that's nice,

00:28:40.705 --> 00:28:43.334
but why?
Why did I go to this trouble?

00:28:43.334 --> 00:28:47.597
Okay, now we're going to use
the fact that this satisfies the

00:28:47.597 --> 00:28:50.226
differential equation,
in other words,

00:28:50.226 --> 00:28:53.921
that u double prime is equal to
minus n,

00:28:53.921 --> 00:28:56.834
I'm sorry, I should have
subscripted this.

00:28:56.834 --> 00:29:00.031
If that's the solution,
then this is equal to,

00:29:00.031 --> 00:29:02.589
times.
You have to put in a subscript

00:29:02.589 --> 00:29:06.000
otherwise.
The n wouldn't matter.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.071
All right, I'm now going to
take that expression,

00:29:10.071 --> 00:29:15.077
and evaluate it differently.
un double prime vm dt

00:29:15.077 --> 00:29:18.385
is equal to,
well, un double prime,

00:29:18.385 --> 00:29:22.966
because it satisfies the
differential equation is equal

00:29:22.966 --> 00:29:25.087
to that.
So, what is this?

00:29:25.087 --> 00:29:29.753
This is minus n squared
times the integral from

00:29:29.753 --> 00:29:33.570
negative pi to pi,
and I'm replacing un double

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:39.000
prime by minus n
squared un.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.187
I pulled the minus n squared
out.

00:29:43.187 --> 00:29:47.987
So, it's un here,
and the other factor is vm dt.

00:29:47.987 --> 00:29:50.642
Now, that's the proof.
Huh?

00:29:50.642 --> 00:29:54.012
What do you mean that's the
proof?

00:29:54.012 --> 00:29:59.936
Okay, well, I'll first state
it, why intuitively that's the

00:29:59.936 --> 00:30:06.189
end of the argument.
And then, I'll spell it out a

00:30:06.189 --> 00:30:11.357
little more detail,
but the more detail you make

00:30:11.357 --> 00:30:16.305
for this, the more obscure it
gets instead of,

00:30:16.305 --> 00:30:22.573
look, I just showed you that
this is symmetric in u and v,

00:30:22.573 --> 00:30:26.202
after you massage it a little
bit.

00:30:26.202 --> 00:30:30.601
Here, I'm calculating it a
different way.

00:30:30.601 --> 00:30:37.866
Is this symmetric in u and v?
Well, the answer is yes or no.

00:30:37.866 --> 00:30:40.923
Is this symmetric at u and v?
No.

00:30:40.923 --> 00:30:42.929
Why?
Because of the n.

00:30:42.929 --> 00:30:46.656
The n favors u.
We have what is called a

00:30:46.656 --> 00:30:50.095
paradox.
This thing is symmetric in u

00:30:50.095 --> 00:30:55.732
and v because I can show it is.
And, it's not symmetric in u

00:30:55.732 --> 00:31:01.464
and v because I can show it is.
I can show it's not symmetric

00:31:01.464 --> 00:31:09.905
because it favors the n.
Now, there's only one possible

00:31:09.905 --> 00:31:19.389
resolution of that paradox.
Both would be symmetric if what

00:31:19.389 --> 00:31:22.169
were true?
Pardon?

00:31:22.169 --> 00:31:29.201
Negative pi.
All right, let me write it this

00:31:29.201 --> 00:31:32.403
way.
Okay, never mind.

00:31:32.403 --> 00:31:37.440
You see, the only way this can
happen is if this expression is

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.091
zero.
In other words,

00:31:39.091 --> 00:31:44.128
the only way something can be
both symmetric and not symmetric

00:31:44.128 --> 00:31:48.917
is if it's zero all the time.
And, that's what we're trying

00:31:48.917 --> 00:31:53.623
to prove, that this is zero.
But, instead of doing it that

00:31:53.623 --> 00:31:57.174
way, let me show you.
This is equal to that,

00:31:57.174 --> 00:32:00.889
and therefore,
two things according to Euclid,

00:32:00.889 --> 00:32:07.000
two things equal to the same
thing are equal to each other.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.539
So, this equals that,
which, in turn,

00:32:09.539 --> 00:32:12.503
therefore, equals what I would
have gotten.

00:32:12.503 --> 00:32:15.677
I'm just saying the symmetry of
different way,

00:32:15.677 --> 00:32:19.558
what I would have gotten if I
had done this calculation.

00:32:19.558 --> 00:32:23.720
And, that turns out to be minus
m squared times the integral

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:28.024
from minus pi to pi
of un vm dt.

00:32:28.024 --> 00:32:33.155
So, these two are equal because

00:32:33.155 --> 00:32:38.244
they are both equal to this.
This is equal to that.

00:32:38.244 --> 00:32:42.926
This equals that.
Therefore, how can this equal

00:32:42.926 --> 00:32:46.183
that unless the integral is
zero?

00:32:46.183 --> 00:32:50.254
How's that?
Remember, m is different from

00:32:50.254 --> 00:32:52.900
n.
So, what this proves is,

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:59.007
therefore, the integral from
negative pi to pi of un vm dt is

00:32:59.007 --> 00:33:05.012
equal to zero,

00:33:05.012 --> 00:33:10.000
at least if m is different from
n.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.805
Now, there is one case I didn't
include.

00:33:12.805 --> 00:33:16.978
Which case didn't I include?
un times un is not supposed to

00:33:16.978 --> 00:33:18.776
be zero.
So, in that case,

00:33:18.776 --> 00:33:22.661
I don't have to worry about,
but there is a case that I

00:33:22.661 --> 00:33:24.028
didn't.
For example,

00:33:24.028 --> 00:33:28.417
something like the cosine of nt
times the sine of nt.

00:33:28.417 --> 00:33:32.830
Here, the m is the same as the

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:34.150
n.
Nonetheless,

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:39.811
I am claiming that this is zero
because these aren't the same

00:33:39.811 --> 00:33:42.169
function.
One is a cosine.

00:33:42.169 --> 00:33:46.132
Why is that zero?
Can you see mentally that

00:33:46.132 --> 00:33:48.113
that's zero?
Mentally?

00:33:48.113 --> 00:33:52.075
Well, this is trying to be in
another life,

00:33:52.075 --> 00:33:57.358
it's trying to be one half the
sine of two nt, right?

00:33:57.358 --> 00:34:02.015
And obviously the integral of

00:34:02.015 --> 00:34:06.255
sine of two nt is zero between
minus pi and pi

00:34:06.255 --> 00:34:09.730
because you integrate it,

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:13.692
and it turns out to be zero.
You integrate it to a cosine,

00:34:13.692 --> 00:34:16.264
which has the same value of
both ends.

00:34:16.264 --> 00:34:18.419
Well, that was a lot of
talking.

00:34:18.419 --> 00:34:22.311
If this proof is too abstract
for you, I won't ask you to

00:34:22.311 --> 00:34:25.786
reproduce it on an exam.
You can go with the proofs

00:34:25.786 --> 00:34:31.000
using trigonometric identities,
and/or complex exponentials.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.709
But, you ought to know at least
one of those,

00:34:34.709 --> 00:34:39.261
and for the problem set I'm
asking you to fool around a

00:34:39.261 --> 00:34:41.959
little with at least two of
them.

00:34:41.959 --> 00:34:47.101
Okay, now, what has this got to
do with the problem we started

00:34:47.101 --> 00:34:50.979
with originally?
The problem is to explain this

00:34:50.979 --> 00:34:53.593
blue series.
So, our problem is,

00:34:53.593 --> 00:34:57.386
how, from this,
am I going to get the terms of

00:34:57.386 --> 00:35:02.549
this blue series?
So, given f of t,

00:35:02.549 --> 00:35:06.568
two pi s a period.
Find the an and the bn.

00:35:06.568 --> 00:35:11.176
Okay, let's focus on the an.
The bn is the same.

00:35:11.176 --> 00:35:16.764
Once you know how to do one,
you know how to do the other.

00:35:16.764 --> 00:35:21.274
So, here's the idea.
Again, it goes back to the

00:35:21.274 --> 00:35:26.372
something you learned at the
very beginning of 18.02,

00:35:26.372 --> 00:35:32.719
but I don't think it took.
But maybe some of you will

00:35:32.719 --> 00:35:36.904
recognize it.
So, what I'm going to do is

00:35:36.904 --> 00:35:40.880
write it.
Here's the term we're looking

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:45.692
for here, this one.
Okay, and there are others.

00:35:45.692 --> 00:35:50.295
It's an infinite series that
goes on forever.

00:35:50.295 --> 00:35:56.258
And now, to make the argument,
I've got to put it one more

00:35:56.258 --> 00:36:00.024
term here.
So, I'm going to put in ak

00:36:00.024 --> 00:36:07.059
cosine kt.
I don't mean to imply that that

00:36:07.059 --> 00:36:11.993
k could be more than n,
in which case I should have

00:36:11.993 --> 00:36:16.532
written it here.
I could have also used equally

00:36:16.532 --> 00:36:22.355
well bk sine kt 
here, and I could have put it

00:36:22.355 --> 00:36:25.809
there.
This is just some other term.

00:36:25.809 --> 00:36:30.052
This is the an,
and this is the one we want.

00:36:30.052 --> 00:36:35.445
And, this is some other term.
Okay, all right,

00:36:35.445 --> 00:36:38.516
now, what you do is,
to get the an,

00:36:38.516 --> 00:36:42.941
what you do is you multiply
everything through by,

00:36:42.941 --> 00:36:46.735
you focus on the one you want,
so it's dot,

00:36:46.735 --> 00:36:50.800
dot, dot, dot,
dot, and you multiply by cosine

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:54.593
nt.
So, it's ak cosine kt times

00:36:54.593 --> 00:36:57.483
cosine nt.

00:36:57.483 --> 00:37:02.000
Of course, that gets
multiplied, too.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.753
But, the one we want also gets
multiplied, an.

00:37:06.753 --> 00:37:11.401
And, it becomes,
when I multiply by cosine nt,

00:37:11.401 --> 00:37:16.260
cosine squared nt,

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:21.542
and now, I hope you can see
what's going to happen.

00:37:21.542 --> 00:37:26.612
Now, oops, I didn't multiply
the f of t,

00:37:26.612 --> 00:37:30.204
sorry.
It's the oldest trick in the

00:37:30.204 --> 00:37:35.017
book.
I now integrate everything from

00:37:35.017 --> 00:37:38.327
minus, so I don't endlessly
recopy.

00:37:38.327 --> 00:37:42.902
I'll integrate by putting it up
in yellow chalk,

00:37:42.902 --> 00:37:46.407
and you are left to your own
devices.

00:37:46.407 --> 00:37:50.982
This is definitely a colored
pen type of course.

00:37:50.982 --> 00:37:55.946
Okay, so, you want to integrate
from minus pi to pi?

00:37:55.946 --> 00:37:59.159
Good.
Just integrate everything on

00:37:59.159 --> 00:38:05.000
the right hand side,
also, from minus pi to pi.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.723
Plus, these are the guys just
to indicate that I haven't,

00:38:10.723 --> 00:38:13.074
they are out there,
too.

00:38:13.074 --> 00:38:16.549
And now, what happens?
What's this?

00:38:16.549 --> 00:38:20.024
Zero.
Every term is zero because of

00:38:20.024 --> 00:38:25.441
the orthogonality relations.
They are all of the form,

00:38:25.441 --> 00:38:31.165
a constant times cosine nt
times something different from

00:38:31.165 --> 00:38:35.458
cosine nt, sine kt,

00:38:35.458 --> 00:38:42.000
cosine kt,
or even that constant term.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.500
All of the other terms are
zero, and the only one which

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:50.083
survives is this one.
And, what's its value?

00:38:50.083 --> 00:38:54.250
The integral from minus pi to
pi of cosine squared,

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:57.583
I put that up somewhere.
It's right here,

00:38:57.583 --> 00:39:00.000
down there?
It is pi.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.900
So, this term turns into an pi,
an, dragged along,

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:10.800
but this, the integral of the
square of the cosine turns out

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.699
to be pi.
And so, the end result is that

00:39:14.699 --> 00:39:18.199
we get a formula for an.
What is an?

00:39:18.199 --> 00:39:20.599
an is, well,
an times pi,

00:39:20.599 --> 00:39:25.800
all these terms of zero,
and nothing is left but this

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.699
left-hand side.
And therefore,

00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:34.599
an times pi is the integral
from negative pi to pi of f of t

00:39:34.599 --> 00:39:40.800
times cosine nt dt.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:45.951
But, that's an times pi.

00:39:45.951 --> 00:39:50.424
Therefore, if I want just an,
I have to divide it by pi.

00:39:50.424 --> 00:39:54.165
And, that's the formula for the
coefficient an.

00:39:54.165 --> 00:39:57.987
The argument is exactly the
same if you want bn,

00:39:57.987 --> 00:40:02.298
but I will write it down for
the sake of completeness,

00:40:02.298 --> 00:40:05.469
as they say,
and to give you a chance to

00:40:05.469 --> 00:40:09.698
digest what I've done,
you know, 30 seconds to digest

00:40:09.698 --> 00:40:12.888
it. Sine nt dt.

00:40:12.888 --> 00:40:16.085
And, that's because the
argument is the same.

00:40:16.085 --> 00:40:20.226
And, the integral of sine
squared nt is also

00:40:20.226 --> 00:40:22.260
pi. So, there's no difference

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:24.730
there.
Now, there's only one little

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:27.564
caution.
It have to be a little careful.

00:40:27.564 --> 00:40:29.670
This is n one,
two, and so on,

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:33.012
and this is also n one,
two, and unfortunately,

00:40:33.012 --> 00:40:35.846
the constant term is a slight
exception.

00:40:35.846 --> 00:40:39.405
We better look at that
specifically because if you

00:40:39.405 --> 00:40:42.529
forget it, you can get them to
gross, gross,

00:40:42.529 --> 00:40:48.479
gross errors.
How about the constant term?

00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:54.816
Suppose I repeat the argument
for that in miniature.

00:40:54.816 --> 00:41:01.899
There is a constant term plus
other stuff, a typical other

00:41:01.899 --> 00:41:06.000
stuff, an cosine,
let's say.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.067
How am I going to get that
constant term?

00:41:10.067 --> 00:41:16.067
Well, if you think of this as
sort of like a constant times,

00:41:16.067 --> 00:41:22.271
the reason is the constant is
because it's being multiplied by

00:41:22.271 --> 00:41:27.559
cosine zero t.
So, that suggests I should

00:41:27.559 --> 00:41:31.252
multiply by one.
In other words,

00:41:31.252 --> 00:41:36.013
what I should do is simply
integrate this from negative pi

00:41:36.013 --> 00:41:40.774
to pi, f of t dt.

00:41:40.774 --> 00:41:44.450
What's the answer?
Well, this integrated from

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:49.294
minus pi to pi is how much?
It's c zero times two pi,

00:41:49.294 --> 00:41:52.719
right?
And, the other terms all give

00:41:52.719 --> 00:41:55.392
me zero.
Every other term is zero

00:41:55.392 --> 00:42:00.069
because if you integrate cosine
nt or sine nt

00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:06.000
over a complete
period, you always get zero.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.012
There is as much area above the
axis or below.

00:42:10.012 --> 00:42:13.312
Or, you can look at two special
cases.

00:42:13.312 --> 00:42:18.394
Anyway, you always get zero.
It's the same thing with sine

00:42:18.394 --> 00:42:21.426
here.
So, the answer is that c zero

00:42:21.426 --> 00:42:24.904
is equal to,
is a little special.

00:42:24.904 --> 00:42:30.165
You don't just put n equals
zero here because then

00:42:30.165 --> 00:42:36.790
you would lose a factor of two.
So, c zero should be one

00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:40.662
over two pi times
this integral.

00:42:40.662 --> 00:42:44.893
Now, there are two kinds of
people in the world,

00:42:44.893 --> 00:42:50.475
the ones who learn two separate
formulas, and the ones who just

00:42:50.475 --> 00:42:55.877
learn two separate notations.
So, what most people do is they

00:42:55.877 --> 00:43:02.000
say, look, I want this to be
always the formula for a zero.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.192
That means, even when n 
is zero, I want this to be the

00:43:07.192 --> 00:43:10.406
formula.
Well, then you are not going to

00:43:10.406 --> 00:43:14.692
get the right leading term.
Instead of getting c zero,

00:43:14.692 --> 00:43:18.895
you're going to get
twice it, and therefore,

00:43:18.895 --> 00:43:21.697
the formula is,
the Fourier series,

00:43:21.697 --> 00:43:24.417
therefore, isn't written this
way.

00:43:24.417 --> 00:43:28.456
It's written-- If you want an a
zero there,

00:43:28.456 --> 00:43:34.146
calculate it by this formula.
Then, you've got to write not c

00:43:34.146 --> 00:43:37.124
zero, but a zero over two.

00:43:37.124 --> 00:43:41.071
I think you will be happiest if
I have to give you advice.

00:43:41.071 --> 00:43:45.087
I think you'll be happiest
remembering a single formula for

00:43:45.087 --> 00:43:48.065
the an's and bn's,
in which case you have to

00:43:48.065 --> 00:43:52.012
remember that the constant
leading term is a zero over two

00:43:52.012 --> 00:43:55.197
if you insist on
using that formula.

00:43:55.197 --> 00:43:59.421
Otherwise, you have to learn a
special formula for the leading

00:43:59.421 --> 00:44:03.645
coefficient, namely one over two
pi instead of one

00:44:03.645 --> 00:44:08.073
over pi.
Well, am I really going to

00:44:08.073 --> 00:44:11.423
calculate a Fourier series in
four minutes?

00:44:11.423 --> 00:44:14.613
Not very likely,
but I'll give it a brave

00:44:14.613 --> 00:44:17.723
college try.
Anyway, you will be doing a

00:44:17.723 --> 00:44:21.552
great deal of it,
and your book has lots and lots

00:44:21.552 --> 00:44:23.944
of examples, too many,
in fact.

00:44:23.944 --> 00:44:28.650
It ruined all the good examples
by calculating them for you.

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:34.225
But, I will at least outline.
Do you want me to spend three

00:44:34.225 --> 00:44:38.828
minutes outlining a calculation
just so you have something to

00:44:38.828 --> 00:44:42.127
work on in the next boring class
you are in?

00:44:42.127 --> 00:44:46.501
Let's see, so I'll just put a
few key things on the board.

00:44:46.501 --> 00:44:49.570
I would advise you to sit still
for this.

00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:54.097
Otherwise you're going to hack
it, and take twice as long as

00:44:54.097 --> 00:44:58.624
you should, even though I knew
you've been up to 3:00 in the

00:44:58.624 --> 00:45:03.173
morning doing your problem set.
Cheer up.

00:45:03.173 --> 00:45:08.260
I got up at 6:00 to make up the
new one.

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:13.478
So, we're even.
This should be zero here.

00:45:13.478 --> 00:45:17.391
So, here's minus pi.
Here's pi.

00:45:17.391 --> 00:45:24.304
Here's one, negative one.
The function starts out like

00:45:24.304 --> 00:45:31.869
that, and now to be periodic,
it then has to continue on in

00:45:31.869 --> 00:45:37.774
the same way.
So, I think that's enough of

00:45:37.774 --> 00:45:42.234
its path through life to
indicate how it runs.

00:45:42.234 --> 00:45:48.279
This is a typical square-away
function, sometimes it's called.

00:45:48.279 --> 00:45:53.432
It's an odd function.
It goes equally above and below

00:45:53.432 --> 00:45:56.207
the axis.
Now, the integrals,

00:45:56.207 --> 00:46:00.765
when you calculate them,
the an is going to be,

00:46:00.765 --> 00:46:08.000
okay, look, the an is going to
turn out to be zero.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.072
Let me, instead,
and you will get that with a

00:46:11.072 --> 00:46:14.004
little hacking.
I'm much more worried about

00:46:14.004 --> 00:46:17.985
what you'll do with the bn's.
Also, next Monday you'll see

00:46:17.985 --> 00:46:22.174
intuitively that the an is zero,
in which case you won't even

00:46:22.174 --> 00:46:25.456
bother trying to calculate it.
How about the bn,

00:46:25.456 --> 00:46:26.922
though?
Well, you see,

00:46:26.922 --> 00:46:29.506
because the function is
discontinuous,

00:46:29.506 --> 00:46:32.788
so, this is my input.
My f of t is that

00:46:32.788 --> 00:46:37.619
orange discontinuous function.
The bn is going to be,

00:46:37.619 --> 00:46:40.049
I have to break it into two
parts.

00:46:40.049 --> 00:46:43.509
In the first part,
the function is negative one.

00:46:43.509 --> 00:46:47.263
And there, I will be
integrating from minus pi to pi

00:46:47.263 --> 00:46:50.503
of the function,
which is minus one times the

00:46:50.503 --> 00:46:54.552
sine of nt dt.

00:46:54.552 --> 00:46:57.276
And then, there's another part,

00:46:57.276 --> 00:47:02.704
sorry, minus pi to zero.
The other part I integrate from

00:47:02.704 --> 00:47:06.805
zero to pi of what?
Well, f of t is now plus one.

00:47:06.805 --> 00:47:10.731
And so, I simply integrate sine

00:47:10.731 --> 00:47:14.570
nt dt.
Now, each of these is a

00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:19.281
perfectly simple integral.
The only question is how you

00:47:19.281 --> 00:47:21.463
combine them.
So, this is,

00:47:21.463 --> 00:47:26.087
after you calculate it,
it will be (one minus cosine n

00:47:26.087 --> 00:47:29.402
pi) all over n.

00:47:29.402 --> 00:47:34.812
And, this part will turn out to
be (one minus cosine n pi) over

00:47:34.812 --> 00:47:40.961
n also. And therefore,

00:47:40.961 --> 00:47:48.949
the answer will be two minus
two cosine, two over n times,

00:47:48.949 --> 00:47:55.394
right, two minus,
two times (one minus cosine n

00:47:55.394 --> 00:48:01.000
pi) over n.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.661
No, okay, now,
what's this?

00:48:03.661 --> 00:48:09.496
This is minus one if n is odd.
It's plus one if n is even.

00:48:09.496 --> 00:48:15.637
Now, either you can work with
it this way, or you can combine

00:48:15.637 --> 00:48:19.732
the two of them into a single
expression.

00:48:19.732 --> 00:48:26.078
Its minus one to the nth power
takes care of both of

00:48:26.078 --> 00:48:29.251
them.
But, the way the answer is

00:48:29.251 --> 00:48:34.165
normally expressed,
it would be minus two over n,

00:48:34.165 --> 00:48:37.236
two over n times,
if n is even,

00:48:37.236 --> 00:48:41.166
I get zero.
If n is odd,

00:48:41.166 --> 00:48:43.500
I get two.
So, times two,

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:46.805
if n is odd,
and zero if n is even.

00:48:46.805 --> 00:48:50.111
So, it's four over n,
or it's zero,

00:48:50.111 --> 00:48:55.944
and the final series is a sum
of those coefficients times the

00:48:55.944 --> 00:49:01.583
appropriate-- cosine or sine?
Sine terms because the cosine

00:49:01.583 --> 00:49:08.000
terms were all coefficients,
all turned out to be zero.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:13.694
I'm sorry I didn't have the
chance to do that calculation in

00:49:13.694 --> 00:49:16.879
detail.
But, I think that's enough

00:49:16.879 --> 00:49:20.545
sketch for you to be able to do
the rest of it yourself.
