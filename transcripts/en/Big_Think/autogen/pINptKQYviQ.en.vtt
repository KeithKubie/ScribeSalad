there to be any complexity at all in the
universe that is fairly breathtaking in

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359
universe that is fairly breathtaking in
 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.140
universe that is fairly breathtaking in
its lack of probability of ever having

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150
its lack of probability of ever having
 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.390
its lack of probability of ever having
happened and it does make you think that

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400
happened and it does make you think that
 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.810
happened and it does make you think that
a mind might have been involved in

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820
a mind might have been involved in
 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.470
a mind might have been involved in
setting the stage at the same time that

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480
setting the stage at the same time that
 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.050
setting the stage at the same time that
does not imply necessarily that that

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060
does not imply necessarily that that
 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.890
does not imply necessarily that that
mind is controlling the specific

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900

manipulations of things that are going

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030
manipulations of things that are going
 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.060
manipulations of things that are going
on in the natural world in fact I would

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070
on in the natural world in fact I would
 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.699
on in the natural world in fact I would
very much resist that idea I think the

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709
very much resist that idea I think the
 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.190
very much resist that idea I think the
laws of nature potentially could be the

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200
laws of nature potentially could be the
 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.380
laws of nature potentially could be the
product of a mind I think that's a

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390
product of a mind I think that's a
 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.210
product of a mind I think that's a
defensible perspective but once those

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220
defensible perspective but once those
 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.820
defensible perspective but once those
laws are in place then I think nature

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830
laws are in place then I think nature
 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.159
laws are in place then I think nature
goes on and science has the chance to be

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169
goes on and science has the chance to be
 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.800
goes on and science has the chance to be
able to perceive how that works and what

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810
able to perceive how that works and what
 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.950
able to perceive how that works and what
its consequences are
