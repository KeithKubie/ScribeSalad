VISHAY NIHALANI: Hi, everyone.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:04.900
Thanks for coming out today.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.930
My name is Vishay Nihalani, and
I'm joined by Flo Thng.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.850
Flo and I are both product
managers who work

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.600
at Google on AdMob.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.260
So just by show of hands, how
many of you here are familiar

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.680
with AdMob?

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.670
And how many of you are
app developers?

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.160
Excellent.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.790
And how many of you app
developers have actually

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.460
included AdMob in one of your
applications, either to

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.560
monetize, or used AdMob
to promote?

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.810
FLO THNG: Yeah!

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.150
VISHAY NIHALANI: Well, it's
great to see that so many of

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.500
you are active and
have used AdMob.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.570
You guys are at the center of a

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.610
thriving mobile app ecosystem.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.890
And we're really proud
to be part of that.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.730
Every day we see that users are
downloading more and more

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.730
applications, and spending
more time in those

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.250
applications as well.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.530
So at AdMob, our goal is to help
be a partner for you, and

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.940
help you promote and monetize
your application successfully.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.580
The pace of growth
is absolutely

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.950
staggering with apps.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.110
And no doubt, that growth
creates some interesting

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.970
challenges.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.040
At AdMob we see three
major challenges.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.210
These are around discovery,
monetization, and the user

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.950
experience.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.780
There are now over 1.6 million
applications across the Google

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.360
Play and iOS app stores
combined.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.080
That's great choice for users,
but what does that mean for

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.890
you as an app developer?

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.770
As an app developer, that
means that you have to

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.520
constantly jockey for place in
the marketplace rankings in

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.570
order to get your app in
front of your users.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.010
So it's important to be
incredibly deliberate about

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.070
how you promote your
app to your users.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.590
On the monetization side, as
your user base grows, you

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.520
expect your revenue
to grow with it.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.870
And doing that might
involve working

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.240
with multiple ad networks.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.240
But working with multiple
networks can be challenging,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.650
both technically and
operationally.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.170
And on the user experience side,
it's important to be

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.180
tactful about how you show
adds to your users.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.900
A bad experience can ruin
the user's experience.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.320
It can put off your existing
users from using your app, and

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.190
it can turn away new users
if they see bad

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.290
reviews in the app store.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.240
And as a developer, you're
including content from third

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.470
party sources.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.120
So you want to make sure that
the content that shows up in

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.660
your application enhances
your brand rather

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.040
than tarnishes it.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.380
You want to make sure that the
ads that show up are relevant,

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.505
engaging, and appropriate
for your users.

00:02:29.744 --> 00:02:56.440
[BREAK IN AUDIO]

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.170
VISHAY NIHALANI: Just
this year--

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:04.710
[BREAK IN AUDIO]

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.250
VISHAY NIHALANI: This is just
the first step to opening the

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.900
floodgates of monetization.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.700
And we hope to see tremendous
growth in this area.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.930
And of course, we want to help
preserve the user experience.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.410
We have a team at AdMob that's
working on building innovative

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.320
new ad formats that help
preserve the user's experience

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.810
within your application.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.370
We're building ad formats that
inherently verify that the

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.450
user is actually interested in
the ad content before taking

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.760
them out of your app and
onto the landing page.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.300
So with an eye toward solving
some of these challenges, I am

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.970
really excited to announce the
launch of a brand new AdMob.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.080
This new AdMob is laser
focused on apps.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.640
At the same time, we've brought
the power of AdSense

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.370
and AdWords to mobile apps.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.330
We've leveraged more than a
decade of innovation and

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.630
experience to bring you the
scale and reliability that

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.350
Google offers across all
of its ads products.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.510
Our goal is to make it
incredibly simple for you to

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.480
promote and monetize
your applications.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.200
The idea is to make it very
simple for you to promote and

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.130
monetize so that you, as a lone
app developer with an

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.470
idea, can go to becoming a team
of app developers working

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.860
on building a sustainable
business like Chris in this

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.339
video we're about to show.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:21.600
We hope that this will be a
familiar aspiration for many

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.850
of you in the audience.

00:04:25.158 --> 00:04:25.610
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.910
-Inspiration can come from some
pretty unlikely places.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.100
But once it hits, there's
a lot of work to do.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.010
Designing an app takes months
of programming, problem

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.410
solving, and testing.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.890
But finally you have something
you're happy with.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.930
And now, with AdMob, you can
earn a return on all your work

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.690
by showing relevant
ads in your app.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.670
Then, with AdMob's promotion
tools, watch your app take off

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.950
in a bigger way than
you imagined.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.520
From success at home to
downloads online, AdMob

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.020
connects your app
with millions of

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.855
advertisers and users.

00:05:03.855 --> 00:05:06.660
So now that you're earning
money, you'll have more time

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.330
to build your business,
and get inspired for

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.805
your next great app.

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.280
VISHAY NIHALANI: And with that,
I'd like to introduce

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.160
Flo, who's going to talk about
some of the features that

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.746
we've built into the new AdMob
to improve app promotion.

00:05:25.746 --> 00:05:27.130
FLO THNG: All right.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.770
Thanks, Vishay.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:28.920
Hi, everyone.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.010
You saw some flashes of the new
interface in the video.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.810
Now let's dive into the demo so
we can share with you some

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.040
of the exciting features in the
new AdMob to help you get

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.600
more users and make more
money from your apps.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.000
We redesigned the UI into
three core sections.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.150
Home, Monetize, and Promote.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.500
Home tab is basically
a dashboard.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.960
We pulled together all your
stats in one place to help you

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.310
get an overview on how your app
business is performing.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.780
On the top here, you can see a
summary on how much money I've

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.520
made from my apps today.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.550
And how many downloads
that AdMob has

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.080
driven to all my apps.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.270
When you scroll down, we can see
more granular stats, like

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.880
RPM, fill rate, conversion.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.060
It's nice to see that we're
getting more and more

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.350
conversion here.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.560
And the best part, my favorite,
is that we've

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.750
organized all of this by app, so
you can quickly review and

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.530
figure out the action needed.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.520
For example, Line Up is getting

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.000
quite a number of users.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.240
Maybe it's time for us to
start monetizing it.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.480
Or Flooded here, which is
actually earning me quite a

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.470
bit of money.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.000
So I could consider actually
promoting it even more.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.820
Which brings us to
the Promote tab.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.970
Promote tab is the hub for
advertising with AdMob.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.420
One of the advantages
of advertising with

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.220
AdMob is our scale.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.230
Because we work with app
developers worldwide, like

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.000
yourself, we have billions of
users in the AdMob network.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.470
And we've designed it so that
you can create a campaign to

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:12.060
reach all of those users with
just a few simple steps.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.360
So I'm going to create
a new campaign today.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.860
And the first step is to
just pick a campaign

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.140
that I want to promote.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.290
I see a lot of you enjoying your
Chrome Pixel, so I will,

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.390
in honor of that, promote
a Chrome app.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.460
All you have to do is just type
it in, and you see that

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.050
we pull automatically from the
two major app stores the most

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.670
likely app that I
was looking for.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.250
Which in this case
is Chrome Beta.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.330
So I will just select it.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.360
No need to put any package ID.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.730
And you can do image
ad or text ad.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.190
I didn't have time to create an
image ad, so I'm going to

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.120
go with text ad today.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.040
Good thing is AdMob is going to
help me make this text ad

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.800
more engaging and informative.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.900
So all I have to do is create
a campaign name, an ad name,

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.560
put a bit for a CPC.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.220
So I will put in $0.08.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:11.580
We pull in the destination
URL directly.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.830
Save you some steps.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:27.150
And the best part here is we can
preview what it looks like

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.570
in different formats.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.890
In tablet, in phone.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:36.190
And we've made this a lot more
informative and engaging for

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.840
the users, because you can see
now, there is that Chrome

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.320
logo, the review information,
the rating information.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.920
The goal is to make this app
informative so that users will

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.420
click on it and then download.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.800
The next step is figuring out
who do I want to target with

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.910
this promotion.

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:01.130
So, because this is I/O
specific, I might want to

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.215
target just people
in San Francisco.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.040
And each of these targeting
settings

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.770
is very easily editable.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:16.980
AdMob also, because we're
connected to Google Play, will

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:21.450
know automatically that Chrome
Beta requires Android 4.0 and

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.750
up in order to run properly.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.710
The OS setting is
correctly set.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.770
This is only going to get
shown to users who are

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:30.035
eligible to download your app.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.630
Now I just need to set a daily
budget, name this.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.750
And I've just create the
Chrome app promotion.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:51.000
Now what I want to know is how
effective is this campaign?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.560
How many users is it going
generate for me?

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.610
And how much are these
users going to be?

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.770
The good thing is we've
integrated conversion tracking

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.450
into the campaign
creation flow.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:07.800
So if you are promoting an app,
all you have to do is hit

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.940
Confirm and Finish here,
and you're all

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.340
done for Android app.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.690
Or if you happen to have
analytics data, and you know

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:17.610
what is the value for conversion
for your app, you

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.480
can put in this optional
value here.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.730
I'm going to put $2.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:27.840
And just with that, AdMob will
automatically start tracking

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.580
the users who have clicked on
your app and then download it.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.050
For iOS, it is a little
bit more involved.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:39.490
You will have to include a short
code snippet in your

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:44.030
app, which you can access from
the App Conversion tab.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.220
If you click on Edit, this
nice little pencil here,

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.760
you'll be able to get
that snippet here.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.210
And we've made it easy, because
you can just email it

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:53.515
to yourself.

00:10:53.515 --> 00:10:55.120
Which I'm going to skip now.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.540
If you're an app developer,
and I'm sure many of you

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.200
actually have multiple apps,
not just one, you can jump

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.910
start your new app by
cross-promoting it to your

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:09.360
existing user base.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.910
And AdMob allows you to do that
easily with house apps.

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:16.260
So when you create a new
campaign, you can also select

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.700
to create a house app.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:24.030
For example, if I want to
promote the Chrome app here to

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:27.180
LabPixies users, I'm going to
just do the same thing.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.270
All of these is the
same as before.

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:45.410
The one new step is we now
display all of the add units

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.510
that you have created
for your app.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:54.250
So I'm going to select Color
Drips and Flooded, which means

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.590
that this Chrome promotion
is going to show

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:59.440
in these two games.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.690
I save it.

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:08.260
And because this is house app,
and we're promoting this to

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.240
your own inventory, you don't
need to set a budget.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.550
We can actually do
this for free.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.160
Next is you just allocate
your inventory.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.680
So don't forget to do
this so that your

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.930
campaign will start serving.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.330
Once everything is set up--

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.880
I've set up house app campaign,
regular campaign--

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.570
you can monitor the performances
of all of these

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.310
campaigns through our reporting
setting, which is in

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.910
these All Apps table.

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:37.070
So I can easily see which one of
my apps is converting well,

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:40.360
how much it is costing me to
convert, and what is the cost

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:40.970
per conversion.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.110
So this is really cool, because
I've set up conversion

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.280
tracking for all of this app,
I'll be able to know how much

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.950
it's costing me to
get somebody to

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:50.840
download a Chrome browser.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.560
The next step is
to optimize it.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.500
So if you click on any one of
these apps, you'll be able to

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.530
see that I've set up
multiple campaigns.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:02.860
Some of them are doing better
than the others.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:07.100
And I've set up multiple ads,
and some are converting better

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.380
than the others.

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.600
So I might want to actually
optimize.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.830
And we allow inline editing, so
I can just go in here and

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.690
say, maybe I need to
actually bid higher

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.240
and get better users.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.290
Or I can go to Campaign tab and
says, the second campaign

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:24.230
is doing really well.

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:25.925
I want to actually increase
the budget.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.130
This is all, however, quite
manual you have to actually go

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.280
in there, figure out which
one is doing well.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.550
Maybe create your own model.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.490
So today we're really excited
to announce a new feature in

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:41.950
AdMob, which is called
Conversion Optimizers.

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:46.370
Conversion Optimizers will allow
you to set the bid based

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:48.810
on a target cost per
acquisition.

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:51.660
Basically, you just tell AdMob
how much you're willing to pay

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.890
for users, and let us do
the heavy lifting.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:57.160
We are going to look at your
conversion history.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.050
So we look at your campaign,
which one is performing well.

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:02.760
And we look at a bunch
of other signals.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.420
And we have very complex
model in the back end.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.310
All of these so that we can
predict when an impression

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.940
comes out whether it's going to
be very valuable for you.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:12.880
So we're going to bid
higher for it.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.080
And then for the less valuable
click, we're going to bid

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.280
lower for it.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.450
In order to do this,
you just have to

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.025
click Edit on the campaigns.

00:14:28.903 --> 00:14:30.153
Oh, sorry.

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:45.550
OK.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.280
We're having some--

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.220
so when you click on the
campaign, these are--

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.430
we're having some
network problem.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:57.300
But you should be able to
actually switch bidding from

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:01.520
bidding on CPC to bidding on--

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.750
I'm going to show it
to a different way.

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:05.000
Sorry.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.450
This is what happens when
we run a live demo.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:19.700
Quite exciting.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.440
So you can see here, you will be
able to switch your bidding

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:34.930
option from focusing on clicks
to focusing on conversion.

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:38.110
You can put in a target cost
per acquisition here.

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:39.300
I'm putting in $1.08.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.090
That's how much I'm willing to
pay to get a user on Chrome,

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:44.380
because my RPU is really,
really high.

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.830
I can put in a lower number and
actually reduce my cost

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:48.830
per acquisition.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:50.960
Just keep in mind, that means
the number of downloads that

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.080
I'm going to get is
going to be lower.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.330
If I had put in a larger number,
like $2, I will get a

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:57.580
lot more download.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.580
What we recommend is actually
put in a conversion cost close

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:03.890
to what you have right now.

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:07.640
So Conversion Optimizer, it's
important to keep in mind,

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:12.910
it's not the same as a
guaranteed cost per install.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.380
The result is going to vary.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.240
However, most people who have
implemented it have seen

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.870
really great results.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:21.890
So our early testers have
seen reduction in

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:23.930
conversion costs by 20%.

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:27.810
We work with Gree, one of the
game developers in Japan.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:30.910
They implemented conversion
optimizers across multiple of

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:33.700
their campaign, and they were
able to reduce their cost of

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.820
user acquisition by 50%.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:39.180
Basically the same budget, they
get twice as many users.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:42.080
Who doesn't love that?

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.320
So with this, hopefully, all of
you now can create your own

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.790
app promotion campaign.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:49.500
We strongly suggest when you
do that, set up conversion

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.300
tracking so you'll be able
to know how much it

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:52.630
costs to get a user.

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:55.770
And please try out Conversion
Optimizer so AdMob can help

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:57.220
you optimize your budget.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:00.530
With that, I'll hand it back to
Vishay, who is going to go

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.610
through Monetization tab,
and help you make more

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:03.860
money with your app.

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:10.160
VISHAY NIHALANI: Thanks, Flo.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.010
So now that you've promoted
your application, you've

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.050
gotten tons and tons
of downloads.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:19.190
The next step is to consider
modernizing those users.

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:21.560
So I'll quickly walk you through
what it's like to set

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.579
up monetization in one
of your applications.

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:27.680
So let's say we want
to monetize the

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.720
same Chrome Beta app.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.510
So first select the
application.

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:37.000
As you can see, one of the
changes from the legacy AdMob

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.500
to this new interface is that
your inventory is actually

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.560
organized by application.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.030
This is great for you because
it adds organization.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:47.260
But it's also great because
it allows us to run some

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.850
interesting quality models to
really optimize your apps,

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:53.150
rather than arbitrary
ad units.

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.700
So let's say we want to
set up an ad unit.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.190
It's quite simple.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.350
Let's say you have a banner
on the bottom screen.

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:05.190
You can create this ad unit, see
a nice preview of the ad

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:07.330
unit, save it.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:09.960
And just like on the promote
side, you can easily email the

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.300
instructions on how to
integrate the ad

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.630
unit to your developer.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.200
So once you've done that and
released your application,

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.850
you'll start to see revenue pour
into your application.

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:24.070
It's fairly simple.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:26.760
Now, the thing to consider is
making sure that you're

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.340
showing the right ads
to the right users.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.310
So with our new publisher
controls feature, we allow you

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:35.710
to very easily categorize all of
the ads that are showing up

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:39.920
in your application, and allow
or block them by category.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.590
So as you can see in this
interface, we launched the

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.710
ability for you to sort your
ads into hundreds of

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:48.020
categories, so that you can
make sure that only

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.470
appropriate ads show
to your audience.

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:53.030
We also have the ability to
see how much revenue is

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:56.820
actually coming from each
category of ad, so that you

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.080
can make an intelligent decision
on the risks versus

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.490
rewards of blocking certain
categories.

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:04.960
Many of you also may have
a concern about showing

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.460
competitors' applications
advertisements in your app.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.930
So with this new feature, we
allow you to actually block

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:14.630
ads by the landing page URL.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:18.580
So for example, if you're Chrome
and you want to block--

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:22.040
let's use an arbitrary
example.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.040
Let's say you want to block
a particular game.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:29.770
You can grab the URL from the
iTunes or Google Play store,

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:31.950
drop it in here, and
click Block.

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:34.810
And we'll make sure that that
competitor's apps don't show

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:38.130
up in your application.

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:41.100
So now that you've set up your
publisher controls and your

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.650
filters, you may find your
inventory start to grow.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:47.270
And in that case, you may want
to work with multiple ad

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:49.460
networks to monetize
your inventory.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.620
So we've made it incredibly
simple to add multiple ad

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.960
networks to your ad source.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.790
So assuming that you've dropped
the SDKs into your

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:59.630
application already, it's very
straightforward to add more ad

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.640
networks because each ad
unit, by default, is

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.360
configured for mediation.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.850
So to do that, simply add
another ad network.

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:12.060
Let's say in this case we want
to add the AdMob eCPM Floor.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.320
Click Save.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.700
And essentially, the
way mediation--

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:22.970
[BREAK IN AUDIO]

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.550
VISHAY NIHALANI: --that
network doesn't

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:25.740
fill the add request.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.860
We'll kick it down to the next
highest paying ad network, and

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:31.590
so on, in order to maximize your
revenue per impression.

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:34.520
So simply set up what you've
been getting paid

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.770
from each ad network.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.930
And by default, we'll start
to optimize your revenue.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:47.880
So we hope these features will
be incredibly useful for you

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.280
as you monetize and promote
your application.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.850
Just to recap, we've kind of
launched five key improvements

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:54.890
in this new interface.

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:56.760
These are smarter app promotion
and conversion

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.320
optimizer, simplified
mediation, robust ad

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.830
filtering, intelligent
reporting, and some of you in

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:07.590
the audience may be really
excited to hear that for

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:10.040
developers who are outside of
the United States, we are

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:15.870
launching local currency
payments all over the world.

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:17.860
We hope that this will make it
easier for you guys to get

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:21.240
paid and to start spending
your money.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.770
So with that, I'd like to show
you some of our really

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.940
exciting new app formats which
we believe are really

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.960
innovative and will really catch
your users' attention.

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:34.885
So the first--

00:21:34.885 --> 00:21:35.860
I often play this game.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.570
It's called Line Up.

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:44.430
And the basic concept is to
clear all these blocks away.

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:47.530
I often play this game while I'm
kind of waiting in line at

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:50.630
the cafes at Google.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:52.500
And so in between levels--
let's say I'm

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.830
done with this level.

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:55.080
I start a new game.

00:21:58.635 --> 00:22:01.415
I think we're having some
network connectivity issues.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:05.890
There we go.

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:08.640
And so just like with TrueView
on the web, we've introduced

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.070
TrueView on the mobile apps.

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:13.990
So in this particular case, in
between the levels, it's a

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:15.720
natural time to show an ad.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.250
We can actually present this
video ad to the user.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.950
They can watch the ad, see if
they're interested in it.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:23.070
If they are, they can keep
watching the video.

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:24.310
In this case, I've
seen this ad.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:25.540
It's pretty cool.

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.680
It's the Chrome ad from Paris.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.170
It's pretty sweet.

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.015
But I've already seen it before,
so I want to skip it,

00:22:32.015 --> 00:22:33.820
and I want to get back
to playing this game.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.480
So to do that, I just click the
Skip Ad button, and just

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.210
like that I'm back
in the game.

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:43.010
So we hope that ad formats like
this one will help to

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:46.390
preserve the user experience,
and also increase the

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:50.260
advertiser ROI, so that they're
only receiving clicks,

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:52.000
and they're only receiving
users who are actually

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.850
interested in the content
that they have on offer.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.710
So with that, I'd like to show
you all the story of Toni

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:01.120
Fingerroos You might have heard
of him from the game

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.640
Hill Climb Racing.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.580
In three months, working long
hours by himself, he built an

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.760
app that now has tens of
millions of downloads.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.770
We believe our new platform
will help create many more

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:12.470
success stories just
like this one.

00:23:22.697 --> 00:23:23.680
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.160
-I like cars I built myself.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.380
That's one of my hobbies.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.458
I own this old Toyota Supra,
which we put the engine and

00:23:31.458 --> 00:23:33.698
all that stuff into.

00:23:33.698 --> 00:23:37.120
I guess it's a little bit in me
that I want to do something

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.540
on my own, build things.

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.890
Even it's a game or a car.

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:43.190
My name is Toni Fingerroos.

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:44.640
I come from Oulu, Finland.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.180
We have a start up there
called Fingersoft.

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:49.770
It creates mobile
games and apps.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:52.270
After developing several years
for a PlayStation game that

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:55.050
was still unpublished, I just
wanted to see some results,

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:58.930
and get my work shown to people
around the world.

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:02.340
So I started working on Hill
Climb Racing alone.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:05.380
I spent like three months
working on it,

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.545
about 16 hours a day.

00:24:07.545 --> 00:24:12.230
The character itself, it's
actually drawn by my fiance.

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:16.530
Hill Climb Racing has had over
60 million downloads.

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:18.250
That's quite a lot.

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.750
That's really started
generating revenue.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:25.010
About 40% comes from
advertisements, and AdMob is

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:26.540
our cornerstone.

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:29.750
With AdMob you have several
different ways to show

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:30.730
advertisements.

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:33.470
So we place them on the bottom
of the screen, and during game

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:35.570
play we hide all the
apps so it doesn't

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:37.080
interrupt the user at all.

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.100
We have users all around
the world.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.220
So we have to feel

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.950
advertisements in global scale.

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:45.310
And I think AdMob is doing
a really good job.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:48.920
I got enough money from AdMob so
I could develop Fingersoft

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.920
applications and games
full time.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.040
If I show it like this--

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:54.940
see?

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:55.820
-Yeah, that's great.

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:56.970
-This is office we started.

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:58.240
Just a room from my place.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.570
You can see me there.

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:01.690
This is the new office.

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:03.080
There's the work stations.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.885
That's the pool table.

00:25:04.885 --> 00:25:07.860
And then, of course, the Finnish
style sauna which we

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:11.190
can relax in and design new
products and ideas.

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:14.180
So have a few beers
and take it easy.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.710
I think it's awesome when you
get to create something, and

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:19.810
you get it finished, and then
you receive customer feedback.

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:22.520
And if they like it,
it's really nice.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.550
And people like it,
and we like it.

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:28.092
That's great.

00:25:28.092 --> 00:25:33.080
[VIDEO PLAYBACK ENDS]

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.830
VISHAY NIHALANI: So I hope you
guys are all as excited to

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:37.290
access the new AdMob as
I am to share it.

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:40.050
We'll be rolling out this new
interface to new users.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:42.310
And if you have an existing
account, be on the lookout for

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:44.420
an upgrade notification.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:46.440
You can upgrade to the new
AdMob without making any

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.080
changes to your existing
application.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:48.870
So you don't have
to go through an

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:51.280
extensive release process.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:26:03.965
And with that, we'll turn it
over to Q&amp;A. Go ahead.

00:26:03.965 --> 00:26:05.440
I think there's a mic there.

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:11.630
AUDIENCE: While we're waiting,
just real quick one.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:14.705
If you're just totally
new to ads--

00:26:14.705 --> 00:26:17.005
you've been a developer for a
while, but totally new to the

00:26:17.005 --> 00:26:20.220
whole ad world, what's a good
resource just to kind of start

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:24.600
to understand what CPM and
all that stuff means?

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.430
VISHAY NIHALANI: We
have extensive

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:27.510
documentation on our website.

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:30.420
I can point to the support
site offline.

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:36.220
AUDIENCE: My question is
more on the video.

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:40.260
So the interstitched video ads
between say a click and

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:44.300
something else that's coming
next, like you showed there.

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.620
Is there a way that
kind of works?

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.660
Maybe this is more of a
double-click question, but can

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.880
you run your own video
ads within that?

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.060
Is there a way to control that
inventory, or is that all

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:57.540
sourced inventory
from AdWords--

00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:00.270
or what you guys are doing.

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:02.260
VISHAY NIHALANI: So today, all
the inventories source from

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:05.350
AdWords and the YouTube
network.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:07.750
But we're working on ways to
kind of improve our house ads

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:10.350
functionality to allow you to
serve your own video ads into

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:11.950
applications as well.

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:13.200
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.300
AUDIENCE: My question is about,
you mentioned that

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:22.240
you're enabling payments in
local currencies, in quite a

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.485
number of countries.

00:27:23.485 --> 00:27:25.950
I'm interested in knowing
what countries they

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:27.740
are covering in Africa.

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:28.940
VISHAY NIHALANI: That's
a great question.

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:29.930
We have a huge list.

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:31.840
I don't know it off the top my
head, but I can certainly

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.170
point you to the resources.

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:36.820
We are launching local currency
payments just all

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:37.430
over the world.

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:41.190
So we'll definitely
let you know if

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:42.440
your country is supported.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.570
AUDIENCE: I have a question
regarding

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:48.840
the convention tracking.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.100
Let's say when I'm an
advertiser, and I want to

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.180
advertise at AdMob,
but I'm also

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:54.780
advertising in other ad networks.

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:58.200
So how well does the new AdMob
work with like third parties

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:02.320
for conversion tracking, and
all these kind of things?

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.772
FLO THNG: So if I get the
question correctly, does the

00:28:04.772 --> 00:28:07.900
new AdMob support conversion
tracking with other networks?

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.520
Is that the question?

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.065
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so when
I want [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:11.065 --> 00:28:13.830
AdMob, if I can use third party
tools for conversion

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:17.080
trends so I can integrate, or
if I can use AdMob to also

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.410
track the conversions
from other networks.

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:19.630
FLO THNG: That's a
great question.

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:22.920
So for now, we only support
tracking conversion

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.810
tracking for AdMob.

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:27.930
And the URL conversion tracking
with third party URL,

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:30.030
we're going to support very
quickly after launch.

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:33.430
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.810
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:35.590
I have a question regarding
the filters.

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:38.750
Is it possible to use wild
cards to block certain

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:42.260
keywords, or does it have
to be that exact URL?

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.820
Just in case that URL changes
on the other end from the

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:47.880
advertiser.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:48.950
VISHAY NIHALANI: That's
a great question .

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:53.130
For now, we don't support just
filtering by keywords.

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:54.560
But the URLs are pretty--

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.350
we use regular expressions to
kind of match patterns.

00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:00.570
So if you put in a regex,
it should work.

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:03.060
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:03.252
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:03.252 --> 00:29:06.160
So I'm pretty interested
in the video ad.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:11.020
So if you just skip the video
in like the five seconds, so

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:14.945
that's not counted as
a valid ad, right?

00:29:14.945 --> 00:29:18.040
So you don't have to
pay for that, or--

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.680
VISHAY NIHALANI:
That's correct.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.140
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.490
And another question is that the
in cost marketing, so we

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:26.850
should be in the same AdMob
account, right?

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:31.670
So if I want to do the inhouse
ad, so we should in--

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:33.520
FLO THNG: Yes, house ad will
be in the same account.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:33.840
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:43.146
But sometimes in our firms,
so each person has

00:29:43.146 --> 00:29:45.520
his very own account.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.990
How do you solve a problem
like that?

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:50.210
FLO THNG: That's a
good question.

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:53.310
If you stop by the Sandbox
later, I'll actually just

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:54.560
address that with you.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.810
AUDIENCE: All right, thanks.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:06.310
VISHAY NIHALANI: Cool.

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:07.690
Well, thanks, everyone,
for coming out.

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:08.070
FLO THNG: Wait, I think there's
one more question.

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:10.980
VISHAY NIHALANI: Oh,
one more question.

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:16.060
AUDIENCE: Is there possible to
insert animated ad banner?

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.850
FLO THNG: Yes, animated banner
will be supported.

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:23.620
AUDIENCE: Which format?

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:28.750
For example, can is insert
the Flash ad?

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:29.610
FLO THNG: I can get
back to you.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:31.420
I don't think-- it's just
a regular format.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.384
I don't think Flash will be.

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:40.580
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:42.495
Do you have any sort of
recommendations on different

00:30:42.495 --> 00:30:43.150
ad formats?

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:47.080
So between banners,
interstitials, what performs

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:50.220
the best for different
types of apps?

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:53.290
VISHAY NIHALANI: Yeah, that's
a great question.

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:56.150
I think there are a couple
things to keep in mind.

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:58.530
Typically, you want keep the ad
placements in places where

00:30:58.530 --> 00:30:59.550
it makes sense for your users.

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:01.860
So for example, if you're
playing with a game, as you

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:06.260
saw from Toni's video, you want
to keep the ad in a way

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:07.920
that it's not going to interfere
with the experience.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:13.460
So in his example, he's kind of
got it on the menu screens.

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.450
For different apps, different
things work.

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:18.070
We typically find that
interstitials have higher

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:20.000
conversion rates and
clickthrough rates, just

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.310
because there's more
of a canvas to

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:25.320
create an engaging ad.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.840
But it really depends
on the applications.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.675
So definitely play around
and experiment.

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:33.280
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.530
Hi.

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:37.670
I'm not really avid with AdMob,
but I have a question

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:43.560
about offline application
and your AdMob.

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:47.430
We have a connection for the
people who don't have Wi-Fi or

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:48.850
a connection.

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:49.630
What happens--

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:52.450
can you explain it
a little bit?

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:52.840
VISHAY NIHALANI: Yeah.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:53.830
So that's a great question.

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:57.080
We've heard this feature request
a number of times.

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.540
We have nothing to announce just
yet, but we're certainly

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:02.007
kind of thinking about
this use case.

00:32:02.007 --> 00:32:03.170
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:04.420
Thank you.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:07.100
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:12.076
I'm curious about whether this
system is compatible with

00:32:12.076 --> 00:32:15.420
these new regulations that are
coming into effect in July,

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:20.770
related to advertising to
children under the age of 13.

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:24.270
Or whether you have, in fact,
terms of service that would

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:27.450
say you can't use this
system with children

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:29.610
under the age of 13.

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:33.430
C-O-P-P-A, COPPA regulation.

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:34.230
VISHAY NIHALANI: That's
a great question.

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:36.078
I'll have to follow up with
you offline on that one.

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:43.810
In general, we always keep the
user experience at the

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:45.290
forefront of what we do.

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:47.740
We want to make sure that we're
compliant with all of

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:50.640
the sort of legal regulations.

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.150
And just kind of keeping
users in mind as we

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:53.400
develop these ads.

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:01.925
Cool.

00:33:01.925 --> 00:33:03.120
Well, thanks a lot
for coming out.

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.330
Definitely come and visit
us at the I/O booth

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:06.810
we have just outside.

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:09.660
And we're happy to answer any
more questions you might have.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:10.910
Thanks.
