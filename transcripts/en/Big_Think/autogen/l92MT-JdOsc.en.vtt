idea of the vision that there's a way to
 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.549
idea of the vision that there's a way to
to to bring out the genius in all of us

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559
to to bring out the genius in all of us
 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.910
to to bring out the genius in all of us
and I wish that there was a way that in

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920
and I wish that there was a way that in
 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.790
and I wish that there was a way that in
our educational system that we could

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800
our educational system that we could
 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.800
our educational system that we could
develop ways to promote creativity we do

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:43.810
develop ways to promote creativity we do
 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.720
develop ways to promote creativity we do
actually we're pretty good at it but we

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730
actually we're pretty good at it but we
 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.410
actually we're pretty good at it but we
could be better that we can teach people

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420
could be better that we can teach people
 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.819
could be better that we can teach people
to take risk in education we could value

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829
to take risk in education we could value
 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.229
to take risk in education we could value
more the the the person that takes the

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239
more the the the person that takes the
 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.410
more the the the person that takes the
path that is not the common path I think

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420
path that is not the common path I think
 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.100
path that is not the common path I think
we as a society are pretty good at that

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110
we as a society are pretty good at that
 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.590
we as a society are pretty good at that
we could be a lot better mm-hmm

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600
we could be a lot better mm-hmm
 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.989
we could be a lot better mm-hmm
and I think that that's one of the

00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:09.999
and I think that that's one of the
 

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:12.330
and I think that that's one of the
values of studying or thinking about

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340
values of studying or thinking about
 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.059

forward faster I think sometimes people

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479
forward faster I think sometimes people
 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.199
forward faster I think sometimes people
think about the brain as kind of a

00:01:28.199 --> 00:01:28.209
think about the brain as kind of a
 

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:31.230
think about the brain as kind of a
shortcut to all these sorts of problems

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240
shortcut to all these sorts of problems
 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.730
shortcut to all these sorts of problems
you know if we just understand the brain

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740
you know if we just understand the brain
 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.949
you know if we just understand the brain
then we can just go right in there and

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:34.959
then we can just go right in there and
 

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:37.559
then we can just go right in there and
just fix things directly whereas it's

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569
just fix things directly whereas it's
 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.609
just fix things directly whereas it's
easy to forget that you know education

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619
easy to forget that you know education
 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.539
easy to forget that you know education
itself is alters the brain exactly I

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549
itself is alters the brain exactly I
 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:46.919
itself is alters the brain exactly I
think that you have to think about

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929
think that you have to think about
 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.209
think that you have to think about
brains in the context of our society um

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219
brains in the context of our society um
 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:53.160
brains in the context of our society um
one of the things about genius I think

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170
one of the things about genius I think
 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.709
one of the things about genius I think
is not just an individual just to bring

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719
is not just an individual just to bring
 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.559
is not just an individual just to bring
it's about opportunity it's about

00:01:58.559 --> 00:01:58.569
it's about opportunity it's about
 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.849
it's about opportunity it's about
somebody who has given the pathway to

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:02.859
somebody who has given the pathway to
 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.069
somebody who has given the pathway to
actually make a contribution think of

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079
actually make a contribution think of
 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.649
actually make a contribution think of
our art musicians that most of us would

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659
our art musicians that most of us would
 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.320
our art musicians that most of us would
consider geniuses walk Beethoven Mozart

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330
consider geniuses walk Beethoven Mozart
 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.009
consider geniuses walk Beethoven Mozart
these are people that were put in

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019
these are people that were put in
 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.100
these are people that were put in
positions that allow them to

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110
positions that allow them to
 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.680
positions that allow them to
be creative the creative spirit comes

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690
be creative the creative spirit comes
 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.410
be creative the creative spirit comes
with many things other than just a brain

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420
with many things other than just a brain
 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.630
with many things other than just a brain
I think it comes from the opportunity it

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640
I think it comes from the opportunity it
 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.000
I think it comes from the opportunity it
comes with resources sometimes with an

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010
comes with resources sometimes with an
 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.300
comes with resources sometimes with an
attitude again I like the idea of not

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310
attitude again I like the idea of not
 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.520
attitude again I like the idea of not
thinking of it as something that that

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530
thinking of it as something that that
 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.580
thinking of it as something that that
targets an individual and separates them

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590
targets an individual and separates them
 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.400
targets an individual and separates them
but something that joins us together as

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410
but something that joins us together as
 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.040
but something that joins us together as
a quality that belongs to all of us hmm

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050
a quality that belongs to all of us hmm
 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.990
a quality that belongs to all of us hmm
well because it is true that when we

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000
well because it is true that when we
 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.770
well because it is true that when we
people talk about geniuses they are

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780
people talk about geniuses they are
 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.210
people talk about geniuses they are
other there there they're almost

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220
other there there they're almost
 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.390
other there there they're almost
freakish exactly and I think that that

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400
freakish exactly and I think that that
 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.470
freakish exactly and I think that that
attitude really deters people from

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480
attitude really deters people from
 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.660
attitude really deters people from
taking the risk when Sedona led sword

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670
taking the risk when Sedona led sword
 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.770
taking the risk when Sedona led sword
the genius term is often associated with

the genius term is often associated with
 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.570

we think it could give it something that

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770
we think it could give it something that
 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.699
we think it could give it something that
didn't exist before that changes the

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709
didn't exist before that changes the
 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.340
didn't exist before that changes the
course of our progress as some

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350
course of our progress as some
 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.630

her nature stands out and is different
and yet and yet all of us are different

and yet and yet all of us are different
 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.120
and yet and yet all of us are different
in our creative sphere and that by

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130
in our creative sphere and that by
 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.060
in our creative sphere and that by
incorporating the creative person into

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070
incorporating the creative person into
 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.120
incorporating the creative person into
the mainstream it might be a way to

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130
the mainstream it might be a way to
 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.620
the mainstream it might be a way to
encourage more creativity in a way you

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630
encourage more creativity in a way you
 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.750
encourage more creativity in a way you
know you've been talking a lot about the

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760
know you've been talking a lot about the
 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.150
know you've been talking a lot about the
things that neuroscientists can't tell

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160
things that neuroscientists can't tell
 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.310
things that neuroscientists can't tell
us about genius we want easy answers and

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320
us about genius we want easy answers and
 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.289
us about genius we want easy answers and
and we think oh the easy answers are on

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299
and we think oh the easy answers are on
 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.300
and we think oh the easy answers are on
the brain and and you're kind of warning

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310
the brain and and you're kind of warning
 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.449
the brain and and you're kind of warning
us like well we neuroscientists we don't

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459
us like well we neuroscientists we don't
 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:52.920
us like well we neuroscientists we don't
know all that much the brain is a

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930
know all that much the brain is a
 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.740
know all that much the brain is a
complicated thing and it's in it it's a

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750
complicated thing and it's in it it's a
 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.870
complicated thing and it's in it it's a
social thing too

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880
social thing too
 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.280
social thing too
so I mean what do you think that

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290
so I mean what do you think that
 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.240
so I mean what do you think that
neuroscientists can do to help us

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250
neuroscientists can do to help us
 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.340
neuroscientists can do to help us
understand genius better I mean what

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350
understand genius better I mean what
 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.860
understand genius better I mean what
what are the kinds of studies that you

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870
what are the kinds of studies that you
 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.289
what are the kinds of studies that you
think would be like the best ones to do

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299
think would be like the best ones to do
 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.240
think would be like the best ones to do
to make us understand genius as you

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250
to make us understand genius as you
 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.020
to make us understand genius as you
think of it I think that in general the

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030
think of it I think that in general the
 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.819
think of it I think that in general the
study of individual differences is a

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829
study of individual differences is a
 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.770
study of individual differences is a
really interesting direction to take

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780
really interesting direction to take
 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.719
really interesting direction to take
differences in say there's some people

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729
differences in say there's some people
 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.869
differences in say there's some people
that have extraordinary memory

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:29.879
that have extraordinary memory
 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:33.919
that have extraordinary memory
and we can design experiments to look at

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:33.929
and we can design experiments to look at
 

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:35.510
and we can design experiments to look at
the neural circuitry that's associated

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520
the neural circuitry that's associated
 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.589
the neural circuitry that's associated
with memory strategies and we learn

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599
with memory strategies and we learn
 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:41.889
with memory strategies and we learn
something about what makes one person

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:41.899
something about what makes one person
 

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:45.379
something about what makes one person
better at memorizing things than another

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389
better at memorizing things than another
 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.909
better at memorizing things than another
there are differences in on how how well

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919
there are differences in on how how well
 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.919
there are differences in on how how well
we do mathematics and how well we can

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:53.929
we do mathematics and how well we can
 

00:04:53.929 --> 00:04:57.859
we do mathematics and how well we can
put things together and understanding

00:04:57.859 --> 00:04:57.869
put things together and understanding
 

00:04:57.869 --> 00:05:00.049
put things together and understanding
the rules for those differences is

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:00.059
the rules for those differences is
 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:03.169
the rules for those differences is
important for example one of the things

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:03.179
important for example one of the things
 

00:05:03.179 --> 00:05:06.139
important for example one of the things
that neuroscientists have taught us

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:06.149
that neuroscientists have taught us
 

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:10.339
that neuroscientists have taught us
recently is that the parts of the brain

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349
recently is that the parts of the brain
 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:14.600
recently is that the parts of the brain
are also richly interconnected and the

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610
are also richly interconnected and the
 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.329
are also richly interconnected and the
extent to which they are connected has a

00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:17.339
extent to which they are connected has a
 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:20.149
extent to which they are connected has a
great deal to do with function so we're

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:20.159
great deal to do with function so we're
 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:23.389
great deal to do with function so we're
talking about say a patch of cortex over

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:23.399
talking about say a patch of cortex over
 

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:25.759

there are like cables joining them
 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.059
there are like cables joining them
together Andy and how well those

to give it a great deal to our

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:37.769
to give it a great deal to our
 

00:05:37.769 --> 00:05:40.399
to give it a great deal to our
individual differences is it that some

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:40.409
individual differences is it that some
 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:42.139
individual differences is it that some
people have more connections than others

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:42.149
people have more connections than others
 

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:45.439
people have more connections than others
or bigger connections or what's what

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449
or bigger connections or what's what
 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:46.579
or bigger connections or what's what
what are those underlying differences

what are those underlying differences
 

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:49.519
what are those underlying differences
well it's all of the above with some

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:49.529
well it's all of the above with some
 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:52.549
well it's all of the above with some
cases the connections are actually more

00:05:52.549 --> 00:05:52.559
cases the connections are actually more
 

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:54.619
cases the connections are actually more
richly innervated they're more simply

00:05:54.619 --> 00:05:54.629
richly innervated they're more simply
 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:57.230
richly innervated they're more simply
more fun in other cases they go to

that really is the $64,000 question and
 

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:13.749
that really is the $64,000 question and
it is the question we would like to

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:13.759
it is the question we would like to
 

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:17.230
it is the question we would like to
answer how does the brain do it and how

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240
answer how does the brain do it and how
 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.850
answer how does the brain do it and how
do we help the brain do it better I

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860
do we help the brain do it better I
 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.480

think that your question really raises

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:22.490
think that your question really raises

think that your question really raises
another really important point and that

00:07:25.059 --> 00:07:25.069
another really important point and that
 

00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:28.240
another really important point and that
is how much bigger our questions are

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:28.250
is how much bigger our questions are
 

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.899
is how much bigger our questions are
than our science our methodology we need

faster and answer them better and we
 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:49.980
faster and answer them better and we
need to apply them to our lives
