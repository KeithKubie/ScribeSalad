&gt;&gt; UMA (ph): Hi. My name is Uma (ph). I’m
an engineer on the Android Project. I worked

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:06.790
on the Application Framework and some of the
Applications. And today, I want to show you

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.290
two of my favorite features on Android. My
first favorite feature that I want to show

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.580
you is the ability to quickly research through
my list of installed Application. For instance,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.080
if I want launch the Android market, I can
simply type “Market.” And then, I really

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.560
like to customize my home screen by installing
new shortcuts. For instance, a shortcut to

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.460
my music.
