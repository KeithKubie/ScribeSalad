00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450
of the world I think that's happened to
 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.170
of the world I think that's happened to
a certain extent but I think we'll see

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180
a certain extent but I think we'll see
 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.029
a certain extent but I think we'll see
that investment in the Chinese domestic

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039
that investment in the Chinese domestic
 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.870
that investment in the Chinese domestic
economy has become so great that it's

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880
economy has become so great that it's
 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.029
economy has become so great that it's
putting in a lot of important around the

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039
putting in a lot of important around the
 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.689
putting in a lot of important around the
danger the asia-pacific region and I

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699
danger the asia-pacific region and I
 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.939
danger the asia-pacific region and I
think it's a stimulated the economy in

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949
think it's a stimulated the economy in
 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.979
think it's a stimulated the economy in
this particular region and it's also

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989
this particular region and it's also
 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.630
this particular region and it's also

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640
dragging an impossible around the world
 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.299
dragging an impossible around the world
so I think the first steps will be an

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309
so I think the first steps will be an
 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.700
so I think the first steps will be an
asia-pacific recovery and then the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710
asia-pacific recovery and then the
 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.290
asia-pacific recovery and then the
recovery will spread to the rest of the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300
recovery will spread to the rest of the
 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.900
recovery will spread to the rest of the
world

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910
