MIHAI IONESCU: Hey, guys.

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.380
Welcome to another session
of Payments on

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.060
Google Developers Live.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.540
Today we're going do a
Hangout-style session on the

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.410
East Coast.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.650
I have my colleague Peng.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.270
Hi, Peng.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.790
PENG YING: What's
up, everybody?

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.790
MIHAI IONESCU: All right.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.450
So a quick check there that you
guys can see both of us.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.550
And over the past few sessions,
we got a lot of

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.770
questions I didn't have
time to answer.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.490
We also looked on the forums
on Stack Overflow.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.130
We looked on the Moderator that
we just posted a few days

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.130
ago, gathered some questions.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.910
And we tried to answer those
as good as we can.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.300
Of course, looking for
suggestions and feedback of

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.880
what you want to hear
on future sessions.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.950
So before we get started, I
have a quick announcement.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.300
We recently announced a series
of DevFest developer events

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.740
based on Google products.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.830
And there is a very interesting
one coming up.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.720
I'm going to share my screen
here to show you the website.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.796
So it's called DevFest
West, and it will--

00:01:13.796 --> 00:01:14.800
you guys can see?

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.470
OK, you can see the site.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.310
It will happen October 20 to 21
at Google headquarters in

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.020
Mountain View, California.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.930
So if you're in the
San Francisco Bay

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.450
Area, please attend.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.880
It's going to be
fun, two days.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.470
There are going to be parties
there are going to be code

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.200
labs, a very interesting
session.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.320
Of course, we're going to
talk about payments.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.840
So if you have time, make
sure you don't miss it.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.896
It's on a weekend, so mark
it on your calendars.

00:01:43.896 --> 00:01:49.910
Now, with that out of the way,
let's go over some questions.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:50.720
So let me look at--

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.026
PENG YING: I have a
question first.

00:01:54.026 --> 00:01:56.485
I'm on our page, and then
I'm trying to see if

00:01:56.485 --> 00:01:57.860
the video is live.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.740
Can everybody see our live
stream right now?

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.810
MIHAI IONESCU: I think so.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.490
PENG YING: OK.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.030
Just making sure.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.160
Because it looks like on our
Google Developers Live page,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.840
the live stream isn't the
right live stream.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.300
MIHAI IONESCU: It probably has
a small delay there, but I

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.290
think we're fine.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.750
PENG YING: OK.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.180
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah, I
think if you refresh,

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.360
then you'll see it.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.800
And that's actually
a very good point.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.300
Probably.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.240
if some people joined earlier,
they would need to

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.590
refresh now to see us.

00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:33.940
Good.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.040
Let's start with a question.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.270
So we launched subscription
about a month ago, and a lot

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.730
of people have been trying it,
quite a few launches, and, of

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.090
course, there are lots
of questions.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.330
It's a new product.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.210
And we still have
some work to do.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.500
So I'll start with
a question here.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.780
"If a recurring subscription
transaction failed, for

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.730
example, because the credit
card expired, would the

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.100
substitution be canceled
immediately?

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.050
Or will the customer to be able
to update the payment

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.680
method?" So that's a
very common case.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.330
You have a long-term
subscription.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.410
You bill your customer
monthly.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.000
And let's say he or she signed
up for a couple of years.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.960
But as is the case, a lot of
credit cards expire monthly--

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.230
sorry, yearly, or
every two years.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.770
So if that happens and the
credit card has expired

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.980
mid-subscription period, then,
of course, the subscription,

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.600
the recurring subscription
transaction, will fail.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.680
So when that happens, the
customer will receive a

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.470
notification, an email.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.290
And we will give instructions
on how to

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.030
update the credit card.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.730
There will be a link and
step-by-step instructions to

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.330
update the credit card link
for that specific

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.500
subscription.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.480
The customer will have three
days to update the credit card

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.430
and retry the substitution.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.600
If there are other specific
cases besides the credit card

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.270
expiration, he or she will also
have the option to go and

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.690
immediately retry the
subscription or contact their

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.460
credit card company to see
what's going wrong.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.000
So from your point of view as a
merchant, you don't have to

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.769
worry about that.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.540
If a subscription fails, then
the customer will be notified,

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.600
and they will have the
option to update

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.380
their credit card online.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.360
If you see other cases where
that is not happening, please

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.950
let us on the forum on Stack
Overflow or on our biweekly

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.460
Office Hours.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.350
One more question.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.080
Peng, do you want to
take that one?

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.460
PENG YING: Yep.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.615
So the question I have "is it
possible to create a Google

00:04:52.615 --> 00:04:57.110
Wallet account without actually
being in the USA or

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.470
adding my credit
or debit cards?

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.030
I'm writing a web application in
which I want to support the

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.720
Add-to-Google Wallet option.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.430
Is it possible?"

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.650
So I think I need a little bit
more context here, because we

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.450
have multiple purchase
methods.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.090
We have multiple options.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:21.070
And then I'm not quite sure if
they're looking to sign up as

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.240
a buyer or sign up
as a merchant.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.730
So I'm going to try to cover
pretty much everything.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.150
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah, let's talk
about both cases and give

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.960
a quick overview of the sign-up
process in both

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.065
situations.

00:05:34.065 --> 00:05:34.420
PENG YING: Yep.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:41.980
So as a buyer, Google Wallet
supports over 140 countries

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.680
and almost all of the
payment flows.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.450
So in payment flows like
Androids or Google Play,

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.600
Checkouts, Google Wallet for
Digital Goods, all of these

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.960
different payment flows support
buyers from over 140

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.860
different countries.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.320
Now, in order to be able
to complete the

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.320
purchase, we only support--

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.780
well, it depends on
the purchase flow.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.720
So, for example, if you're
purchasing on Android, you

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.320
will have credit cards, debit
cards, and carrier billing.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.250
In Checkouts, we only support
credit cards and debit cards,

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:30.310
and the same is for Google
Wallet for digital goods.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.640
On the merchant side, it's
a little bit different.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.940
So for merchants, you can sign
up for merchant accounts for

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.260
Checkout in two countries--

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.460
US and UK.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.320
You can sign up for merchant
accounts for Google Wallet for

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.410
Digital Goods in 18 countries.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:47.610
And there's an FAQ
with the list of

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.060
countries that we support.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.540
And then for Android, you can
sign up for a merchant account

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.580
in 31 different countries.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.390
And we're always looking to
continually expand the number

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.200
of countries that each of these
payment methods support.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.490
But you know, it takes a little
bit more time for each

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.960
of these as well.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.290
In terms of signing up without
a credit or debit card, you

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.810
can supply your federal tax
ID in most of these cases.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.110
So you don't need to enter in
your credit card or debit

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.680
cards as part of your
identification.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.320
So I hope that answers
your question.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.070
And if it doesn't, then please
follow up on the forums, and

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.860
then we'll have--

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.110
I mean, we always check
the forums.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.530
So somebody will be there and
see if we can provide a better

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.140
answer to your question.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.470
MIHAI IONESCU: Cool.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.440
Thanks, Peng.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.860
So we're always looking to
improve the sign-up process.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.790
It is cumbersome, but we have
to follow all kinds of

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.620
financial regulations.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.830
And based on your feedback and
usability studies, we're

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:48.820
trying to make that process
as simple as possible.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.470
So the next question, I'll
take the next one.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:56.790
It's also related to payments,
and probably this is a new

00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:00.190
merchant trying the
subscriptions API.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.860
And the question is "the Digital
Goods API sometimes

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.480
uses a pop-up window to ask
the user for information.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.350
Is it possible to disable
the pop-up?"

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.830
So sometimes that can
create problems,

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.690
especially on mobile devices.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:19.810
And the reason we are requiring
a pop-up is to

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:24.740
securely log in the user or
transmit information, private

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.880
information, such as credit
card payments.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.400
So there is a very good
reason for the pop-up.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:37.269
On the other hand, we agree
that it is not a very nice

00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:40.330
user interface issue.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.950
So we're looking at ways to
remove that and make it

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:49.220
simpler and seamless for users
of the Digital Goods API to

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.650
either sign in or complete
a transaction.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.930
Note that that happens only the
first time the user logs

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.310
in or the first time they
enter the credit card

00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:59.030
information.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:02.100
If they already have a Google
Checkout account and they

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.360
already have payment
methods set up, you

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.290
will not see the pop-up.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:11.010
Or you will see it very rarely
if the user did not login to

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.570
the account for weeks.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:13.440
So stay tuned.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.330
We're looking for ways to
improve that and make it a

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:18.580
better user experience.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.560
PENG YING: All right.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.010
I'll take the next question.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:28.610
And it is "what is the current
criteria for getting started

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:29.960
as a merchant?

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:35.680
Or do you have any time frame
for general availability?" And

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.740
I think this one needs
a little bit

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.510
more context as well.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.430
So I guess I'll talk
about the different

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.040
purchase flows for merchants.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.740
There's Checkouts.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.065
There's Google Wallet
for Digital Goods.

00:09:45.065 --> 00:09:48.130
There is, I guess,
Google Play.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:52.720
And then there is Google Wallet
for Online Commerce.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.100
I'm guessing that this one is
specifically geared towards

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.140
Google Wallet for Online
Commerce, because the other

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.610
ones are open sign-up
right now.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.890
But let's walk through
each of them anyway.

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:08.240
So for Checkouts, you
just need to be a--

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.415
it's open sign-up.

00:10:09.415 --> 00:10:11.900
You need to be a US or UK
merchant, because those are

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.960
the only two countries that
we support for Checkout.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.725
And then you need to sign up
with either a credit card or

00:10:18.725 --> 00:10:20.740
your federal tax ID.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:25.560
For Google Play, I believe that
you need to sign up to be

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.310
a developer of Google Play.

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:30.630
And I think the requirements are
the same, but we support

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.960
additional countries.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.980
For Google Wallet for
Digital Goods,

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.780
we support 18 countries.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.420
And I think it's the
same information

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.050
for sign-up as well.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.630
And then for the last one,
Google Wallet for Online

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:50.651
Commerce, right now we're
accepting applicants.

00:10:50.651 --> 00:10:52.870
I don't know if we have
specific criteria.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:55.080
I think we're just
looking for--

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.510
because we've kind of soft
launched, we haven't fully

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.380
launched yet, that we're
just looking for great

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.300
partners work with.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.660
MIHAI IONESCU: Do we have
a website or a way for

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.810
interested merchants
to sign up?

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:08.600
PENG YING: Yeah, there should
be a sign-up on the Google

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.770
Wallet for Online Commerce
developers page.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:15.110
I think there's a link
in the Nav somewhere.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:18.230
MIHAI IONESCU: OK, so just
express your interest, and

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.910
then we'll follow up with
additional information on how

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.020
to sign up.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.000
PENG YING: Yep.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.840
MIHAI IONESCU: Yep, right?

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.190
Looks like there's interest on
an API that's just launched.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:28.440
That's always good news.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.530
All right, I'll take
the next one.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:35.300
I'm getting the easy
questions, Peng.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.582
You've got the more
complicated ones.

00:11:38.582 --> 00:11:40.350
PENG YING: I feel like I'm
doing a lot of talking.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:45.750
MIHAI IONESCU: It's also about
subscriptions, and someone

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:49.080
who's trying different
variations on subscriptions.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.180
The question is "when
a customer cancels a

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.480
subscription, a digital
subscription before the

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:59.650
expiration date, will prorated
refunds be issued?"

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:04.680
So the policy that we have right
now is when a customer

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:09.780
cancels a subscription
mid-period before the end of

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:14.430
the next subscription period,
then there will be no refunds.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.720
The entire subscription will run
out until the end of the

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.690
next period, after which
it will be canceled.

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:29.900
However, as a merchant, you can
show goodwill or decide to

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.060
offer the customer
other options.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:37.420
In this case, you can decide
to do a prorated refund.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.590
You can do that from the
merchant center, where you go

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.720
and refund a specific amount.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.830
You can refund for the
entire period.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.930
It's all entirely up to you.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:51.810
So you have a choice in this
case, or you can let the

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.290
subscription run out.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:13:00.570
As a quick point for
non-technical related

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:04.040
questions regarding
subscriptions, I would

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:08.180
recommend to go look
at the Help Center.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:12.150
It's a little hard to find, but
if I can share the screen

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:20.700
here, I can show you where it is
on our documentation page.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:25.230
So let me go back to
the page here.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:33.810
And if we go on our Digital
Goods API page, if you look on

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:39.930
the side navigation bar on the
Resources Help Center, if you

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:45.770
click on Help Center, it will
take you to a merchant

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.920
end-user help center.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.960
And most likely, you will
find the answers to

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.210
such questions there.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.054
Cool Want to take the
next question?

00:14:03.054 --> 00:14:05.280
PENG YING: Yep.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.770
I think we've covered this one
before, but we're just going

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:09.030
to go over it again.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:13.100
"Why is Google Wallet not
available on Verizon Galaxy

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:13.660
Nexus?"

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:13.870
MIHAI IONESCU: Oh, yeah.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.830
We answer that every session.

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:16.420
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.320
It's a Nexus device.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.270
So I mean, I can't really get
into the details about why.

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:25.570
But I just wanted everybody to
know that we are in talks with

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:26.500
the carriers.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.320
And I mean, it's the powers that
we're working with, the

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.340
powers that be, right?

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.970
You know, we want to make Wallet
available everywhere.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.150
So we're still trying to push
for it, and then we'll see

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:38.400
where it goes.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.510
MIHAI IONESCU: That's the answer
we've been giving you

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.070
guys for the past few months.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:48.060
But we always have new
announcements.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.720
And things happen
really quickly.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.670
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.640
One of these days, we're
going to be like, boom.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.440
Yeah.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.270
MIHAI IONESCU: We don't
know what else to say.

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:58.870
Pretty soon.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:59.790
All right.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:02.450
Another hard question for you,
another easy one for me.

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:03.960
So let me go--

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:04.330
OK.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.420
So I'm getting all the digital
payments and subscription

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.340
questions today.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:13.640
And this one is about the--

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.950
"are there plans--" it's
about programmatic API?

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:19.750
So the question is "are there
plans to allow merchants to

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.720
cancel and refund
subscriptions

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.180
programmatically?" So that is
a very good question, and

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.890
obviously, it's a
very useful API.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:32.500
If you're a high-volume
merchant, you have a high

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:37.130
download subscriptions, you do
not have time to do refunds or

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:38.430
cancellations manually.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:42.770
So that's where a programmatic
API will come in very handy

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:45.430
and allow you to automate
the entire process.

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:49.460
And the good news is that we
have that in the works, and it

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:52.790
will be available very soon
for beta testing.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:56.750
We're asking you guys for
additional feedback and what

00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:02.400
other APIs you think will be
useful, so stay tuned.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.600
We'll announce something
very soon.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.810
PENG YING: Cool.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:08.290
I'll get the next question.

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:10.570
"I'm testing Checkout
in the sandbox.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:13.990
The merchant's account currency
is in US dollars, but

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:15.730
I want to place an
order in euros.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:19.510
How can I change the account
currency to euros?"

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:25.070
Well, for Checkout,
it's an older API.

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.370
Right now, it's still restricted
to US and UK

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:28.620
merchants only.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.920
You can only bill in the
currency of your account.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.250
So if your account is a US
account, you can only bill in

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:37.390
US dollars.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:40.810
If your account is a UK account,
you can bill in

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:42.060
British pounds.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.525
So that's kind of restrictive.

00:16:46.525 --> 00:16:49.960
However, we have a separate API
called Google Wallet for

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.460
Digital Goods.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.960
The main purpose of it, as the
API name states, is to sell or

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.780
enable the purchase
of digital goods.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:02.140
And with this API, what you're
actually able to do is you can

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:08.770
specify any of something like 20
currencies or 29 currencies

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:13.250
and then have us automatically
convert the charge amounts--

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.250
the native currency
charge amount--

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.560
to the currency of
your account.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.569
So it really depends on what
you're looking for.

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:22.569
If you're looking to sell
physical goods, unfortunately,

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:25.599
you won't be able to do this
right now with Checkout.

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:27.880
But if you're selling digital
goods, we have a solution for

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.490
you called Google Wallet
for Digital Goods.

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:33.910
MIHAI IONESCU: And in this
particular situation, where

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:37.790
the user is looking to sell in
the euros, we are supporting

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:40.190
most of the countries
in the eurozone.

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:43.550
So out of the 18 countries
supported for Google for

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:46.790
Digital Goods, a lot of them
are using the euros.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:52.784
So you can have euro count in
euros and go ahead and sell.

00:17:52.784 --> 00:17:53.700
PENG YING: Yep.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.100
MIHAI IONESCU: OK.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:56.200
My turn.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:56.640
All right.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.360
I have another easy one.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.890
So someone has been asking--

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:04.840
has been posting this question
on the Google+ stream.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.620
And the question is "how can I
join the Wallet team?" And

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.440
that is a fantastic question.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.500
And we are hiring on
multiple levels.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.120
It's not clear if this developer
wants to join the

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.850
Developer Relations team, or the
Wallet engineering team.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:23.940
But we're hiring in both of
them, and I can share my

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.537
screen again and show you
where you can go look.

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:38.060
So the easiest place to
start is if you go to

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:42.050
developers.google.com/jobs,
where all the Developer

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.750
Relations jobs are listed,
starting with developer

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:47.460
advocates, developer programs
engineer, program manager,

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.910
technical writers.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:52.290
Browse through those
and follow the

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:55.980
links for more details.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:59.760
The interview process is similar
for most positions.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:05.740
And after you will receive an
offer, then you can decide

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.460
which area you're more
interested in.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.444
PENG YING: Come join our team.

00:19:09.444 --> 00:19:10.440
Come join our team.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:10.730
It's great.

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:11.180
MIHAI IONESCU: Yes.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.430
Come join our team, exactly.

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:13.680
The Wallet team is hiring.

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:21.520
So, yeah, Go check out either
developers.google.com/jobs, or

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.640
google.com/jobs.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:27.120
Lots of very good information
on both sides.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:27.850
PENG YING: Yep.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:31.710
All right, and then I have
another question.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:35.520
"When will the Google Wallet
for Online Commerce APIs be

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:40.520
available internationally?" Now,
that's a tough question,

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.690
because right now, we've only
kind of soft launched.

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:47.190
So even in the US, we're trying
to launch in the US

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:50.990
first, grow the merchant user
base here, and then launch

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:53.510
internationally, of course,
after that.

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:57.030
Right now, what we're
doing is we--

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.280
like with our other pay methods,
we're only supporting

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.090
credit cards and debit cards.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:04.450
And as a lot of you know, most
countries in the world, or

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:07.230
only like a few countries in the
world, actually use credit

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:08.870
cards and debit cards
very heavily.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:13.080
It would be the US, the UK,
maybe France, probably

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.570
Australia and Canada, right?

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:18.550
So I mean, we definitely want
to expand internationally.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:22.640
But I can't really get into a
time scope or time frame.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.940
MIHAI IONESCU: Things are
moving fast, guys.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.950
So don't lose patience.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:32.910
It'll happen.

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:33.730
All right.

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:37.340
We are at the end
of our session.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.740
It looks like we don't have
any more questions.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:45.370
Just a quick reminder that we
want you guys to attend our

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:46.573
DevFest West.

00:20:46.573 --> 00:20:53.900
I'm going to put again
the website on.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.360
So this, register
if you have not.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:02.110
There will be code labs,
parties, and, of course, all

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:04.050
kinds of interesting sessions,
including a

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:07.250
session on Wallet APIs.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:07.790
So are we done?

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:08.760
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.110
MIHAI IONESCU: Thank
you for attending.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:13.860
We're looking forward to seeing
you guys again in a

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.085
couple of weeks.

00:21:15.085 --> 00:21:17.060
And let us know how
we're doing.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:22.310
Let us know what topics you want
to hear on the forum or

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:25.640
on the Google+ stream.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.890
PENG YING: And remember
to apply.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.415
Yeah, remember to apply
to join our team.

00:21:32.415 --> 00:21:33.150
MIHAI IONESCU: Oh, yes.

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:36.650
And whoever is interested in
jobs with the Wallet team,

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:38.162
please apply.

00:21:38.162 --> 00:21:40.620
All right, thanks, Peng.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:41.740
Thanks, everyone,
for attending.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:42.820
PENG YING: Always a pleasure.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.750
MIHAI IONESCU: We'll see
you back in two weeks.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:45.550
Bye-bye.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:46.800
PENG YING: See you, guys.
