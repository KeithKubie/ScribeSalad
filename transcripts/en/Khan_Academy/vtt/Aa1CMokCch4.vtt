00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.120
Let's think a little bit
about some of the

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.820
properties of alcohol.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.260
So the general formula for an
alcohol we saw is some type of

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.050
group or chain of carbons bonded
to an oxygen, bonded to

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.210
a hydrogen.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.980
And of course, the oxygen
will have two lone

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.220
pairs just like that.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.060
Let's compare this to water.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.680
So water just looks like this.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.260
You have a hydrogen bonded to
an oxygen, bonded to another

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.190
hydrogen with two lone pairs.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.960
Now in the case of water,
the oxygen is much more

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.090
electronegative than the
hydrogen, so it hogs the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.350
electrons towards it.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.620
So you have a partial negative
charge at the oxygen end.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.060
Then you have partial positive
charges at the hydrogen ends.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.600
That's what allows oxygen to
kind of-- or sorry-- that's

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.680
what allows water to bond to
itself or to have not a

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.910
ridiculously low
boiling point.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.580
So let me show this.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.980
Let me copy and paste this.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.680
We've seen all this before
in regular chemistry.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.099
So copy and paste.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.180
So let me draw some more
water molecules here.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.740
Let me draw another water
molecule here.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.320
So you see water because the
oxygen end has a partial

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.570
negative charge and the hydrogen
ends have partial

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.210
positive charges, the oxygen of
one water molecule will be

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.710
attracted to the hydrogen of
another water molecule.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.390
And we've seen this before.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.580
This we call hydrogen bonding.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.905
So that right there is
hydrogen bonding.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.940
The exact same thing can happen
with alcohols, although

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.290
alcohols really only have
the partial positive

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.120
charge on the hydrogen.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.060
We don't know exactly what's
going on here.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.500
We probably have carbons
bonded to the oxygen.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.200
And with the carbons, they're
reasonably electronegative.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.580
They're not going to have their
electrons hogged as much

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.130
as a hydrogen would.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.620
So in the case of an alcohol--
let me draw.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.250
Instead of having this R for
radical there, let me make it

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.290
a little bit more concrete.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.140
Let me draw an actual alcohol.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.580
So an actual alcohol.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.400
Maybe we have methanol.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.620
Maybe we have methanol that
would look like that.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.060
It has a hydrogen
right over here.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.630
Oxygen is much more
electronegative than the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.490
hydrogen, so you have a partial
negative charge there.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.680
And then you have a partial
positive charge there.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.220
So it too, because of these
hydrogen bonds, it will have a

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.500
reasonable boiling point.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.850
It won't just turn immediately
into the gaseous state.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.576
It would actually try to
bond to each other.

00:02:33.576 --> 00:02:36.750
Let me copy and paste that.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.680
So it can also form the
hydrogen bonds.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.030
Although they won't to be quite
as strong as what you

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.660
see in water.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.770
And that's why something like
methanol actually has a lower

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:47.950
boiling point than water.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.390
It's easy to make it boil.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.470
It's easier to make these bonds
break apart because you

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.980
don't have as much of the
hydrogen bonding.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.320
So this is an example
of hydrogen

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.360
bonding with methanol.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.575
Now because methanol can have
hydrogen bonding and it has

00:03:03.575 --> 00:03:06.920
this slight polarity to it and
water obviously has hydrogen

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.390
bonding, methanol is actually
miscible in water.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.430
And all that means is that it's
soluble in water in any

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.020
proportion.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.380
No matter how much methanol
or how much water

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.900
you have, it is soluble.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.690
So if I were to draw some
methanol molecules-- actually,

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.110
maybe this is the water
right here.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.380
So if you draw a methanol
molecule right there, that

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.580
would have a hydrogen bond
right over there.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.690
If I were to draw another
methanol molecule maybe right

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.590
over here, you would have
another hydrogen bond right

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.250
over there.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.470
And that's what allows
methanol to

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.730
be soluble in water.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.930
Now, as this chain grows, or
if you have alcohols with

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.140
longer radical chains, then
they become less and less

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.060
soluble in water.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.980
But their boiling points
actually do go up.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.640
And let's think about
why that is.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.760
So if I have something like--
let me do butanol.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.430
So butanol's going to
have 4 carbons.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:10.100
So it's going to be H3C, H3--
let me just draw it like H3C,

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:17.260
CH2, Ch2, CH-- let me
do it like this.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.579
H2C.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.440
Then that carbon, that last
carbon right there is going to

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.630
be bonded to the oxygen.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.680
It's going to be bonded
to an oxygen, which

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.890
is bonded to a hydrogen.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.530
Now, when you have a situation
like this, the oxygen will

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.990
have a partial negative
charge.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.080
The hydrogen will still have
a partial positive charge.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.180
Just like we saw up
here with both the

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.050
water and the methanol.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.670
But now you have this big thing

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.260
here that has no polarity.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.660
So this part of the alcohol is
not going to be soluble in

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.640
water, and it's going to make it
harder for this part to be

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.090
soluble over here.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.130
So this right here
is less soluble.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.210
This is less soluble.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.730
It'd still be a little
bit soluble.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.190
So if you have some oxygen here,
you will still have a

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.890
little bit of the hydrogen
bonding.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.740
You still will have a little
bit of the hydrogen

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:06.360
bonding going on.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.250
But this part is kind of-- you
can imagine it's almost-- it

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.370
doesn't want to dissolve
with the water.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.620
It is non-polar.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.110
You could actually, for
example, butanol in

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.700
particular, it actually
is soluble in water.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.280
But not in any proportion.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.800
So methanol is miscible.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.390
Let me write this.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.210
This is a new word.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.530
I don't think I've ever used
it before in the context of

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.650
the organic chemistry videos.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.660
So methanol is-- let me write
that in a brighter color since

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.360
it's a new word.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:40.270
Methanol is miscible, which
just means soluble in any

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.520
proportion.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.240
So I don't care what percent
is methanol,

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.140
what percent is water.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.950
The methanol will dissolve
into the water in any

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.100
proportion.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.380
If you look at butanol, it
is soluble but not in any

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.910
proportion.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.900
If you had a ton of butanol,
some of it would not dissolve

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:05.660
in the water.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.750
So this is soluble.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.150
So the butanol right here
is soluble, but

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:18.430
not miscible in water.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.940
If you have too much of the
butanol, all of a sudden, some

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.930
of it will not actually be
able to be dissolved.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.460
If this was a decanol or
something with a really long

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.150
carbon chain, then of
course, it's going

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.290
to be very non soluble.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.030
You might be able to get a
couple of molecules in the

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.600
water, but most of them
will not dissolve.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.940
Now the other reason-- I
hinted-- look, you know the

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.260
reason why the alcohols have a
reasonable-- not too low of a

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.580
boiling point is that
they're able to do

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.930
this hydrogen bonding.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:45.840
But you would say well, look.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.970
You know, these longer carbon
chains, these are going to

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.140
have less of the hydrogen
bonding going on.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.230
Maybe these would have
lower boiling points.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.680
But actually, the longer the
chain gets, these actually

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.210
have higher boiling points.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.830
And that's because
these chains can

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.780
interact with each other.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:05.930
So the longer the chain, so
longer R or the longer R

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.800
chain, I guess, I could say,
we could say the higher the

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.620
boiling point in an alcohol.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.420
Higher boiling point.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.280
It's harder.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.840
You have to put more heat into
the system or the temperature

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.860
has to be higher for the
things to break apart.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.000
And that's because this is one
decanol molecule here, another

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.100
decanol molecule might
look like this.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.950
Maybe it might look like this.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.460
You have an oxygen and a
hydrogen and then you have

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.420
your carbons.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:38.990
So you have your CH,
your CH2, CH2, H3C.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.290
So you have this other
butanol here.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:44.090
And what the interaction between
these two chains are--

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.090
these are the van
der Waal forces.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.950
So even though they have
no [INAUDIBLE],

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.380
so these guys are going to have
some polar interactions.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:51.650
They're going to have the
hydrogen bonding.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:53.610
We've seen that multiple
times already.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:57.250
But these long chains, they're
going to have the London

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.020
dispersion forces, which are a
subset of van der Waal forces.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.840
Where even though they're
neutral, every now and then,

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.790
one of these might become
slightly negative on one side.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:09.410
So you might have
a very temporary

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.670
partial negative charge.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.370
And that's just because
of the randomness of

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:14.720
how electrons move.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.110
On this side of the molecule,
all of a sudden, you might

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.630
have more electrons
over there.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.460
So you have a partial
negative charge.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.220
And because of that, you're
going to have-- the electrons

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.395
over here, they're not going
to want to be there.

00:08:26.395 --> 00:08:28.210
So you're going to want to have
a partial positive charge

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.570
there and you're going to have
a very temporary interaction.

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:31.910
That's a very weak force.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.880
Much weaker than
hydrogen bonds.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.720
But as these chains get longer
and longer, as they possibly

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.840
even get intertwined with each
other and get close to each

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.230
other, these London dispersion
forces or van der Waal forces

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.220
are going to keep propagating.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.970
So all of a sudden, maybe these
guys are going to be

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.900
attracted to each other and
that's going to disappear.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.790
Than these guys are going be
attracted to each other and

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.000
then that's going
to disappear.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.800
And then these are going to be
attracted to each other and

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.000
then that's going
to disappear.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.940
And so you can imagine, the
longer the chain, the more of

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.290
these type of interactions
you're going to have. The more

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:58.970
attracted they're going
to be to each other.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:01.720
And it's going to be harder to
break them apart, higher

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:02.680
boiling point.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.810
So those are just kind of the
two big takeaways on the

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.350
properties of alcohols.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.170
Especially smaller chained
alcohols are soluble in water.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:13.610
The very small ones are
completely miscible.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.026
And the longer the chain you
have, the harder it is to

00:09:16.026 --> 00:09:16.870
dissolve in water.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.130
But also, the higher
the boiling point.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.940
The harder it is to break them
apart because you have these

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.180
London dispersion forces.
