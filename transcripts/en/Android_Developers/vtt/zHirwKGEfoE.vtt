ROMAN NURIK: Hello,
and welcome to

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.960
Android Design in Action.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.350
My name is Roman Nurik, With
me here today is--

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.780
ADAM KOCH: Hi guys, Adam Koch.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.740
And over in London--

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.680
NICK BUTCHER: Hi,
Nick Butcher.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.870
ROMAN NURIK: So today, unlike
most days on the show--

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.190
most Tuesdays on the show--
we're not actually going to be

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.840
talking about redesigns.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.930
So for those of you who have
never seen this show, we

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.990
usually take a look at apps
that have been nominated--

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.540
usually the developer nominates
themselves--

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.560
and take a look at how we can
reimagine some of the screens

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.950
in those apps to fit better with
Android styling, and just

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.620
be a better experience
for users overall.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.150
And then we take that, and we
pass it off to developers and

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.350
see if they like it.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.560
And if they do, then sometimes
they make the changes.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.520
And sometimes, they don't.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.280
And for those of you who have
been watching, basically,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.900
developers can come back on
Thursday and let us know what

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.460
they think of the show.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.320
And that's the Developer Strikes
Back, where developers

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.330
strike back show.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.870
This week, however, we're
not doing any of that.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.660
Because of the massive technical
failures that

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.870
plagued the guys in Mountain
View for the Friday app

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.670
clinic, we decided to take a
slightly different approach to

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.030
this episode today.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.080
So today, we're going
to be talking

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.610
about responsive design.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.260
So let's jump into what
responsive design is.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.860
Now, for several people, this
is the first time they're

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.710
hearing of the concept
of responsive design.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.150
And Ethan Marcotte--

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.500
and sorry, Ethan, if I'm
mispronouncing your name--

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.610
Ethan Marcotte coined the term
a few years ago in an article

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.030
that talked about responsive
web design.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.970
And basically, you can see from
the quote here-- this is

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.260
from the article--

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.500
it's really about taking a
website and making sure that

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.110
it scales across any medium, be
it phone, tablet, browser,

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.340
different screen sizes,
and pretty much any

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.580
other device type.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.930
So taking a single layout or a
single piece of content and

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.680
making sure that it scales
according to its medium.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.870
So that's responsive
web design in

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.580
a super small nutshell.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.520
So responsive web design
applies to

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.970
mobile apps, as well.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.680
And so today, we're going to
be talking about responsive

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.130
design and how it applies
to Android devices.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.590
Before we jump in, Adam,
Nick, any comments?

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.672
Any thoughts?

00:02:26.672 --> 00:02:29.720
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, as you were
saying, we're focusing on

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.110
responsive design, because this
week, we're having a big

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.000
focus on tablets.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.250
We've just launched some quality
guidelines on how to

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.300
make a high-quality tablet
application.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.830
And, for me, having an
application which scales well

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.910
on the huge variety of devices,
that is the Android

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.400
landscape, is a big, big
part of that quality.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.470
So I think this is a really
important topic.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.320
ADAM KOCH: And one quick thing
I wanted to mention was I

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.960
really believe if you kind of
think about these responsive

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.830
web design or responsive Android
development from the

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.740
beginning of your development
cycle when building Android

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.950
apps, it can help you get that
tablet app or create designs

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.610
that just really make it easier
to suit all different

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.590
screens out there.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.410
So rather than just designing
from the ground up, if you

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.300
just think about all these
things from the beginning, it

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.376
really helps.

00:03:19.376 --> 00:03:22.040
ROMAN NURIK: And before we jump
in again, just to talk a

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.760
little bit about the format,
we're not really going to be

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.340
talking about development
best practices.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.290
We do have several training
sessions on

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.330
developer.android.com
on how to actually

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.170
implement these concepts.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.150
But what we will do is we will
look into existing apps that

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.620
are out there and see how they
treat or how they implement

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.270
these responsive designs, how
they kind of scale fluidly

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.080
across the different
device types.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.030
So let's jump in.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.130
First, we're going to take
a look at Calendar.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.800
So this is the built-in calendar
application that

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.050
comes with many devices, like
the Galaxy Nexus, the Nexus 7,

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.080
the Motorola Zoom.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.870
And this is an example of the
screen that lets you create a

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.550
new calendar entry.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.350
So on the phone here,
you see that--

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.850
and I'm going to go zoom
in for a second--

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.540
on the phone, you see that you
have a kind of Done, Cancel

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.740
bar at the top, which is
basically replacing the Action

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.339
bar, and the different entry
fields, like the Calendar,

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:24.330
Event Title, the Date, Time,
things like that.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.780
Pretty typical stuff.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.380
And then on the Nexus 7, you'll
see that it's switched

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.240
over into kind of a multi-column
layout where on

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.330
the left column, you have the
labels of the different text

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.410
entry fields.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.240
And on the right, you have
the fields themselves.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.310
And then on the 10-inch
tablet in landscape--

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.040
I'm going to zoom in here.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.350
Sorry about that.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.730
You'll notice that it's
basically the same screen as

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.270
the screen in portrait, except
it has wider margins.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.700
So basically, they've decided
that, let's make sure that the

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.800
content, the text fields never
go past a pretty common

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.660
number, around 45 to
75 characters.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.720
Let's make sure that you can
never see more than that all

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.790
at once so that the line lengths
aren't too long.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.630
So to fit that constraint,
let's introduce

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.350
margins along the sides.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:24.560
So that's, in a gist, in a
nutshell, what the Calendar

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.660
app's Create Event screen
looks like.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.640
Guys, any thoughts on other
things that they've done

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.538
really well here to make sure
that this is responsive?

00:05:33.538 --> 00:05:34.780
NICK BUTCHER: I'd probably
just like

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.910
to call out as well--

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.000
we talk a lot on this show about
Holo, about the visual

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.830
language of Android, the Holo
visual theme, and that it has

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.800
its own certain flat
look and feel.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.700
And I just wanted to call out
why that-- it's not an

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.650
accident that that kind
of design scheme

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.160
was chosen for Android.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.460
And I think this set of
screens here really

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.810
demonstrates how Holo helps you
to create a user interface

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.870
which scales nicely by using
typography and spacing

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.170
appropriately to give your
application structure, which

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.100
you can clearly see in
these three screens.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.480
That there isn't a lot of Chrome
subdividing boxes and

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.630
so on, text boxes and so on.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.640
It really is the content
which defines the

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.240
structure of the page.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.520
And that really, really
helps it to scale.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.280
You haven't got lots and lots
and lots of different bitmap

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.510
assets or graphical assets or
gradients all over the place,

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.500
which may look strange when
scaled up and wouldn't really

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.430
help you out in this field.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.520
So I think this is one of my
major takeaways from looking

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.760
at the Calendar application is
how Holo really, really, helps

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.290
out this app to scale across
these screen sizes.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.020
ADAM KOCH: And one quick point
for me, if you look at the

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.255
white space on the margins--

00:06:47.255 --> 00:06:49.610
let's see, if we zoom in here.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.260
So you can see on the phone,
you've got some white space on

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.060
the left and right.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.890
And then if you go up to the
Nexus 7, you'll see there's

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.760
slightly more white space.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.060
And then if you go across to the
landscape zoom, you'll see

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.380
they've actually got more white
space here that sort of

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.760
makes everything fill out the
larger screen size there.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.640
ROMAN NURIK: It's important to
know that when you're creating

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.510
or defining these margins that
you still stick to a grid.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:18.955
And as you can see in our design
guide under the Metrics

00:07:18.955 --> 00:07:22.800
and Grids section, we have this
concept of a 16-DIP grid

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.760
and a 48-DIP rhythm.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.900
So using increments of 16 DIPs,
so 32 DIP or 48 or 64,

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:36.250
that can still introduce
structure into your layouts

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:40.410
without constraining you to just
using very small margins.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:44.750
So 32 DIPs, 48 DIPs, that's
great to use for larger

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.002
devices, such as tablets.

00:07:47.002 --> 00:07:48.160
NICK BUTCHER: Yes.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.200
A naive implementation of this
kind of screen might have just

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.420
stretched the input fields all
the way across, which would

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.330
look pretty ungainly
on the 10-inch.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.050
So I think it's approaching your
screen design when you're

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:58.870
designing an app.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.900
And if you see something which
is so barren, thinking about,

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.250
hey, how is that going to look
on a much wider display, like

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.790
a 10-inch in landscape, for
example, and bearing in mind

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.490
where you might want to
start introducing

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.756
these margin points.

00:08:13.756 --> 00:08:16.080
ROMAN NURIK: So let's move
on to the next app.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.955
So this will be the first
third-party app

00:08:17.955 --> 00:08:19.440
that we look at.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.420
And this is Pattrn.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.375
Nick, you want to talk a little
bit about Pattrn?

00:08:22.375 --> 00:08:23.070
NICK BUTCHER: Sure.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:27.410
So Pattrn is a great little app
for finding wallpapers for

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:29.820
your device.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.935
It's by a UK developer called
Lucas who works for Mozilla.

00:08:33.935 --> 00:08:36.809
And I think they've done a great
job of really making the

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:39.059
content adapt.

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:41.740
Luckily for them, they have
almost a dream application for

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.860
this kind of scenario where the
content-- the patterned

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.280
wallpapers--

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.290
have no kind of concept
of aspect ratio or

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:49.820
anything like that.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.540
They actually kind of tile, so
it works really well that they

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.180
can change for different aspect
ratios, which might not

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:56.670
be the case for some apps.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:00.710
But as you can see, in the three
screens we're showing

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:04.190
here, on the phone, they're
relying on three tabs to go

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:07.150
through the three major
views of the data.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.310
But when they get beyond a
certain point and have more

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:11.600
space, they actually break that
out away from the tab

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.810
navigation into having this
sidebar, which I think works

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:16.600
really well.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.760
Rather than just stretching the
content to be overly wide,

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:24.950
it actually gives you easier
navigation, as well as

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:26.130
servicing more information.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.350
So you can see there on the
Nexus 7, for example, it

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.030
services recent searches.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:31.720
So it's kind of one tap away.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.990
Rather than having to tap into
the search field and then get

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.260
shown the recent history, it
might prompt you to click on a

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.230
recent search, which
is really great.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.970
The other thing, if you look
at the difference between,

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.350
say, the phone and the 7-inch
tablet, is they've actually

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:47.320
hinted the text size and
paddings to be slightly larger

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.270
to just feel more comfortable
at that certain size.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:51.090
And then--

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.810
ROMAN NURIK: And it looks
like-- sorry, Nick--

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:55.250
it looks like on a tablet,
they have just a slightly

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:56.245
wider margin.

00:09:56.245 --> 00:09:59.350
I don't know if it's an
increment of 16 DIPs, like we

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:01.620
talked about, but it's
definitely noticeably larger

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.136
to the left and to the right
of the patterns.

00:10:04.136 --> 00:10:05.670
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, and then
just last thing I can say,

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.910
when you step out from the 7-
to the 10-inch and have even

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.800
more space available, they break
out into this kind of

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.820
grid view where they show more
potential wallpapers

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.290
on screen at once.

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:19.350
So it's kind of reimagining
the content, the

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:20.480
representation of the content.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.220
So it's the same content but
laid out in a completely

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.416
different way to just make much
better use of the space.

00:10:26.416 --> 00:10:29.500
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, and I just
wanted to comment on one

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.990
missed opportunity.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:33.820
And this is very minor, but
if you look at the handset

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.440
version in landscape-- we don't
have a screenshot here--

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.960
but Lucas also uses a single
column for the patterns.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.200
So since he's already got
multi-column implemented, it

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.130
seems like it would be fairly
trivial to switch that over to

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:47.740
a multi-column-- like a

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.610
two-column layout in landscape.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:52.270
That might work really well.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:52.540
OK.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.725
So let's move on to the next
app, unless you guys have any

00:10:54.725 --> 00:10:55.672
more comments.

00:10:55.672 --> 00:10:58.180
ADAM KOCH: Just one question.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.720
I haven't actually used this
app that much, but what's

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.320
under the You tab for
the handset version?

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.657
[INAUDIBLE].

00:11:05.657 --> 00:11:06.571
ROMAN NURIK: Nick--

00:11:06.571 --> 00:11:08.230
I actually don't remember
myself.

00:11:11.185 --> 00:11:13.110
I think it was Favorites
and something else.

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.405
But it was a combination
of either one.

00:11:14.405 --> 00:11:17.060
ADAM KOCH: So I guess it's just
interesting to note how

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.500
they've definitely changed the
structure just a little bit on

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.560
the handset version just so they
can fit it into the three

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.330
standard tabs there and make
it still look nice.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.490
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.334
OK, let's move on.

00:11:31.334 --> 00:11:32.730
So we should do a time check.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:33.320
OK.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.270
So the next app is Pocket.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.250
And Pocket is-- actually, I
think it's called Pocket,

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.540
Formerly Read it Later.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.640
Pocket is basically a--

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.280
it's a saved list of articles.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.520
So if you're browsing an RSS
feed, and you don't want to

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.720
read it right now, you just go
off and save it to Pocket.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.340
And they have an intent that you
can share to and all those

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.120
good things.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:00.020
So this is kind of the main
screen in Pocket that lets you

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.250
see the list of your
saved articles.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:06.270
So you'll see that on the phone,
they have a simple list

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.410
with thumbnails on the right.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:11.970
Now, when you scale that up to
a 7-inch tablet, they have a

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:14.710
two-column grid, and if you turn
that over into landscape,

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.830
you'll see that there's
a three-column grid.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.570
And you'll notice that it's
completely different, but it's

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:20.730
the same content, right?

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:24.990
It's more of like a tile view
rather than a simple

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:27.510
horizontal linear layout.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.300
And then if you look at the
10-inch tablet, they've

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.200
basically graduated into more
of a quote, unquote,

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:36.370
"magazine" layout, similar to
how the Google Play client

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:39.560
application lays out the
different tiles in the

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.090
featured sections.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:44.520
So the interesting thing to me
is that they've done a lot of

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.300
work here to tweak font sizes.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:51.560
So you'll notice that the title
sizes on the 10-inch

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.130
tablet are slightly larger than
on the 7-inch tablet.

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:58.110
And then the fact that they've
basically implemented this

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:02.000
layout three times, once as a
list, another as a grid view,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.920
which is probably a simplified
version of the magazine layout

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:07.710
on the right.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.060
But they also have the magazine
layout, which we

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.950
don't have framework
support for.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:13.850
One of the things I should note
is that they may have

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:14.630
cheated a little bit.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:19.150
They may be using WebView in
HTML5 and CSS3 stuff to do the

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:22.160
layout, which is perfectly
awesome.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.800
The only issue is that there's
some minor performance

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.310
penalties--

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:27.490
well, maybe not minor, but there
are some performance

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:28.940
penalties involved.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:33.140
But overall, it looks
just wonderful.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.910
Yeah, so that's in a nutshell.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.670
The other thing I wanted to
mention is that they kept the

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:37.930
action bar the same.

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:39.640
And this is totally fine.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.040
You don't necessarily have to
switch the action bar and make

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.630
it taller, make things wider.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.640
The framework actually does
all those things for you.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.690
It'll make your icon slightly
wider, the action

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:52.940
bar slightly taller.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.150
So it'll do all those
things for you.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.580
In this case, I think that
they've probably implemented a

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.300
custom action bar, so it's
not happening there.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:02.110
But note that the action bar is
pretty much the same across

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:05.320
tablet and phone, in terms
of behavior and rough

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.856
proportions.

00:14:07.856 --> 00:14:09.540
NICK BUTCHER: One of my favorite
things that they've

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.720
done on here as well is that you
can see on the phone and

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.630
tablet, they've prioritized the
search, bringing it out

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:17.920
right at the top of the content
view so you can search

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:21.520
and filter, whereas on the
tablet, they have kind of

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.870
demoted that.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:23.500
So less important.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:27.150
I think it's under the action
overflow there, which I think

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.000
is really interesting.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.850
I think it's shown that they've
thought about how

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:32.480
someone's going to use this
application slightly

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.590
differently on a tablet, that
they have the same content

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:37.440
available, but it's a different
representation.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.980
They're kind of designing for
a different use case where

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.665
someone might have more time
and might be in more of an

00:14:43.665 --> 00:14:44.915
explorative mode.

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:49.330
ROMAN NURIK: Any
other comments?

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:50.870
OK, so let's move on to--

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.280
I believe the--

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.080
oh, no, there's TED.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.250
Talk about TED, Adam.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:57.760
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, so the TED
app-- hopefully, some of you

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.340
are familiar with the TED app
and all of the great content,

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.690
video talks that they have.

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:08.350
So I like this example just
because it's fairly simple.

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:10.800
You don't have to do anything
crazy or complicated in order

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.010
to support different form
factors and have it look nice

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:14.610
and feel nice still.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:16.460
So if you look at the three
different form factors that

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.480
were posted up here, you've got
the handset in portrait

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.560
mode, where they have the big
thumbnail at the top and then

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.270
three subtabs down at the bottom
to show the different

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:28.480
views related to that video.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.760
And then you move to Nexus 7,
which looks fairly similar.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.195
They've added some extra
white space.

00:15:35.195 --> 00:15:37.480
Let's just zoom in here
a little bit.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.810
They've added some extra white
space, notably around the

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.660
tabs, as well, which
is interesting.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.460
But otherwise, it's
fairly similar.

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:49.130
Extra white space, slightly
bumped up font size.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:53.940
And then, if you move to
the landscape 10-inch--

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.200
let me zoom across here--

00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.620
you'll notice that they've moved
from the sort of stacked

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:04.470
layout of their fragments
to being side by side.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.710
But essentially, it's
the same fragments.

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:08.980
You can clearly tell
they've reused the

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.040
same fragments there.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.890
One interesting thing for their
video thumbnail here is

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:18.490
they've moved the title from
being a transparent overlay to

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:21.650
beneath the actual video,
because there's more room, and

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:24.460
they can really bring out the
nice video thumbnails,

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.750
allocating a little bit
more space for that.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:28.910
Guys, you have any comments?

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:33.390
ROMAN NURIK: I just wanted to
mention one thing about the

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:35.120
overall structure
of the screen.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.470
It reminds me of the YouTube
playback screen on Android.

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:42.400
And I think that that's
actually a good thing.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.300
I think that users, when they
buy their Android device, they

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:48.980
pop open YouTube, they instantly
become familiar with

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:49.630
how it behaves.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.770
And I'm guessing if
you rotate into

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:54.600
landscape, it's full screen.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:59.010
They're very familiar with how
it behaves, kind of the tab

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:02.130
structure at the bottom on the
phone that lets you switch

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:04.300
between the different
pieces of detail

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.329
information about the video.

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:09.619
And then in tablet, they
basically do something, again,

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:10.630
very similar to YouTube.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:12.400
They pop that over
to the right.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:18.640
And this is almost like a
natural way to do something

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.970
with the new space
that you have.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:24.569
But I just that added extra
bit of similarity to the

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:28.485
YouTube app makes it instantly
familiar to users.

00:17:28.485 --> 00:17:30.292
Nick, anything else
before we move on?

00:17:30.292 --> 00:17:32.180
NICK BUTCHER: I would say
they've done a great job of

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.380
playing with the spacing
as well.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:36.580
I think you can see that they
definitely hint at the spacing

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.875
when you go from phone up to
7-inch to make it just feel

00:17:38.875 --> 00:17:41.630
that much more comfortable
on that sized device.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:43.310
So it's the kind of thing where
you might have just

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:45.900
tried the phone layout on the
7-inch device and thought,

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:46.700
hey, that's good enough.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.720
But they've actually gone the
extra mile to say, actually,

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.050
it feels a little bit cramped or
would benefit from a little

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.230
bit more spacing here.

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:55.990
So they've gone the extra mile
to really optimize for the

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:57.750
different device sizes,
which is great.

00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:00.070
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, it's worth
noting as well that they don't

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.950
have a landscape layout for
this particular screen on

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:04.180
handset devices.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:07.670
Actually, I'm not sure if they
actually have landscape for

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.460
any of the screens on handset.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:12.060
But for a video app, especially
for a video detail

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.580
screen like this, I think that's
OK sometimes, because

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.870
people sort of expect that when
they rotate, the video

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:19.440
will be playing full
screen instead.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.990
There's not really enough room
to do much else there.

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.875
That's TED.

00:18:24.875 --> 00:18:26.935
ROMAN NURIK: OK, so let's
move on to, I

00:18:26.935 --> 00:18:27.920
believe, the last app.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.300
So we're kind of cheating here,
because this is an app

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.700
that we all worked on.

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.610
This is the Google I/O
2012 application.

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:38.280
So basically, this app, if you
attended the conference, it

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:42.240
lets you see what sessions
are playing.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.980
It lets you create a
personalized schedule.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.330
It also syncs across your
different devices, which,

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:51.420
again, is very important for a
multi-device user that has

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:55.760
multiple devices, having
seamless sync across those.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.220
So what we've done here
is basically--

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:01.150
on phone, there isn't that
much horizontal space.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:06.060
So we have three tabs for the
different core pieces of

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.010
functionality.

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:09.610
That's kind of the interaction
side where you interact with

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:11.980
other people on Google+ that
are also attending the

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.140
conference.

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.890
The My Schedule or My Agenda
area, and then the exploration

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.970
phase, where you can look at
the map or take a look at

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:23.020
individual tracks.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.290
So the interesting thing that
we've done here is we split it

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:30.110
up from tabs to multiple
panes across tablets.

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.600
So in portrait, actually,
both of these devices--

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.520
7-inch and the 10-inch
device--

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.670
in portrait, they would show
this kind of two-column

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:42.180
layout, where two of the panes
are stacked in one column.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:46.660
And in the landscape, they
switch to a wider

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.560
three-column layout.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:52.550
One of the key differences
between the 7-inch and 10-inch

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:55.170
layouts here is that the
margins here on a

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:56.980
7-inch are 16 DIP.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:00.750
And here on a tablet that's
10 inches, they're 32 DIP.

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:04.760
And that actually gives a little
bit more breathing room

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.650
for the content on this
10-inch device.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:09.330
And you'll notice this on the
next screen as well, once we

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:14.400
get to it, that this adds
a sense of spacing and

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.540
separation of the two pieces
of content, or in here, the

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.460
three different pieces
of content.

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.636
Any thoughts, guys?

00:20:22.636 --> 00:20:24.815
NICK BUTCHER: It's
a beautiful app.

00:20:24.815 --> 00:20:27.700
ADAM KOCH: Whoever designed
this is amazing--

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:27.910
[CLEARS THROAT]

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:28.990
Roman.

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:33.310
ROMAN NURIK: One thing I forgot
to mention is that you

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:36.200
can't see this in the
screenshot, but these tabs on

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.600
phone, as you swipe across
them, there's actually a

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:44.080
16-DIP divider that has-- it's
actually just empty space.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:48.110
That divider is the same grey
background as is on the

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:50.180
tablet-- so in this area.

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:53.220
So if you have multiple devices,
there's a subtle hint

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.230
that these are actually part
of the same screen.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:21:00.000
So as you slide on a phone, like
I said, you see that grey

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.462
background giving you, again,
that sense of separation.

00:21:03.462 --> 00:21:05.610
ADAM KOCH: One last thing.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:08.030
One thing I really like,
personally, is on the tablet

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:11.400
layouts, the sort of alignment
of the headings of each of the

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.120
different fragments,
it just makes the

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.050
app feel really nice.

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:17.010
And as Roman was saying, it's
got this sort of padding, the

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:20.300
equal padding there between the
different sections here

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.520
and also the little ticker,
which I can't remember what

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.535
it's called.

00:21:23.535 --> 00:21:25.240
ROMAN NURIK: The What's
On fragment?

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.120
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, the
What's On fragment.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.430
It just sort of-- the
alignment there

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:29.760
looks really nice.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.370
Makes everything look
really consistent.

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.350
ROMAN NURIK: One thing that we
haven't done here is use

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:37.880
Roboto Thin or Roboto Light,
which we probably should have.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:41.530
So in case you want to make the
title stand out even more,

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:42.610
get even more attention--

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.100
I'm not convinced that it's
necessary here, but you could

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.810
use a large point size and
Roboto Thin to give an elegant

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:52.140
header to each of these panes.

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:56.640
OK, so let's move on to the
second screen in this app.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.930
And this is basically the
session detail screen.

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:05.140
So once I get into a specific
session, like in this case,

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:08.510
the session that Chris and Ellie
gave on Android apps and

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:09.590
Google Play where they
announced the

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:11.500
new publisher console.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:14.100
Once I get into the screen,
there's a bunch of information

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.890
that I may want to see, a bunch
of actions that I may

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:17.370
want to take on the session.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.510
For example, I may want to add
it or remove it from my

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:23.430
schedule, share it with people,
see a map of it,

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:24.030
things like that.

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:25.840
I may want to +1 it up here.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.360
And I may want to see the list
of speakers, learn more about

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.370
Chris or Ellie, and
then there's a few

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:33.360
links at the bottom.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.750
So what we've done here is this
is a single screen on--

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:40.020
well, the session detail and the
list of sessions, which is

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.740
a previous screen.

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:45.145
This is a single screen on
phones, whereas on tablets,

00:22:45.145 --> 00:22:47.550
it's combined into a
multi-pane layout.

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:53.100
This is kind of the very common
master detail layout

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:56.200
that's used in almost all
of our system apps.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.010
You'll notice that
in portrait--

00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:59.330
it's not really visible here.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:00.370
We kind of need animations.

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:03.020
We don't have the fancy
technology to show this.

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:06.910
But in portrait, it's kind
of a sliding screen.

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:10.250
So that left pane collapses
once you start interacting

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:12.310
with the right detail pane.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:15.455
And then pressing the Up button
slides it in again, or

00:23:15.455 --> 00:23:17.600
it's just actually sliding
on the screen.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.430
And then in 10-inch tablets on
landscape, we have all that

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:24.830
space available, so we don't
need that collapsing behavior.

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:26.080
So it's always visible.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.566
Any thoughts, guys, on other
things we should point out?

00:23:32.566 --> 00:23:35.270
NICK BUTCHER: I really the
treatment on the 7-inch here,

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:38.810
where it's not quite wide
enough to have the same

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:40.540
displays you have on the
10-inch, to have all the

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.490
information permanently
on screen.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:45.540
So it's a nice solution with the
sliding in and out to give

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:47.860
you a lot of the benefits of
having both on screen.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:51.210
I like the quick interaction
between swapping between the

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:53.460
current sessions, rather than
having to do it on the phone,

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.210
where you have to keep on going
up and down, back up to

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:57.560
see the other adjacent
schedules.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.930
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, one minor
thing, which I like, is

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:03.260
there's this concept
of links related to

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:04.110
a particular session.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:07.040
So these are dynamic links
related to a session that fall

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.350
below on the handset and--

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:11.960
let me see if I can zoom--

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.320
in Nexus 7 version.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.090
But then if you go to the
10-inch version in landscape,

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:19.065
you'll see they sort of fall
alongside the content instead.

00:24:19.065 --> 00:24:19.690
So it's just--

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:22.630
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, that gives
a great way to get a natural

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:25.510
margin point, as well, so that
the details don't get too

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:26.540
wide, I think.

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:29.300
ROMAN NURIK: I think one of
the natural points here is

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.850
really just about text length
and white space.

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:37.860
You really want to optimize to
minimize large, large swaths

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.570
of white space, where there's
just nothing on screen.

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:43.220
You don't want to throw
information along one of the

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.440
edges of the screen
or the corners.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.990
And then, like I said about the
line lengths, you want to

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:51.340
really optimize around a certain
number of characters

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:56.270
per line, because any larger and
it's a little less easy to

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.400
read in terms of your
eye having to

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.220
jump to the next line.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.490
And then any smaller, it's
kind of like a newspaper,

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:06.380
where if there's only two or
three words per line, it

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.560
becomes really tedious
reading a vertically

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.360
long piece of text.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.940
So really that's one of the
optimization points, is to

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.560
make sure that the text itself
is very legible and that the

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:20.650
white space is adequately
filled.

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:23.270
One last thing I wanted to point
out is just a common

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:25.120
thread across these-- you'll
notice that the green

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.780
background maintains some of
the branding for the track.

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:32.050
So you'll notice that the
action bar icon here is

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:35.090
colored green to indicate you're
looking at Android.

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:38.130
And then the green is persistent
across the

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.980
different tablets.

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:41.520
All right.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.410
So with that, let's move on to
our last section, since we

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:46.760
have four minutes left.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:47.945
Wow, we're on time, guys.

00:25:47.945 --> 00:25:50.120
That's awesome.

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.400
Since we have four minutes left,
let's jump into Android

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.460
Design News.

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:58.610
So the first bit of news-- and
this is not really news.

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:01.700
Sorry for lying to people.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.580
So this is actually an article
from Kirill Grouchnikov, who's

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:10.640
one of the engineers on one of
Google's very popular apps.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.920
He wrote a series of articles
on responsive mobile design.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:18.940
They're more like, I guess,
developer focused, but they do

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.340
focus a lot about the different
switching points,

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:24.540
the margin points, as Nick was
alluding to, and how you make

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:29.080
those decisions, and then,
basically, how that affects

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.800
your different layouts
on tablets.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:35.260
A little caveat that this is
a little over a year old.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:39.890
So some of the thinking is
the older version or the

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:42.190
predecessor of what our current
design thinking is.

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:47.750
But it's a phenomenal intro to
responsive mobile design.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:49.380
Moving on.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.912
Nick, I think this is yours.

00:26:52.912 --> 00:26:56.600
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, this is
fantastic to see that this is

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.930
one of the applications, which
we took a look at two weeks

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:02.920
back, called Glimmr, which is
an application for viewing

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.130
photos from Flickr.

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:06.840
And just want to say good job to
the developer, Paul Bourke,

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.160
who's taken the designs and
implemented them already.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.000
You can see the change here in
the before and after of his

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:13.900
first screen.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.530
So no longer is it just a plain
login, but he actually

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:19.600
shows up some content right
from the beginning, and it

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:20.140
looks really nice.

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:21.200
I think he's done
a wonderful job.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.004
So good job, Paul.

00:27:23.004 --> 00:27:25.540
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, totally.

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.370
Well, good job, Nick,
as well, for

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:30.470
inspiring the initial designs.

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:32.220
Next is The Verge.

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.840
Nick, do you want to talk
about that, as well?

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:35.930
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, sure.

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:41.160
So The Verge, popular gadget, my
go-to gadget news site, has

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.230
just done a Holo redesign.

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:45.530
So you can see here, they've
stayed pretty faithful to the

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:48.790
Holo look and feel while
marrying it to their branding

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:50.220
quite successfully, I feel.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.730
So generally, a really
nice job.

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:55.860
A few issues with the navigation
in the application.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.240
But they've done a good job, and
I'm also really pleased to

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.150
see them use the drawer
navigation

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:02.520
pattern pretty correctly.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:03.980
So that's very good to see.

00:28:06.812 --> 00:28:10.130
ROMAN NURIK: Next we have
ActionBarSherlock.

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:13.770
And this is more focused
toward developers.

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:17.000
But ActionBarSherlock is a
library by the very famous

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.680
Jake Wharton.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:22.050
It's a library that lets you use
the action bar in all of

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:26.630
its glory on devices that don't
really have Honeycomb or

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:29.580
Ice Cream Sandwich yet-- for
example, Gingerbread devices.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:31.350
And the latest version--

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:32.650
version 4.2--

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:35.280
adds, I believe, it's
preliminary support for

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:35.890
SearchView.

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:39.090
So if you've been designing
around SearchView because you

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:42.370
must support Gingerbread, this
may be a good way to

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:46.370
backport that view.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:49.070
And I think that's
it for this week.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.140
I think we're one
minute early.

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.590
But again, thanks
for tuning in.

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:55.510
And we hope to see you next time
where we will actually be

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:59.290
doing redesigns of video player
apps that are reviewed

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:02.270
this Friday, I believe,
on the app clinic.

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:02.700
Thanks again.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.960
As always, I'm Roman Nurik.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.203
ADAM KOCH: Adam Koch.

00:29:05.203 --> 00:29:06.500
NICK BUTCHER: Nick Butcher.

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:07.590
ROMAN NURIK: Signing off.

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:08.370
See you guys later.

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:09.270
ADAM KOCH: Thanks, guys.

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:09.570
Bye.

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:17.733
