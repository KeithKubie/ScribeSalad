00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.970
The Joe Rogan experience.
So when you're,
you got into stand up comedy.

2
00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:07.860
When you first started doing that,

3
00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:12.000
what is the scene like in England is that was their comedy clubs where you could

4
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:16.290
go to an open mic night?
We were,
how do you,
we were copying you guys.

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.820
I think Lenny Bruce set up the more alternative version cause,

6
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.720
but I still think in America it's always stayed kind of mainstream.

7
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.520
But Lenny Bruce was definitely doing alternative and as you got lots of Lenny,

8
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.120
I love that guy.
Yeah.
You know,

9
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.280
I played them on stage and that was a wonderful thing.
What did you play them in?

10
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.840
What was that Lenny,
you know the film was from a stage play,
Dustin Hoffman film.

11
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.350
That was a stage play.
Dustin Hoffman was fantastic.

12
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.150
He was so close.

13
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.860
And the guy who plays him in the marvelous Mrs Maysville is very good as well.

14
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.980
I know that's very interesting to say because I'm watching that.
I'm thinking,

15
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.010
okay now I've,
I've gone through the clubs myself,

16
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:58.011
but I did mine in the 80s and into the 90s and that's in this fifties wow.

17
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.660
I sort of take myself there.
Then there's Lenny.
Then I think he,

18
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.180
I know Lenny and I play them.
I used to Dianne and I go,
that's me.

19
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.990
They'll get that.
But I was,
I was doing the standup.

20
00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:14.340
I W I see that the photo I put,
I put that together.
That was,

21
00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:18.600
and I called him to Jesus crisis of comedy because as a Jewish guy,

22
00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:23.601
he died for us to die for us to give us the freedom of speech.

23
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.110
Yeah.
He died for freedom of speech because in the end,
a little of heroin too.

24
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.450
I know,
but the mixture together,
he shouldn't have conflated the two.
Yeah.

25
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.580
He meant that we could say what we want to do.

26
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.470
I'm saying the missus nasal things makes it a little,

27
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.930
it's a little homogenized like him,
like,
and even his struggle,

28
00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:46.060
it's almost like it's no big deal.
Are you,
are you in the latest season?
Is it,

29
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.340
is it three or two to three hasn't released yet.
They're filming it right now.

30
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.920
I've gone through both of them.
It's really good.
Yeah.
Really,

31
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.370
it's just not accurate.
Like historically it's way off the mark.

32
00:01:56.371 --> 00:01:59.190
There's no woman who was talking like that back then.
It wasn't,

33
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.140
there was no mrs main song.
Like I really liked it and uh,

34
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.080
it's interesting sheet.
Yeah,

35
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.760
like norm McDonald got mad about it until he was like,
man,
I,

36
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.100
there was no woman like that back then.
There was a she,
there's no,
it doesn't,

37
00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:16.770
I can we keep it to,
if it's a fucking show,
man,
the hawks not really there.

38
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.290
There's no guy who becomes the hawk now.
I enjoy it.

39
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.730
I really liked normally talk about I love him.
Yeah.
I didn't have,
there was a,

40
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.310
she was swearing like a,

41
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.440
like a soldier on the stage very quickly,
very quickly.
Which that was,

42
00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:32.274
I found,

43
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.220
I don't know how she ramped into that and then she dropped down out of it.

44
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.020
It was,
that was something was by,

45
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:42.021
and then she went to France and I wanted absurd and did stand up that someone

46
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:43.770
was translating and like that was weird.

47
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.330
I have done it in French and I don't think I could've got that,

48
00:02:47.331 --> 00:02:48.240
that I didn't know why that,

49
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.740
that seemed just seemed to be slightly sharp jumping a shot,

50
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.930
going up to the shock and swimming around in ships,
artistic interpretation.
They,

51
00:02:55.931 --> 00:03:00.490
they,
they,
it wasn't realistic,
but it still,
it was a,

52
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:03.580
and as a person who makes a living doing standup comedy,

53
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:07.900
I was willing to let that suspension of disbelief taste.
I like the,

54
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.940
the sexual relationship is it always coming back?

55
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:14.500
The husband's omens coming back into the frame and his,
and his fight that,

56
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.160
um,
cause yeah,
but now I,
I did watch it.
I binge watched it.
Oh,

57
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:21.180
that's what I'm doing.
I just sit down and I just watched everything.
Yeah.

58
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.810
And then I moved on.
Um,
but uh,
yeah,
Lenny,
um,

59
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.810
how do we get into Lenny,
which we're talking about something else.
But anyway,

60
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:31.070
now he's great.
He's great playing Lenny,
but Oh yes,
I was,

61
00:03:31.071 --> 00:03:34.510
I was doing this style apps and I was just told by Director Peter Hall,

62
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.600
I'll leave the stand up to you.
So I had no direction on it.

63
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.990
So I just did it as close as I could to have Lenny would have done it.

64
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.330
Did you listen to a lot of recordings?
I did that.

65
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.470
That is very difficult for birdish uh,

66
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.310
cage maybe even met and kids of today to know cause he's doing a lot of hipster

67
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:54.580
references.
A lot of the other Sophie Tucker references and there's a,

68
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:58.930
there's a Lawrence Welk as it that Welsh,
Welsh,
yeah.
We don't know those guys.

69
00:03:58.931 --> 00:03:59.890
So when he was doing,
that's cool.

70
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:02.230
Is this Sophie Tucker and the guy I could look up.

71
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:03.740
So today I'd have to look up the,

72
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.670
some of the punchlines or enough of that number of the references cause you

73
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.110
without the references you can't get it.

74
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.220
This is a trick I do in universal humor that I take either huge references or

75
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:15.490
explain my references so that you know,
uh,
sees it.

76
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.660
Everyone probably knows about season if they don't.
Well,
yeah.
Anyway,

77
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.980
good as Lenny was,
it's really hard for people to listen to that comedy today.

78
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.040
It doesn't necessarily trans,
it doesn't transfer.
Well,

79
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:29.270
he's talking about Nixon and you're like,
oh Nixon,
no,
this is,

80
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.910
this is a vice president Nixon and this is Eisenhower,
Nixon,
different thing.

81
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.750
Um,
so he,

82
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.490
I worked out that all the,
all my stuff is non datable is no,

83
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.010
I didn't do any topical stuff.
Identity politic,
political stuff.

84
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.420
So it should not date.
I do historical stuff cause that never dates,
you know,

85
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.480
sees it,
is not going to come back.
Now sees his,
changed his whole thing.

86
00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:54.440
He's much nicer though.
He's come back from the dead and he's,

87
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.210
he's cleaned up his act.
Um,
so I've,
I've tried to do that.

88
00:04:58.211 --> 00:05:00.880
And Python did this as well.
You do stuff.
It just doesn't really date.

89
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:05.740
Most of it doesn't date.
Um,
which is a handy thing.
So the stuff,
guns,
yeah,

90
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.250
second.
But I did much stand up does,
and it's also the,
the,
the,
the culture.

91
00:05:10.251 --> 00:05:13.480
So significantly different between the late fifties and sixties,

92
00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:17.740
where Lenny Bruce was sort of starting out and making his mark versus today.

93
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.620
It's like the things that were naughty back then.

94
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.770
The things that he could say that were controversial.
There were nothing today.

95
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.680
They're the,
literally it's a non controversy,

96
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.080
whether there's one that it still was,

97
00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:33.710
was when he said how many people using the n word,

98
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.180
the that's working,
they just went to all the,
how many are in the [inaudible]?

99
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.930
How many of you went and I did this,
I used to do that on stage every night.

100
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.650
And that was still a striking tense.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But the,

101
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.610
the sentiment behind it was that these words only have power because,

102
00:05:48.611 --> 00:05:51.720
cause we're giving them permission and if you could use them again,
again,
again,

103
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.740
and for the gay community,
they taken the word queer.
Reclaim that.
Yeah.

104
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.170
So it doesn't have the force anymore.
And that,
that is a truth.
He spoke,

105
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.550
he was at,
that was a true analysis that he did.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was,
um,

106
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.780
we had some still Joe,
there was a UN,
unfortunately,
accidentally,

107
00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:11.930
a friend of mine stole one of his jokes and didn't know that.

108
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.040
He actually just thought of the same premise.
Yeah.
And he was the,

109
00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:17.780
the premise was that,
uh,

110
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.580
homosexuality in some places and illegal.
And what do they do if they catch you?

111
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:25.100
Well,
they lock you up in jail with a bunch of men who want to have sex with you.

112
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.880
Like in that was Lenny Bruce's line by like Digg,

113
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.640
homosexuality is illegal,
right?
And so what do they do?

114
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:35.330
They put you in jail with a bunch of men will have sex with you.
You know,
like,

115
00:06:35.331 --> 00:06:38.900
that was his whole like,
and like,
that still would work today.

116
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.710
Like if there was a place or homosexuality was illegal today and you did that

117
00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:46.210
joke,
it's a good joke.
It's like set up punch lines.
All right.
There.
