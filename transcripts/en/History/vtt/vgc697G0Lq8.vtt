00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.830
NARRATOR: In the rugged
cliffs of Southwest Montana,

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.070
Jake is on a high-speed chase.
[howls]

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.200
Come on!

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.670
NARRATOR: To keep pace
with his youngest hound.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.300
Now I got to go ahead
and catch up with Marlene.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.930
She's trailing that calf.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.330
NARRATOR: Who's
broken from the pack

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.170
to track and tree a 200-pound
mountain lion all on her own--

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.600
for a second time.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.400
Pretty cool to
see, but she probably

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.530
shouldn't be
running a big column

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.600
like this by herself anyways.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.930
Son of a bitch.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.970
It looks like Marlene has got
him locked down right now.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.700
And that's a pretty
badass sight to see.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.970
[barking]

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.770
Wow.
That's a big calf, big calf.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.800
NARRATOR: Marlene split from the
pack a mile down the mountain.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.170
Come on, Marlene.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.100
Good girl, Marlene.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.300
NARRATOR: To pick
up their trail,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.900
Jake relies on his
emergency tech.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.070
I've just got Henry
and Lefty located

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.170
a couple of hundred yards away.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.430
But got a hell of an
obstacle course ahead of me.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.900
Looks like the dogs are trailing
just over top of this ridge.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.470
I've got to pick my
way up through here.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.170
This is a nasty, nasty cliff.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.230
It's not going to be fun,
but it's the only way

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.170
to get up and through here.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.970
So let's go, Marlene.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.570
Get up there, baby girl.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.030
Good girl.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.670
NARRATOR: The monster cliff
faces a near vertical climb.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.070
These rocks are slick as hell.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.470
NARRATOR: On a coating
of treacherous black ice.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.130
It's real important that I try
to stay on these dry patches.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.700
If you look down
underneath the snow here,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.600
there's a lot of ice.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.400
Every bit of that
is slick as [bleep]..

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.600
And one false move
here, and it's

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.170
going to be a real bad day.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.500
Come on, Marlene.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.330
This is a route I've taken
in the past by myself,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.300
but today is my first
experience trying

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.770
to lead a puppy through it.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.230
Come here.
Come here.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.030
A little further.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.900
Come here.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.900
Get over here.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.800
Come here.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.730
Woo!
Close call, baby girl.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.000
NARRATOR: In a race to catch up
with the rest of his dog pack--

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.300
The conditions
right now aren't

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.900
real ideal for taking this
route, but we can't let up now.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.030
NARRATOR: But sitting
between him and his hounds--

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.400
I've got to Henry and Lefty
up just over the ridge there.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.770
NARRATOR: Is a 300-foot vertical
wall of ice and solid rock.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.470
Good girl.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.530
All right.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.970
NARRATOR: And the only
way through is up.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.330
Let's go, Marlene.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.770
Come on.
Here.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Good girl.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.170
Come here, big girl.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.430
Come here.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.170
I'll lift you up
through this part.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.770
Good girl.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.100
Get up there.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.730
Let's go, Marlene.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.800
One last little pull.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.400
Climb up there, baby girl.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.070
Good girl.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.030
Good girl.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.030
All right.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.600
Now that I'm over
the ridge here,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.730
I need to get these dogs
caught up right now.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.130
I can hear them just a
couple hundred yards away.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.970
Yeah, that's a big cat track.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.130
Both dogs are in it, and they're
treeing just ahead of me.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.130
I'm going to make my way
up here real quietly.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.300
I'm making my way
up to these dogs.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.700
I can hear them
treeing pretty hard.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.730
All right.
Here's the captain.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.570
You can see its butt
facing towards us.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.000
Good boy.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.930
NARRATOR: Altogether, Jake's
team treed two cats three times

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.200
in just a matter of hours.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.470
Looks like Lefty and
Henry are doing their job.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.430
They got that cat up there.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.800
Good boy, Lefty.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.830
Good boys!

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.470
Good dogs!

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.570
NARRATOR: A hard
day's work and a sign

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.700
that the valley's predators are
showing no signs of surrender.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.670
Now that we got this cat
far enough off the ranch,

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.730
it's time to go ahead
and pull the dogs

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.130
and make our way
back to the truck.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.730
On to the next one.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.070
I feel like today
was highly successful.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.130
I've pushed away two
cats instead of one.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.270
But tomorrow is another day, so
we'll get right back after it.
