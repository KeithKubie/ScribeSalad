(cheering)

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.661
- Seventh's not that bad.

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:31.564
Plus, he just qualified
for the paralympics.

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.967 align:start size:88% position:13%
Every four years, we
spend two weeks watching

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:36.002
athletes compete for a
chance to be on a box

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:38.238
of disgusting cereal
that nobody's bought

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:39.506
since the '50s.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:42.108
Who wants to spend
two weeks in London?

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:43.777
The food sucks, it's
always raining, and

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:46.479
no one looks like
Christian Bale.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.049 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's just like Boston
with a big clock.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.984
The Olympics haven't
been fun since '92

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:53.253 align:start size:88% position:13%
when the Dream Team
destroyed every country

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:55.622 align:start size:88% position:13%
they played by 40 points
and impregnated half

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:57.957
the bitches in Barcelona.

00:00:57.957 --> 00:00:59.225
Yeah.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:00.593 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's not a coincidence
that Spain suddenly

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:03.997 align:start size:97% position:3%
started cranking out
beautiful mixed race ballers.

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:05.765 align:start size:88% position:13%
The Greeks only invented
the Olympics because

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:07.400
they needed something
to watch while eating

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.202
their delicious salads.

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:11.538
That's why I decided to
get in on this action

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:13.273
and do every single
sport in the Olympics

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:17.777
in record time for the 2012
tosh point O-lympic games.

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:20.814 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Announcer] Here is Daniel
Tosh with an affinement

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:24.684 align:start size:97% position:3%
warm-up routine that has
this announcer fully aroused.

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:25.852 align:start size:84% position:16%
He loads into the
blocks in the historic

00:01:25.852 --> 00:01:28.455 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
tosh point O-lympiad
is under way.

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:31.558 line:0%
A ridiculously short
dash into the hurdles,

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:33.560 line:0%
into the high jump.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.129 line:0%
He's no stranger to
working the pole.

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:37.297
Is it the shoes?

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:38.798 line:0%
Clips the crossbar.

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:41.434 line:0%
And waiting for him on
the pad is a wrestler.

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:42.469
Let's get it on.

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:43.503
It's over.

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:45.138 line:0%
Four gold so far.

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:46.873 line:0%
Can he make it five?

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:50.777 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
Tosh floats like a
butterfly, stings like VD.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:51.611
Judo?

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.079
Now he's just piling on.

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.347
(yells)

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:57.650 line:0%
It's as if he's been
training all morning.

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:00.253
He looks dead.

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:01.888
That's gonna make
the rematch tricky.

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:03.556 line:0%
Time to throw stuff.

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.227 line:0%
He chucks the metal frisbee.

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:09.262 line:0%
The metal softball.

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:11.297 line:0%
Tosh races through
the field events

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:13.800 line:0%
like a ferral chested [Bleep].

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.736 line:0%
Oh, hits his head
on the release.

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:18.104
Can we see a replay?

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:18.938
No?

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:19.772
Okay.

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:25.111 line:0%
Forehand followed by a backhand.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.015 line:0%
Then a two handed
backhand into a

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:30.617 line:0%
whatever the hell that is.

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:31.851
A big shove.

00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:33.153 line:0%
The judges aren't
going to like that.

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:33.987 line:0%
[Bleep] It.

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:34.821 line:0%
YOLO.

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:36.789
He clings it.

00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:39.459
He jerks it.

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.694 line:0%
And even has time to
get a quick nap in.

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:44.731 line:0%
This is where Tosh truly
excels, handling balls.

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:48.368 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
Spikes the volleyball
right into a rented Camera.

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:52.105 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
Water Polo ball fake
and a header for a goal.

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.308
And look out, Dream
Team, because Daniel

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:57.911
just brought the house down.

00:02:57.911 --> 00:02:59.512 line:0%
Chalks up for gymnastics.

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:01.514 line:0%
And let's just say
he powdered his nose

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:03.082
for a little extra energy.

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:04.017
Take that, G series.

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.352
(whimsical flute)

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:07.687
Just delightful.

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:11.324
Suck a bag of tits, China.

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:14.060
Bela Karolyi right out
to congratulate him.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.262
Must me nice to hug a man
and not a 12 year-old girl

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:18.765 line:0%
that will never have a period.

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:21.668 line:0%
That counts as equestrian?

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:23.436 line:0%
Seems like a stretch.

00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:27.774 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
Remember, nobody needs an
assault rifle for any reason.

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:30.877 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
He'll probably get a low
score because of that splash,

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.345 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
but doesn't seem to
bother him as he swims

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:37.217 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
to the end of the pool and
right into sailing and rowing.

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:41.321 line:0%
And here it is, the final
leg of the Dan-cathlon.

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:43.823
Yes, he's done it.

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:45.692 align:start size:88% position:13%
The judges are factoring
in time, distance,

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:47.393
and degree of difficulty.

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:49.062
Daniel Tosh just
made Michael Phelps

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:50.964
look like a lazy bitch.

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:53.666
What a great day for America.

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:56.135 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I just completed all the
Olympic events in record time.

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:57.503
Now can we start
football season?

00:03:57.503 --> 00:03:59.872
It's the only sport
Americans care about.

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:01.407
(cheering)

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:04.444
I don't know why everyone's
so upset about blood doping.

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:05.778
Makes sports so much easier.

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:08.715
(energetic techno)
