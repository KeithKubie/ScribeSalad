00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.400
The standard story of the Scientific Revolution
culminates with the long life of one man:

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.510
Sir Isaac Newton—a humble servant of the
Royal Mint, two-time parliamentarian, and

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.420
a scientific titan whose name, along with
Einstein’s, is synonymous with physics today.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.109
But there was also another Isaac Newton.

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.440
I mean, it was the same guy, but this Newton
was very different from the mythic, hyper-rational one.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:35.240
This Sir Isaac Newton was also an alchemist,
obsessed with the occult—with hidden, non-rational truths.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.520
And every story’s leading character has
to have a foil, right?

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.600
Enter Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz, an equally
remarkable master of mathematics.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.140
Together, these rival geniuses would change
the worlds of math and science forever.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.580
[INTRO MUSIC PLAYS]

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.050
Ike was born prematurely on what was then—it’s

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.960
a long story—Christmas Day in 1642 in the
delightfully named hamlet of Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.720
Which is known for… mostly just being the place where
Isaac Newton was born.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.510
Newton’s family was not well off.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.800
His dad died, and his mom remarried and had
a bunch more kids.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.340
Farming in rural Lincolnshire?

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.340
Not fun.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.040
And in school, Ike was bullied.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.400
But he discovered that he loved learning,
and so, to no one’s surprise, he did fine

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.000
at Trinity College, Cambridge, on scholarship.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.350
And by “did fine,” I mean that he first
dreamed up the mathematical system that would

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.570
become calculus before he even graduated.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.030
Calculus is the mathematics that describes
how a thing change instantaneously, whether

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.930
that thing is velocity, acceleration, displacement,
height, weight, volume, or whatever.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.530
It provided a new mathematical connection
between displacement, velocity, and acceleration—

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.720
all of which are required if you want to understand
things like planetary motion.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.710
This is all the more amazing because Ike was
poor, he wasn’t tutored at the best schools,

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.650
and—at the time he went there in 1661—Cambridge
was a backwater college.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.530
Fifty years after Bacon’s new, experiment-focused
science, Cambridge was still teaching Aristotle!

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.920
In 1666, soon after Newton graduated, Cambridge
closed for the year due to fear of the bubonic

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.920
plague.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.290
Newton went back home to Lincolnshire and
had what we now call his annus mirabalis or

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.340
“miracle year.”

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.590
In one year, Newton… discovered the laws
of gravity when an apple supposedly fell on

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.740
his head—although this probably didn’t
actually happen.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:31.220
And he laid down the core ideas that would
lead to his inventing calculus—or co-inventing it.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.340
And he started to develop the theory of
light and colors, which holds that white light

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.430
is made up of seven visible colors.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.200
By any measure, Newton had an outstanding
1666.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.480
That was not true of everyone, however: that fall,
a Great Fire swept through London for four

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.320
days, destroying much of the city.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.480
Plus, you know, plague.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.700
But, like I mentioned, there was another side
of this legendary thinker:

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.350
Newton was a wee bit eccentric.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.560
This almost created a professional problem
for him, because for a while, Cambridge required

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.680
professors to become Anglican priests, and
he wasn’t exactly an orthodox Christian.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.840
Newton thought the Holy Trinity was nonsense.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.830
He believed he had unique access to a secret
treasure of wisdom—both religious and scientific—passed

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.350
down from God to Noah, then Moses, then Pythagoras,
and then himself.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.310
Newton was also a major alchemist—as were
his buddies, Robert Boyle and John Locke.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.010
But Newton was obsessed with alchemy, or thinking
philosophically about stuff by changing it.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.070
While he didn’t view alchemy as separate
from his more scientific-looking investigations

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.620
into “what is stuff,” he didn’t stray
far from the alchemical mainstream.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.000
He kept his furnaces burning for days on end,
transmuting metals.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.180
In fact, the largest section of his complete
works concerns alchemy!

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.940
That said, Newton wasn’t interested in trying
to turn lead into gold.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.819
He was just trying to understand everything.

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.930
Newton returned to work at Cambridge in 1667,
continuing to work on his revolutionary insights.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.560
He first published on optics, in 1672 in the
Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.840
With what became known as his “crucial experiment,”
Newton showed that light is composed of rays

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.190
of different colors that can be split using
a prism, and that these rays can’t be further

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.350
split by a second prism.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.139
And that the color of light can be brought
back to white using a mirror.

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.139
BOOM.

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.139
Okay, this may not sound like a mic drop by
today’s standards.

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:27.050
But at the time, there was a lot of debate
about the relationship between color and light.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.360
Newton theorized that light is made of different
colors that are visible only when refracted,

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.360
or bent.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.699
Newton’s fellow science-genius, Robert Hooke,
believed that light is wave, whereas Newton,

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:40.050
like René Descartes, believed light is a
“corpuscle,” or particle.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.289
Newton’s paper on optics earned him membership
in the Royal Society.

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.580
It also proved to be quite controversial.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.220
Many of Newton’s peers still believed in
an Aristotelian version of optical physics,

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.849
and others believed in Descartes’s version.

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.770
The debate went on for decades, leading Newton
to shun public life.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.050
Through his work on optics, Newton also developed
the first functional reflecting telescope,

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.289
using a mirror to focus light.

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.430
Newton’s work on light was collected in
the 1704 book Opticks.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.800
By then, Newtonian optics had beaten out its
Aristotelian and Cartesian competitors.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.180
But that’s not all, because it's
Newton, so of course it’s not.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.589
He concluded Opticks with a series of “queries,”
or questions.

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:23.900
Though they weren’t really questions, but rhetorical
statements meant to guide further research.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.490
In the first edition, there were sixteen queries.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.030
As he continued his own research, Newton added
more queries in subsequent editions, up to

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.030
thirty one.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.930
The queries went way beyond optical physics,
concerning the nature and transmission of

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:43.159
heat, the possible cause of gravity, electricity,
how God created matter “in the Beginning,”

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:47.960
the proper way to do science, and the ethical
conduct of human beings.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.389
As much as the work on optics itself, these
queries influenced science for centuries.

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.129
But a new paradigm in optics isn’t what
Newton is best known for.

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:00.259
Nor for making the first calculation of the
speed of sound.

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:02.419
Nor for all of his other brilliant ideas.

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.810
Newton is best known as the person who…
one, mathematically perfected the astronomical

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.479
system of Copernicus, Kepler and Galileo,
which we spent two episodes on;

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:16.930
Two, mathematically described how gravity
works, setting the stage for classical mechanics;

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.779
and, three, introduced calculus to the world.

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:24.139
You may think this is too much to cram into
one book—but then you wouldn’t be Ike.

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:25.720
Newton dropped The Mathematical Principles

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.169
of Natural Philosophy, or simply Principia,
in 1687.

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:34.869
Work on the book began a few years earlier, when Edmund
Halley—the astronomer after whom Halley’s

00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:40.729
comet is named—asked Newton about his thoughts
about Kepler’s model of planetary motion.

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:44.349
How did the sun invisibly control the planets?

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:49.180
Newton took a few years, but what he delivered
was a book that gave a fairly complete answer.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.480
In fact, almost none of Newton’s contemporaries
could fully understand Principia, the math

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.849
was so dense!

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:58.039
Principia was made up of three books.

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:00.720
It begins with axioms, or core principles.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:06.150
In the introduction, Newton explains that,
if you take his system, you get Galileo’s

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.649
law of falling bodies.

00:07:07.649 --> 00:07:11.999
Book one focused on the motion of bodies in
free space, laying out the core principles

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:16.319
of calculus, the branch of mathematics that
concerns derivatives and integrals.

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:21.509
Newton described how centripetal force works,
exploring the implications of his math regarding

00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:22.740
how objects move.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.350
But Newton discussed calculus in terms of
geometry because—remember—no one else

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.749
had ever heard of calculus before!

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:34.659
Book two concerned the movement of bodies
in a restricted medium like a fluid, instead

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:36.029
of a free space.

00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:40.159
This was Newton’s answer to Descartes, whose
system proposed that the planets move through

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:41.529
a fluid æther.

00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:45.129
Book three, finally, turned to celestial mechanics.

00:07:45.129 --> 00:07:50.409
Newton specified for the first time that gravity
was the force holding all of the planets in

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:52.020
their orbits around the sun.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.469
With this book, he unified the work
of Descartes, Galileo, Kepler, and Copernicus

00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:59.479
into one mathematically sound system.

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:04.060
This was the first time that natural philosophers
in Europe had had a single system for understanding

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.270
what stuff is and how it moves since Aristotle.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:13.569
Newton’s work in math is a good example
of a new mechanical intelligibility in science.

00:08:13.569 --> 00:08:18.189
Mechanical intelligibility is just the idea
that a fact about nature is true because we

00:08:18.189 --> 00:08:22.970
can do stuff with it—say, predict the
motions of planets—even if we don’t understand

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.949
what it—like, gravity—really is.

00:08:24.949 --> 00:08:29.379
Now, for all the awesomeness that is Newton,
the story of the other person who invented

00:08:29.379 --> 00:08:32.589
calculus is equally impressive.

00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:33.589
Introduce us, ThoughtBubble!

00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:36.150
Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz was born in

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:40.209
Leipzig, in what was then the Holy Roman Empire,
in 1646.

00:08:40.209 --> 00:08:44.039
He wrote his first book, De Arte Combinatoria,
or On the Combinatorial Art, at the age of

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:47.100
nineteen, in that fateful year, 1666.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:54.010
Leibniz worked on almost every area of natural
philosophy—reshaping how libraries work,

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:58.220
inventing the mechanical calculator, creating
the binary notation that would centuries later

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.670
be central to computer science, and becoming
a major figure in philosophy.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:07.779
Leibniz worked out elements of calculus in
1675, independently of Newton.

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:11.389
And we actually use Leibniz’s version, not
Newton’s!

00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:14.640
But in 1676, Leibniz traveled to London.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.329
This trip would become the primary evidence
in the long-standing priority dispute, or

00:09:19.329 --> 00:09:21.829
argument about who invented calculus first.

00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:26.329
The English math posse accused the German
of having glimpsed Newton’s unpublished

00:09:26.329 --> 00:09:27.329
notes.

00:09:27.329 --> 00:09:32.550
What did Leibniz discover back in 1675, over
a decade before the publication of Principia?

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:37.769
He used integral calculus for the first time
in history to find the area under the graph

00:09:37.769 --> 00:09:39.029
of a function.

00:09:39.029 --> 00:09:41.530
Which might not sound impressive, but it is.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:46.610
In doing so, he made up some important notation,
or symbols, including the d for differentials

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:52.100
and the integral sign, which is a long S standing
for the Latin word “summa,” or highest.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.790
We still use Leibniz’s notation today.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:58.529
But Leibniz didn’t publish his calculus
until 1684.

00:09:58.529 --> 00:10:05.200
And he didn’t lay out his full theory, expressing
the inverse relation of integration and differentiation—AKA

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.250
the fundamental theorem of calculus—until
1693, well after Principia.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:14.600
This delay, along with a growing rivalry between
thinkers from different nations, meant that

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.259
Leibniz never really got the credit he deserved.

00:10:17.259 --> 00:10:19.540
The Royal Society favored Newton from the
start.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.889
They never gave Leibniz a chance to offer
his version of events, ruling in favor of

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:27.050
Newton—the Society’s president—in 1713.

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:30.680
Thanks Thoughtbubble.
Until he died, Leibniz had to fight to prove

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.490
that he had invented calculus without consulting
Newton’s notes.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:38.980
And there is still no complete edition of
the writings of Leibniz available in English!

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:43.120
Now, the role of the Royal Society in this
dispute is worth pointing out here, because

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.520
this was the time when scientific societies
were first coming into existence.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.800
These were salons where natural philosophers
could debate ideas.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.050
The first major scientific society—mentioned
in our first episode—was the Royal Society

00:10:55.050 --> 00:11:00.290
of London, founded in 1660 and given a royal
charter in 1662.

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:03.589
Here, natural philosophers held weekly discussions.

00:11:03.589 --> 00:11:08.460
The Society consisted of elected members or
“Fellows of the Royal Society,” who add

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.610
the letters “FRS” after their names.

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:15.100
Robert Hooke became the Royal Society’s
official Curator of Experiments, and Newton

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.850
served as president between 1703 and 1727.

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:20.630
The Royal Society was not alone.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:25.940
The Academy of Sciences in Paris was established
in 1666, based out of the Louvre.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:30.250
The Academy maintained the royal observatories
and held public salons.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:34.720
The nearby Royal Garden,
founded in 1626 and opened to the public in

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.160
1640, also served as a way of spreading new
ideas about science.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.800
Importantly, scientific societies functioned
as publishers.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:46.329
In addition to journals sharing the latest
discoveries, such as the Royal Society’s

00:11:46.329 --> 00:11:52.870
Philosophical Transactions, they printed field-defining
books such as Hooke’s Micrographia in 1665

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.290
and Newton’s Principia in 1687.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:12:00.220
Scientific societies were also a place for
debate, including the super unfair one between

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.279
Newton and Leibniz over calculus.

00:12:02.279 --> 00:12:06.279
With the exchange of ideas that scientific
societies facilitated, natural philosophy

00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:08.680
became a public enterprise.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.230
Printing and the availability of mail between
nations—even rivals, sometimes at war with

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.210
one another—became crucial for the production
of knowledge.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:22.089
But the societies also helped generate a new
need in early modern Europe for expert knowledge,

00:12:22.089 --> 00:12:26.591
by showing the utility of science, securing
government patronage, and helping to develop

00:12:26.591 --> 00:12:29.399
commercial applications for the discoveries
of their members.

00:12:29.399 --> 00:12:35.310
We can never properly repay Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth
for its contribution to the history of science.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:40.449
But the bigger point is that Newton was part
of a whole scientific culture engaged in lively

00:12:40.449 --> 00:12:45.040
internal debate about what counts as valid
knowledge and what to do with it.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:49.810
By the time Newton left Cambridge to become
superintendent of the Royal Mint, in 1696,

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:54.689
the paradigm for scientific knowledge production
in Europe had definitively shifted away from

00:12:54.689 --> 00:12:59.220
Aristotle and toward Galileo and Bacon…
and Ike and Leibniz.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:05.290
Next time—get ready to get your phlogist-on—and
then gone: we’re revolutionizing chemistry

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:06.440
with Lavoisier!

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:11.240
Crash Course History of Science is filmed in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney Studio in Missoula, MT.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:16.660
And it is made possible with the help of all these nice people. And our animation team, is Thought Cafe.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:21.540
Crash Course is a Complexly production. If you wanna keep imagining the world complexly with us
