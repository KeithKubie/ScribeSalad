00:00:00.281 --> 00:00:01.983
- [Instructor] When we
left off in the last video,

00:00:01.983 --> 00:00:04.843
things were not going particularly well

00:00:04.843 --> 00:00:07.634
for the English settlers at Jamestown.

00:00:07.634 --> 00:00:11.344
They had managed to
survive a couple of years

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:13.107
by the skin of their teeth,

00:00:13.107 --> 00:00:17.274
but by 1610, they had endured
such incredible starvation

00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:22.015
that they were actually leaving.

00:00:25.047 --> 00:00:28.163
And as they were just
leaving the Chesapeake Bay,

00:00:28.163 --> 00:00:31.505
they met a ship with
English reinforcements,

00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:34.207
who ordered them back to Jamestown,

00:00:34.207 --> 00:00:37.352
and came bearing orders from England

00:00:37.352 --> 00:00:40.185
about a new strategy in Jamestown.

00:00:41.503 --> 00:00:45.562
And these new orders were
carried by a new commander,

00:00:45.562 --> 00:00:48.062
here this was Lord De La Warr.

00:00:51.947 --> 00:00:53.329
Spelled a little bit different,

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.955
but the state of Delaware today

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:58.638
is named after this gentleman.

00:00:58.638 --> 00:01:01.181
And Lord De La Warr said,
"Well, it's been great

00:01:01.181 --> 00:01:02.831
"that you've all been trying to get along

00:01:02.831 --> 00:01:06.998
"with these Powhatans, but
let's get rid of them."

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:11.122
So he switched the English from their

00:01:12.243 --> 00:01:15.488
small amount of conflict
with the Native Americans

00:01:15.488 --> 00:01:16.907
over stealing food,

00:01:16.907 --> 00:01:20.407
to a pretty much all-out war of extinction

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.293
against the Powhatans.

00:01:24.983 --> 00:01:29.150
And De La Warr was a veteran
of the Irish campaigns

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.827
to subdue that colony.

00:01:32.827 --> 00:01:34.160
So he brings his

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:39.172
tactics of complete
brutality and submission

00:01:39.172 --> 00:01:43.048
of the native population to the New World.

00:01:43.048 --> 00:01:45.845
He raids Native American villages.

00:01:45.845 --> 00:01:47.595
He burns their crops,

00:01:48.705 --> 00:01:52.872
and generally promotes an idea
that they'll be no such thing

00:01:53.927 --> 00:01:55.927
as peaceful co-existence

00:01:57.522 --> 00:02:01.355
between English settlers
and Native Americans.

00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:06.420
That the only thing for
Native Americans to do

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.920
is go away or die.

00:02:09.446 --> 00:02:13.038
And these conflicts between
the English colonists

00:02:13.038 --> 00:02:17.083
and the Native Americans living
in this Virginia tidewater

00:02:17.083 --> 00:02:20.000
are called the Anglo-Powhatan Wars.

00:02:23.147 --> 00:02:26.647
The first Anglo-Powhatan war ended in 1614

00:02:27.615 --> 00:02:30.099
with a brief period of peace,

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.849
when this fellow here, John Rolfe

00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:35.394
married Pocahontas.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.800
As kind of a

00:02:39.304 --> 00:02:40.554
peace offering.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.303
But, by the time

00:02:45.297 --> 00:02:49.464
that the second Anglo-Powhatan
war was over in 1625,

00:02:51.217 --> 00:02:54.300
pretty much the entire Powhatan tribe

00:02:55.394 --> 00:02:59.362
had either been killed,
or driven from the area,

00:02:59.362 --> 00:03:03.857
and therefore this
English war of extinction

00:03:03.857 --> 00:03:07.159
against Native Americans had succeeded.

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.323
Now John Rolfe made another contribution

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:12.658
to the colony at Jamestown,

00:03:12.658 --> 00:03:14.722
beyond his marriage with Pocahontas,

00:03:14.722 --> 00:03:17.305
he also discovered that tobacco

00:03:18.187 --> 00:03:19.687
was a perfect crop

00:03:20.907 --> 00:03:23.990
for the kind of marshy Virginia soil.

00:03:25.321 --> 00:03:28.284
And tobacco was a commodity

00:03:28.284 --> 00:03:31.656
that was getting hotter
and hotter in Europe,

00:03:31.656 --> 00:03:34.229
and so they discovered
that they could grow

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:37.796
pretty much as much tobacco
as they possibly could,

00:03:37.796 --> 00:03:40.320
and markets in Europe would just

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.232
buy it and buy it and buy it.

00:03:42.232 --> 00:03:45.717
And so, although the
colonists at Jamestown

00:03:45.717 --> 00:03:48.409
didn't find the gold that
they were hoping for,

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.384
they found a very
different way to get rich,

00:03:51.384 --> 00:03:54.013
and that was through cultivating tobacco.

00:03:54.013 --> 00:03:57.505
And this is going to have
enormous consequences

00:03:57.505 --> 00:04:00.442
for the development of
Virginia as a colony,

00:04:00.442 --> 00:04:03.025
both in terms of its geographic

00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:08.696
development, and also the
development of its labor force.

00:04:08.696 --> 00:04:12.546
As tobacco is an incredibly
labor-intensive crop,

00:04:12.546 --> 00:04:14.608
these English planters in Virginia

00:04:14.608 --> 00:04:17.968
will quickly look for ways to staff

00:04:17.968 --> 00:04:20.613
a labor force in the New World.

00:04:20.613 --> 00:04:23.571
And one way that they
will do this is through

00:04:23.571 --> 00:04:26.448
the importation of African slaves.

00:04:26.448 --> 00:04:30.615
The very first slave ship
arrived in Jamestown in 1619.

00:04:33.325 --> 00:04:35.733
We'll talk more about
that in the next video.
