Speaker 1:          00:00          Jocko. I've got a question regarding the quote. If there is a doubt, there is no doubt. Oh, right. I remember that from last time. Okay. This would seem to indicate avoiding taking risks. Many, many businesses or many business decisions involve risk. Often there can be a doubt about either of two options, doubt that you should maintain the status quo and doubt about pursuing a new opportunity to frequent or you frequently talk about dichotomies. Would you mind sharing your thoughts on this principle?

Speaker 2:          00:31          Yeah, this is, this is a classic thing in and it's a great point and that's why these little sound bites can be a little bit dangerous. Sometimes we use a little little power soundbites because they are that simple and of course I've loved, I like things to be simple, right? That's the number two law of combat is to keep things simple. But sometimes things like this need a little bit of amplifying information and yes, this could be construed as being extremely risk averse and like, hey, if I have any doubt about the safety of success of this mission that we're not going to do it. Which if that was the case, then I would have done a zero missions during my deployments to Iraq. Uh, same with business. Never would have started victory. MMA never would've started echelon front cause there was risk involved in starting those things.

Speaker 2:          01:18          Never would have done anything really because there's always going to be doubts. So this is a accurate statement and of course every business has risk. And so, so I guess that idea that if there is a doubt, there is no doubt is not to be taken literally when it comes to risk, when it comes to risk, don't take it literally. But what it should be I think is like a a warning, right? Like a little warning that's in your head. If there's a doubt like, okay, we need to think about what's going on here. We need to understand what, what is at risk here because, and I just had this conversation with us, CEO of a company. As a matter of fact, I was talking about the dichotomy of leadership and I was talking about how, you know, giving him examples. I was like for instance in, and he was in a technology company and I said, you know, if you didn't take risk you wouldn't, you wouldn't make any progress, but if you took too much risk you wouldn't be where you are right now because they're dominating.

Speaker 2:          02:14          So it's like, oh you're, you're balancing that dichotomy all the time. So if he would have said, hey, if there a doubt, there is no doubt he never would have gotten off the ground. Now, where I think it becomes a more solid statement is from like a moral or an ethical standpoint. And that is if you think that something is wrong or that it probably is, if you think you're doing something that you probably shouldn't be doing, then there's doubt and you probably shouldn't be doing it. I think an easy way to keep yourself in check and these days it's a very real possibility. It's just if you think that you're being recorded at all times, like if you just think, oh, I'm being recorded, which probably somebody is recording you. Like if you decide you think you can get away with something, you're probably not going to get away with it.

Speaker 2:          02:57          Look at all the, just go watch youtube, don't caught in the act or whatever. People get caught all the time. So whenever you're doing, think that there could be somebody there with a phone recording you and I think that's keeps you a morally and ethically in check. You know, I used to tell my guys that you could be getting watched by CNN or Al Jazeera or some report. You know, whoever you, you know, you could be getting watched and if you're doing something that you shouldn't be doing, you're, you're gonna get caught. So don't do it. Not to mention these days we got the aircraft overhead, they can see everything. So do the right thing. That's what you do. You do the right thing. Yeah. If you have any doubt that what you're doing is the right thing, then you should probably shouldn't do it. A lot of those, a lot of the horrible police actions, yeah.

Speaker 2:          03:44          Are, you know, recorded by some random person with a phone. Now, of course, I always need to point out that there's all of these good actions that take place every single day. Millions and millions of police doing the right thing. No one publishes those. No one uploads those on to youtube or Facebook. But the bad acts that are caught, they're caught because someone has a camera. And so like that's great advice for a cop. Hey, act like you're being recorded all the time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's interesting. Well, it may cause you very well. Might be. Yeah. Yeah. So do the right thing. Next question. Thank God I didn't have cameras when I was a kid for all the dumb stuff I did. Yeah. Uh, yeah. Well, I, I always want to make sure that I'm not sitting here saying like, everyone out there should do the right thing like me.

Speaker 2:          04:33          I'm not saying that if you thought I was saying that, I'm not saying God that apologize for even sounding that way. Like I was as dumb and stupid as the next person and still do dumb stuff. Try not to get a man you don't do dumb stuff. Right. You know, it was bad when, when, uh, when we had Charlie plumb and Jim conch on. Yeah. And I'm like thinking they're like, you know, hey, this is the way to act. Right? And I'm like, don't put me in that category, but you guys, you guys are awesome heroes and I'm just over here. Yeah. Don't say that about me. You guys can say like, Hey, talk about character. You have character. I'm just over here trying to do shit.
