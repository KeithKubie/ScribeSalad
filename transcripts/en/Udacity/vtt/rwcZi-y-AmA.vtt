00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.315
Let's look at a real example of branch divergence,

00:00:02.315 --> 00:00:04.650
the kind of thing that might come up in the real world.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.786
Suppose that I'm doing some sort of operation on a 1024x1024 image

00:00:08.786 --> 00:00:14.801
but I need to do some special operation to deal with the pixels that are on the boundary.

00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:20.031
For example, if I'm doing a blur, I don't want look off of the edge of the image.

00:00:20.031 --> 00:00:23.909
So here's a simple kernel code that illustrates this idea.

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:26.417
I'm going to call per pixel kernel.

00:00:26.417 --> 00:00:33.211
I'm going to check to see if the thread index is 0 or 1024 in either x or y.

00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:36.299
If so, I'm going to call some code that deals with the boundary conditions.

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:39.141
Otherwise, I will run some code that does whatever it is I'm doing to the pixel.

00:00:39.141 --> 00:00:42.221
Okay. You can totally imagine that this is a common kind of operation.

00:00:42.221 --> 00:00:44.575
You've probably written code like this already in this class.

00:00:44.575 --> 00:00:49.491
So as a quiz, what is the maximum branch divergence of any warp in this code?

00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:52.555
Is it 1-way, 2-way, 3-way, 32-way, and so forth?
