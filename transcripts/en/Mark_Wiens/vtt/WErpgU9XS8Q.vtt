00:00:00.177 --> 00:00:02.121
- [Mark] That's an amazing shot.

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:03.184
- You got it?
- Yeah.

00:00:03.184 --> 00:00:04.780
- [Mark] The entire rib-eye.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.230
The best of the best Kobe beef.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.063
Wow.

00:00:15.077 --> 00:00:15.910
- Hey, everyone.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:16.873
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:16.873 --> 00:00:18.619
Good morning from Phuket.

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.938
We are staying at a place called Sri Panwa

00:00:20.938 --> 00:00:22.465
and this is day number two.

00:00:22.465 --> 00:00:26.926
We are gonna, basically, just
hang out and relax all day.

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.249
And do some eating.

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:29.944
But, tonight is the main event.

00:00:29.944 --> 00:00:32.201
It's the Wagyumafia Beef event

00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:35.265
which I am really looking forward to.

00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:37.640
But, for now, we're gonna
go have breakfast real fast.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.720
It's about 7:00 a.m.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.784
We're gonna have breakfast,
right here, at the hotel.

00:00:40.784 --> 00:00:43.440
They have a full selection
of different curries,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.094
Southern Thai curries, and a
full buffet up at the front.

00:00:47.094 --> 00:00:50.165
Basically, all kinds
of breakfast delicacies

00:00:50.165 --> 00:00:51.878
you could possibly want
but then, they also,

00:00:51.878 --> 00:00:53.476
have a menu where you order eggs.

00:00:53.476 --> 00:00:56.597
Decided to start off with their signature

00:00:56.597 --> 00:00:58.180
Baba Eggs Benedict.

00:00:59.505 --> 00:01:01.801
I'm gonna have this first
before I eat some curries.

00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:04.801
And also, coffee, gotta have coffee.

00:01:07.908 --> 00:01:08.741
Oh yeah.

00:01:08.741 --> 00:01:10.083
That's a really good Americano.

00:01:10.083 --> 00:01:12.011
Let me break into this yolk.

00:01:12.011 --> 00:01:13.377
Oh, yes.

00:01:13.377 --> 00:01:15.595
This one is proper, proper yolk.

00:01:15.595 --> 00:01:18.611
The other one is a little bit overcooked,

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:21.347
but this yolk is beautiful.

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:25.514
Oh, and there's a piece of,
maybe, bacon down there.

00:01:29.342 --> 00:01:32.759
Oh yeah, that is a very
soothing, soothing egg dish.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.686
Any chance that I have to eat crab,

00:01:34.686 --> 00:01:38.325
Southern Thai crab curry for
breakfast, I am very happy.

00:01:38.325 --> 00:01:39.563
And it looks wonderful.

00:01:39.563 --> 00:01:41.588
Just loaded with crab meat.

00:01:41.588 --> 00:01:43.835
I, also, got some beef and some cabbage

00:01:43.835 --> 00:01:46.335
and just a little bit of rice.

00:01:51.255 --> 00:01:52.799
Oh, wow.

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.549
Oh, it's really good.

00:01:57.138 --> 00:02:00.240
Oh, just boneless nuggets of crab.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.481
What a way to start the day.

00:02:01.481 --> 00:02:03.927
Next course, I went with a
lot of fruits and vegetables.

00:02:03.927 --> 00:02:05.535
The salad course and then,

00:02:05.535 --> 00:02:08.826
just a few pieces of cheese
and chorizo, for good measure.

00:02:08.826 --> 00:02:11.409
(upbeat music)

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:18.738
I really love bell peppers.

00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:19.821
Dragon fruit.

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.932
We've been having a very leisurely morning

00:02:24.932 --> 00:02:28.797
and now I'm walking over to
David's room because David

00:02:28.797 --> 00:02:32.964
has this unbelievable view and
a swimming pool at his room.

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:43.428
Oh, wow.

00:02:43.428 --> 00:02:47.578
This room is spectacular
and this pool with a view,

00:02:47.578 --> 00:02:48.745
it's gorgeous.

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.749
Okay, just to tell you
the rough plan of the day.

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:56.950
We're gonna hang out and then, for lunch,

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.329
we're going into Phuket
town to eat at a restaurant.

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.213
Which is a very well known
Southern Thai restaurant

00:03:01.213 --> 00:03:03.326
and I think we're just gonna
come back to the hotel,

00:03:03.326 --> 00:03:06.338
hang out, have a nice leisurely afternoon,

00:03:06.338 --> 00:03:09.687
and then tonight is
another main food event.

00:03:09.687 --> 00:03:12.982
Which I am ecstatic
about and we'll be having

00:03:12.982 --> 00:03:17.938
some of the ultimate, best
Wagyu beef from Wagyumafia.

00:03:17.938 --> 00:03:20.521
(upbeat music)

00:03:28.447 --> 00:03:30.250
We just took the drive into Phuket town

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.319
and we're eating lunch at
a restaurant called Raya.

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.517
This is a legendary, Southern
Thai food restaurant.

00:03:34.517 --> 00:03:37.005
And Ying and I have been
here a couple times before

00:03:37.005 --> 00:03:38.311
when we've been in Phuket town,

00:03:38.311 --> 00:03:39.960
but we're here with a whole crew.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.377
We're here with Wagyumafia and Chef Sato.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.631
We got Gkoong Pad Sadtaw
which is shrimp stir-fried

00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:52.232
with shrimp paste and lots of stink beans.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.098
And then one of the signature
dishes here is called

00:03:54.098 --> 00:03:57.301
Mu Hong which is a braised pork dish.

00:03:57.301 --> 00:03:59.028
And then we, also, got Gang Bu.

00:03:59.028 --> 00:04:03.282
I think, with Pai Chapu
which is a crab nugget curry

00:04:03.282 --> 00:04:06.648
with Mai Chupu which is wild betle leaves.

00:04:06.648 --> 00:04:09.481
Let me start with the stink beans.

00:04:12.592 --> 00:04:13.825
Oh, yeah.

00:04:13.825 --> 00:04:15.242
Oh, it's so good.

00:04:16.762 --> 00:04:19.095
Let me try the Mu Hong pork.

00:04:28.517 --> 00:04:31.091
It's so tender and then
you can taste all the

00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:33.619
Chinese five-spice flavors in there.

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:37.340
You can taste garlic, you
can taste black pepper.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.257
It's delicious.

00:04:38.257 --> 00:04:39.901
I didn't get to show you that much of it

00:04:39.901 --> 00:04:42.201
because we were hanging out and conversing

00:04:42.201 --> 00:04:43.333
but it was a great lunch.

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:46.641
And great to hang out with
everybody that we ate with.

00:04:46.641 --> 00:04:49.224
(upbeat music)

00:04:52.354 --> 00:04:53.759
Made it back to the hotel after lunch.

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:57.485
Baby is just taking a nap so
I'm gonna head down to beach.

00:04:57.485 --> 00:04:58.397
Oh, really cool.

00:04:58.397 --> 00:05:01.764
You have to walk on,
there's a jungle canopy.

00:05:01.764 --> 00:05:05.016
And check out the size
of these taro leaves.

00:05:05.016 --> 00:05:06.433
These are giants.

00:05:08.614 --> 00:05:10.509
There, also, sometimes
called elephant ears

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.469
because they're so big and
look like elephant ears.

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:15.605
Oh, look at that view
of the beach down there.

00:05:15.605 --> 00:05:18.188
(upbeat music)

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:26.578
A nice little private beach.

00:05:26.578 --> 00:05:28.344
And it's just a little
cove of a beach, too

00:05:28.344 --> 00:05:33.261
because Sri Panwa it takes
up their whole ridge area

00:05:33.261 --> 00:05:35.622
and then it's, mostly, rocky.

00:05:35.622 --> 00:05:37.862
That's why you have
such spectacular views,

00:05:37.862 --> 00:05:41.871
but then there's just this
little patch of sand right here.

00:05:41.871 --> 00:05:42.704
Whoa.

00:05:44.043 --> 00:05:47.876
Gotta have good balance
on this thing, though.

00:05:49.517 --> 00:05:52.350
(water splashing)

00:05:54.242 --> 00:05:55.523
Oh, that's amazing.

00:05:55.523 --> 00:05:57.773
(clapping)

00:05:59.154 --> 00:06:02.987
- [Together] Wagyu!
(clapping)

00:06:05.112 --> 00:06:07.324
- And, actually, Wagyumafia they are

00:06:07.324 --> 00:06:11.491
expert dealers in Wagyu, but
then as their popularity rose

00:06:13.053 --> 00:06:15.552
they decided to open their
own pop-up restaurant.

00:06:15.552 --> 00:06:18.330
And now, they have a
full restaurant in Japan.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.173
But, they're real purveyors of the

00:06:20.173 --> 00:06:22.309
best of the best quality of beef.

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:25.793
So, they're gonna serve us a
full menu of different courses.

00:06:25.793 --> 00:06:27.479
And the first course
that they're serving us

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:31.396
is homemade beef jerky
with Ozaki beef A5 BMS8.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.984
It's just a thin strip but
you can see that marbling

00:06:35.984 --> 00:06:39.151
just on that thin piece of beef jerky.

00:06:46.111 --> 00:06:49.278
It's very light in spice
but really, really fragrant.

00:06:49.278 --> 00:06:51.963
It's salty, you can taste
the pepper in there.

00:06:51.963 --> 00:06:55.880
And then, there's a little
bit of an oil sauce.

00:06:56.801 --> 00:06:57.753
Oh, wow.

00:06:57.753 --> 00:07:00.253
That is a stunning first bite.

00:07:04.877 --> 00:07:05.710
Thank you.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.413
For the next course,
it is a type of satay,

00:07:13.607 --> 00:07:14.982
two types of satay.

00:07:14.982 --> 00:07:18.379
Which are, kind of, a
combination of Japanese Wagyu

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:20.845
with Thai-flavor style satay.

00:07:20.845 --> 00:07:23.512
So, I'll start with this skewer.

00:07:30.602 --> 00:07:33.852
Oh, it's so beefy tasting and so juicy.

00:07:38.456 --> 00:07:39.289
Whoa.

00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:44.089
I think that just is pure fat, I think,

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:46.463
and it just melts in your mouth.

00:07:46.463 --> 00:07:48.234
Oh, and it's so flavorful.

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:49.651
It's so fragrant.

00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:51.994
That is amazing.

00:07:55.008 --> 00:07:57.664
- I want you to squeeze
with your chopsticks

00:07:57.664 --> 00:08:01.286
and eat it with a (mumbling) stock.

00:08:01.286 --> 00:08:04.903
- It's a Thai-Japanese
invention, or fusion,

00:08:04.903 --> 00:08:07.614
with Wagyu beef but a type of krapao

00:08:07.614 --> 00:08:10.406
which is stir-fried with holy basil.

00:08:10.406 --> 00:08:12.972
And then, they poached an egg yolk

00:08:12.972 --> 00:08:14.853
and stuck the egg yolk on top.

00:08:14.853 --> 00:08:17.471
And chef has instructed
us to pinch the egg yolk

00:08:17.471 --> 00:08:20.023
with our chopsticks
and break that egg yolk

00:08:20.023 --> 00:08:21.953
all over the meat below.

00:08:21.953 --> 00:08:23.474
That yolk!

00:08:23.474 --> 00:08:25.138
That yolk is just perfect.

00:08:25.138 --> 00:08:28.635
You just stick your chopsticks
onto it and it just,

00:08:28.635 --> 00:08:31.099
you can feel it wiggling around.

00:08:31.099 --> 00:08:32.826
Oh, that's gorgeous.

00:08:32.826 --> 00:08:35.078
Oh, that's just perfect yolk.

00:08:35.078 --> 00:08:36.544
Perfect yolk.

00:08:36.544 --> 00:08:38.461
Oh, it oozing all over.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.195
That yolk is, actually, perfect.

00:08:44.195 --> 00:08:47.612
It's just like a runny thick, rich sauce.

00:08:57.199 --> 00:09:00.664
Next course, we are onto
an Ozaki beef tendon.

00:09:00.664 --> 00:09:02.829
It's like a reinvention
of a Tom Yum Goong.

00:09:02.829 --> 00:09:05.522
It's, kind of, cold and looks jelly-ish.

00:09:05.522 --> 00:09:08.011
You, kind of, wanna scoop
it up almost like a pudding

00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:12.178
because you can see there's
chunks of tendon in it.

00:09:16.635 --> 00:09:17.699
Oh, yeah.

00:09:17.699 --> 00:09:21.211
There's little tender nuggets
of meat and tendon in there.

00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:22.245
It's just really good.

00:09:22.245 --> 00:09:24.495
That's like a beef pudding.

00:09:30.042 --> 00:09:32.625
(upbeat music)

00:09:40.856 --> 00:09:42.439
- Okay.
- Thank you.

00:09:44.268 --> 00:09:47.018
- So, that's prepared by Satoshi.

00:09:48.699 --> 00:09:50.712
So, it's a total collaboration.

00:09:50.712 --> 00:09:53.212
This is Misugi, shoulder clod.

00:09:54.308 --> 00:09:55.641
An oyster blade.

00:09:56.656 --> 00:09:57.623
From Ozaki beef.

00:09:57.623 --> 00:10:00.441
A piece of sushi, a beef sushi.

00:10:00.441 --> 00:10:03.416
And it is one of the most beautiful things

00:10:03.416 --> 00:10:05.053
that I have ever seen in my life.

00:10:05.053 --> 00:10:06.823
It almost looks like pure fat

00:10:06.823 --> 00:10:08.536
with just a little bit of meat in it.

00:10:08.536 --> 00:10:10.411
And, actually, as it sits on my plate,

00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:13.505
it, actually looks like
it's starting to just melt.

00:10:13.505 --> 00:10:15.505
Melt in the natural air.

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:17.841
It's starting to melt.

00:10:17.841 --> 00:10:19.758
This thing is a beauty.

00:10:25.276 --> 00:10:26.109
Wow.

00:10:34.325 --> 00:10:35.158
Wow.

00:10:36.725 --> 00:10:39.535
Oh, you do not want to swallow that bite.

00:10:39.535 --> 00:10:42.263
It just keeps on releasing beef juices.

00:10:42.263 --> 00:10:45.346
Next course is tako yaki, but this is

00:10:46.375 --> 00:10:47.958
Wagyu rib-eye ball.

00:10:50.672 --> 00:10:53.187
There's a batter and
then it's all encrusting

00:10:53.187 --> 00:10:55.463
a little piece of rib-eye
and there are some,

00:10:55.463 --> 00:10:56.763
I think they're bonito flakes,

00:10:56.763 --> 00:11:00.346
and then some other
light seasonings on it.

00:11:08.185 --> 00:11:09.412
It's like a batter ball.

00:11:09.412 --> 00:11:11.541
It's like a comforting ball and then,

00:11:11.541 --> 00:11:13.067
and that beef in there is so soft

00:11:13.067 --> 00:11:16.106
that it blends in with the batter.

00:11:16.106 --> 00:11:17.560
Oh, it's ridiculously soft.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.169
So soft that I barely even
tasted the beef, at first.

00:11:20.169 --> 00:11:21.952
The next course, I think,
is gonna be grilled beef

00:11:21.952 --> 00:11:24.792
on a mookata and it is a hot griddle.

00:11:24.792 --> 00:11:28.542
The actual broth is made
from Kobe beef bones

00:11:29.622 --> 00:11:31.443
and then they sprinkled
some vegetables in it.

00:11:31.443 --> 00:11:35.398
They put a giant chunk of Wagyu fat on top

00:11:35.398 --> 00:11:39.680
and then we're gonna be grilling
up splices of Wagyu beef.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:44.302
So, this is one of the
most luxurious, gourmet,

00:11:44.302 --> 00:11:48.696
and just outrageously,
insanely awesome mookata

00:11:48.696 --> 00:11:51.529
that has ever been prepared, ever.

00:11:57.341 --> 00:11:59.698
We all got bowls of the mookata

00:11:59.698 --> 00:12:03.115
with a slice of beef and then vegetables.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:09.007
And, actually, I wanna just
taste that broth first.

00:12:11.372 --> 00:12:12.205
Wow.

00:12:13.055 --> 00:12:15.138
That's so meaty, perfect.

00:12:17.016 --> 00:12:21.072
They added in some nice
chilis in there, too.

00:12:21.072 --> 00:12:22.896
Flaming Ozaki beef.

00:12:22.896 --> 00:12:24.563
Steaming Ozaki beef.

00:12:27.887 --> 00:12:29.195
Oh, yeah.

00:12:29.195 --> 00:12:32.306
You could just eat bowls of it.

00:12:32.306 --> 00:12:33.473
A whole plate.

00:12:39.719 --> 00:12:41.969
(mumbling)

00:12:52.752 --> 00:12:53.585
- [Man] Thank you, sir.

00:12:53.585 --> 00:12:54.418
I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry.

00:12:54.418 --> 00:12:57.335
I love you, I love you, I love you.

00:13:02.374 --> 00:13:04.562
- This is for you, man.

00:13:04.562 --> 00:13:06.178
- Thank you.

00:13:06.178 --> 00:13:07.577
This is the first piece.

00:13:07.577 --> 00:13:08.410
How is it?

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:09.361
How is it?

00:13:09.361 --> 00:13:12.778
- You have to try it, you have to try it.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.663
- You just wanna keep it in your mouth.

00:13:26.663 --> 00:13:28.174
- [Man] It's the best of
the best of the Kobe beef.

00:13:28.174 --> 00:13:31.660
- [Mark] The best of
the best of Kobe beef.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.660
- [Man] It's the eye of the rib-eye.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:36.383
Oh my god.

00:13:40.786 --> 00:13:42.453
Turn the cut around.

00:13:48.563 --> 00:13:51.400
- This is the main course of the night

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:55.406
and it is the best of the
best of Kobe beef, a rib-eye.

00:13:55.406 --> 00:13:57.239
And it's a whole hunk.

00:13:58.848 --> 00:13:59.758
Oh, yeah.

00:13:59.758 --> 00:14:00.978
Look at that, look at that.

00:14:00.978 --> 00:14:01.925
Light on there.

00:14:01.925 --> 00:14:04.425
Oh, it's dripping with juices.

00:14:09.609 --> 00:14:10.442
- You have to try.

00:14:10.442 --> 00:14:12.368
I can't tell but it's really good.

00:14:12.368 --> 00:14:15.201
- Alright, I'm gonna take a piece.

00:14:17.238 --> 00:14:18.071
Wow.

00:14:19.815 --> 00:14:22.732
I'm gonna dip a little bit in salt.

00:14:32.344 --> 00:14:34.550
It is ridiculous.

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:38.282
It's something that you never
want to leave your mouth ever.

00:14:38.282 --> 00:14:41.615
You wanna keep it in your mouth forever.

00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:50.388
- [Together] Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:15:00.498 --> 00:15:03.081
- Next course is a Wagyu ramen.

00:15:06.113 --> 00:15:09.838
What they did, I think, is
they boiled it in Wagyu broth.

00:15:09.838 --> 00:15:12.588
Has an amazing beefy smell to it.

00:15:19.859 --> 00:15:21.762
Oh, it's beefy and garlic-y.

00:15:21.762 --> 00:15:23.089
This is an extra dish that they made

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:25.672
and it is a tom yum with Wagyu.

00:15:27.712 --> 00:15:31.879
Which I can, definitely,
say I've never had before.

00:15:35.382 --> 00:15:38.383
Oh, that beef just melts in your mouth.

00:15:38.383 --> 00:15:39.216
Oh, wow.

00:15:40.834 --> 00:15:42.501
Oh, that is amazing.

00:15:44.294 --> 00:15:46.863
And this is the final
course which is dessert.

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:50.843
There is mochi rice
surrounding by some kind of a,

00:15:50.843 --> 00:15:52.000
I think it's mango.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:52.833
I think it's mango.

00:15:52.833 --> 00:15:54.673
It's a little rice ball.

00:15:54.673 --> 00:15:56.832
Oh, it's very sticky
and there's some coconut

00:15:56.832 --> 00:15:58.832
on the outside, as well.

00:16:08.077 --> 00:16:11.129
Oh yeah, the rice is
really sticky and gummy.

00:16:11.129 --> 00:16:14.524
And then inside is like a
pudding, a mango pudding,

00:16:14.524 --> 00:16:16.672
with coconut shreds on top.

00:16:16.672 --> 00:16:20.904
- [Man] Thank you.
(clapping)

00:16:20.904 --> 00:16:22.487
- [Together] Wagyu.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:26.887
- [Chef] Thank you everybody!

00:16:28.363 --> 00:16:29.573
- Just made it back to the hotel

00:16:29.573 --> 00:16:31.899
after one of the most stunning meals

00:16:31.899 --> 00:16:33.479
I've ever had in my life.

00:16:33.479 --> 00:16:34.312
That beef.

00:16:35.163 --> 00:16:39.729
And in particular, the
rib-eye, the Kobe beef rib-eye.

00:16:39.729 --> 00:16:43.671
I can not even explain
the sensation of that meat

00:16:43.671 --> 00:16:46.012
dissolving on your tongue.

00:16:46.012 --> 00:16:49.204
It's, like, you're in a different world.

00:16:49.204 --> 00:16:51.526
So, I want to say a big
thank you to Wagyumafia.

00:16:51.526 --> 00:16:53.707
I wanna say a big thank
you to David Califa.

00:16:53.707 --> 00:16:55.976
He's the one that
organized this whole pop-up

00:16:55.976 --> 00:16:58.637
and he is the.hungry.tourist on Instagram.

00:16:58.637 --> 00:17:00.900
I'll leave his link in
the description box below.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.618
And I wanna say a big
thank you to Kun Blau Wan

00:17:03.618 --> 00:17:08.248
and Sri Panwa Hotel and the
entire team for hosting us.

00:17:08.248 --> 00:17:09.858
And, also, I wanna say thank you to you
