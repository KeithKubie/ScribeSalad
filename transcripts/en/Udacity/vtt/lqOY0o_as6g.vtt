00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.990
Michael, here is a world. In fact, for the

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.020
purposes of this discussion it is the world. Okay. So

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.420
imagine the entire universe is well described by this

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.780
picture over here. Okay? Now this is called a grid

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.090
world, which is something that people in reinforcement learning

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.040
love to think about, because it's a nice approximation for

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.280
all the complexity of the entire universe. Now this particularly

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.730
world is a three by four grid. So you have

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.580
one comma one, two comma one, three comma one, four comman

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.310
one. You have one comma two, one comma three and so on

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.600
and so forth. For the purpose of this discusision we can

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.050
think of the world as being a kind of game where you

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.500
start out in state. Which we're going to call the start state.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.730
And your able to execute actions, one of these four, up, down,

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.550
left to right and the purpose is to wonder around this

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.960
world in such a way that eventually you make it to the

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.370
goal over here, this little green spot. You see that Michael?

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.200
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.930
&gt;&gt; And under all circumstances, you must avoid the red spot.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.390
&gt;&gt; No.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.680
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Now for this particular example, up

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.170
does what you think it does, down does

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.010
what you think it does, as do left and right. But if you find yourself at a

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.365
boundary, such as right, up here in thi

00:01:09.365 --> 00:01:11.500
upper-left-hand corner, and you try to go up, you

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.280
just stay where you are. If you try to go left, you just stay where you are.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.500
But if you go right, you do actually end up in the next square. Got it?

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.270
&gt;&gt; Think so.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.590
&gt;&gt; Okay. Three last things. One, this little black, space here, is

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.760
a place you can't enter into, so it acts just like a

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.890
wall. This green space is the goal, and once you're there it's

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.160
over. The world is over and you get to start over again.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.680
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.550
&gt;&gt; And once you enter into the red spot, the world is also over and you

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.360
have to start over again. So you can't go through the red square to get to

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.850
the green square. Okay, you got it?

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:44.690
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.670
&gt;&gt; Excellent. So, here's the quiz. Given this

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.280
particular world, with the physics I just described to

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.460
you, and given these actions that you can take,

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.950
up, down, left and right, what is the shortest

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.460
sequence of actions that would get us from

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.100
the start state to the goal state? And you

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.870
can just type in the words up, down, left

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.340
and right, separated by spaces, or commas or anything

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.580
like that. Okay. [LAUGH] Say semicolons are allowed, colons are not.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah, good. I am glad you made that distinction.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.030
&gt;&gt; Well, it's an important one to make. Okay, you got it?

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.560
&gt;&gt; Alright, cool. So let's see what you get then. Go.
