MALE SPEAKER: We're
really excited that we've

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.950
released Android
L. And now we're

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.310
also super excited to announce
that we are releasing Google

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.490
Play services 6.5 enabling
you to build better apps.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.936
[CROWD CHEERING]

00:00:13.936 --> 00:00:16.350
Yeah.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.910
That's what this is all about.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.480
When you start using all the
APIs of Google Play services,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.510
you will be building
better apps.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.700
And as always, when you develop
using Google Play services,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.900
it will run on all devices,
starting with Gingerbread.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.549
So let's check out the
new features in 6.5.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.940
And let's have some fun
while we're doing it.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.690
High five, Gingerbread man.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.380
So starting off with the
Google Drive Android API,

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.650
imagine that your app needs
to upload lots of drive data.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.630
Let's say gigabytes.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.260
Well, in that case,
you may want to ensure

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.700
that you're connected
to a power source

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.270
and you're on a Wi-Fi network.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.030
Well, now, you can
programmatically

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.580
specify these types of
conditions for uploads.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.520
And in this release, it
is also possible to cancel

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.010
pending uploads
that you don't want.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.470
So these features allow
you to control and conserve

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.460
precious resources, such
as network and battery,

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.860
for users of your app.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.730
Another new feature is that
you can now create empty files.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.470
Nope, there's no data in here.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.610
And perhaps saving
the best for last,

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.930
we've now added the
possibility to add

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.750
public and private
properties to your file.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.840
This is like custom
metadata your app assigns

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.520
to a file that can
describe the file content.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.460
And, of course, you can
also use this information

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.840
when doing queries.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.660
Moving over to
Google Maps, which

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.850
is truly an amazing product.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.330
You can navigate through
the entire world using it.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.550
But sometimes, you
don't want to navigate

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.720
through the entire world.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.230
Have you ever wanted
just a small, simple map?

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.950
That's exactly what
Lite mode maps provides.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.420
Here is one showing
the Googleplex.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.060
Lite mode maps allow you to
serve a static image as a map.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.750
But it still supports many of
the features of ordinary maps,

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.650
including different map types,
such as terrain and satellite.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.170
Markers and polylines
are also supported.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.600
Here, you can see a mark
for Googleplex, for example.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.930
And user location can
also be displayed.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.230
Here, for example, is
where I am right now.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.930
And since Lite mode maps
are based on a static image,

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.150
there is no need for
continuous server communication

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.490
to update the map.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.450
So you can truly say
that they are Lite mode.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.770
So if you have a
bounded area or maps

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.640
that are too small
to interact with,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.470
or if you want to stack a
number of small maps together,

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.490
then you should consider
using Lite mode maps.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.390
And guess what?

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.670
It is really easy to switch to
full blown map functionality.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.030
The user just needs to
tap on the static image.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.110
Now, we've also
added a new toolbar.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.510
This toolbar works for both
regular as well as Lite mode

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.980
maps and enables the user
to quickly open Google Maps

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.380
and immediately get directions.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.130
And that brings us
over to Google Wallet.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.400
Previously, we've had
the Buy with Google

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.410
and the various Save
to Google buttons.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.550
And now, we're also adding
a Donate with Google button.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.400
That's right.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.690
This makes donating as easy
as buying things, exactly

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.385
the way that it should
be, which brings us over

00:03:26.385 --> 00:03:27.820
to a much-discussed topic.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.850
Let's go really, really
deep technically.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.360
Let's talk about the Google
Play services SDK and something

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.674
that will help manage the 16-bit
method limit of dex files.

00:03:37.674 --> 00:03:40.880
[BEEPING]

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.620
Previous versions of the
Google Play services SDK

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.650
required you to depend on
all of Google Play services

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.940
to do one aar file.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.030
So your gradle build file
looked something like this.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.190
Yeah, a single line
that included everything

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.720
in Google Play services.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.150
And as we've continued
to add more APIs,

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.490
it has proven hard to
maintain a lean app.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.010
Therefore, we have
unbundled this aar file,

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.870
so you can select only
the APIs you want to use.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.890
Here's an example
gradle build file

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.210
that only uses the maps and
the ads API of Google Play

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.490
services.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.260
And while there are
many aspects and ways

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.320
to manage the 16-bit
method limit of dex files,

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.400
this should make it easier
to keep your app lean,

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.420
since you select the APIs you
want to include in your build.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.010
And that's almost
it for this time.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.540
I say almost, because there's
one more thing to cover.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.900
Let's go out in the wild and
talk about the Google Fit API.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.480
Google Fit was officially
released in October,

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.080
so now it's high time for you
to develop your applications

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.350
and publish them to
the Google Play store.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.490
Here is an application,
for example.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.990
Nathan has a band
around his chest, which

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.450
allows a Google Fit application
to measure and record

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.880
his heartbeats while
he is doing chin-ups.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.650
NATHAN: Now, it's your turn.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.155
MALE SPEAKER: Hot
dog, do I get to try.

00:05:01.155 --> 00:05:01.655
Eeee!

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.530
That's it for this time,
but be sure to check out

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.080
these resources as well.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.500
Now it's your turn to go out
there and build better apps

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.140
using all of these APIs.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.750
And don't forget to
tell us all about it.
