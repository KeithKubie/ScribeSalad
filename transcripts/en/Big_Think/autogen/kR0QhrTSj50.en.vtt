types is going to start to deepen our

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630
types is going to start to deepen our

ability to help people move through the

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370
ability to help people move through the
 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.890
ability to help people move through the
behavioral changes they need to make to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900
behavioral changes they need to make to
 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.670
behavioral changes they need to make to
really change their health and the costs

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680
really change their health and the costs
 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.920
really change their health and the costs
of their health of maintaining their

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930
of their health of maintaining their
 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.260
of their health of maintaining their
health and so that's that's one of the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270
health and so that's that's one of the
 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.520
health and so that's that's one of the
things that we're trying to do the the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530
things that we're trying to do the the
 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.820
things that we're trying to do the the
main cost come from diabetes heart

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830
main cost come from diabetes heart
 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.190
main cost come from diabetes heart
disease obesity and asthma and allergies

disease obesity and asthma and allergies
 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.200
disease obesity and asthma and allergies
those are the sort of main low-hanging

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210
those are the sort of main low-hanging
 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.640
those are the sort of main low-hanging
fruits that's where if you look at where

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650
fruits that's where if you look at where
 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.960
fruits that's where if you look at where
your costs are coming from that's where

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970
your costs are coming from that's where
 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.190
your costs are coming from that's where
they're coming from you know diabetes is

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200
they're coming from you know diabetes is
 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.110
they're coming from you know diabetes is

an epidemic in this country 8% of people
 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.749
an epidemic in this country 8% of people
have diabetes at this point that's

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759
have diabetes at this point that's
 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.360
have diabetes at this point that's
that's a major cost center so going

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370
that's a major cost center so going
 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.220
that's a major cost center so going
after those diseases with these new

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230
after those diseases with these new
 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.890
after those diseases with these new
methodologies you know we've tried

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900
methodologies you know we've tried
 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.869
methodologies you know we've tried
disease management in the past but it's

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879
disease management in the past but it's
 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.330
disease management in the past but it's
generally been only going after one

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340
generally been only going after one
 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.550
generally been only going after one
personality type which is a nurse calls

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560
personality type which is a nurse calls
 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.800
personality type which is a nurse calls
you twice a week to berate you into

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810
you twice a week to berate you into
 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.809
you twice a week to berate you into
maintaining your health that works for

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819
maintaining your health that works for
 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.400
maintaining your health that works for
some people but only works for one

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410
some people but only works for one
 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.130
some people but only works for one
personality type you need to apply many

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140
personality type you need to apply many
 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.050
personality type you need to apply many
more tools to getting people to change

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060
more tools to getting people to change
 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.509
more tools to getting people to change
their behavior and you need to deploy

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519
their behavior and you need to deploy
 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.250
their behavior and you need to deploy
them in a much more cost-effective way

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260
them in a much more cost-effective way
 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.559
them in a much more cost-effective way
which having an expensive nurse call

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569
which having an expensive nurse call
 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.259
which having an expensive nurse call
twice a week to the whole population is

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269
twice a week to the whole population is
 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.690
twice a week to the whole population is
pretty expensive way to do it and and so

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700
pretty expensive way to do it and and so
 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.460
pretty expensive way to do it and and so
those are models that have failed but

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470
those are models that have failed but
 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.080
those are models that have failed but
there are many more models to try and

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090
there are many more models to try and
 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.430
there are many more models to try and
some of them are gonna work over the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440
some of them are gonna work over the
 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.809
some of them are gonna work over the
next five or ten years and so that's

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819
next five or ten years and so that's
 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.759
next five or ten years and so that's
what made PD is is a platform for trying

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769
what made PD is is a platform for trying
 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.500
what made PD is is a platform for trying
out all these different ideas and then

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510
out all these different ideas and then
 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.990
out all these different ideas and then
capturing the stats about what's working

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000
capturing the stats about what's working
 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.240
capturing the stats about what's working
and then iterating on that and and

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250
and then iterating on that and and
 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.009
and then iterating on that and and
focusing people on the things that are

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019
focusing people on the things that are
 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.500
focusing people on the things that are
actually working evidence-based sort of

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510
actually working evidence-based sort of
 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.900
actually working evidence-based sort of
behavioral change and and that's that's

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910
behavioral change and and that's that's
 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.180
behavioral change and and that's that's
where we're going another another big

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190
where we're going another another big
 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.449
where we're going another another big
