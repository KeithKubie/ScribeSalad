00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:02.070
The Salem Witches

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.580
When you think about people disposing of witches
a few hundred years ago, you probably imagine

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.210
a woman tied to a stake jutting up from a
pile of smoking wood.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.049
The burning of witches has become so ingrained
in witch-hunt canon that it’s a cliché.

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.769
But the truth of the matter is that the burning
of people convicted of being witches wasn’t

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:20.260
all that common in England.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.630
By the time the colonies were set up, English
law forbade burning people alive, which meant

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.590
that no witches could be burned in the American
colonies as a result of the Salem witch trials,

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.390
contrary to what is often depicted.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.890
The Salem Witch Trials are probably the most
well-known American witch hunt.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.289
They took place between 1692 and 1693 in colonial
Massachusetts, just as the European witch

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:42.960
hunts were winding down.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.030
Previous to the European hunts—which started
around 1300—the ability to perform “magic”

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.030
was more accepted.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.380
For instance, people would use so called “magic”
to heal others.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.109
Of course, if magic could be used for good,
it could also be used for evil.

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:58.949
This way of thinking set the stage for the
Salem Witch Trials.

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.230
You see, Salem was going through a rough patch
in the years leading up to the hunt.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.910
Refugees flooded into the town in 1689 following
England’s war with France on American soil.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.250
The war displaced many people living in New
York, Quebec, and Nova Scotia, and the extra

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.170
mouths to feed in Salem put a strain on the
town’s resources.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.930
This, in turn, stretched the division between
Salem’s rich and poor, causing heated arguments

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.280
which the local Puritans blamed on the Devil.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.260
There was also a major feud going on between
two major families, the Putnam and the Porter

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.720
families, the former of which included one
of original accusers.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.850
Many in the region sided with one family or
the other in the feud, causing tensions to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.750
be extremely high.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.450
That same year, Reverend Samuel Parris became
Salem’s first ordained minister, an appointment

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.060
that wasn’t well-received.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.460
Parris was also greedy, causing more controversy
in the town.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.970
In January 1692, three young girls began having
“fits”—they would scream, mutter strange

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.481
sounds, bark like dogs when addressed, become
unable to concentrate on tasks given, and

00:01:57.481 --> 00:02:01.050
contort themselves into supposedly “impossible”
positions.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.840
This began occurring after the girls started
experimenting with fortune telling to try

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.869
to figure out how their lives would end up
and what their husbands would do for a living.

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.730
(This sort of thing was quite common at the
time, such as one tradition using mistletoe

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.250
put under one’s pillow at night and then
burned the next day.)

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.410
One of the girls was Reverend Parris’ daughter,
Betty Paris (9 years old), and another was

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.050
his niece, Abigail Williams (11 years old).

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.310
The third was Ann Putnam (12 years old), a
member of one of the powerful families involved

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.640
in the family feud going on in the region.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.130
When prayer didn’t fix the problem, the
Reverend called in a doctor who was unable

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.370
to explain what was causing the fits.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.190
He declared that something supernatural was
affecting the girls.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.480
In February, the victims of the “devil’s
work” confessed to a judge that three women

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.980
were responsible for giving them fits: Sarah
Osborne, Sarah Good, and Tituba, the Parris’

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.980
slave.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.020
The women were interrogated, but only Tituba
confessed to the crime.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.480
All three were later put in prison—not burned
at the stake.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.930
Even though the three suspected witches were
put away, the people of Salem became paranoid.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.380
In a fit of mass hysteria- and probably a
dash of simply taking advantage of the situation

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.020
to get rid of enemies- fingers were being
pointed at supposed witches left and right,

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.050
even for the mildest of offenses.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.170
When the hunt ended, some 200 people had been
accused of witchcraft.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.910
However, only 20 people were executed.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.630
The first to be formally executed was Bridget
Bishop.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.630
She was perceived as a promiscuous woman and
a gossip.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.580
(Clearly, she must have been a witch!)

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.569
Though she pleaded innocent, the Special Court
of Oyer and Terminer—the court set up to

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.120
deal with the witch trials—found her guilty.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.140
On June 10, 1692 she was hanged on what would
become known as Gallows Hill.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.030
Eighteen more women followed in Bishop’s
footsteps, swinging on Gallows Hill.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.910
Additionally, one elderly man named Giles
Corey was pressed to death by heavy stones.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.319
Many more people were tried and sent to prison,
and several of them died while incarcerated,

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.430
including Sarah Osborne, one of the first
“witches” convicted.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.630
Funny enough, Tituba, who confessed to witchcraft
right from the start, was simply let go a

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.090
year after being imprisoned when someone paid
to get her out of jail.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.280
As the Salem Witch Trials demonstrate, the
most common way to dispose of a witch was

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.450
by public hanging.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.280
In Britain, witchcraft was considered “a
crime against the government and a felony

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.180
punishable by hanging.”

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.570
As the American colonies were still under
British rule at the time, hanging was how

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.419
Salem dealt with the witches.

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.060
It’s likely that burning witches went down
in history as the more popular method of execution

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.900
because of what happened to the witches after
they died.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.770
Authorities commonly burned the remains of
the witch in order to protect themselves and

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.080
the town against any evil she might wish upon
them in death.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.520
Not too long after the Salem Witch Trials,
in 1702, the General Court declared that the

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.730
trials had been unlawful after many of those
involved in the convictions confessed that

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.550
they had made their decisions in error.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.250
In 1711, the heirs of the victims were given
£600 to ease the blow of losing a loved one,

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.120
and the victims’ good reputations were restored.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.410
It wasn’t until 1957, however, that Massachusetts
formerly apologized for the events.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.550
As for the original little girls who started
the whole thing, one of them, Ann Putnam,

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.960
later apologized in 1706, stating:
I desire to be humbled before God for that

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.970
sad and humbling providence that befell my
father’s family in the year about ninety-two;

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.800
that I, then being in my childhood, should,
by such a providence of God, be made an instrument

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.430
for the accusing of several people for grievous
crimes, whereby their lives was taken away

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.990
from them, whom, now I have just grounds and
good reason to believe they were innocent

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.120
persons; and that it was a great delusion
of Satan that deceived me in that sad time,

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.340
whereby I justly fear I have been instrumental,
with others, though ignorantly and unwittingly,

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.900
to bring upon myself and this land the guilt
of innocent blood; though, what was said or

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:46.260
done by me against any person, I can truly
and uprightly say, before God and man, I did

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.850
it not out of any anger, malice, or ill will
to any person, for I had no such thing against

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.120
one of them; but what I did was ignorantly,
being deluded by Satan.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.030
And particularly, as I was a chief instrument
of accusing Goodwife Nurse and her two sisters,

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.881
I desire to lie in the dust, and to be humble
for it, in that I was a cause, with others,

00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:10.660
of so sad a calamity to them and their families;
for which cause I desire to lie in the dust,

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:15.240
and earnestly beg forgiveness of God, and
from all those unto whom I have given just

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:32.330
cause of sorrow and offense, whose relations
were taken away or accused.
