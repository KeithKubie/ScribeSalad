00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:01.534
- Forrest: Uh, just
before we get started,

00:00:01.534 --> 00:00:04.267
who's been to an Ignite before?
All right. 

00:00:04.267 --> 00:00:05.567
Well, for those of
you who haven't,

00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:08.434
it'll be a lot of fun.

00:00:08.434 --> 00:00:10.667
So, welcome to Ignite.

00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:15.801
It's a fun, normally beer-
filled, geek-filled night.

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:18.400
Google invited me here
today to run one

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.100
and we pulled in
a combination of

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.801
Googlers, attendees, and
cool people who've done

00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:26.667
great Ignite talks
in the past.

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:29.801
Uh, I'm Brady Forrest,
I write for O'Reilly,

00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:32.834
I do a bunch of conferences,
and I spend a lot of my time

00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:36.934
doing Ignites, which, in case
you wouldn't have guessed it,

00:00:36.934 --> 00:00:38.367
I love my job.

00:00:38.367 --> 00:00:42.734
Um, and I also--I started this
because geeks like to share,

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:44.767
and geeks have a
lot of passions,

00:00:44.767 --> 00:00:47.634
they don't necessarily want to
take a whole weekend camp

00:00:47.634 --> 00:00:49.400
to explain it and
talk about it.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.067
They want to share
it with their friends

00:00:51.067 --> 00:00:54.367
but a long, 45-minute talk
is just a little too long.

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:55.834
And geeks like beer.

00:00:55.834 --> 00:00:57.868
So, when you combine the
two things together,

00:00:57.868 --> 00:01:00.701
a fun, social night
out at a bar,

00:01:00.701 --> 00:01:03.300
with your passions,
and short talks,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.033
and your non-geek but
interested-in-Twitter friends,

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:09.601
you get something like Ignite.

00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:13.000
And the way we do that is
we have this fun format,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.300
and it's not showing. Sorry.

00:01:17.834 --> 00:01:19.200
Ha.

00:01:23.534 --> 00:01:29.200
So this is what you just missed.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.701
And here's where we are.

00:01:30.701 --> 00:01:34.200
And we use this format to make
all the content interesting.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.601
Each speaker gets
just five minutes,

00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:38.767
20 slides that
auto-advance after 15 seconds.

00:01:38.767 --> 00:01:41.300
The speakers that get up here
have no control over the slides.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.133
What I just did is cheating.

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:46.534
Um, but I feel like I had a good
reason, my own incompetence.

00:01:46.534 --> 00:01:49.267
And what you're going to see
today are nine speakers

00:01:49.267 --> 00:01:51.434
who are going to take you
through a variety of topics.

00:01:51.434 --> 00:01:53.734
Uh, speakers who are
here today are

00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:55.868
Pamela Fox from Google,
Kevin Marks from Google,

00:01:55.868 --> 00:02:00.167
Leo Dirac, Kathy Sierra and
Tim Ferriss, Mike Driscoll,

00:02:00.167 --> 00:02:03.868
and you may have an Ignite in
your city and you don't know it.

00:02:03.868 --> 00:02:05.701
And, if not, you
should go start one.

00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:07.400
They're very easy,
as you'll see.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.767
You just ask your
friends to give you

00:02:08.767 --> 00:02:10.200
20 slide presentations.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.367
You just set them to

00:02:11.367 --> 00:02:14.534
"All Auto-Transition after 15
seconds,"

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:16.367
and then you go to a bar,

00:02:16.367 --> 00:02:19.067
and you can be like
any of these towns.

00:02:19.067 --> 00:02:22.801
At the last Ignite Seattle,
we had almost 600 people there.

00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:24.267
A recent one here
in San Francisco,

00:02:24.267 --> 00:02:26.734
we had 800.
It's a lot of fun.

00:02:26.734 --> 00:02:30.534
We put the videos up online
and it's a great way to

00:02:30.534 --> 00:02:33.334
share your passions,
get your name out there.

00:02:33.334 --> 00:02:38.067
If you want to see more of this,
check out "The Ignite Show."

00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:41.901
And, now, without much more ado,
I'd like to welcome up our first

00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:45.901
speaker, here from Google, but
an Ignite Seattle veteran,

00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:49.133
Leo Dirac. Please
give it up for Leo.

00:02:49.133 --> 00:02:51.434
- Dirac: Thanks, Brady.

00:02:51.434 --> 00:02:53.534
So, I'm Leo Dirac--
wow, this is loud--

00:02:53.534 --> 00:02:55.734
and, uh, I'm here to
talk to you about 

00:02:55.734 --> 00:02:58.167
saving the world with
The Better Alarm Clock.

00:02:58.167 --> 00:02:59.534
I'm going to give you
a couple of strategies

00:02:59.534 --> 00:03:01.501
for waking up in the
morning; the geek strategy

00:03:01.501 --> 00:03:03.567
and the hippie strategy.

00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:06.501
But, uh, I'd like to start out
by taking an audience poll.

00:03:06.501 --> 00:03:09.701
So, raise your hands if you
regularly use the Snooze button

00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:11.167
on your alarm clock.

00:03:11.167 --> 00:03:14.267
All right, now keep them up
if you regularly snooze 

00:03:14.267 --> 00:03:16.434
for more than 15 minutes.

00:03:16.434 --> 00:03:19.300
Half an hour? An hour?

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.534
Yeah, it's okay,
I do it too, sometimes.

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:24.968
The thing is, beds are comfy,
and they're warm, and

00:03:24.968 --> 00:03:26.934
they often have snuggly
things in them.

00:03:26.934 --> 00:03:29.868
And the alarm clock is a stupid
little robot that just goes,

00:03:29.868 --> 00:03:35.067
"Beep. Beep. Time to wake up and
face the cold, harsh reality

00:03:35.067 --> 00:03:38.067
of your life. Beep. Beep."

00:03:38.067 --> 00:03:40.167
So, a more effective
alarm clock would,

00:03:40.167 --> 00:03:42.067
say, make the bed uncomfortable.

00:03:42.067 --> 00:03:46.667
Suddenly. Say by, uh, pumping
cold fluid into the mattress,

00:03:46.667 --> 00:03:49.467
or making it not
horizontal anymore.

00:03:49.467 --> 00:03:52.767
But, you know, that's maybe not
the funnest way to deal with it.

00:03:52.767 --> 00:03:54.834
What if, what if
getting up was really fun?

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:57.901
What if there's something
totally awesome you couldn't do

00:03:57.901 --> 00:03:59.868
lying down with
your eyes closed?

00:03:59.868 --> 00:04:01.968
Well, then you'd want
to get out of bed.

00:04:01.968 --> 00:04:03.167
So, what would that
be like, hmm?

00:04:03.167 --> 00:04:05.300
Well, I've got
a couple of ideas.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.200
Like, um, how about
snowboarding?

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.467
Or, what if you were a
superhero, and you had to get

00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:14.167
out of bed every day to prevent
the end of the world?

00:04:14.167 --> 00:04:16.267
That would keep you from hitting
the snooze, wouldn't it?

00:04:16.267 --> 00:04:19.267
But, you know, I think each and
every one of you could be

00:04:19.267 --> 00:04:22.067
that superhero, because
our world is facing

00:04:22.067 --> 00:04:24.534
very real threats every day.

00:04:24.534 --> 00:04:26.868
Now, nuclear war, maybe not
as dire as it used to be,

00:04:26.868 --> 00:04:28.868
but, what about bio-terrorism?

00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:30.667
What if there was a
bio-engineered super virus

00:04:30.667 --> 00:04:33.667
that turned all humans into
flesh-eating zombies?

00:04:33.667 --> 00:04:35.934
Or, what about cataclysmic
climate change,

00:04:35.934 --> 00:04:37.300
or, gray goo?

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.267
Or, you know, if we keep
going the way we have been,

00:04:40.267 --> 00:04:42.067
eventually, this planet isn't
going to be able

00:04:42.067 --> 00:04:44.534
to support human life at all.

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:46.367
And how long do you think
we have before that?

00:04:46.367 --> 00:04:48.701
Do you think we'll
make it 100 years?

00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:51.467
A thousand?
I mean, I think, eventually,

00:04:51.467 --> 00:04:53.434
something's
going to wipe us out.

00:04:53.434 --> 00:04:57.133
And, uh, I mean, maybe it's not
even worth trying to save

00:04:57.133 --> 00:04:58.567
the human race at all.

00:04:58.567 --> 00:05:00.934
Maybe we should try to save
something more important.

00:05:00.934 --> 00:05:03.801
Well, what's more
important than people?

00:05:03.801 --> 00:05:06.868
That's a good question.
Let's put on our P.M. hat

00:05:06.868 --> 00:05:09.033
for a minute,
and go into triage mode.

00:05:09.033 --> 00:05:12.133
If you ask me,
the Pri 1 is complex thought.

00:05:12.133 --> 00:05:15.868
This is ideas and emotions.
Logic. Art.

00:05:15.868 --> 00:05:19.434
All of these things are
way more important than

00:05:19.434 --> 00:05:22.667
things like, uh,
eh, you know,

00:05:22.667 --> 00:05:28.133
birds or plants
or human beings.

00:05:28.133 --> 00:05:31.701
Because, so, okay, how do you
have complex thought without

00:05:31.701 --> 00:05:33.067
a human brain?

00:05:33.067 --> 00:05:35.701
Well, that's a--
that's a good question.

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:37.601
What else can support
complex thoughts?

00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:40.567
Well, sounds kind of like an
engineering problem to me.

00:05:40.567 --> 00:05:42.400
And a really fun
challenge at that.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.834
What if we made robots that
were really powerful

00:05:44.834 --> 00:05:48.467
and could support human emotions
and live lives as rich as ours?

00:05:48.467 --> 00:05:51.601
Well, that'd be one way to do
it, and we're all geeks,

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:53.234
let's get to it.
What do you say?

00:05:53.234 --> 00:05:56.667
Now, I know, some people are
going to miss having bodies.

00:05:56.667 --> 00:06:00.701
They're going to miss
food, watching sunsets,

00:06:00.701 --> 00:06:02.567
but you know, people get
nostalgic about all

00:06:02.567 --> 00:06:04.234
sorts of stupid stuff already.

00:06:04.234 --> 00:06:08.367
Like, "Boy, wasn't it nice when
we all used to huddle around the

00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:12.601
campfire to keep warm while
hiding from the saber-toothed

00:06:12.601 --> 00:06:16.033
tigers in our caves?" I mean,
come on. Let's get over it.

00:06:16.033 --> 00:06:17.567
It's time for us to move on.

00:06:17.567 --> 00:06:20.667
I say we cast off these weak,
fragile human bodies,

00:06:20.667 --> 00:06:22.367
and replace them with something
better.

00:06:22.367 --> 00:06:24.467
Let's let the robots take over.

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:27.133
Okay, so here's what you can do
to help.

00:06:27.133 --> 00:06:29.634
First, pick a job that's
going to get you

00:06:29.634 --> 00:06:31.634
 out of bed every Monday
morning.

00:06:31.634 --> 00:06:33.501
Do something that's really
important for the world,

00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:35.567
something that's going to
help the robots take over.

00:06:35.567 --> 00:06:37.567
There's two ways to do
this; you can be a geek,

00:06:37.567 --> 00:06:38.968
or you can be a hippie.

00:06:38.968 --> 00:06:42.634
So, the geek way means do
science. Build technology.

00:06:42.634 --> 00:06:45.300
Help people communicate.
Help people solve

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.934
complex problems together.

00:06:46.934 --> 00:06:48.767
Because, as the
world gets smarter

00:06:48.767 --> 00:06:50.968
at solving these problems,
we're getting closer to having

00:06:50.968 --> 00:06:54.534
the robots that we're gonna need
to get through this.

00:06:54.534 --> 00:06:57.267
The other thing,
we gotta buy more time.

00:06:57.267 --> 00:06:59.200
And that means being a hippy. 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.067
And you know what this
is; this is recycling,

00:07:01.067 --> 00:07:03.834
this is composting, this is
peace in the Middle East.

00:07:03.834 --> 00:07:06.200
All of the things the hippies
have been preaching for decades

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.467
are actually really important.

00:07:08.467 --> 00:07:11.267
Because, the humans might
be doomed,

00:07:11.267 --> 00:07:13.968
but we've got to keep them
around for long enough

00:07:13.968 --> 00:07:15.834
so they can build us V2--

00:07:15.834 --> 00:07:19.834
ah, I mean, we have to keep
ourselves around long enough

00:07:19.834 --> 00:07:23.200
to build our own replacements,
because I'm a human too.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.467
And, uh, this is what gets
me up in the morning.

00:07:26.467 --> 00:07:31.667
Because, I don't know, uh, maybe
the humans will make it forever,

00:07:31.667 --> 00:07:34.133
but I'm not really willing
to take that risk.

00:07:34.133 --> 00:07:37.968
I think counting on that is
reckless and immoral.

00:07:37.968 --> 00:07:40.601
Because everything that we know
and care about in this world

00:07:40.601 --> 00:07:43.501
that's important is in
danger of being wiped out.

00:07:43.501 --> 00:07:47.234
And it's only by working
together, as geeks and hippies,

00:07:47.234 --> 00:07:49.334
that we can save the world.

00:07:49.334 --> 00:07:51.734
So, thank you.

00:07:57.067 --> 00:07:59.834
- Forrest: Thank you very much,
Leo, for, uh, telling us about

00:07:59.834 --> 00:08:01.534
Google's new product
Google Body.

00:08:01.534 --> 00:08:03.634
[laughs]

00:08:03.634 --> 00:08:06.167
Uh, and now we're going to move
to open source,

00:08:06.167 --> 00:08:07.834
because we want to
know what to save,

00:08:07.834 --> 00:08:09.100
and we'll need to
calculate that.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.133
Please welcome up Mike Driscoll,
telling us about R.

00:08:11.133 --> 00:08:18.367
- Driscoll: Thanks, Brady.

00:08:18.367 --> 00:08:22.868
So, uh, we are now living in
an age of big data.

00:08:22.868 --> 00:08:27.234
Every cash register, every cell
phone, uh,

00:08:27.234 --> 00:08:30.634
can I get some extra time?

00:08:30.634 --> 00:08:33.067
Uh, every car, uh, every
computer is streaming

00:08:33.067 --> 00:08:34.667
billions of data points.

00:08:34.667 --> 00:08:37.734
And, uh, the professor Joe
Hellerstein has called this the

00:08:37.734 --> 00:08:41.734
Industrial Age of Data. The
Industrial Revolution of Data.

00:08:41.734 --> 00:08:44.467
And, that's great,
that's exciting.

00:08:44.467 --> 00:08:46.601
You know, big data has become
something that a lot of people

00:08:46.601 --> 00:08:49.434
are talking about. Um,
and it's not just about

00:08:49.434 --> 00:08:53.033
gathering this data. Um, you
know, data's become interesting.

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:56.734
In fact, data's become something
that's not just interesting,

00:08:56.734 --> 00:08:59.200
um, it's even become
something that's sexy.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.200
In fact, Hal Varian has said
that

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.167
"Statisticians are the sexy job
in the next decade."

00:09:06.167 --> 00:09:09.234
And you might be wondering with
all this data, um,

00:09:09.234 --> 00:09:11.868
how can I learn how to
become sexy too?

00:09:11.868 --> 00:09:15.033
Uh, what can I do to
make pretty charts?

00:09:15.033 --> 00:09:17.601
Um, well, there's a tool
for you. It's called R.

00:09:17.601 --> 00:09:20.133
And it was invented by
these two guys, um,

00:09:20.133 --> 00:09:23.400
both whose names
begin with R, and

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.534
R is different. It's an open
source tool for statistics

00:09:25.534 --> 00:09:28.467
and data analysis. It was
developed by statisticians

00:09:28.467 --> 00:09:33.234
for statisticians, and, what
it's great at is three things,

00:09:33.234 --> 00:09:37.501
really, um, data manipulation,
statistical analysis,

00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:39.100
and visualization.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.834
And I like to call these things
data munging, data modeling.

00:09:42.834 --> 00:09:46.334
Um, these are really things that
belong together.

00:09:46.334 --> 00:09:50.767
And we use these tools, and we
use this to build hypotheses

00:09:50.767 --> 00:09:53.367
about the world. This is one
such hypothesis.

00:09:53.367 --> 00:09:57.234
Um, Jessica Hagy said that
the more money you have,

00:09:57.234 --> 00:09:59.367
the more free time you've got.

00:09:59.367 --> 00:10:00.901
In fact, when you're broke,
you've got free time,

00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:03.801
when you're rich. I decided to
examine this by looking at

00:10:03.801 --> 00:10:06.167
OECD data for 29 countries.

00:10:06.167 --> 00:10:10.067
I took this data, munged it
with R, and examined whether

00:10:10.067 --> 00:10:12.567
Jessica's hypothesis was right.

00:10:12.567 --> 00:10:16.000
Well, it turns out, um,
she was partially right.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.801
Turns out that, uh,
if you're from Luxemburg,

00:10:18.801 --> 00:10:21.467
um, you're pretty rich and you
do have a lot of free time.

00:10:21.467 --> 00:10:24.133
But, actually, the poor
countries, um, basically

00:10:24.133 --> 00:10:26.734
don't have very much
free time, so, um,

00:10:26.734 --> 00:10:30.100
this is an example of using R
for hypothesis testing.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.801
Um, but there's a lot of
bigger data out there.

00:10:31.801 --> 00:10:35.067
And this is an example of
a gene array that has

00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:37.167
100,000 data points.
This is actually the chip

00:10:37.167 --> 00:10:38.801
I designed in graduate school.

00:10:38.801 --> 00:10:42.200
And we like to find ways to
distill this data down to

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.000
something we can feed our
brains. 

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.567
A visualization that we can
give, and this is what I did

00:10:47.567 --> 00:10:50.033
with R. Um, I took those
100,000 data points and

00:10:50.033 --> 00:10:52.968
created a single visualization
that tells me something about

00:10:52.968 --> 00:10:55.834
the variants on
this particular chip.

00:10:55.834 --> 00:11:00.667
Um, that's great because, uh,
looking at data is not something

00:11:00.667 --> 00:11:02.868
we can just do
like a computer does.

00:11:02.868 --> 00:11:05.534
Another example is, um,
credit card transactions.

00:11:05.534 --> 00:11:07.868
There'll be one million credit
card transactions during

00:11:07.868 --> 00:11:11.133
this presentation, and we can
use this data to predict

00:11:11.133 --> 00:11:13.367
something about what we consume.

00:11:13.367 --> 00:11:17.767
Um, in fact, every time you go
to Amazon or Netflix,

00:11:17.767 --> 00:11:19.901
uh, you see questions
about which products

00:11:19.901 --> 00:11:23.868
are ordered together. Um, we can
use this credit card

00:11:23.868 --> 00:11:26.367
transactional data, in fact I
used it for a particular 

00:11:26.367 --> 00:11:30.534
client of mine, to figure
out, whether or not, uh,

00:11:30.534 --> 00:11:33.267
if you like Google IO,
you're going to love, uh,

00:11:33.267 --> 00:11:35.601
Oscon 2009.

00:11:35.601 --> 00:11:38.667
Click data; there are a billion
clicks that will happen during

00:11:38.667 --> 00:11:41.534
this presentation, but you can
use click data and pull it into

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:44.200
R to make interesting, uh,

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.801
predictions about what people
are doing.

00:11:45.801 --> 00:11:48.734
In fact, the advertising guru
John Wanamaker said

00:11:48.734 --> 00:11:50.834
that half of the money
I spend on advertising

00:11:50.834 --> 00:11:53.234
is wasted, but the problem is,
I don't know which half.

00:11:53.234 --> 00:11:55.601
Well, we can change
this using data.

00:11:55.601 --> 00:11:58.601
Right here, we do an analysis
using Baisian statistics

00:11:58.601 --> 00:12:01.501
to figure out which web ads
are more successful.

00:12:01.501 --> 00:12:03.334
Again, this is done using R.

00:12:03.334 --> 00:12:04.868
But now let's talk about
something really important.

00:12:04.868 --> 00:12:07.300
Pitches. Major league
baseball pitchers.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.367
Major league baseball
has a database

00:12:09.367 --> 00:12:11.067
of over one million pitches

00:12:11.067 --> 00:12:13.434
with their velocity, their
location, and their speed,

00:12:13.434 --> 00:12:14.734
and we can take this data,

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:17.834
and we can build
visual fingerprints for pitches.

00:12:17.834 --> 00:12:20.534
The top here is Cole Hamels,
the bottom in Brandon Webb,

00:12:20.534 --> 00:12:22.567
and I've used this data to look
at the kinds of pitches

00:12:22.567 --> 00:12:24.434
these guys throw.

00:12:24.434 --> 00:12:27.634
Uh, Cole Hamels is a finesse
pitcher, Brandon Webb

00:12:27.634 --> 00:12:31.667
uses change-ups, ways of
deceiving the pitchers.

00:12:31.667 --> 00:12:35.167
And that's great. The truth is
that, what we're moving towards

00:12:35.167 --> 00:12:37.934
is a way to bring
data to the masses.

00:12:37.934 --> 00:12:40.701
Um, and we have actually, uh,
because R is open source

00:12:40.701 --> 00:12:42.400
we can put it into a web page.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.801
Um, we don't have to have it
sitting on our desktop.

00:12:44.801 --> 00:12:46.634
This is a stack I like to call
LAMR.

00:12:46.634 --> 00:12:50.133
Um, if you've got a better name,
please let me know.

00:12:50.133 --> 00:12:52.300
So the reason we want to do this
is because, you know,

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.901
data is out there, it's in the
clouds. Well, there's no reason

00:12:54.901 --> 00:12:58.534
to be bringing all this data to
your desktop, that's just crazy.

00:12:58.534 --> 00:13:01.467
Um, and that's why we need to
think about putting R

00:13:01.467 --> 00:13:05.234
into that stack, because--and
the truth is, that, you know,

00:13:05.234 --> 00:13:08.000
I love coding, it's great, but,
given a choice, we'd rather be

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.901
clicking on applications.
When we're doing data analysis,

00:13:10.901 --> 00:13:13.567
we'd rather be clicking our way
through it, rather than

00:13:13.567 --> 00:13:17.000
coding our way, and putting R in
the stack; using the force of

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.067
open source, we can do that.

00:13:19.067 --> 00:13:21.968
So, in conclusion, uh,
it's an exciting period.

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:24.868
We live in the age of big data.
Uh, may the force of open source

00:13:24.868 --> 00:13:27.133
be with you, and, uh, I hope
you'll check out R.

00:13:27.133 --> 00:13:30.934
Thanks very much.

00:13:30.934 --> 00:13:35.167
- Forrest:
Thank you very much, Mike.

00:13:35.167 --> 00:13:37.901
I consider myself a geek,
I consider most of these talks

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:41.434
to be geek-oriented, and now
we're going to learn from

00:13:41.434 --> 00:13:43.501
one of our speakers how she
grew up to be a geek.

00:13:43.501 --> 00:13:49.767
Please welcome the Elven
cartographer, Pamela Fox.

00:13:49.767 --> 00:13:51.734
- Fox: All right, hey,
I'm Pamela Fox.

00:13:51.734 --> 00:13:54.200
I've been the Google Maps API
Support Engineer for the last

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.267
two years, and a lot of times
people ask me how I got into

00:13:57.267 --> 00:13:59.701
this crazy world of web
development, so I'm going

00:13:59.701 --> 00:14:04.334
to try to boil it all down into
five minutes for you guys.

00:14:04.334 --> 00:14:07.701
So yeah, I'm a geek. Uh, but
I didn't start this fire.

00:14:07.701 --> 00:14:10.834
It's not my fault. It happened
at CalTech, as all good love

00:14:10.834 --> 00:14:14.067
stories do, when two people
infinitely geekier than me,

00:14:14.067 --> 00:14:16.133
you know, fell in love. So,
I want to introduce you

00:14:16.133 --> 00:14:20.534
to my parents, and justify
their geek cred for you.

00:14:20.534 --> 00:14:23.133
Starts with my dad, Geoffrey
Fox. He started in physics

00:14:23.133 --> 00:14:25.267
and then moved to computer
science when he realized

00:14:25.267 --> 00:14:26.868
that he needed
mad CPU cycles

00:14:26.868 --> 00:14:28.968
in order to compute all this
crazy physics shit.

00:14:28.968 --> 00:14:31.000
Back then he was doing stuff
like writing

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.167
the Mathematica forerunner's
kernel with Stephen Wolfram,

00:14:34.167 --> 00:14:36.200
and running the physics
department with Feynman.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.434
Here's my mom, she was my dad's
physics student, ooh la la,

00:14:39.434 --> 00:14:42.234
and, uh, she also does
a lot of space stuff.

00:14:42.234 --> 00:14:45.267
She worked for NASA JPL and made
something called a scatterometer

00:14:45.267 --> 00:14:46.801
which is orbiting space
above our heads and,

00:14:46.801 --> 00:14:51.100
I'm kind of worried that maybe
it's watching me right now.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.033
So they decided to get married
and have babies,

00:14:53.033 --> 00:14:54.734
but they never stopped writing
research papers that had

00:14:54.734 --> 00:14:57.734
ridiculously long titles.

00:14:57.734 --> 00:15:00.100
I never knew that particle decay
could, like, provoke so many

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.567
passionate nights of conception,
and I'm a bit concerned that

00:15:02.567 --> 00:15:06.200
my titles are the dorkiest.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.968
So, we grew up and we were kind
of oblivious to the fact that

00:15:08.968 --> 00:15:11.734
we were different. Right?
We didn't know it was strange

00:15:11.734 --> 00:15:14.200
that around the house instead of
having framed family photos,

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.834
we had portraits
of Richard Feynman

00:15:15.834 --> 00:15:20.701
and framed super
computer chips.

00:15:20.701 --> 00:15:23.634
Uh, we also didn't know it was
kind of weird that we had

00:15:23.634 --> 00:15:27.901
six computers
and just two tiny, little TVs.

00:15:27.901 --> 00:15:29.701
It just made family
communication a lot easier

00:15:29.701 --> 00:15:31.868
because when it was dinner time,
we could just instant message

00:15:31.868 --> 00:15:33.868
upstairs and be like,
"Dad, it's time for dinner.

00:15:33.868 --> 00:15:35.968
Come downstairs." 

00:15:35.968 --> 00:15:38.701
And, uh, speaking of that,
we were also the only people

00:15:38.701 --> 00:15:40.467
in the city
that had a T1 connection

00:15:40.467 --> 00:15:42.300
straight to the university.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.634
To me, this was just
instant popularity, right?

00:15:44.634 --> 00:15:47.734
I had so many new friends who
wanted to come over and look at

00:15:47.734 --> 00:15:51.901
Backstreet Boys websites
and porn.

00:15:51.901 --> 00:15:54.868
So, back then, I was using all
of our computers to use, like,

00:15:54.868 --> 00:15:57.234
awesome old school computer
programs like Carmen San Diego,

00:15:57.234 --> 00:16:00.834
which I now really, really want
to redo using the maps API,

00:16:00.834 --> 00:16:04.467
and also Kid Pix Deluxe, which
is basically Windows Paint

00:16:04.467 --> 00:16:07.467
on crack or LSD or
something really strong.

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:09.634
Uh, but one day it was Mother's
Day and I realized I needed

00:16:09.634 --> 00:16:14.033
a present for my mom, so I
googled or yahooed HTML and

00:16:14.033 --> 00:16:17.834
learnt it and got this MS Word
plugin called Internet Assistant

00:16:17.834 --> 00:16:21.267
and, uh, basically I've never
bought presents since.

00:16:21.267 --> 00:16:24.100
Parents love web pages. So my
dad saw this and decided to

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.501
introduce me to real
programming, which was Perl,

00:16:26.501 --> 00:16:29.501
back then. Uh, so one New Year's
Eve, instead of watching

00:16:29.501 --> 00:16:33.167
fireworks, we sat together and
created my first Perl program

00:16:33.167 --> 00:16:36.067
when the clock struck midnight.
Adorable.

00:16:36.067 --> 00:16:37.734
It was--that's the Mad Libs.

00:16:37.734 --> 00:16:39.033
Uh, so my dad was such
a huge proponent of Java

00:16:39.033 --> 00:16:41.667
back then. He thought it was the
future of the internet.

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:46.701
He still thinks that. And, um,
so he had me learn Java and, uh,

00:16:46.701 --> 00:16:50.167
and run a Java Academy, and this
is actually where I first got

00:16:50.167 --> 00:16:53.033
asked out by my first boyfriend,
with a Java applet.

00:16:53.033 --> 00:16:56.667
I said yeah. Um, so as kids,
we had a lot of freedom,

00:16:56.667 --> 00:16:59.167
but then suddenly my dad became
really strict and he had this

00:16:59.167 --> 00:17:02.734
one rule for me that, no matter
what, I had to program Java

00:17:02.734 --> 00:17:05.767
that week. He wouldn't give me
allowance or let me go out,

00:17:05.767 --> 00:17:07.968
unless I programmed
some Java.

00:17:07.968 --> 00:17:10.434
But I was in high school,
so, yeah,

00:17:10.434 --> 00:17:12.634
I programmed a bit, but there
was just so much else that I

00:17:12.634 --> 00:17:16.234
wanted to do too, so I, I was
class president for four years,

00:17:16.234 --> 00:17:17.567
and laid out the newspaper

00:17:17.567 --> 00:17:21.000
and did volunteerism as well,
and so my dad

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.701
wasn't thrilled by all this
other stuff I was doing.

00:17:23.701 --> 00:17:26.667
And then, afterwards, I went to
USC and I did computer science

00:17:26.667 --> 00:17:28.734
because that was still my,
you know, my core interest.

00:17:28.734 --> 00:17:31.601
But I still pursued other loves
as well, so, linguistics,

00:17:31.601 --> 00:17:36.467
animation, volunteerism, being a
radical hippy, save the world.

00:17:36.467 --> 00:17:38.634
Uh, so my, once again,
Dad wasn't that thrilled,

00:17:38.634 --> 00:17:40.834
but one day he comes
to visit me at USC

00:17:40.834 --> 00:17:42.300
to give a talk about SOAP
web services,

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.501
which looked like gobbledy gook
to me, then.

00:17:44.501 --> 00:17:47.000
And, uh, he looked around and
saw everything I did and said,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
"Hey, you know, maybe it's
actually a good thing

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.968
that you decided to do stuff
other than program."

00:17:51.968 --> 00:17:55.400
So finally I felt pretty good
that I had some validation.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.467
Uh, and then I got into web APIs
and mashups and learned that

00:17:59.467 --> 00:18:02.367
SOAP really is gobbledy gook,
but just in XML form.

00:18:02.367 --> 00:18:07.033
So it's a standard. Uh, and you
can see my dad finally admitted

00:18:07.033 --> 00:18:10.534
that SOAP is just,
it's not cool anymore.

00:18:10.534 --> 00:18:12.501
Uh, so, what about
the rest of my family?

00:18:12.501 --> 00:18:15.234
This is my sister; she's now in
Boston doing web development

00:18:15.234 --> 00:18:17.501
with jQuery. Uh, my brother
logged off Facebook

00:18:17.501 --> 00:18:20.167
before we actually created our
Fox Family Group, so we don't

00:18:20.167 --> 00:18:23.334
actually know what he's doing,
so if you see him, if you could

00:18:23.334 --> 00:18:25.100
say "Hi" and let me know.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.667
Uh, this is my Mum, she's
a scientific programmer now,

00:18:27.667 --> 00:18:31.267
and she's analyzing spectrol
emissions from rocket, uh,

00:18:31.267 --> 00:18:33.767
rocket emissions. So she's
basically a rocket scientist.

00:18:33.767 --> 00:18:36.567
And, uh, she actually visited me
the other day and said they're

00:18:36.567 --> 00:18:38.701
thinking of publishing
their rocket science

00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:41.334
using Amazon EC2
and App Engine.

00:18:41.334 --> 00:18:44.267
And, here is some new spawn
for my dad.

00:18:44.267 --> 00:18:47.634
This is with his new wife, who
was also his physics student.

00:18:47.634 --> 00:18:49.267
Bit of a pattern there.

00:18:49.267 --> 00:18:52.534
And, clearly, he's trying to get
her to learn programming already

00:18:52.534 --> 00:18:55.133
but hopefully he lets her
explore other interests as well.

00:18:55.133 --> 00:18:58.167
She'll probably come up geek
anyway.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.734
- Forrest:
Thank you very much, Pamela.

00:19:07.734 --> 00:19:09.000
In case you just came in,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.901
you're in the middle
of an Ignite session.

00:19:10.901 --> 00:19:13.934
We've got nine speakers.
We just had our third talk.

00:19:13.934 --> 00:19:16.868
Uh, all the talks are the same
in that they're

00:19:16.868 --> 00:19:20.501
five minutes, 20 slides,
15 seconds a slide.

00:19:20.501 --> 00:19:24.267
And the speakers
have no control.

00:19:24.267 --> 00:19:26.133
And our next speaker
is a control freak

00:19:26.133 --> 00:19:28.634
and not used to this.

00:19:28.634 --> 00:19:30.267
Please meet Tim Ferriss.

00:19:30.267 --> 00:19:32.000
He's the author of
"The Four Hour Work Week"

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.300
and he's here to talk
about practical pessimism.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:36.367
- Ferriss: All right, guys,

00:19:36.367 --> 00:19:38.133
this is not meant to be
depressing,

00:19:38.133 --> 00:19:41.968
it's meant to be practical. I
changed my topic, uh, a bit, so,

00:19:41.968 --> 00:19:44.467
uh, hopefully, at least, perhaps
one or two percent of you

00:19:44.467 --> 00:19:48.133
will find this useful.

00:19:48.133 --> 00:19:51.934
Do a little dance.
All right,

00:19:51.934 --> 00:19:55.234
so this is a photograph
of Las Lenas in Argentina,

00:19:55.234 --> 00:19:59.400
where I went skiing with two
close friends, one of whom

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.434
recently died of pancreatic
cancer. He was in his early 30s.

00:20:03.434 --> 00:20:05.567
On the same day I received
an email notifying me

00:20:05.567 --> 00:20:08.434
that the ten-year-old daughter
of the close friend

00:20:08.434 --> 00:20:11.100
had been diagnosed with
inoperable cancer,

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.801
and, uh, this was very recent,
and this catalyzed,

00:20:14.801 --> 00:20:18.634
it produced a profound sense
of urgency in me

00:20:18.634 --> 00:20:22.000
to do bigger and better things
in my life, and to test

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.033
new directions before some
undefined point in the future.

00:20:27.033 --> 00:20:30.434
So I want to talk about the most
effective pair

00:20:30.434 --> 00:20:34.167
of productivity techniques that
I've come across since 2004,

00:20:34.167 --> 00:20:37.834
uh, that have helped me up to
this point, test the uncommon

00:20:37.834 --> 00:20:41.567
despite the fear of ridicule,
criticism,

00:20:41.567 --> 00:20:42.834
failure, and so forth.

00:20:42.834 --> 00:20:45.200
And both techniques,
I cheated a bit with the format,

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.601
some things will repeat, uh,
are borrowed from stoicism,

00:20:48.601 --> 00:20:52.267
which was a school of philosophy
from the Hellenistic period

00:20:52.267 --> 00:20:55.734
used by a lot of the Greco-Roman
educated elite,

00:20:55.734 --> 00:20:58.701
including emperors and military
and statesmen.

00:20:58.701 --> 00:21:03.934
The first is called negative
visualization, and it's all

00:21:03.934 --> 00:21:06.300
related to the basic assumption
that defining your fears,

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:11.300
instead of your goals, is a key
to doing anything uncommon,

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:15.067
anything big. Uh, negative
visualization is,

00:21:15.067 --> 00:21:18.133
what I would call, preparation
in practical pessimism.

00:21:18.133 --> 00:21:22.200
And that is, defining
in excruciating detail

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.534
the worst case scenarios.

00:21:23.534 --> 00:21:25.501
So, as an anecdote, in 2004,

00:21:25.501 --> 00:21:29.634
I was working 14 hours a day,
uh, in my own company,

00:21:29.634 --> 00:21:31.567
trapped in a beast
of my own design,

00:21:31.567 --> 00:21:36.100
and knew that I had to take
a two to four week retreat

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:40.234
to either, uh, streamline the
business and extricate myself,

00:21:40.234 --> 00:21:43.167
or shut it down, because there
were issues with exit options.

00:21:43.167 --> 00:21:46.634
I didn't do that for six months
because I was running

00:21:46.634 --> 00:21:48.467
an endless loop
of what-if scenarios.

00:21:48.467 --> 00:21:52.200
What if I missed a notification
with the IRS?

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:56.634
What if we lost the biggest
customer we have and, therefore,

00:21:56.634 --> 00:21:58.334
had problems A, B, and C?

00:21:58.334 --> 00:22:00.467
Problem is, those fears
weren't actionable,

00:22:00.467 --> 00:22:02.868
just like poorly-defined goals
aren't actionable.

00:22:02.868 --> 00:22:07.000
Then I came across the writings
of Seneca, Lucius Seneca,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.801
who was an advisor to the
emperor in his day, in Rome.

00:22:10.801 --> 00:22:12.300
Also, what you might consider

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.300
the most successful investment
banker and playwright,

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.267
at the time, in Rome.

00:22:16.267 --> 00:22:20.033
And, I performed an exercise
that he suggested,

00:22:20.033 --> 00:22:22.067
which was taking
out a piece of paper,

00:22:22.067 --> 00:22:24.601
in my case an eight and a half
by eleven sheet one evening,

00:22:24.601 --> 00:22:26.200
and detailing,
in the first column,

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.567
all of the terrible things,
the worst case scenarios

00:22:28.567 --> 00:22:30.267
that could happen, if I did
what I was considering,

00:22:30.267 --> 00:22:31.734
which was this retreat.

00:22:31.734 --> 00:22:34.167
For you, it might be a change
of job, it might be

00:22:34.167 --> 00:22:37.734
proposing a new project, it
might be ending a relationship,

00:22:37.734 --> 00:22:38.968
it could be
any number of things.

00:22:38.968 --> 00:22:41.100
All of the negative
things that could happen.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.968
Second column, all of the
things that I could do

00:22:42.968 --> 00:22:45.634
to minimize the likelihood of
those things happening.

00:22:45.634 --> 00:22:49.200
And then the last column were
all the line by line actions

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.467
I could take to get back to
where I was then.

00:22:51.467 --> 00:22:53.767
To reachieve the status quo, so
to speak, maybe getting back

00:22:53.767 --> 00:22:57.000
into the industry that you could
leave to start your own start up

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.701
whatever that might be.

00:22:58.701 --> 00:23:01.868
And, in that instant, I saw that
on a scale from zero to ten,

00:23:01.868 --> 00:23:07.200
ten being most impactful, I was
looking at a unlikely transient

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.968
pain of about two,
and a potential, life-changing,

00:23:10.968 --> 00:23:14.167
permanent change of ten,
and, I took the trip.

00:23:14.167 --> 00:23:17.267
I took the trip, and that's why
the book happened,

00:23:17.267 --> 00:23:20.267
that's why the world
championships in tango happen,

00:23:20.267 --> 00:23:23.367
everything that
brought me to stand here today,

00:23:23.367 --> 00:23:26.200
I can trace back to that one
evening in that one exercise.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.334
So, let's move to practice,
the second piece,

00:23:28.334 --> 00:23:29.501
the second technique

00:23:29.501 --> 00:23:33.067
is rehearsing the worst-case
scenarios.

00:23:33.067 --> 00:23:34.367
Seneca would put it thus,

00:23:34.367 --> 00:23:36.767
"Set aside
a number of days each month,

00:23:36.767 --> 00:23:40.667
"where you are satisfied
with the cheapest and

00:23:40.667 --> 00:23:42.968
"scantiest of fare,
meaning food,

00:23:42.968 --> 00:23:46.200
"the roughest of dress,
all the while asking yourself,

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.200
'Is this the condition
I feared?'"

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.434
What you're doing is exposing
yourself to negative emotions,

00:23:52.434 --> 00:23:57.567
like fear, embarrassment, lack
of finances, so that you're

00:23:57.567 --> 00:24:01.033
inoculated when you later
have to make hard decisions,

00:24:01.033 --> 00:24:05.734
ask for hard things,
or reject refused things,

00:24:05.734 --> 00:24:08.300
uh, so that you can act
despite these emotions.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:12.234
Uh, Cato, who has viewed Seneca
as the perfect Stoic,

00:24:12.234 --> 00:24:17.567
wore darker clothing than his,
uh, expected light purple,

00:24:17.567 --> 00:24:21.167
didn't go with the tunic, he was
very out of style in his day.

00:24:21.167 --> 00:24:24.734
And he did so that he would
learn to be ashamed

00:24:24.734 --> 00:24:26.467
of only the things
that were truly shameful

00:24:26.467 --> 00:24:28.467
and to ignore
the millions of things

00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:31.067
that men would otherwise have
low opinions of.

00:24:31.067 --> 00:24:33.767
Uh, so it's very important that
you practice

00:24:33.767 --> 00:24:35.801
your worst case scenario,
and what you'll find is that

00:24:35.801 --> 00:24:39.601
many of the fears you have
are based on undervaluing

00:24:39.601 --> 00:24:41.300
the things that are
easily attainable.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.400
So, those are two techniques

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.601
that have
resulted in the greatest gains,

00:24:45.601 --> 00:24:48.868
all of the uncommon, all of the
big things I've been able to do,

00:24:48.868 --> 00:24:50.200
and I would encourage you,

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.801
before trying
to define your goals,

00:24:51.801 --> 00:24:53.400
to focus on
defining your fears.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.767
Thank you very much.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:05.200
- Forrest:
Thank you very much, Tim.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.000
Pardon the admin time.

00:25:17.334 --> 00:25:19.501
Our next speaker is going to
talk about something that's

00:25:19.501 --> 00:25:21.601
near and dear, I'm sure,
to many of your hearts,

00:25:21.601 --> 00:25:26.801
and that is scaling.
Please welcome Nitin.

00:25:26.801 --> 00:25:31.133
- Nitin: So this is about the
Twitter flame wars that started

00:25:31.133 --> 00:25:33.968
last year, when Twitter first
had some scaling problems,

00:25:33.968 --> 00:25:37.767
and, uh, it's about a principle
that I derived from listening to

00:25:37.767 --> 00:25:40.033
all of that stuff and, uh,
trying to get underneath

00:25:40.033 --> 00:25:42.467
and trying to find the
fundamental principles

00:25:42.467 --> 00:25:46.501
by first, uh, clearing
your mind, and trying to get

00:25:46.501 --> 00:25:47.734
to the bottom of things,

00:25:47.734 --> 00:25:50.200
and by trying to find
fundamental principles

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:54.234
that are, uh, independent of
technology, uh, well,

00:25:54.234 --> 00:25:56.901
specific technology or specific
languages and so forth.

00:25:56.901 --> 00:25:59.334
And this is what all of that
sounded like to me, because

00:25:59.334 --> 00:26:01.467
these were specific phrases
that were used

00:26:01.467 --> 00:26:03.200
when people were
yelling at each other.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.200
There was a lot of emotion
and things like that.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.834
And, uh, underneath all that,
there was some discussions

00:26:07.834 --> 00:26:10.300
about engineering,
and, uh, at some point,

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.501
I started to get beyond this and
started to hear some stuff that

00:26:13.501 --> 00:26:15.868
had to do with engineering, but
still, there wasn't anything

00:26:15.868 --> 00:26:17.934
there that I could see was
a fundamental principle.

00:26:17.934 --> 00:26:22.300
And I wished I could be like
that dog in that famous cartoon

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.534
where people or somebody's--
people are yelling at the dog

00:26:25.534 --> 00:26:26.667
and the dog is just hearing

00:26:26.667 --> 00:26:28.300
the stuff
that the dog wants to hear.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:31.601
So, for you visual learners,
uh, something here.

00:26:31.601 --> 00:26:34.801
And, uh, again, so focusing down
and trying to distill that to

00:26:34.801 --> 00:26:39.801
fundamental principles, um,
I began to hear something that,

00:26:39.801 --> 00:26:43.000
to the database person, sounded
like, people were talking only

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.367
about what I called
the physical model,

00:26:44.367 --> 00:26:46.033
which is just about
implementation.

00:26:46.033 --> 00:26:48.000
And they weren't talking
too much about design.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.601
Uh, in the database world,
we talk about physical model

00:26:49.601 --> 00:26:50.801
and the logical model,

00:26:50.801 --> 00:26:52.601
which is the abstract
structure of the data.

00:26:52.601 --> 00:26:54.634
And I didn't hear too much
about database design,

00:26:54.634 --> 00:26:56.834
and I didn't hear too much
about, uh, queries and stuff,

00:26:56.834 --> 00:26:58.501
and so, that's what
I'm going to talk about.

00:26:58.501 --> 00:27:00.167
And I'm going to talk less
about, uh,

00:27:00.167 --> 00:27:01.968
all the stuff that was
talked about earlier.

00:27:01.968 --> 00:27:04.501
So, uh, we take a simple query
that, uh,

00:27:04.501 --> 00:27:06.234
happens in two
different cases,

00:27:06.234 --> 00:27:10.267
and during Flickr in 2005, I had
a problem with the servers

00:27:10.267 --> 00:27:12.367
and the servers were crashing
because of the way

00:27:12.367 --> 00:27:13.834
that had to do with groups.

00:27:13.834 --> 00:27:15.267
And, it turns out,
a very similar query

00:27:15.267 --> 00:27:18.634
is a query that was causing
Twitter to crash in 2008,

00:27:18.634 --> 00:27:21.033
and I, uh, extracted
out of what is common

00:27:21.033 --> 00:27:22.400
in both of these queries,

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:26.434
and it turns out that there's
a problem of visibility.

00:27:26.434 --> 00:27:29.701
Uh, there are two people, one
person is, uh, publishing some

00:27:29.701 --> 00:27:33.434
content with some restrictions,
uh, like groups or, uh,

00:27:33.434 --> 00:27:35.434
blocking users
in the case of Twitter,

00:27:35.434 --> 00:27:36.767
and the other user says,

00:27:36.767 --> 00:27:38.534
"What, what can I see?"
And that's the common query

00:27:38.534 --> 00:27:40.968
in all of this, and what causes
a scaling problem

00:27:40.968 --> 00:27:42.133
in all of this queries

00:27:42.133 --> 00:27:45.834
is a self-join
on a million row user table.

00:27:45.834 --> 00:27:48.901
And that's at the core of this
problem, and you don't see this

00:27:48.901 --> 00:27:52.300
in outside social networks,
because, in the enterprise,

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:55.367
you don't have a million row
user tables.

00:27:55.367 --> 00:27:57.300
And, uh, in the enterprise,
you have, uh,

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.667
more hierarchical structures.

00:27:59.667 --> 00:28:00.934
That's what the enterprise
looks like

00:28:00.934 --> 00:28:03.033
and that's what a social network
looks like.

00:28:03.033 --> 00:28:04.767
And you can't really break
it down and partition it,

00:28:04.767 --> 00:28:06.968
and so I called it
"Shard-Nothing."

00:28:06.968 --> 00:28:09.868
And, that's got lots of many to
many relationships,

00:28:09.868 --> 00:28:12.033
that's got a lot of one
to many relationships,

00:28:12.033 --> 00:28:13.634
and so let's get
back to basics

00:28:13.634 --> 00:28:16.100
and do some science and see
what have you got that's good.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:19.367
Uh, so RAM and cores, good.
And query cost,

00:28:19.367 --> 00:28:22.434
lots of users and squared
to the denominator, bad.

00:28:22.434 --> 00:28:27.133
And so, I created a formula that
I call data crunching power.

00:28:27.133 --> 00:28:30.834
And, you divide RAM times core
by n squared, and so you've got

00:28:30.834 --> 00:28:33.734
a lot of good stuff, you've got
a lot of data crunching power.

00:28:33.734 --> 00:28:36.067
If you've got a lot of bad
stuff, well, you know,

00:28:36.067 --> 00:28:37.534
servers are going to crash.

00:28:37.534 --> 00:28:39.300
And so, you're going to say,
so you're going to say

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.367
"Okay, I'm just going to put
a lot of servers on here,

00:28:41.367 --> 00:28:43.567
I'm going to put a lot
of, uh, cores,"

00:28:43.567 --> 00:28:46.167
but you've got a problem.

00:28:46.167 --> 00:28:49.100
And so, you got to stay far away
from that intersection point

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.868
and, uh, you can do that by
trying to keep shifting this

00:28:51.868 --> 00:28:54.133
curve over on the other side by
adding more servers, but you

00:28:54.133 --> 00:28:55.968
can't really use the amount of
data you're dealing with

00:28:55.968 --> 00:28:57.367
by going down.

00:28:57.367 --> 00:29:00.701
And so, I pulled my friend's
timeline from Twitter,

00:29:00.701 --> 00:29:02.634
and put it on my laptop.

00:29:02.634 --> 00:29:04.467
And I said "Let's see what
queries I can do on it

00:29:04.467 --> 00:29:06.667
versus what Twitter
can do for me."

00:29:06.667 --> 00:29:09.200
And so, those are
the numbers from 2008,

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.200
and Twitter had a single 8 core
server with 64G of RAM, 

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.067
or something,
put it into my formula,

00:29:14.067 --> 00:29:15.501
and guess what comes out.

00:29:15.501 --> 00:29:20.067
Look at this stuff on the right.
Uh, my laptop has a 100,000

00:29:20.067 --> 00:29:23.767
times advantage over Twitter
when it's dealing with my data.

00:29:23.767 --> 00:29:26.367
So, clearly not with all of the
data, but just with my data.

00:29:26.367 --> 00:29:28.434
So I can do more stuff
with my data

00:29:28.434 --> 00:29:33.334
than Twitter can do with,
with my data on Twitter.

00:29:33.334 --> 00:29:35.534
Now, of course, Twitter can do
search and they can do trans

00:29:35.534 --> 00:29:39.234
and all of this stuff,
and I can't do that, so...

00:29:39.234 --> 00:29:42.901
So, the principle here is that,
you know, you ought to be

00:29:42.901 --> 00:29:45.901
taking your own data back and,
and, but right now

00:29:45.901 --> 00:29:48.033
you can't shard this, so,

00:29:48.033 --> 00:29:50.767
hidden in here is another
solution which, uh,

00:29:50.767 --> 00:29:53.868
I call "Shard-Everything."
So, you take every user's data

00:29:53.868 --> 00:29:56.200
and you give it to them
to manage on their laptop,

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.334
and all, and then, the vendor

00:29:59.334 --> 00:30:00.934
just does
all of the aggregate stuff

00:30:00.934 --> 00:30:04.367
like search and trans
and all of the stuff that,

00:30:04.367 --> 00:30:06.100
are very simple queries
that can be done

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.834
on data warehouses and stuff
like that.

00:30:07.834 --> 00:30:10.267
And all of that comes out
of a law that I call

00:30:10.267 --> 00:30:13.267
"The Scaling Law of Gravity"
because you can't escape it

00:30:13.267 --> 00:30:16.934
and it's an inverse square law,
but also because my name sounds

00:30:16.934 --> 00:30:20.601
like Newton, and I
did this on an Apple, so...

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.634
- Forrest:
Thank you very much, Nitin.

00:30:28.634 --> 00:30:29.834
Our next speaker asks,

00:30:29.834 --> 00:30:33.400
"Why are we bigoted
about social networks?"

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.300
And, I would argue
that one of the reasons is

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.734
'cause many of them are slow.

00:30:36.734 --> 00:30:38.868
And that might be why we choose
one over the other.

00:30:38.868 --> 00:30:40.734
But I'm sure Kevin
has his own reasons,

00:30:40.734 --> 00:30:44.267
so please let's welcome
Kevin Marks.

00:30:44.267 --> 00:30:46.400
- Marks: Thank you.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.033
This is something I started
noticing a while ago,

00:30:49.033 --> 00:30:51.467
which is that people
are very insular.

00:30:51.467 --> 00:30:55.734
Um, but it manifests itself in
social networks particularly.

00:30:55.734 --> 00:30:58.434
Um, so I picked a few quotes out
of the press that covers this.

00:30:58.434 --> 00:31:01.767
This is Pete Cashmore of
Mashable, um,

00:31:01.767 --> 00:31:03.267
referring to Orkut

00:31:03.267 --> 00:31:05.167
as "Orkut's Brazilian drug
dealers" as a collective noun

00:31:05.167 --> 00:31:06.567
for the Orkut users.

00:31:06.567 --> 00:31:08.868
That, that one surprised me.
I thought "Okay, maybe this is,

00:31:08.868 --> 00:31:11.901
this is just, you
know, xenophobia."

00:31:11.901 --> 00:31:14.067
If you think about,
you know, this is, this is

00:31:14.067 --> 00:31:16.200
Le Monde's view of social
networks and each one

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.667
takes over a different country
and they're obviously

00:31:18.667 --> 00:31:20.834
very nationalistic and
there's sort of a great,

00:31:20.834 --> 00:31:22.300
sort of, imperialist
thing going on here

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.467
where each social network
invades a place

00:31:23.467 --> 00:31:25.501
and takes it over and,
therefore, obviously

00:31:25.501 --> 00:31:27.200
you'd resent ones that have
in other countries.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.033
So that's one thing, and then
Marshall did this last week.

00:31:30.033 --> 00:31:32.801
He said, "MySpace is like
a bratty little sister

00:31:32.801 --> 00:31:34.434
wearing too
little clothing."

00:31:34.434 --> 00:31:37.734
So there's something, there's
something else going on there

00:31:37.734 --> 00:31:39.501
than just,
sort of, xenophobia.

00:31:39.501 --> 00:31:43.801
There's some, is this, you know,
is this, your sister problems?

00:31:43.801 --> 00:31:46.801
Then I read Michael Wolfe.
Now this is really impressive.

00:31:46.801 --> 00:31:49.067
He says, "If you're on MySpace,
you're a cretin.

00:31:49.067 --> 00:31:50.234
"You're a poor cretin.

00:31:50.234 --> 00:31:52.467
"Nobody beyond 8th grade level
of education

00:31:52.467 --> 00:31:55.734
is on MySpace.
It's for backwards people."

00:31:55.734 --> 00:31:58.968
So, there's something stronger
than just little sisters here.

00:31:58.968 --> 00:32:00.734
Um, if you look at the social
networks

00:32:00.734 --> 00:32:03.067
and their growth over time,
they've spread out.

00:32:03.067 --> 00:32:05.901
They started with out
with a few, you know,

00:32:05.901 --> 00:32:07.667
15 years ago,
and they've grown up gradually,

00:32:07.667 --> 00:32:09.267
and there are lots
of different ones,

00:32:09.267 --> 00:32:12.234
and they end up having
different feels to them.

00:32:12.234 --> 00:32:15.934
Um, so, here's one more
from The Times, um,

00:32:15.934 --> 00:32:17.334
he's talking about
Twitter, he says,

00:32:17.334 --> 00:32:19.234
"Typical profile of a follower
is someone young who feels

00:32:19.234 --> 00:32:20.801
"marginalized, empty,
and pointless.

00:32:20.801 --> 00:32:25.801
They don't have an inner life."

00:32:25.801 --> 00:32:29.868
So, it's fear of the other,
is what's going on here.

00:32:29.868 --> 00:32:32.501
This is XKCD's map of social
networks, and it says,

00:32:32.501 --> 00:32:35.367
they're not like countries, or
they're kind of like countries.

00:32:35.367 --> 00:32:38.267
You sort of explore them, um,
they take up space, and you

00:32:38.267 --> 00:32:39.534
kind of know they exist,

00:32:39.534 --> 00:32:40.934
but you've only been
to one or two of them.

00:32:40.934 --> 00:32:43.100
You might visit one of them,
you have friends who live there

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.367
and say
it's a great place to holiday.

00:32:44.367 --> 00:32:46.067
Um, and he summed it
like this, he says,

00:32:46.067 --> 00:32:48.067
"I'm waiting for the day when,
if you tell someone 'I'm from

00:32:48.067 --> 00:32:49.701
"the internet,' instead of
laughing, they just ask

00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:52.467
'well which part?'"

00:32:52.467 --> 00:32:56.100
And that's, I think that's sort
of getting closer to this.

00:32:56.100 --> 00:33:00.701
What happens is we, um,
we only see a different web.

00:33:00.701 --> 00:33:02.634
We each see something different.
We're all looking at our own

00:33:02.634 --> 00:33:05.868
little filter on the web, now.
And, we don't have a shared

00:33:05.868 --> 00:33:08.701
public in the way we thought
we did when all we had was

00:33:08.701 --> 00:33:11.701
newspapers and television and we
could assume that people had

00:33:11.701 --> 00:33:13.968
seen the same thing
as we had done.

00:33:13.968 --> 00:33:17.801
Um, the idea of there
being one public

00:33:17.801 --> 00:33:21.334
and then lots of little
privates is not there anymore.

00:33:21.334 --> 00:33:23.133
What we have is many publics.

00:33:23.133 --> 00:33:27.367
Um, we have, we all have our own
view of the web, um, we can't

00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:29.367
all see the same thing, and if
you look at the social networks

00:33:29.367 --> 00:33:32.367
that are successful, they
reflect this by showing us

00:33:32.367 --> 00:33:34.400
all different views of it. If
you look at Twitter, everyone

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.734
sees something different, and
there are more social networks

00:33:36.734 --> 00:33:38.834
out there than you know. Now,
I thought I knew this field,

00:33:38.834 --> 00:33:41.968
and I keep finding 30 million
user social networks that are

00:33:41.968 --> 00:33:44.734
signing up for OpenSocial that I
hadn't previously heard of.

00:33:44.734 --> 00:33:48.667
Um, so what's happening with the
Le Monde thing is actually

00:33:48.667 --> 00:33:51.000
that these social networks
are growing organically,

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.567
they're spreading through
friendship groups,

00:33:52.567 --> 00:33:54.968
they're growing out, um, people
apply to more of their friends

00:33:54.968 --> 00:33:57.300
and they're not overlapping
much, and then the bump

00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:01.033
into the existing cultural
boundaries that are there.

00:34:01.033 --> 00:34:02.434
Um, and we don't really want

00:34:02.434 --> 00:34:04.667
hundreds
of social network sites.

00:34:04.667 --> 00:34:06.767
None of us want to sign up,
fill in forms,

00:34:06.767 --> 00:34:08.767
for more than a few.

00:34:08.767 --> 00:34:10.501
We really don't want to have to
go through this process

00:34:10.501 --> 00:34:11.834
again and again and again.

00:34:11.834 --> 00:34:17.033
Um, so that's, um,
we want to be able to reuse

00:34:17.033 --> 00:34:18.834
the ones we gotten.
We're starting to see this now.

00:34:18.834 --> 00:34:21.434
In the last few weeks we've
seen, um, FriendFeed let

00:34:21.434 --> 00:34:23.434
you sign up with other
social networks.

00:34:23.434 --> 00:34:25.601
We've got Friend Connect that
lets you do that across

00:34:25.601 --> 00:34:27.934
many social sites so you can
bring the places you've already

00:34:27.934 --> 00:34:29.634
got sets of friends and social
network stuff,

00:34:29.634 --> 00:34:30.868
to the rest of the web.

00:34:30.868 --> 00:34:32.868
We've got a set of open
standards to do this.

00:34:32.868 --> 00:34:35.868
There's starting to be, to show
up in actual real world action.

00:34:35.868 --> 00:34:38.033
Even Facebook is now adopting
this for logging in,

00:34:38.033 --> 00:34:39.234
which surprised me,

00:34:39.234 --> 00:34:42.567
as they don't
let you take any data out.

00:34:42.567 --> 00:34:44.934
Um, but we're extending
the networks across the web

00:34:44.934 --> 00:34:48.934
and we're creating activities
that then flow back from our

00:34:48.934 --> 00:34:52.400
explorations of the web, from
our publics, to our friends in

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.868
the social networks. Um, feeding
the stuff back to them so they

00:34:55.868 --> 00:34:58.033
can share even what we're
seeing, so that we can actually

00:34:58.033 --> 00:35:00.100
connect across the web
in this way.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:04.567
Um, so, the challenge
is always who you trust.

00:35:04.567 --> 00:35:08.067
Douglas Adams warns that
deciding who to trust is

00:35:08.067 --> 00:35:11.801
what a large part of our brains
is for, um, and we can't really

00:35:11.801 --> 00:35:13.067
delegate that
to the computers.

00:35:13.067 --> 00:35:14.834
The computers can't
model this very well.

00:35:14.834 --> 00:35:16.701
But what they can have
is they can have

00:35:16.701 --> 00:35:20.467
a list of people that we know,
um, with photographs and names

00:35:20.467 --> 00:35:22.767
next to them attached to the
information, and then we can use

00:35:22.767 --> 00:35:25.834
our brains to decide
what to trust.

00:35:25.834 --> 00:35:28.234
So, we can use the standards for
the social networking

00:35:28.234 --> 00:35:30.567
to connect
people across the web,

00:35:30.567 --> 00:35:35.100
um, but rely on our own mental
models of whom to trust,

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.334
um, and have people
attach the information

00:35:37.334 --> 00:35:39.868
so that we can filter
the information ourselves,

00:35:39.868 --> 00:35:42.067
through the network of our
friendships across the web

00:35:42.067 --> 00:35:45.100
and hopefully end some of this
bigotry about other people

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:48.901
elsewhere, um, being different
and nasty and strange.

00:35:48.901 --> 00:35:50.834
Thank you.

00:35:54.901 --> 00:35:57.634
- Forrest: Thank you very much,
Kevin, and Kevin is the one

00:35:57.634 --> 00:35:58.968
who arranged for us
to do this today,

00:35:58.968 --> 00:36:01.834
so let's just give
him an extra hand.

00:36:06.767 --> 00:36:09.667
And our next speaker
is going to talk about

00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:11.000
not the needs
of the consumer,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.567
not the needs of the enterprise,
but, instead,

00:36:12.567 --> 00:36:15.033
the needs of NGOs
and developing countries.

00:36:15.033 --> 00:36:18.300
Please welcome Andrew Hatton
on coding against cholera.

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.834
- Hatton: Thank you.

00:36:19.834 --> 00:36:24.234
Hi. This isn't a Google product,
um, so I hope no alarms

00:36:24.234 --> 00:36:25.601
are going to go off here.

00:36:25.601 --> 00:36:27.467
Um, and this is
a bit of a sell, so,

00:36:27.467 --> 00:36:28.901
apologies in advance.

00:36:28.901 --> 00:36:30.734
Um, I'm going to talk to you
this afternoon

00:36:30.734 --> 00:36:32.667
about clever plastic
and cool code,

00:36:32.667 --> 00:36:36.501
or coding against cholera.

00:36:36.501 --> 00:36:40.000
Um, so I worked for Oxfam,
which is an NGO, N/NGO.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.067
Um, now,
I'm not meaning to offend anyone

00:36:43.067 --> 00:36:45.968
with this question, but really I
just want to make the point that

00:36:45.968 --> 00:36:49.767
something that we see as, um,
kind of, treatable and trivial,

00:36:49.767 --> 00:36:52.734
in a sense, actually kills
a lot of people.

00:36:52.734 --> 00:36:55.834
Second leading cause of death
among children under five.

00:36:55.834 --> 00:36:58.667
A major cause of that
is the Cholera bacteria.

00:36:58.667 --> 00:37:00.400
And many of the places
where we work,

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.767
we find that the Cholera
bacteria is there.

00:37:02.767 --> 00:37:06.133
Overcrowded camps,
spreads very, very quickly,

00:37:06.133 --> 00:37:08.267
and it can kill
people very quickly.

00:37:08.267 --> 00:37:10.801
The treatment, however,
is really well known,

00:37:10.801 --> 00:37:13.767
how to handle this. Something
that we call "Watsan,"

00:37:13.767 --> 00:37:16.267
or "Clean Water,
Good Sanitation,"

00:37:16.267 --> 00:37:17.701
and then, of course,

00:37:17.701 --> 00:37:20.767
um, kind of best practice
in terms of hygiene standards.

00:37:20.767 --> 00:37:22.133
So it is kind of
very well established

00:37:22.133 --> 00:37:23.667
how to manage this stuff.

00:37:23.667 --> 00:37:26.567
Now we've got some really good
front line tools in the war

00:37:26.567 --> 00:37:29.667
against, um, disease
like, um, cholera.

00:37:29.667 --> 00:37:32.100
Um, one is, um,
the bucket over here

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.334
which I've been walking
around the conference center,

00:37:34.334 --> 00:37:37.234
trying to promote it in front
of all the video cameras.

00:37:37.234 --> 00:37:38.868
And then
the other was the toilet.

00:37:38.868 --> 00:37:42.367
Now I'm calling this "Bucket
3.0," so we've already made

00:37:42.367 --> 00:37:45.400
a start there on, um, a lot of
the technology companies.

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:49.167
Bucket 1.0, 2.0, 3.0,
and that's the best bucket.

00:37:49.167 --> 00:37:51.234
Award-winning
bucket this is now.

00:37:51.234 --> 00:37:53.133
Um, we recently won
an award with this.

00:37:53.133 --> 00:37:55.567
So some of the kind of key
features with this bucket,

00:37:55.567 --> 00:37:58.601
it's got a good lid, um, it's
got very thick plastic,

00:37:58.601 --> 00:38:02.501
it's UV resistant, so bacteria
and algae won't grow inside,

00:38:02.501 --> 00:38:03.934
and it's got also a tap there,

00:38:03.934 --> 00:38:06.400
so you can measure your
water out very carefully,

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:09.701
and it stacks, so it can be
transported very easily.

00:38:09.701 --> 00:38:11.434
So we're going to write
a quick app,

00:38:11.434 --> 00:38:12.634
and we're
going to get this bucket out

00:38:12.634 --> 00:38:13.934
to somewhere that needs it.

00:38:13.934 --> 00:38:15.834
We work in 72 countries around
the world.

00:38:15.834 --> 00:38:17.667
In our case study now,

00:38:17.667 --> 00:38:19.100
we're going to get it
to the DRC,

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.868
or Democratic Republic
of Congo,

00:38:20.868 --> 00:38:22.968
so that's where we're going to
send our bucket

00:38:22.968 --> 00:38:25.801
and write it up to them
to order that bucket.

00:38:25.801 --> 00:38:28.300
And the Congo recently
came out of conflict.

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.033
Um, there are still up to a
million people living in camps

00:38:31.033 --> 00:38:34.234
for displaced people, so the
kind of conditions where you're

00:38:34.234 --> 00:38:36.567
going to get disease spreading
very, very quickly,

00:38:36.567 --> 00:38:38.701
people are
going to be suffering.

00:38:38.701 --> 00:38:40.434
And one of the key
tentacle challenges

00:38:40.434 --> 00:38:41.701
of the first that we have

00:38:41.701 --> 00:38:44.067
in working somewhere like DRC
is bandwidth.

00:38:44.067 --> 00:38:47.434
Um, light blue is bad,
so Congo is bad.

00:38:47.434 --> 00:38:49.901
Basically, our only option there
is a VSAP connection,

00:38:49.901 --> 00:38:53.434
pretty much. Um, there are some
movements happening

00:38:53.434 --> 00:38:56.400
to make that better, um,
but it's still very poor.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:59.334
Um, so the kind of connection
speeds that we're going to see

00:38:59.334 --> 00:39:02.934
are pretty low.
Um, 450 kilobits per second.

00:39:02.934 --> 00:39:06.601
Obviously much, much slower than
we're used to in the west.

00:39:06.601 --> 00:39:08.501
Um, so that's going
to be a challenge.

00:39:08.501 --> 00:39:09.834
One of the main challenges

00:39:09.834 --> 00:39:11.834
around those types of
connections is latency.

00:39:11.834 --> 00:39:14.667
And I don't know
if anyone here has had a VoIP,

00:39:14.667 --> 00:39:16.601
um, over a really poor
latent connection,

00:39:16.601 --> 00:39:19.334
then you'll kind of
know what that is like.

00:39:19.334 --> 00:39:21.067
And the message will be
distorted,

00:39:21.067 --> 00:39:23.634
although, interestingly, you'll
recognize that line,

00:39:23.634 --> 00:39:26.868
Obama's recent inauguration
speech kind of works

00:39:26.868 --> 00:39:28.868
pretty much however much
you chop that message up,

00:39:28.868 --> 00:39:30.501
which I thought was
quite interesting.

00:39:30.501 --> 00:39:31.834
Um, our approach to the app

00:39:31.834 --> 00:39:33.534
is going to be based on
simplicity,

00:39:33.534 --> 00:39:37.100
very simple work flow,
just a couple of steps,

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:39.434
have an offline option as well,
so an offline client

00:39:39.434 --> 00:39:42.901
and deliver across multiple
clients, so mobile.

00:39:42.901 --> 00:39:44.300
Security, very important,

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.267
different languages we need
to support,

00:39:46.267 --> 00:39:48.200
and, of course, search.

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.167
Good findability for
the data is very important.

00:39:51.167 --> 00:39:53.334
So those things are all going to
basically meet,

00:39:53.334 --> 00:39:55.801
uh, be our
requirements, if you like.

00:39:55.801 --> 00:39:57.234
Um, our approach to training

00:39:57.234 --> 00:39:59.267
is going to almost be like,
kind of, viral.

00:39:59.267 --> 00:40:00.901
We'll train
a couple of people up,

00:40:00.901 --> 00:40:02.467
they'll train a couple
of people up,

00:40:02.467 --> 00:40:04.033
and they'll train
a couple of people up.

00:40:04.033 --> 00:40:06.734
So you kind of spread the
message, basically, quickly

00:40:06.734 --> 00:40:09.000
and cheaply, um, as you can.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.267
So all of these things go into
our sausage machine,

00:40:11.267 --> 00:40:15.267
or the appropriate app engine,
otherwise known as a developer,

00:40:15.267 --> 00:40:18.901
couple of other inputs in there,
might be chocolate and money,

00:40:18.901 --> 00:40:21.300
um, because they like those as
well, and out of the end

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:24.601
you get your sausage, or you
get your appropriate app,

00:40:24.601 --> 00:40:27.234
um, for this
particular scenario.

00:40:27.234 --> 00:40:29.234
So, just summarized,
the appropriate app

00:40:29.234 --> 00:40:32.968
is low bandwidth friendly,
copes with poor latency,

00:40:32.968 --> 00:40:36.767
so not a chatty application,
printer friendly, offline mode,

00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:39.801
secure, multi-lingual,
minimal workflow.

00:40:39.801 --> 00:40:44.467
So, diarrhea kills, but can we
beat it? Yes, we can.

00:40:44.467 --> 00:40:48.501
Basic hygiene goes a long way,
well-designed water carrier,

00:40:48.501 --> 00:40:49.801
and bandwidth is scarce,

00:40:49.801 --> 00:40:51.968
so we're going to design
an appropriate app.

00:40:51.968 --> 00:40:54.801
So, those are the key kind
of things

00:40:54.801 --> 00:40:56.100
that we want to achieve.

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:58.200
Just very quick, there are
some useful links there,

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.868
um, slightly
odd formatting, but just,

00:41:00.868 --> 00:41:04.367
um, kind of illustrate some of
the bandwidth maps, um,

00:41:04.367 --> 00:41:07.167
that kind of show
the bandwidth situation.

00:41:07.167 --> 00:41:10.367
And then maybe just one last
thought, before we go,

00:41:10.367 --> 00:41:13.667
that really is my, um, kind of
conclusion of happiness,

00:41:13.667 --> 00:41:14.901
the one mentioned

00:41:14.901 --> 00:41:17.200
what their conclusion was
of happiness earlier

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.634
but, kind of, um, a humorous,

00:41:18.634 --> 00:41:21.334
uh, making a serious point
with humor.

00:41:21.334 --> 00:41:23.267
Thank you.

00:41:27.133 --> 00:41:28.767
- Forrest:
Thank you very much.

00:41:28.767 --> 00:41:32.834
We've got two more talks and,
in case you've just walked in,

00:41:32.834 --> 00:41:35.000
everybody gets just 20 slides,
15 seconds a slide,

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.434
and they have no control.

00:41:36.434 --> 00:41:39.501
And our next speaker predicted
the future about five years ago

00:41:39.501 --> 00:41:43.834
and he's here to talk about
the short film epic,

00:41:43.834 --> 00:41:46.868
and how to forecast the future
in the future

00:41:46.868 --> 00:41:49.901
for you to do that.

00:41:49.901 --> 00:41:51.634
- Robin: Hi, everybody,
I'm Robin,

00:41:51.634 --> 00:41:53.100
and I'm going to talk about
how to predict the future.

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:56.133
My goal is to give you three
simple tools you can use

00:41:56.133 --> 00:41:58.367
in your life, your work, to sort
of improve the way

00:41:58.367 --> 00:42:00.968
that you think
about what happens next.

00:42:00.968 --> 00:42:03.033
Why am I qualified
to talk about this?

00:42:03.033 --> 00:42:05.434
Uh, I'm not, but to the degree
that anyone is, you know,

00:42:05.434 --> 00:42:07.534
I actually had an experience
predicting the future,

00:42:07.534 --> 00:42:11.767
I made a short movie called
"Epic 2014," back in 2004,

00:42:11.767 --> 00:42:13.701
with a friend of mine
named Matt Thompson.

00:42:13.701 --> 00:42:15.200
It was about
the future of news

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.501
and its core argument
was that the future,

00:42:17.501 --> 00:42:19.968
that future is actually more
in the hands of companies

00:42:19.968 --> 00:42:22.901
like "Googlezon" than it
is the New York Times.

00:42:22.901 --> 00:42:25.934
Googlezon, of course, being
the company that, uh, sort of

00:42:25.934 --> 00:42:29.901
emerged from the merger of
Google and Amazon in 2012.

00:42:29.901 --> 00:42:33.767
So, millions of people actually
watched this video, um, which

00:42:33.767 --> 00:42:37.133
was a lot in the pre-You Tube
days, um, and,

00:42:37.133 --> 00:42:39.934
uh, I'm going to
come back to it.

00:42:39.934 --> 00:42:41.567
Dah dah dah dah dah.

00:42:41.567 --> 00:42:43.033
Got emailed around, got IMed,

00:42:43.033 --> 00:42:44.934
got shown at
conferences like this.

00:42:44.934 --> 00:42:46.100
I'm going to come back to it.

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:48.100
First I want to talk
about tip number one.

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.200
Philip Tetlock, pictured here
in the center,

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.334
is a researcher at
UC Berkeley

00:42:52.334 --> 00:42:54.434
who has done a radical thing
when it comes to the future.

00:42:54.434 --> 00:42:56.200
He has run an experiment.

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:59.868
He's been distributing surveys
to thousands of experts, um,

00:42:59.868 --> 00:43:02.534
people in the military, people
in the academy, asking them

00:43:02.534 --> 00:43:05.467
for qualitative, quantitative,
rather, um,

00:43:05.467 --> 00:43:06.767
predictions about the future.

00:43:06.767 --> 00:43:08.801
He's been doing it
for over 20 years, um,

00:43:08.801 --> 00:43:10.000
and he's discovered something

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.501
about the predictions
and the kind of people

00:43:11.501 --> 00:43:12.934
who make predictions.

00:43:12.934 --> 00:43:14.367
He breaks them down
into two groups,

00:43:14.367 --> 00:43:16.701
these are actually
Isaiah Berlin's categories,

00:43:16.701 --> 00:43:18.267
Hedgehogs and Foxes.

00:43:18.267 --> 00:43:21.334
Now, Hedgehogs are big thinkers,
they're people with big ideas,

00:43:21.334 --> 00:43:23.467
they like big theories,
they're visionaries,

00:43:23.467 --> 00:43:25.267
and Hedgehogs can
change the world,

00:43:25.267 --> 00:43:27.400
but they're really bad
at predicting the future.

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.467
On the other hand, there's a
person who he calls Foxes.

00:43:30.467 --> 00:43:33.400
Foxes actually hate theories,
they hate extrapolating

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:34.734
too much at all.

00:43:34.734 --> 00:43:36.834
They like taking things
on a case by case basis.

00:43:36.834 --> 00:43:38.400
They really like the specifics,

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.934
and they're much better
at predicting the future.

00:43:40.934 --> 00:43:42.534
So, when you think about
the future,

00:43:42.534 --> 00:43:45.334
think about specifics and
listen to foxes, not hedgehogs.

00:43:45.334 --> 00:43:48.167
So, uh, there's a historian
named Neil Ferguson.

00:43:48.167 --> 00:43:50.367
This is number two,
pictured here.

00:43:50.367 --> 00:43:53.434
Um, he actually agrees with
Phil Tetlock on another issue.

00:43:53.434 --> 00:43:55.467
They both think that the
practice of history

00:43:55.467 --> 00:43:58.033
needs to involve something
called "counter-factual."

00:43:58.033 --> 00:44:00.033
Now something funny happens on
the way to the future, 

00:44:00.033 --> 00:44:02.934
it seems all strange and
unpredictable until we get there

00:44:02.934 --> 00:44:05.601
and then it happens and it seems
obvious in retrospect.

00:44:05.601 --> 00:44:06.801
This is a huge fallacy.

00:44:06.801 --> 00:44:09.000
Uh, the practice of
counter-factual says,

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.934
"Let's take all of our smarts,
all of the research and rigor

00:44:11.934 --> 00:44:13.267
"that we apply to history

00:44:13.267 --> 00:44:14.968
"and use it to think
about all the things

00:44:14.968 --> 00:44:16.367
that could have happened."

00:44:16.367 --> 00:44:18.400
Uh, why is this
the Google IO Conference?

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.434
Why isn't it the Yahoo
IO Conference?

00:44:20.434 --> 00:44:22.367
Why isn't it
the Googlezon IO Conference?

00:44:22.367 --> 00:44:25.033
Why isn't it the 
New York Times IO Conference?

00:44:25.033 --> 00:44:28.200
Um, all of these sort of carry
interesting things.

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.868
If we can understand those
possible futures,

00:44:29.868 --> 00:44:31.834
we can understand ourselves
better.

00:44:31.834 --> 00:44:34.000
This begins to sound a lot like
science fiction,

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000
and this is tip number 3.
Read science fiction.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.801
Now you're not going to read it
because it's right, no, 

00:44:38.801 --> 00:44:41.267
science fiction is totally
written by hedgehogs.

00:44:41.267 --> 00:44:42.567
But, the important thing

00:44:42.567 --> 00:44:45.400
is that lots of people
also read science fiction.

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.400
Uh, designers, developers,
inventors, 

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.634
entrepreneurs, the people who
are going to make the future,

00:44:49.634 --> 00:44:50.901
are reading this stuff.

00:44:50.901 --> 00:44:52.934
It's like
a slow-ticking time bomb.

00:44:52.934 --> 00:44:54.033
Uh, here's two books

00:44:54.033 --> 00:44:55.434
that I recommend
you should read right now.

00:44:55.434 --> 00:44:59.634
"Daemon" by Daniel Suarez
and "Feed" by M.T. Anderson.

00:44:59.634 --> 00:45:03.067
Now I have a confession to make.
Going back to "Epic 2014,"

00:45:03.067 --> 00:45:05.701
uh, Matt Thompson and I did not
make a movie in the first place.

00:45:05.701 --> 00:45:08.467
We made a slide show, and it was
very rigorous.

00:45:08.467 --> 00:45:10.767
Um, it had, you know, numbers
and charts and graphs

00:45:10.767 --> 00:45:12.501
and it sort of made
this argument.

00:45:12.501 --> 00:45:14.067
It was the same argument,
it was the same prediction

00:45:14.067 --> 00:45:16.767
about the future,
but it was totally boring.

00:45:16.767 --> 00:45:17.901
People couldn't
get through it.

00:45:17.901 --> 00:45:19.667
It definitely was not going to
go viral.

00:45:19.667 --> 00:45:21.167
This is an important insight.

00:45:21.167 --> 00:45:23.167
Stories are powerful,
and I actually think

00:45:23.167 --> 00:45:25.501
this is an important theme
for a group like this.

00:45:25.501 --> 00:45:28.501
Uh, you know, people who prize
numbers, who like rigor,

00:45:28.501 --> 00:45:30.767
who like quantitative stuff,
tend to be really bad

00:45:30.767 --> 00:45:31.868
at telling stories.

00:45:31.868 --> 00:45:33.467
Makes me think of somebody
like this.

00:45:33.467 --> 00:45:35.167
This is Al Gore.
He's actually my boss.

00:45:35.167 --> 00:45:37.234
He cofounded Current,
the company where I work.

00:45:37.234 --> 00:45:39.367
He's been talking about
the future for a long time,

00:45:39.367 --> 00:45:41.400
talking about the planet,
the environment,

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.901
what's going to happen, not
always the best results.

00:45:43.901 --> 00:45:47.133
It wasn't until he wrapped those
predictions up in a story,

00:45:47.133 --> 00:45:50.701
a really scary story about
what's going to happen

00:45:50.701 --> 00:45:52.200
that things actually
started to change.

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.834
You could say that this was
really just the right prediction

00:45:53.834 --> 00:45:55.200
at the right time,

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.901
I think the fact that
it's a story is important.

00:45:56.901 --> 00:45:58.234
When you tell a good story,

00:45:58.234 --> 00:46:00.334
history can sometimes bend
around it.

00:46:00.334 --> 00:46:04.033
So coming back to finish up
the story of "Epic 2014,"

00:46:04.033 --> 00:46:05.300
about a year
after we made it,

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.334
there was this article
in the "Financial Times."

00:46:07.334 --> 00:46:08.334
Um, it was
about Rupert Murdoch

00:46:08.334 --> 00:46:09.801
and how Rupert Murdoch

00:46:09.801 --> 00:46:12.534
was completely changing the
strategy at News Corporation,

00:46:12.534 --> 00:46:14.501
because they realized they had
missed the boat on the internet.

00:46:14.501 --> 00:46:16.501
Couple 'graphs
down there is this line,

00:46:16.501 --> 00:46:19.367
"Mr. Murdoch is understood to
have seen the film

00:46:19.367 --> 00:46:22.133
and taken note."

00:46:22.133 --> 00:46:27.100
We were like "What?" So, to sum
up, number one, when you're

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:30.501
thinking about the future,
listen to foxes, not hedgehogs.

00:46:30.501 --> 00:46:33.734
Um, you should prize specifics
over grand theories.

00:46:33.734 --> 00:46:35.534
Number two,
think counterfactually.

00:46:35.534 --> 00:46:39.968
Keep alive that question "How
else might things have been?"

00:46:39.968 --> 00:46:42.934
Number three, read science
fiction, not because it's right,

00:46:42.934 --> 00:46:44.868
but because everybody else
is reading it too,

00:46:44.868 --> 00:46:46.200
and here's the trick,

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:48.534
I actually think the best way
to predict the future

00:46:48.534 --> 00:46:51.467
is to predict the future
and tell a story about it.

00:46:51.467 --> 00:46:54.734
A really compelling, convincing,
passionate, scary,

00:46:54.734 --> 00:46:57.868
exciting story, other people
will have to pay attention,

00:46:57.868 --> 00:46:59.200
and then, who knows?

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:00.667
That might become the future
because,

00:47:00.667 --> 00:47:03.634
you never know
who's paying attention.

00:47:08.734 --> 00:47:11.734
- Forrest:
Thank you very much, Robin.

00:47:11.734 --> 00:47:13.834
And we've got
just one more talk,

00:47:13.834 --> 00:47:16.467
and she's going to tell you
the story of how to be awesome.

00:47:16.467 --> 00:47:19.501
Please welcome Kathy Sierra.

00:47:21.567 --> 00:47:25.434
- Sierra: So, if we want to
create passionate users,

00:47:25.434 --> 00:47:27.334
we have to help them
get better.

00:47:27.334 --> 00:47:31.334
So nobody's passionate
about things they suck at,

00:47:31.334 --> 00:47:33.501
and if we can help them
have more resolution,

00:47:33.501 --> 00:47:36.400
richer, deeper, better
experiences, we have a chance

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.634
of getting them passionate.

00:47:37.634 --> 00:47:39.300
But I know there are a whole
bunch of you here

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:43.000
that still have your cameras
set to automatic program mode,

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.100
even though you have shutter
speed and aperture control,

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:49.767
so if we could unlock that door
for our users,

00:47:49.767 --> 00:47:53.133
and help them be awesome,
what would that mean to them?

00:47:53.133 --> 00:47:55.534
Well, uh, if you read "Outliers"
by Malcolm Gladwell,

00:47:55.534 --> 00:47:57.334
you've seen that 10,000 hours
number,

00:47:57.334 --> 00:48:00.367
it takes 10,000 hours to get
really good at something,

00:48:00.367 --> 00:48:02.400
that's really depressing.

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.367
So one way we can minimize that

00:48:04.367 --> 00:48:07.200
is to be practicing
all of the time.

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.868
So I'm trying to get
really good at horses.

00:48:08.868 --> 00:48:11.267
That's my desk chair.

00:48:11.267 --> 00:48:13.167
That's an actual saddle,
so I'm practicing.

00:48:13.167 --> 00:48:17.734
I'm getting in my 10,000 hours
while working on the computer.

00:48:17.734 --> 00:48:20.133
Uh, I know, some people are kind
of creeped out by that,

00:48:20.133 --> 00:48:23.100
but it, it's actually awesome.

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.033
Another way
we can help our users

00:48:25.033 --> 00:48:27.434
to cut down
that 10,000-hour time frame

00:48:27.434 --> 00:48:29.634
is to give them patterns.

00:48:29.634 --> 00:48:31.767
Experts, people who are awesome
at something,

00:48:31.767 --> 00:48:35.334
have patterns, they use rules,
they have an 80/20.

00:48:35.334 --> 00:48:38.534
Give people what's the one thing
you can do to be amazing.

00:48:38.534 --> 00:48:41.667
Another one is get better gear.
Spend the money.

00:48:41.667 --> 00:48:43.133
And offer better gear

00:48:43.133 --> 00:48:44.567
and higher-end equipment
to your users,

00:48:44.567 --> 00:48:46.834
it just works, so you think
that if you get a big monitor

00:48:46.834 --> 00:48:50.267
and a bunch of displays, you
think you'll be a hacker god,

00:48:50.267 --> 00:48:51.467
if you do that.

00:48:51.467 --> 00:48:54.267
The problem is,
when we have better equipment,

00:48:54.267 --> 00:48:57.234
everyone else who has to pay for
it, this is what they see

00:48:57.234 --> 00:48:58.868
and someone at Google has to
calculate the odds

00:48:58.868 --> 00:49:01.200
because this slide was in the
last person's presentation,

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:04.734
but anyway, you will see more
pixels so give people away

00:49:04.734 --> 00:49:08.334
to justify the better gear
that you're offering them.

00:49:08.334 --> 00:49:11.968
Now, motivation is
also really important.

00:49:11.968 --> 00:49:14.267
I mean, I think now today's
competitive advantage

00:49:14.267 --> 00:49:18.701
is just making the product that
people will actually use.

00:49:18.701 --> 00:49:20.534
Your treadmill is not in the
corner gathering dust

00:49:20.534 --> 00:49:21.801
because you don't use it.

00:49:21.801 --> 00:49:24.501
You don't use it
because it's in the corner.

00:49:24.501 --> 00:49:26.734
So, you know, make the right
thing easy for people

00:49:26.734 --> 00:49:28.467
and the wrong thing hard.

00:49:28.467 --> 00:49:30.767
So now let's look
at the anti-patterns,

00:49:30.767 --> 00:49:33.734
things that we do that, that
really help create our users

00:49:33.734 --> 00:49:36.601
sucking as opposed
to getting better.

00:49:36.601 --> 00:49:38.767
And, uh, I don't know
why that's a bunny bath.

00:49:38.767 --> 00:49:40.767
Anyway, this is the single
biggest problem

00:49:40.767 --> 00:49:42.133
that most of us have is,

00:49:42.133 --> 00:49:44.434
we focus on the tool,
not the thing

00:49:44.434 --> 00:49:46.300
our users
want to do with the tool.

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:48.767
That's the biggest block to
getting people interested

00:49:48.767 --> 00:49:51.067
and passionate
and engaged and,

00:49:51.067 --> 00:49:52.400
especially in this case,
you know,

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.734
we treat people really well
before they buy

00:49:54.734 --> 00:49:56.834
and then afterwards,
we treat them poorly.

00:49:56.834 --> 00:50:00.501
This is also the reason people
don't want to upgrade.

00:50:00.501 --> 00:50:03.567
If we really want to help people
upgrade, which they're going to

00:50:03.567 --> 00:50:04.834
need to do to go forward,

00:50:04.834 --> 00:50:07.501
we have to accept
that it's a loss for them,

00:50:07.501 --> 00:50:10.234
it's a hit to their self-esteem
every time they upgrade

00:50:10.234 --> 00:50:11.834
and we just
tell them to get over it.

00:50:11.834 --> 00:50:14.834
This is the other reason that
people don't want to upgrade

00:50:14.834 --> 00:50:15.968
and move forward.

00:50:15.968 --> 00:50:18.567
Because we write the FAQs
and the help

00:50:18.567 --> 00:50:22.367
and the manuals as though they
were intellectually curious,

00:50:22.367 --> 00:50:23.701
and using a tablet PC.

00:50:23.701 --> 00:50:27.067
But, the real reason is because
they're consulting help

00:50:27.067 --> 00:50:29.067
because they are having
a horrible experience.

00:50:29.067 --> 00:50:31.100
But this is not the
right answer either.

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:33.367
You don't feel awesome because
you're not awesome

00:50:33.367 --> 00:50:34.634
if you master something

00:50:34.634 --> 00:50:36.534
because a three-year-old
could master it.

00:50:36.534 --> 00:50:39.334
So don't let the ease-of-use
police step in

00:50:39.334 --> 00:50:41.601
and dumb something down,
that's not an answer.

00:50:41.601 --> 00:50:45.000
This is also a really,
really bad solution,

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.367
which is to hire
a social media consultant,

00:50:48.367 --> 00:50:50.667
and some of my best friends are
social media consultants,

00:50:50.667 --> 00:50:53.200
but it is out of control
because it's

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:55.534
completely focusing
in the wrong direction.

00:50:55.534 --> 00:50:59.133
We are, well, this is the social
media consultant fantasy.

00:50:59.133 --> 00:51:02.801
The goal is to get users
to love us.

00:51:02.801 --> 00:51:04.501
That's such
a ridiculously bad goal.

00:51:04.501 --> 00:51:06.300
Nobody is awesome because
they love you

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:07.634
because you are nice.

00:51:07.634 --> 00:51:10.501
So, you know, someone tweeted,
uh, that, you know,

00:51:10.501 --> 00:51:13.901
the holy grail is if your users
want to party with you.

00:51:13.901 --> 00:51:16.100
That's a bad idea. You want your
users to party

00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:19.133
because of you
without you.

00:51:19.133 --> 00:51:21.601
So, put users with other users,

00:51:21.601 --> 00:51:23.667
not connecting
users to the company.

00:51:23.667 --> 00:51:27.300
This is a fantasy also.
This is not going to happen.

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:31.934
Great use of social media is to
find out what role we play

00:51:31.934 --> 00:51:35.300
in our users' lives and what
role our competitors play

00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:36.567
in our users' lives.

00:51:36.567 --> 00:51:38.634
Use social media to look
for pain and pleasure

00:51:38.634 --> 00:51:41.000
and those are the things
that we can tweak and exploit

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.367
to help them be awesome.

00:51:42.367 --> 00:51:43.901
Another thing we can do,
well,

00:51:43.901 --> 00:51:46.200
another anti-pattern is that,

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.901
by trying
to be really competitive

00:51:48.901 --> 00:51:52.567
and focusing on our competitors,
we end up being uncompetitive

00:51:52.567 --> 00:51:55.067
because we end up with
things like featuritis.

00:51:55.067 --> 00:51:57.968
We start building the very
things that harm users.

00:51:57.968 --> 00:51:59.234
The best thing we can do,

00:51:59.234 --> 00:52:01.133
and this is the greatness
of social media,

00:52:01.133 --> 00:52:05.000
look at what the bigger,
cooler thing is, the world

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000
that our product
and our competitor's products

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.634
exist in, that bigger,
cooler thing,

00:52:09.634 --> 00:52:11.467
that's what people want
to kick ass at.

00:52:11.467 --> 00:52:13.801
Not your tool.
So blog about that.

00:52:13.801 --> 00:52:17.100
You know, Tweet about that.
Use social media about that.

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:21.067
Uh, in the social marketing
world, you hear the word WOM.

00:52:21.067 --> 00:52:24.367
Word Of Mouth. That's supposed
to be the holy grail.

00:52:24.367 --> 00:52:27.000
But really there's something
much better than that,

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.200
that most of us are able
to do, and that's WOFO.

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:35.400
If your users are so good,
you get Word Of F-ing Obvious.

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:39.601
And you all have the chance to
do that. Thank you.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.200
- Forrest:
Thank you very much, Kathy.

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:50.634
That concludes Ignite.
Thanks for joining.

00:52:50.634 --> 00:52:52.033
All the speakers,

00:52:52.033 --> 00:52:53.834
want to just stand up and get
another round of applause?

00:52:53.834 --> 00:52:56.033
Soak it up?

00:53:02.501 --> 00:53:03.934
And I'm Brady Forrest.

00:53:03.934 --> 00:53:06.567
If you want to start an Ignite
in your town, it's easy.

00:53:06.567 --> 00:53:09.501
And just ping me,
and I'll tell you how.
