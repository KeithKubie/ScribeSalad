00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:06.930
So, the amount of household debt and even
more recently of student debt in the U.S.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:14.099
is something that is really troublesome and
it reflects the very large rise in tuition

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.890
in the U.S. a very large inequality in access
to education.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.690
And I think if we really want to promote more
equal opportunity and redistribute chances

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.450
in access to education we should do something
about student debt.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:37.380
And it's not possible to have such a large
group of the population entering the labor

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.320
force with such a big debt behind them.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.350
This exemplifies a particular problem with
inequality in the United States, which is

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.920
very high inequality and access to higher
education.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:01.170
So in other countries in the developed world
you don't have such massive student debt because

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.510
you have more public support to higher education.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:16.110
And I think the plan that was proposed earlier
this year in 2015 by President Obama to increase

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.380
public funding to public universities and
community college is exactly justified.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:31.660
This is really the key for higher growth in
the future and also for a more equitable growth.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.660
There's one statistic, which I give in my
book, which is a bit frightening, which is

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:46.170
that if you look at the average income of
the parents of Harvard University graduate

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:54.090
students right now what you get is the equivalent
of the average income of the top two percent

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.170
of the U.S. distribution of family income.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.590
So this doesn't mean that there's nobody from
below the top two percent that gets into Harvard,

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.560
but this means something very precise, which
is that people from below the top two that

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.120
make it to Harvard are sufficiently few.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.550
And the people who come from the top two come
from sufficiently high within the top two,

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.770
that the overall average is as if all students
had been picked from within the top two percent

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.340
of the distribution of U.S. family income.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.560
So this is an example which shows that you
have the official discourse about meritocracy,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.270
equal opportunity and mobility, and then you
have the reality.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.670
And the gap between the two can be quite troublesome.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.810
So this is like you have a problem like this
and there's a lot of hypocrisy about meritocracy

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.650
in every country, not only in the U.S., but
there is evidence suggesting that this has

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.790
become particularly extreme in the United
States.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.180
And of course, student debt at to the other
extreme of the distribution is the other side

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.700
of the coin.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:13.550
So this is a situation that is very troublesome
and should rank very highly in the policy

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.830
agenda in the future in the U.S.
