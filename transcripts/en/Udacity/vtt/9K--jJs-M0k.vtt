00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.608
Now finally, since we have these last two linear factors, we can write f of x

00:00:03.608 --> 00:00:07.262
as the product of four linear factors, which we knew it would have because it

00:00:07.262 --> 00:00:13.596
is a function of degree 4. So now we can write that f of x equals x times 2 x

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:19.984
minus 1 times x minus 3 minus 2 i times x minus 3 plus 2 i. This is really

00:00:19.984 --> 00:00:23.826
awesome. We've made so much progress since we started off. Now I have one final

00:00:23.826 --> 00:00:27.390
question for you, and it's really what we've been working toward for the entire

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.224
problem. What are all the zeros of f of x? We already know two of them from a

00:00:33.224 --> 00:00:37.665
couple of quizzes ago, 3 plus 2 i, and 3 minus 2 i. And so I'd just like you to

00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:40.975
fill in the last two. Check in with the linear factors we haven't used yet to

00:00:40.975 --> 00:00:44.443
find zeros, but at least haven't used in this quiz yet.
