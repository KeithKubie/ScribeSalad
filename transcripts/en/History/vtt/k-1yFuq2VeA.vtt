00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.460
NARRATOR: According to NASA,
the colonization of Mars

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.120
will begin not with
humans, but with robots

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.290
sent ahead to
construct habitats,

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.000
rovers, and life support units.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.670
Food and supplies
will be sent next,

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.170
and then, finally,
the first humans

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.330
will arrive, ready to start
their new lives as Martians.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.830
FEMALE SPEAKER: The
Martian environment

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.580
is very different to earth.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.580
It has 38% of the
gravity of earth.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.080
The daily temperature
fluctuations are very extreme.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.750
For instance, if you're near
the equator on a summer day,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.080
it can be as warm as
70 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.420
But at night, the temperatures
could drop down to minus 100

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.080
degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.580
So there's a lot
of things out there

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.580
that's getting us,
including radiation as well,

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.380
and the dust storms.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.580
PAUL DAVIES: The atmosphere
is incredibly thin, about 1%

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.880
that of Earth.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.290
There's no breathable
oxygen there.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.960
The radiation is
very high as well.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.290
And so, astronauts
there are faced

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.420
with multiple difficulties.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.790
A Martian day is
almost like earth's.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.710
It's 24 hours and 39 minutes,
so it's just a little

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.620
bit longer than a day on earth.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.120
But a Martian year is two
years, because Mars' orbit

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.710
is twice the size of Earth's.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.620
NARRATOR: Because of
the day/night cycle

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.880
and the thin atmosphere, Mars
is the only nearby planet where

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.290
large scale greenhouses
lit by natural sunlight

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.120
can be utilized.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.960
These structures will
allow the colonizers

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.330
to grow their own food on
the cold and barren planet.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.670
Obviously, you can't
rely on food parcels

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.420
from home coming
every two years.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.500
You're going to have
to grow your own food.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.670
A lot of people think, well,
that's pretty straightforward.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.920
You just take a few potatoes
and cabbages, and away you go.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.830
You can do farming on Mars.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.250
Well now, research that's
been done at Arizona State

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.250
University suggests
that when you

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.330
send microorganisms into
space, they behave differently.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.580
They don't like it up there.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.290
Hundreds if not thousands of
PhD theses in the last 20 years

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.790
have been written about
how to grow food on Mars.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.790
And there was a very
interesting experiment

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.540
done a couple of
years ago in Holland,

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.170
where NASA provided
the Dutch with what

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.710
they thought was almost
an identical copy

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.290
of the soil of Mars.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.960
And the Dutch
planted 4,200 seeds

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.210
in it of all kinds of
different vegetables,

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.500
and every single
seed germinated.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.000
Some things did better
than others, like carrots

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.670
grew very well there.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.710
There is no question that
we will be able to grow food

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.790
on Mars, but it's going
to be hundreds of years

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.040
before we grow enough
food on Mars that we can

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.880
survive from the food we grow.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.210
The only way we're going
to be able to do that

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.500
is to terraform the planet
so that it becomes much more

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.380
earth-like so that
we can grow crops

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.750
on the surface of the planet.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.080
NARRATOR: In recent
years, scientists

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.750
have proposed various
methods to terraform Mars,

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.420
deliberately altering it
to be more earth-like.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.540
Most focus on melting
the ice at the poles

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.710
to release carbon dioxide into
the atmosphere to thicken it.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.250
MALE SPEAKER: If we heat
up the poles on Mars,

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.080
that causes a significant
temperature rise on Mars,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.210
and we start having
flowing water on Mars,

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.000
especially around the equator.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.580
Then water itself will go
into the atmosphere, which

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.420
is another greenhouse gas,
and we will warm up Mars,

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.880
and we will be able to plant
crops on the surface of Mars.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.580
But that's a ways away.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.580
That's probably at
least 300 years away.
