00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.470
Now let's find the sum of squares for within subject variability. This one's a

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.670
little harder. We take the sum of each value and subtract the respective mean.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.104
Then square it. Then we add them all together. This is a little trickier. You

00:00:16.104 --> 00:00:22.162
need to calculate each deviation of each value from the respected mean. Square

00:00:22.162 --> 00:00:27.540
them and then add them all up. Do the same for every sample. And then add up

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.014
each sum of squares. You're welcome to enter your calculations here, but that

00:00:33.014 --> 00:00:37.810
part won't be graded. Only the complete sum of squares for within groups will

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.130
be graded.
