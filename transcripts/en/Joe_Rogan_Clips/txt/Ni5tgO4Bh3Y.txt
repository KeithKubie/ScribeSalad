Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. Hey, wait, that's this. This reminds me of when you talk about that island, that private island. Do you know Sentinel Sentinel's sensible? Our Central Island? Yeah. Planes still fly over that or no? Are they not allowed to tell about it as a restricted airspace? I don't think it's restricted. No, but you can't land there and you can't circle. Right. You can't visit. India owns it. Right. It doesn't, it doesn't. India control leaves and it's like 10 mile radius. I saw a thing online that said a boat crash there and you could still see on Google images the remnants of the boat. Yeah. They came for the people in the boat too. And the helicopters got them off the boat. Right as the people were like pulling up and Oh, so they lit raps and shit. Yeah. Fuck yeah, they, they live. But those, the villages were common for them.

Speaker 1:          00:43          Wow. Yeah. Can you imagine stumbling across a village they've been fucked with sometime in the past? You know that a commander Maurice Vidal Portman. Yeah. Guy. Yeah. Shout out to a respectable law on, uh, Twitter. He has a, a, a giant thread about it. It may be pinned on the top of his Twitter page, but explaining, uh, like one of the reasons why those people were so hostile. Right. And it has to do with this British explorer who was really kinky and, uh, he went there to fuck. Who knows, we want to fuck island as what he did, but people got sick because of them. You know, this, I had this Guy Graham Hancock on yeah. And he was talking to me about, um, uh, all the different shit that they're finding in the Amazon and in South America, and that they used to be 20 million people that live in the Amazon and they died off because of sickness.

Speaker 1:          01:36          They were visited most apparently Europeans when they came in like the 15 hundreds, they would tell these incredible stories about these huge civilizations in the Amazon. But then when explorers came back 200 years later, there was nothing there. And they were like, this is crazy. They do. They lied. They must've lied, but it turns out they didn't lie. What happened was smallpox ran through the fucking jungle. And white people. Everybody. We did it and then these, the jungle just overtook the cities and now they're finding these cities with something called Lidar. They use these planes and they circle over this area or helicopters or whatever the fuck they do and they shoot this shit down this lidar. It's like laser radar and it gives you a detailed image of what's below the surface and what's there. And it shows them all these crazy structures, all these like uh, like roadways and irrigation systems and circles inside of a square.

Speaker 1:          02:30          Like it was villages and cities and the millions of people probably live there. I couldn't look at it. That's all stuff. They're finding that yeah. And all of it was swallowed up by the jungle. They think within like a hundred years just vanished in the jungle. Oh cause it's so, so lush and tropical down there. Dude. It was one of the most amazing podcasts I've ever done to listen in to that guy. Tell this story right after this one though. No, you are the best. You're the best. He's a, this is kind of, well this is like, this is like the of Atlantis, right? Like when they started finding, you started finding more and more land under in this they found traces of five drugs including dime methyl trip to mean on a thousand year old South American ritual. DMT Baby. That's like proof positive. Um, evidence that it least 1000 years ago they were using Iowasca.

Speaker 1:          03:20          Wow. This was the drug pouch that was made from Fox snouts. That sounds so crazy. It literally look, when you see it, it looks like they used everything and the first reason it looks really nice and knows, I wonder why they do that with a Fox. It's probably like some cleverness somehow that that's what a shaman, that's like literally what a shaman is supposed to. That's what the, the, the definition is supposed to be in certain cultures, certain cultures. It's a clever fellow. That's who the chef, the Shawman is. Okay. That kind makes sense. They are just clever fellows. But I mean imagine that. Like he takes a Fox, that clever little fucker. I'm going to take his face. I want to split my drugs in his face. Only a person would think to do something. So creepy trucks. No exact chipmunk cheeks. Yeah, right. That would be a good move. Yeah. A little pouch. Sugar pouches at hangs for your belt. It's just chipmunk cheeks while your coins in it.
