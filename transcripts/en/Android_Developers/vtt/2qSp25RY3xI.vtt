00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.240
RETO MEIER: Hi there.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:06.930
My name is Reto Meier.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.950
IAN NI-LEWIS: And I'm
Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.230
RETO MEIER: This week, we find
out what's up with SMS

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.220
replacement app, WhatsApp
Messenger.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.680
IAN NI-LEWIS: We take a bite out
of the Group Me 4 beta, to

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.480
see if we like the new flavor.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.480
RETO MEIER: Turns out it tastes
a lot less like fruit

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.070
than it used to.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.320
IAN NI-LEWIS: And a lot
more like ice cream.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.310
RETO MEIER: And we discover that
instant messaging classic

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.560
Trillian has not only survived
the apocalyptic instant

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.600
messaging wars of the early
2000s, but has risen from the

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.830
ashes to flourish in
the mobile space.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:32.940
IAN NI-LEWIS: All that
and more, this

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.930
week on The App Clinic.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.680
RETO MEIER: This week, we're
looking at instant messaging

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.370
apps, which turns out to be a
critical part of mine and

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.370
Ian's teamwork flow.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.740
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.450
What you may not realize is
Reto and I never speak

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.340
directly to one another.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.710
IAN NI-LEWIS: In fact,
we don't even ever

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.780
be in the same room.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.900
We're actually on opposite
sides of

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.080
building 44 right now.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.590
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's right.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.440
Reto's not here at all.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.390
So that means IM apps
are critical for us

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.370
to get things done.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.010
RETO MEIER: Let's start by
looking at WhatsApp.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.610
IAN NI-LEWIS: WhatsApp Messenger
was by far our most

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.830
popular candidate this
week, right?

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.700
RETO MEIER: Absolutely, yeah.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.140
And you can see here that
they've done a pretty good job

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.030
on their landing page
on Google Play.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.010
It's one of the things that
they've done a little bit

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.010
wrong here is they've got a
great logo, which I really

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.710
like to see.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.570
But what they've done which
I think they could really

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.850
improve on is their feature
graphic, which is effectively

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.910
just a combination of their
logo, the app name, and a

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:26.892
bunch of screenshots.

00:01:26.892 --> 00:01:29.615
Now, it turns out that there are
other places on the Google

00:01:29.615 --> 00:01:33.410
Play listing for your logo, app
name, and screenshots, and

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.170
so it's kind of a
waste of space.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.050
So they've done the right thing
in having a feature

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.455
graphic, but they could
do a lot more with

00:01:38.455 --> 00:01:39.550
what they've got.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.560
IAN NI-LEWIS: Sure.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.090
RETO MEIER: So what
is this app?

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.500
It describes itself as a super
powered replacement for SMS

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.920
messaging, and I'd say
it pretty much

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.400
lives up to that claim.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.060
It can do all of the regular
instant messaging type

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.750
behavior that you expect, which
is basically sending

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.490
instant messages to other
people, all without having to

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.420
rely on a cell network
connection in order to do so.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.630
So the big plus here is that if
you don't have an unlimited

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.500
text messaging plan, you can
send messages to your friends

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.250
at no cost, which is nice.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.450
As a bonus, you can also
do multimedia stuff.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.430
So you can send pictures,
images, videos, movies, all of

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.900
that sort of stuff, which you
can theoretically do with MMS,

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.320
but this makes it
a lot easier.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.490
And of course, it also supports
offline messaging,

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.240
which is nice.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.260
They try and keep things as
simple as possible by tying

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.040
everything into your phone
number rather than having a

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.895
secondary account, which is
nice, but it does mean that

00:02:31.895 --> 00:02:33.820
you can't use this app
on tablet devices.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.670
And sure enough, they've
actually blocked installation

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.350
for those platforms, which is
a little bit disappointing,

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.050
frankly, because it
really does limit

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.080
the utility the app.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.780
And given that it's transferring
data over the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.770
internet, why force me to depend
on having a mobile

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.470
number and having a device
with a mobile connection?

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.680
So as you can see from this
screenshot, I think WhatsApp

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.320
Messenger could really do with
a full UI overhaul, really

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.350
bringing it up to date with
whole new themes, and

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.030
genuinely presenting a more
consistent and intuitive UI

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.600
navigation structure.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.480
I'm not going to get too
much detail into that.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.060
That's kind of Roman's
wheelhouse, so I'm going to

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.210
let him and the guys comment
more on that aspect on

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.410
Tuesday's Android Design
In Action.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.040
IAN NI-LEWIS: But I think
we do have to say that

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.730
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.960
is fine, but it's pretty old
school to just slap some sort

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.565
of random picture behind
your stuff.

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:20.080
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.630
I mean, if you're using
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.700
as a technique to try and make
users more comfortable with

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.300
the app so that they feel
more familiar with the

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.580
expectations, then that's
a great idea.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.480
Here, it just looks like, eh,
white and black backgrounds

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.310
look kind of boring.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.400
Let's stick something behind.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.700
Maybe a faux rock effect.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.560
And frankly, that doesn't
really add to it.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.500
It just makes the whole thing
look a little bit untidy.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.880
IAN NI-LEWIS: True.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.420
So the elevator pitch for Group
Me is that it's like

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.660
your own private Twitter.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.495
And I think that's a pretty
accurate description.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.900
Awesome.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.400
MALE SPEAKER: My fault.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.490
Sorry.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.940
IAN NI-LEWIS: No, no,
no, it's cool.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.140
Take your time.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.130
All right.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.130
We've used Group Me a lot
on the Android team.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.330
When we go to a conference like
Google I/O, it's tough to

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.020
stay in sync with
the whole team.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.770
And if you don't stay in touch,
well, you miss things

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.110
like the $100 shots of Glen
Ross that Dan Galpin

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.380
missed at I/O 2012.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.950
That was a good night.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.400
And thanks, Dan.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.500
We will pay you back someday.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.300
Anyway, Group Me isn't perfect,
but so far, it's been

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.190
the most reliable solution for
keeping our group in sync.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.690
It works via push messaging, but
it can also send messages

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.900
via SMS, so it works even if
you don't have a data plan.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.380
That's pretty important if
you're in Shanghai or

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.840
Barcelona or Sao Polo.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.330
RETO MEIER: Or the I280 between

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.250
Cupertino and Sunnyvale.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.810
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well,
that's true.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:38.040
Yeah.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.050
There's some sort of rip in
the fabric of reality down

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.880
there that disturbs anything
that gets too close.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.910
Speaking of which, Group Me used
to look like this, which

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.490
made it feel a lot less
like an Android app.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.310
The speech bubbles not only
make me feel like I've

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.310
accidentally picked up someone
else's device--

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.400
some hipster's device--

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.410
they also waste space and clash
with the Android action

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.870
bar at the top of the screen.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.100
So the redesign is a better use
of space and feels a lot

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.320
more like Android.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.520
It's even got some nice touches
like the embedded map

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.200
view, and that's great
for finding out

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.060
where the party is.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.730
In fact, I remember in
Barcelona, we were trying to

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.280
find the party for, gee,
how long was it, Dan?

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.520
It was like, hours, right?

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.890
MALE SPEAKER: We walked
around for hours.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.400
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, and
we couldn't find it.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.350
RETO MEIER: But in Barcelona,
everywhere's a party.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.200
Like, just open the
nearest door.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.750
IAN NI-LEWIS: That is true,
but we were looking for a

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.270
specific party.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.170
MALE SPEAKER: The
great ragers.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.360
IAN NI-LEWIS: We didn't
want to get fired.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.320
Let's put it that way.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.090
RETO MEIER: You didn't want to
be like Dan and miss out on

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.250
the free booze.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.810
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.840
Well, my only objection to the
redesign is the way they've

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.340
changed the action bar.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.820
Group Me has jumped on
the drawer bandwagon.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.990
So not only did they take
away the regular

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.660
[? app affordance, ?]

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.330
but they've also got this three
bar thing that I guess

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.860
is starting to be acknowledged
as the universal drawer

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.030
pattern, but I'm still a fan of
the [? app affordance. ?]

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.040
And apparently they didn't get
the memo about the design

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.500
guidelines for drawers.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.240
Just in case you're in the same
boat, here is the memo.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.740
The main takeaway is that
drawers should slide out under

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.480
the action bar, not push the
action bar out of the way.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.700
That's important, because your
action bar still needs to be

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.670
contextual, it's still your
[? app affordance. ?]

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.450
We don't want it to arbitrarily
leave the screen.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.170
But let's not get too caught
up in the design.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.650
That's really Roman's job.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.185
Let's go ahead and move on.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.630
Overall, the beta looks
like Group Me is

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.200
moving in a great direction.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.860
I love the way they've
worked with media.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.620
A lot of the recommendations
that we've given about using

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.780
larger pictures and alpha text
over the pictures just make it

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.790
look fantastic.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:51.560
Honestly, the only thing that
I really, really wish that

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.340
Group Me did is an
easier login.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.700
Now, they've actually made a
big change for the better.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.310
In the previous version, you had
to login with your phone

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.220
number, which, for me,
was a horrible issue.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:11.500
Not only do I use Google Voice
and have like 10 different

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.770
SIMs that I use--

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.530
I can never remember which phone
number I actually logged

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.050
into Group Me with first.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.280
I think it was something that I
threw away a long time ago.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:26.370
But their SMS permission system,
where they'll send you

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.660
a text to say, is this
really your phone?

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.280
It doesn't always work,
and I don't know why.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.870
RETO MEIER: I had that problem
today, actually.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:33.300
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.430
It might be that because of
their beta, the servers are

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.840
just under load or something.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.840
Anyway, they made it so you can
log in with a username and

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.790
password, but if you've been
watching the show, you know

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.370
what my pet peeve is here.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.810
Don't make me type in a
username and password.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.720
My credentials are
on the phone.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:54.260
Either put the account on the
phone, or synchronize or

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.440
federate with an account
that's already there.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.000
Google Play services
makes this easy.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.460
We talked about that
a couple weeks ago.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.360
Typing in passwords
is so 2010.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.990
Don't make me do it.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.320
All right, let's go
ahead and move on.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:08.750
RETO MEIER: All right.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.380
So I think the biggest surprise
for me with Trillian

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.600
is that it actually still
existed, and I mean that as

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.360
kind of a compliment.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.490
It's great to see a company able
to leverage their core

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.880
strengths and really take
advantage of new opportunities

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.120
when they arrive.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.230
And that's really exactly what
the team at Trillian has done.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.730
So in the height of the instant
messaging federation

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.410
wars, Trillian was my go to
client for being able to

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.000
connect to multiple
services at once.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.289
I was on ICQ, I had friends
who were on--

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:35.275
what other ones existed?

00:08:35.275 --> 00:08:36.210
Yahoo?

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:36.679
I don't know.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:36.990
There was a bunch.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.640
IAN NI-LEWIS: AOL.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:37.880
RETO MEIER: AOL.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.100
Yeah.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.450
There was heaps of them.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.510
And so Trillian was a great way
to have one app that lived

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:46.170
on my desktop PC at that time
that let me communicate with

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:49.120
everyone, because that was the
only way we could get things

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.110
done was to have clients do
the federation for us.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.030
Now, these days, they've taken
it a step further, and they've

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.820
added support for some of the
newer protocols like Facebook

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.690
instant messaging, I think Skype
is either there or on

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:00.760
their roadmap.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.670
And of course, with most of
these conversations now

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.150
happening from people's phones,
it's great to see

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.300
Trillian offering
a mobile app.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.700
So rather than being a
replacement for SMS messaging

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.450
like the two apps that we looked
at earlier, Trillian is

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.850
really looking to replace the
need for having a number of

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:19.860
separate chat clients for each
different services that you

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:20.980
already use.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.120
So it's supposed to replace
having to have four or five

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.540
different instant messaging
clients.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.440
And they've done a great job of
keeping things simple, and

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.790
you can see that on the
screenshot here.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:34.190
And as you go through the app,
it really is sort of that cut

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.560
down, most basic vision of
how instant messaging

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.450
apps used to work.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:41.210
You have a list of contacts, in
this case separated by the

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:44.290
service type, so you can see
who your ICQ friends are--

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.340
which kind of doesn't make that
much sense, because I

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.610
don't really care what
technology I'm using, what

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.240
back end service I'm using to
communicate with people.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.570
I just want to see the people
and communicate with them.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.090
And I guess the complexity here
is that often people will

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:00.700
have multiple accounts on each
of the different services, so

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.570
how do you reconcile that?

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.160
I think that's one of the
challenges, and something

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.070
which an app like Trillian could
really perhaps put in a

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.770
little bit more effort to figure
out how to do that

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:11.140
reconciliation.

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.880
Otherwise, the simplicity is
nice, but really the app just

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:14.920
looks a little dated.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.510
It could really do an upgrade
to hollow styling.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:19.660
And even better, I'd really
love to see them try and

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.430
develop a rich tablet user
experience to complement their

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:23.630
desktop and mobile apps.

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.560
So again, this is an app which
was designed for mobile to

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.590
take advantage of the fact that
people were sending their

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:32.180
instant messages over SMS via
BlackBerry Messenger and other

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.240
mobile devices, and so they've
made a mobile app as well.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.280
I'd love to see them now realize
that tablets are where

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:45.491
it's at as well, and develop
some tablet app features too.

00:10:45.491 --> 00:10:47.165
IAN NI-LEWIS: It feels like one
of those things where they

00:10:47.165 --> 00:10:49.180
could really take advantage
of the content manager.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:53.950
If you think about it, having
people that have ICQ and

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:56.950
Facebook and other different
types of accounts is really

00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:00.270
just like having a friend that
has a work phone and a home

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.850
phone and a cell phone, right?

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:01.940
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.470
And that's exactly what the
contacts contract content

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:05.610
provider lets you do.

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:08.930
So you can add your own specific
content types.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.150
And in this case, it
would be different

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:11.645
instant messaging clients.

00:11:11.645 --> 00:11:13.610
And if I'm not mistaken, I
think instant messaging

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.710
clients is one of the default
fields you can use.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:18.070
So they may be better off just
leveraging that existing

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:18.960
infrastructure.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.720
IAN NI-LEWIS: Definitely.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.110
I think that would make
me a lot happier.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.230
Although it always makes me
happy whenever you have to say

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:29.650
contracts contacts contracts
provider on air.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:30.550
You can do it better
than I do.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.660
RETO MEIER: Well, you know,
it's all about practice.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.250
IAN NI-LEWIS: So let's go ahead
and dive into a couple

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:35.960
of details that we think
would help instant

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.620
messaging apps in general.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.850
If I had to pick one feature
that is absolutely crucial for

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.030
an instant messaging app, that
one thing that you really just

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:47.220
cannot afford to get wrong
is notifications.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.710
The whole point of instant
messaging is it's instant.

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.460
You need to know as soon
as a message arrives.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.310
At the same time, it's
also crucial to use

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.040
notifications wisely.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.200
It's terrible to have too
many notifications.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.280
It's worse than having
none at all.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.010
So that's why on any version
of Android, no matter what

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:04.670
you're running, you should
always make sure you're doing

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:06.440
what we call stacking
notifications.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.230
I sort of don't like the word
stacking notifications,

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:13.710
because it could actually refer
to the wrong way of

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:14.900
doing things, in my opinion.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.930
But here's what the design guide
means when we talk about

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:18.760
stacking notifications.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.490
If you have two notifications
that would otherwise be

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:27.720
displayed on top of one another,
the basic rule of

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.610
thumb is that your app should
never appear more than once in

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:32.510
the notification panel.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:37.060
So if you have something new
to say, then say it inside

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.030
your existing notification,
rather than creating a second

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:40.970
notification.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.950
For instance, you could add a
number pending field to let

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:46.350
your users know that there's
more to see.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:52.050
Instead of placing three
notifications in the

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:55.800
notification panel, you just
display one that says you have

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.120
three notifications pending.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.170
But if you're running on
Jellybean or higher, you can

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.510
actually do a lot better
than that.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.980
The standard notification
builder class has a new style.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:06.660
It's called [? index ?]

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.720
style, and it lets you add
a list of strings to your

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.640
notification.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.020
So when the notification gets
expanded, the user can see all

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.860
their recent notifications
at a glance.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.870
You can see that in the Gmail
app, for instance.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:21.710
And I think if you look at this
particular style, the

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:24.600
view on the right there where
it's expanded, I think you can

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.320
see that's a perfect
way to receive a

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.850
series of instant messages.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.110
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.960
IAN NI-LEWIS: You might also
consider going one step

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:37.230
further with rich notifications
and have some

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:38.990
action buttons.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:42.420
For instance, I honestly would
really appreciate a button to

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.000
automatically send
a busy message

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.290
for all my IM buddies--

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.430
you know, I'm driving,
or whatever.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.200
Just something that's really,
really simple.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.330
RETO MEIER: Or if I'm
in a meeting.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.460
Something slightly
less dangerous.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.680
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.300
Well, anyway, the point is that
there's a lot of stuff

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.720
that you can do with rich
notifications on Jellybean.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.270
But you don't actually
have to be targeting

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:03.970
Jellybean to get this.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.810
If you use a notification
[? compat ?]

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:09.070
API, it's easiest to support
both the old notification

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.900
style and the new hotness.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.920
Just remember that any action
buttons you create won't be

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.240
available on legacy versions of
the OS, so you need to have

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.030
some alternate way to access
that behavior.

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:23.120
And of course, as we all know,
it's usually to just tap the

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.270
notification and send the user
directly to an activity that

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:30.585
can handle that notification or
expand on or offer actions.

00:14:30.585 --> 00:14:32.640
RETO MEIER: So using the
notification [? compat ?]

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.520
API, you're actually able to
just have a single code path

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.610
which has all the functionality
for all the

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.260
newest versions, and then it
just gracefully degrades back

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.620
to whatever is supported?

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.915
IAN NI-LEWIS: Essentially
so, yes.

00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:43.300
RETO MEIER: Nice.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.030
Oh, that's quite handy.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:44.168
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:14:44.168 --> 00:14:45.852
So that's really cool.

00:14:45.852 --> 00:14:49.360
So the code that you see on the
screen is ripped from the

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.310
pages of developer.android.com,
and it

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:55.590
shows you exactly how to make
an inbox style notification.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:58.060
As you can see, it's really
quite simple.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.810
RETO MEIER: And I think, in
fact, if you go to Android

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:03.500
training, or perhaps the API
guides, the notification

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.100
guide, I think, has been
recently updated to have all

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.440
of the new hotness explained
in some detail.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.850
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yes, in fact,
that's where I stole all the

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:11.350
previous [INAUDIBLE]
graphics from.

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.570
RETO MEIER: Outstanding.

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:11.950
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yes.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:15.256
I have been thieving like
a madman today.

00:15:15.256 --> 00:15:17.920
RETO MEIER: That's what we do
here as developer advocates.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.200
We take all the hard work of
our tech writers, and steal

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.620
it, and pass it off
as our own.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.820
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:24.612
Ah, life is good.

00:15:24.612 --> 00:15:26.450
Well, what do you have
for us today, Reto?

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:28.250
RETO MEIER: Well, I think it's
also worth discussing how

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.950
these instant messaging
apps actually work.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.630
The key to a great experience
is really balancing that low

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:37.670
latency instant instant
messaging with making sure

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:40.180
that you're not draining the
battery in order to get those

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.540
rapid updates.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.810
So fundamentally, there's a
couple of different approaches

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.115
that you can take.

00:15:45.115 --> 00:15:47.840
On the first hand, you can
maintain an open socket

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.820
connection between your client
running on each device and

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.050
your server.

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:54.610
Now, having an open socket will
minimize your latency,

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:55.910
because the connection
is there.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:57.700
You can just send stuff
through that pipe.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.820
But you really need to carefully
manage it so that

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.120
you're not draining your battery
exceptionally quickly

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.110
by maintaining that socket.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.870
So the way that you actually
keep the socket open is by

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.550
sending data or sending
[INAUDIBLE]

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:11.680
pings to your server at regular
intervals, which is

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.230
going to stop the network
from automatically

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.900
closing those sockets.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.740
But if you ping too regularly,
you're just going to be

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.340
keeping the cell radio
turned on.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.070
It's just going to drain
the battery.

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:21.950
And if you do it too
infrequently, you're going to

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:23.360
lose your socket connection
anyway.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.440
So the latency's going to go up,
because you're expecting

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.120
it to be zero latency,
but it isn't.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.320
You've got the additional cost
it takes to initiate a new

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.050
socket connection.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:32.165
It's just a bad time
all around.

00:16:32.165 --> 00:16:35.530
And figuring out the right
frequency is actually really,

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:36.940
really hard.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.780
It varies between network
operators--

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.760
the sockets that you're allowed
to use to have these

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.610
long, looped connections vary
depending on networks.

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:46.660
So it makes it really difficult
for individual app

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:47.850
developers to figure out.

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:50.280
And frankly, that's not the sort
of thing that you want to

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.480
have to be thinking about.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.640
You want to be focusing on
features, on UI, not how do I

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.620
keep the data connection going
between the app and server.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.640
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know, not only
that, but even if you got

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:04.420
everything right, in order to
avoid draining the battery and

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.420
keep the socket open and get
all the behavior that you

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.349
want, you would also have to
synchronize perfectly with any

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:11.319
other app that wanted
to do this, right?

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:15.270
Because even if-- let's say 10
minutes is the magic number.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:17.484
My app goes every 10
minutes, your app

00:17:17.484 --> 00:17:18.680
goes every 10 minutes.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.780
Your app started five
minutes after mine.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:21.400
Ouch.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.910
RETO MEIER: Whoopsie.

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.460
So can we do that, then?

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.514
How can we synchronize all of
the apps on the device so that

00:17:27.514 --> 00:17:29.860
they all send pings
at the same time?

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:30.990
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, I think
you've got to have somebody

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:32.310
send the pings for you.

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:32.810
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:35.120
And happily, that is
exactly what Google

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.210
Cloud Messaging does.

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:38.220
So we've already figured out
the most efficient way to

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:41.870
maintain a low latency network
path, and in fact, this is

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.580
something that we can keep
track of and continue to

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:47.470
optimize and make more and more
efficient, so that you

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:49.350
can just piggyback on top
of that, and use it as a

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.400
mechanism to tell your app when
it should initiate a new

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.090
connection and start
transferring those

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:56.330
messages in real time.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:59.640
So all the details for Google
Cloud Messaging are available

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.930
on that cloud sync Android
training class.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.850
So the thing is, though, that
cloud to device messaging or

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:08.640
C2DM, as we like to call it,
because everyone loves an

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.560
acronym, doesn't guarantee
the delivery latency.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.930
It will definitely get there,
but you don't know that it'll

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:15.680
get there straight away.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.360
Now, chances are it will get
there straight away.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.910
But one approach, too, is
actually use C2DM to initiate

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:22.660
the conversation.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.200
So when someone pings you with
a message the first time, use

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.250
see C2DM to notify the
recipient, who can then create

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.620
a short lived socket connection
to transfer the

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.535
rapid fire messages backwards
and forwards.

00:18:33.535 --> 00:18:36.510
So then you're just keeping
a short lived socket.

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:38.620
You kill it as soon as the
conversation is finished, and

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:43.350
then fall back to waiting for
C2DM to wake up your app and

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:45.190
listen for new messages.

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:50.090
So some apps that we looked at
actually chose to use a third

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:52.580
option, which isn't really
an option, which

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:55.040
is polling the server--

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.520
just pinging your server to
check to see whether you've

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.840
got any new messages pending.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.960
And that's kind of a terrible
idea, because the latency is

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.880
going to be shocking, unless
you're doing it every minute,

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.080
in which case the battery drain
is going to be even more

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.240
shocking than the latency.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.700
And I saw some comments in
reviews suggesting that that's

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:16.850
what WhatsApp Messenger does
to get its messages.

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:18.700
I haven't confirmed that, so I
don't want to criticize them

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.180
too sharply without knowing
for certain.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.550
But if that is the case, then
that's definitely something

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:26.790
you want to move away from and
move towards a GCM model.

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:29.910
So if you have your own service,
polling is never the

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:30.960
right answer.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.570
So if you're relying on someone
else's service to get

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:36.580
information so you can't send a
push message, well, OK, then

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.730
you're going to have to come
up with something clever.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.190
But if you've got your own
servers, then this is going to

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.380
make your life a lot easier.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:43.880
So yes.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:44.700
Switch to GCM.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.110
The sun will shine brighter,
food will taste sweeter, and

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:49.870
life will always be better.

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:52.110
IAN NI-LEWIS: I switched
to GCM.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:55.830
I liked it so much I
bought the company.

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.060
RETO MEIER: So before we sign
off, let's take a look at

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.270
prescriptions for each of the
apps that we have looked at

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:04.020
today, and see if we cannot help
them move towards a more

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:07.130
pure Android experience.

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:11.700
So let's start off with
WhatsApp Messenger.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.750
So I think first off, what
I'd really like to

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:15.760
see is tablet support.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.480
I'd love to see them make this
app work really nicely, create

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.800
an optimized tablet
experience.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.750
I think that's something which
is kind of missing from this

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:25.700
space, where a lot of the focus
has been on creating

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.550
this awesome mobile experience,
because that's

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.120
clearly where their growth is.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.130
Tablets seem like the
next logical step.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:33.380
When you're sitting on the
couch, rather than opening up

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.950
your laptop to instant messaging
people, you can have

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:37.720
a richer experience talking
to more than one

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.140
person using a tablet.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.860
IAN NI-LEWIS: I was surprised at
how common it was for some

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:47.660
of these messaging apps to rely
on SMS if not as their

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.700
only transport mechanism,
then at least as

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.030
their primary mechanism.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:54.110
And that really feels
like five years ago.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:54.830
RETO MEIER: It does.

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:59.250
It kind of made sense back when,
hey, we can simplify

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:01.990
signup by just checking what
the phone number is.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:04.500
But now it actually complicates
it, because half

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:08.650
of my devices don't have
a SIM card in them.

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:11.880
I've got tablets, I've got some
devices without SIMs, so

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.410
it really just makes
my life harder.

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:16.990
So a non-phone signup flow for
WhatsApp Messenger would make

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:18.560
my life a lot better.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.410
I'd love to see a
modernized UI.

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:23.250
I'd love to see some using cloud
to device messaging, if

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:26.230
they're not already doing so.

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:27.170
Yeah.

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:28.650
IAN NI-LEWIS: In the
future, none of us

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:30.310
will have phone numbers.

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:32.690
You're going to be able to
ring my email address.

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:33.820
RETO MEIER: I would
like to do that.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:36.260
That would make me
a happier person.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.420
What did you think
about Group Me?

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:42.040
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, Group Me is
in beta, and the beta looks

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.280
really, really promising.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.820
It's hard to say for sure
exactly how it's

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:46.383
going to turn out.

00:21:46.383 --> 00:21:47.420
You know there's definitely
some rough

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:48.500
edges right now, but--

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:48.830
RETO MEIER: Sure.

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:51.530
But we like the idea of beta
releases to try and figure out

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:53.900
where you should be investing
that time and effort to get

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.120
the best bang for your
buck, right?

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:55.790
IAN NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:58.060
In fact, the only thing that
disappointed me about the beta

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:00.120
is I couldn't get it
off of Google Play.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.200
I had to go to their
website and get it.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.650
But that's not their fault.

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:04.500
That's probably ours.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:04.710
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:07.760
It would be nice if we offered a
way to do a more streamlined

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.850
beta release by Google
Play, but--

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:10.450
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know what?

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:11.480
I'll put in a request.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:11.980
RETO MEIER: Let's do that.

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:12.880
I know some people.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.340
RETO MEIER: Excellent.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:19.390
IAN NI-LEWIS: The drawer pattern
is definitely done in,

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:21.370
let's say, not the
wrong way, but--

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:22.280
it's the wrong way.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.530
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:27.080
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's not the way
that we recommend right now.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.400
And so I'd like to see
them fix that.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.560
They also have this sort of--
we didn't really touch on

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.670
this, but they've got this sort
of weird thing where the

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:38.760
drawer actually opens either to
the left or to the right,

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.370
making it almost, but not
quite like a view pager.

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:46.200
So they've sort of mixed a few
metaphors, and I think that as

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.960
they sort of hone in on their
final version, they might want

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:54.100
to take a look at that and
decide whether the user

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.410
confusion is going to be worth
the benefits they're

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:57.190
getting out of it.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:59.100
RETO MEIER: It's just a really
interesting example as well,

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.960
where given that it is in beta,
there's an opportunity

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:05.750
there to do some AB testing and
just sort of pick one or a

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:07.690
few different options presented
to different users,

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.260
and use analytics to figure
out which is the one that

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.150
people are finding the
easiest to use?

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.110
So I'm a big fan of doing that,
particularly in beta.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:17.360
If you've got a bunch of
alternate ideas, present them

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.420
all, and see which one users
actually use and

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:20.720
find the most intuitive.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.990
IAN NI-LEWIS: But especially
coming from their last

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:26.330
version, which is, as I said, a
service that we used a lot.

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:31.440
We've always enjoyed using the
app, but design wise, this is

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.120
head and shoulders above
the other one.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:37.670
So hopefully they'll converge
onto something that everybody

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:41.370
loves, and will get all
that figured out.

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:43.810
The other thing, of course, and
this pretty much applies

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:47.560
to almost any app that has any
kind of login is let's

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.810
integrate that sign in.

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:50.950
If you're not going to do with
Google, then integrate with

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:51.880
something else.

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:56.070
Facebook's popular, Twitter is
fine, anything where the user

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:58.890
is likely to have an account
on the machine.

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:02.440
For Android, we usually suggest
Google, not because

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:06.900
that's who pays us, although
it sort of is.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.010
But because almost all Android
devices have a

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:11.290
Google account on them.

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:12.500
RETO MEIER: I mean, really, what
we're just trying to do

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.230
is make that sign in flow as
simple as possible, and it's

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.360
something that we're
particularly sensitive to,

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.745
because we install
a lot of apps.

00:24:19.745 --> 00:24:23.200
And we're doing this, and the
App Clinic, obviously, we

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.530
spend a fair bit of
time looking at.

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:28.260
But we spend a lot of time
looking at a lot of apps, and

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:29.530
we do it really quickly.

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:32.540
We download it, we'll open it
up, and we want to figure out

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.970
how this app works, what it's
doing right, what it's doing

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:37.400
wrong, inside of 15 seconds.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.390
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, I
don't think we're

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:39.630
unique in that, because--

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:40.780
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.980
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's very, very
common, if a user wants to

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:47.450
download an app for a particular
purpose, it's

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:50.010
extremely common to download
10 of them.

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:53.010
And the ones that are going to
get looked at first are the

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:55.590
ones that don't throw up any
roadblocks to finding out what

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:56.990
the functionality is.

00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:59.830
Now, Group Me is an app that
I love a lot, but I think I

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:03.280
probably would have skipped it
at the beginning, because I

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:07.500
couldn't get into the app until
I had not only put in my

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:13.980
phone number, but verified it
with an SMS which I never got.

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:17.310
Now, fortunately they've fixed
that particular flaw, but you

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:19.930
still have to sign in before you
can get to the good stuff.

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:20.390
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:25.720
And this is something which
actually I can see for next

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.930
week, we're doing personal
fitness apps.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:30.190
And I actually discovered this
exact scenario where I was

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:33.020
sitting at the foot of the
mountain, ready to go hiking,

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.380
my wife's like, we should
track how far we go.

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.960
I think I have an
app for that.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.280
So I fired up the [? trailer, ?]
looked at all

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.270
the suggestions, and installed
each of them.

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:43.060
And the way I chose which one to
use was I just opened them

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.600
one at a time, and as soon as
I got to a roadblock, I

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.210
stopped to check if the
other one was quicker.

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:48.750
It's like, you need
me to sign in?

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:49.000
No.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.820
You need me to do a
bunch of settings?

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:51.680
No.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.490
And that's kind of the way
people use their apps.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:57.020
They're going, I need
to do something.

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:58.560
I'm going to download an
app and see whether it

00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:59.380
does that for me.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.760
It's not the, yeah, I've
got some time.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.770
I'm going to download this app
and see what it does and see

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:04.790
how it works.

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:07.280
It's not really the use case
particularly on mobile.

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.600
IAN NI-LEWIS: And we're being
a little unfair, because

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.160
obviously, in an instant
messaging situation, you have

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.340
to sign in in some way.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:14.910
RETO MEIER: Have an identity?

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:18.200
IAN NI-LEWIS: But that's why
it's so important to federate

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.100
or integrate with the context
manager and the account

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.545
manager on the device.

00:26:22.545 --> 00:26:26.030
Now, I will say in Group Me's
favor that their new beta, if

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:30.210
you don't sign in immediately,
still has a view pager with

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:32.890
some demo screens on it, and
it kind of tells you what

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:33.730
you're getting into.

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:37.440
So I think that's a good effort,
but still, if I can

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:40.380
just open it up and it
automatically knew,

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:41.550
oh, you're this guy.

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:43.150
I think I've seen you before.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:44.570
That would make me
super happy.

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:45.030
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:47.360
And keep in mind as well that
even without doing the

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.490
federated sign in that Ian's
describing, you can tell me

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:53.690
what my phone number is by
checking the phone, and you

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:55.800
can tell me what my email
address is by

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:56.780
checking the phone.

00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:00.060
So populating those and asking
me to confirm them, rather

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.870
than having me type them all
in is all things which are

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:04.170
going to make that sign
in process smoother.

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:05.080
IAN NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.220
So what did you think
about Trillian?

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:06.560
RETO MEIER: Trillian.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.890
So kind of similar to the first
app that we looked at,

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:12.890
in that I'd really like to see
a modernized UI and improved

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:13.650
tablet support.

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:17.090
I think otherwise, it's good in
that it has that focus, and

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:18.890
so that's a big thing
for me is an app

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:20.100
which has a clear focus.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.800
And in this app, they're not
trying to reinvent messaging.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.750
They're just trying to make it
easy for you to use the tools

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.720
and the services and the
contacts that you've already

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.610
been communicating with on
a different platform.

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:32.590
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, and I guess
it's not showing up here

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:35.980
because this slide was put
together by trained monkeys,

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:40.352
but the real important thing,
I think, is that they could

00:27:40.352 --> 00:27:41.730
integrate with contacts
manager.

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:42.075
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:27:42.075 --> 00:27:42.560
Absolutely.

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.150
I've already got my
contacts there.

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:46.720
Put all of that data in there,
and that's going to make life

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.390
a lot easier.

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:51.830
So basically, Trillian's been
around for a long time, and so

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:54.020
that's why I think tablet
support is a big one for them.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.830
It's like, it's a company which
clearly recognizes that

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:59.190
there's an opportunity in
adapting their service to

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:01.250
people using new devices.

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:02.850
IAN NI-LEWIS: But let's
adapt all the way.

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:05.250
Let's make it-- by the way,
you didn't put this slide

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:05.750
together, did you?

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:07.080
RETO MEIER: No no, that was
my trained monkeys.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.810
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh good.

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:09.390
RETO MEIER: They're
getting there.

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:10.475
I mean, this is close.

00:28:10.475 --> 00:28:12.240
This is two out of three.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.620
I'm pretty happy with that.

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:13.973
IAN NI-LEWIS: Sure.

00:28:13.973 --> 00:28:14.680
Good point.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.010
RETO MEIER: Right.

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:17.180
So I think we've just
done half an hour.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:19.490
We've managed to keep it to the
time frame that we were

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:20.960
hoping to this week,
so yay us.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.692
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yay!

00:28:21.692 --> 00:28:22.770
RETO MEIER: That's
all for us today.

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:25.140
Don't forget to tune in to
Roman, Nick, and Adam for

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:28.250
Android Design in Action, next
Tuesday, from the unflooded

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:31.280
New York office, where they'll
be setting their design skills

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.190
loose on some of the instant
messaging apps that we talked

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.880
about today.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:34.920
RETO MEIER: And I think they
said they're going to be

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.500
looking at [? Trippit ?]
as well.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.080
RETO MEIER: Oh, excellent.

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:37.620
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.570
I was just talking to Roman, and
then he said he had to go,

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.650
because he was on the
phone with a--

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:44.960
and then he used a nasty word.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.780
RETO MEIER: Oh, that's
surprising.

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:47.650
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know why?

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:48.180
New York.

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:48.655
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:28:48.655 --> 00:28:49.740
New Yorkers, man.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.950
IAN NI-LEWIS: Anyway, we'll be
back next week, taking a look

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:54.060
at personal fitness
tracking apps.

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.550
RETO MEIER: And the voting in
that category has been fierce,

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:59.880
so be sure to hit our trailer
page and get your votes and

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:02.480
nominations in for this week
and the following weeks.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.350
There's a bit.ly link there at
bit.ly/appclinic/trailer.

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:07.670
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now, remember
to vote early.

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:10.470
Don't be like the people who
nominated poor Glyph, which

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:12.920
received the most votes this
week, but was nominated too

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.090
late to be considered.

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:15.370
RETO MEIER: We'll try
and squeeze Glyph

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:16.230
into another week.

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:19.340
But until then, here's a quick
message to tide you over.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:22.660
IAN NI-LEWIS: Pencil, square,
skull, skull, skull, diamond,

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.530
airplane, pencil.

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:26.380
RETO MEIER: Nice one.

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.150
Until then, I'm Reto Meier.

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:29.260
IAN NI-LEWIS: I'm
Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.510
RETO MEIER: And thank
you for watching.
