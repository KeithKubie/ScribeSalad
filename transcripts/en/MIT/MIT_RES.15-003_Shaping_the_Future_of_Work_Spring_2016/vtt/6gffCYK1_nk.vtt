00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.770
We're talking today
with Jianming Zhou,

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.270
and, Ryder Pearce
the co-founders

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.950
of a very interesting
organization

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.630
called SherpaShare.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.960
It works in the ride
service business,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.650
and it provides
services both to drivers

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.360
and to other people companies
interested in this business.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.920
So we're very interested
in learning more about

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.830
what you do, why you
founded your organization,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.840
and where it's going.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.920
So welcome, thank you
for joining us today.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.420
Thank you.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.620
Thanks for having us.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.970
So tell me what is SherpaShare?

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.290
What is it that you do?

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.620
Yeah so SherpaShare is
financial management,

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.030
and a communication platform
for on-demand workers.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.312
And we basically
offer them to access--

00:00:50.312 --> 00:00:52.270
basically offer them an
independent and neutral

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.030
platform to access
information, utility,

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.530
and work opportunities
to maximize their work.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.170
And tell me a
little bit about why

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.780
you formed this organization.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.400
What led you to do it?

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.460
The fundamental reason
is we see there's

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.260
a fundamental conflict
between on-demand services

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.890
and the workers And the
workers are typically

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.310
working for multiple
services, and they

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.610
have growing challenges
to manage their work,

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.280
and understand that there
are all other work options.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.430
And they don't have
loyalty to any services.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.890
At the same time a company
competing for the same supply

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.080
pool, and they have very
high acquisition cost.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.240
And so we think
a sort of putting

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.870
in a buffer layer in between
can benefit both sides.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.600
So that's why we position
us to sell that need.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.800
And so who do you define as your
customers for your services?

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.980
So typically it's been
ride share drivers

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.470
is who we've started with.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.040
And those typically,
Uber, Lyft, formerly

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.140
Sidecar, and delivery
companies as well

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.500
although we'd like to expand
to other independent drivers.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.760
And do the companies
themselves come to you

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.330
with ideas for your
services or ask you

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.500
for either information that's
helpful to them as well?

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.380
Some, yeah.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.670
Especially for smaller players.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.390
So basically, if you're
looking for a channel

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.670
to acquire supplies--

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.739
but actually for the
workers, they also

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.280
are looking for a
third party channel

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.790
to exchange information
as well, yeah.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.150
You know what I find fascinating
is you characterize SherpaShare

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.670
an intermediary, not as a
representative or an advocate

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.190
for one party or the other.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.170
Tell me more about
how that works

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.120
and why you're positioning
Sherpa share in this kind

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.260
of middle category?

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.990
What do each of the
different stakeholders

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.970
get from your Services

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.100
Yeah so, as I said, like
most workers actually

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.500
working for multiple
services, so because they

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.210
are working for
multiple services,

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.210
they need tools to
manage your earnings

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.130
from different sources,
check their personal expenses

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.130
understand that
their tax liability,

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.480
and navigate increasingly
more working options.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.020
And no single on-demand
services can't actually

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.900
provide the necessary
tools to help them.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.110
And other side is on-demand
services are very powerful,

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.070
and workers are actually
on the weak side.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.770
And they don't-- they are
forced into a Silo Situation.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.690
So that's why we
think like SherpaShare

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.830
as a third party can
provide value on both sides,

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.600
make the transaction more
smooth and efficient.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.110
Yeah, for example,
so that the workers

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.440
don't have loyalty,
as J.Z. Said,

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.890
and so workers who
need a place where they

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.520
can manage their
multiple work options

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.670
and also communicate with each
other and exchange information.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.339
And the problem the
companies are having is,

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:20.820
they basically don't
have a good way

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.556
to demand loyalty,
or command loyalty.

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:26.180
And that's one of
things we see they're

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.346
struggling with quite a bit.

00:04:27.346 --> 00:04:29.990
How do they actually
convince a driver,

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.980
who has multiple options,
to work for them.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.210
And that's in many ways to
challenge of the on demand

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.040
economy where you don't have
a direct employer and employee

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.880
relationship in place, so
that the interaction is

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.160
a little bit more fluid.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.990
So I think that's a
very interesting point.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.700
So your services
come via an app.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.650
Take me through the app.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.280
If I'm a driver, what do I do?

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.800
How do I get access to it?

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.740
What will I learn
by using your app?

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.530
Yeah, so, also it's actually--

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.640
have a mobile app.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.020
We also have a website.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.150
So we provide a tool to
help you to consolidate all

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.720
your earnings into one place.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.250
We also use a mobile app
to track your expense

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.230
automatically.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.490
Now since [INAUDIBLE]
focus on the drivers,

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.420
so the biggest expense for
them actually is mileage.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.240
So we track the mileage
for them automatically.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.640
We also have so-called heat
map, which is across map,

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.830
and show where the hot spot
for the drivers in real time.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.970
So they can, based
on the heat map

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.770
decide when and where to
work for each service.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.750
And we also have a
so-called chat feature,

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.850
so kind of chat room,
so drivers can get help,

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.410
get support from other drivers.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.460
Yeah that's basically
what we have now.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.530
Today we are
launching a new app.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.690
As of last week.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.200
We launched a brand new app that
basically took the chat feature

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.220
and gave it its own home.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.200
So when we launched the
chat in our existing

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.430
app we found that, drivers--

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.350
it was a strong need for drivers
to communicate with each other,

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.240
to ask questions, to
give status updates.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.650
What's it like down time
right now, for example.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.160
When does the game get out?

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.700
And so last week, we
launched a new app

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.660
dedicated to basically
allowing drivers

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.350
to exchange information.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.200
Call it SherpaShare Plus.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.590
Real time exchange [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.630
For example, when I
came in this morning,

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.850
I posted something
saying, hey, we're

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.497
going to be in Boston
talking about driver issues,

00:06:42.497 --> 00:06:43.830
anything you want to talk about?

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.880
And we had several
drivers right away

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.970
respond, a couple the
points where repeat--

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.660
Uber should add
tips for drivers,

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.880
so that was one that drivers

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.580
And tips.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.790
And temps it was the one.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.069
And a few others, basically
saying that drivers

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:01.110
want to communicate more.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.394
So if companies can
do more or if we

00:07:03.394 --> 00:07:05.060
can do more to help
drivers communicate,

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.170
it's a strong lead.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.030
That's very interesting
that drivers are--

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.740
they operate
independently, separately,

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.890
they're all in their
own vehicle, And so on.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.310
But they're looking for
some sense of community,

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.690
and communications.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.700
That's and that's a service
that you can provide.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.700
That's very interesting.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.950
Yeah, there's like two
fundamental needs drivers need.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.380
The number one is
always financial need.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.980
The second need, we
actually call social need.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.500
So basically, they
need a channel

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.110
to talk about their career.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.970
And so basically they talk
to passengers every day.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.820
But they need to talk
to other drivers,

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:43.160
talk about their company, talk
about their so-called career,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.550
in some way.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.190
So we want to
become that channel.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.150
Well that's a
fascinating opportunity

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.230
for people to do
it in a modern way.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:55.570
Do you know if this creates
any social networking where

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.010
people drivers
actually physically get

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:02.030
together, and form communities
or is it all online?

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:02.850
Both, actually.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:04.770
Yeah, there is some
offline we see more.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.950
I mean, online is the
big one, because everyone

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.990
has different schedules
and so it's hard to align.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.300
But traditional
employment of course,

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.190
had lunch, break, the break
room, the water cooler which

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:19.510
doesn't exist for the drivers.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:24.300
We would like to replicate
the online chat as the water

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.180
cooler area.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.240
We do see in some cities where
there are a lot of drivers,

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.950
the drivers will coordinate.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:33.140
Hey, I'm taking a break
at this coffee shop

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.900
now and trying to get
a few people together.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.730
So it's kind [INAUDIBLE]
of our platform.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:42.070
Drivers can organize
whatever they want,

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.570
whether that's discussions
or offline meet-ups.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.840
Another name for
on-demand industry

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.300
is some people call O2O,
which is online to offline,

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.670
or offline to online.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.900
Actually, our community
is very interesting we

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.400
develop a community
from offline to online.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.200
But eventually we
also want to bring

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.280
online to offline in some way.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.300
Well there's all
kinds of opportunities

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.670
for that kind of interaction.

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:11.110
Well let's talk more
specifically about the drivers

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.600
and how they are
doing, financially.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.400
You're providing
both information

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.130
for helping them build
a social network,

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:23.520
but also to assess their
own financial situation.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.600
What are you hearing
from drivers?

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.460
What can you say about how
they are doing financially now,

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.870
and over time?

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:36.910
Yeah the biggest thing we
found at a fundamental level

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.600
was a lot of these drivers are
first time independent workers.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:46.000
And so understanding
expenses, mileage tracking,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.700
wasn't really there so I
didn't have a basis for that.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.240
And so what that
meant was, whatever

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.450
Uber and Lyft and other
companies marketed to them.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.000
They say $35 an hour.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.800
Drivers didn't have
a good sense of what

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.520
their actual net earnings was.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.160
And that's why we started,
that's how we started basically

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.610
showing them, here's what
you're actually making.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:11.230
Another issue we saw was
that basically drivers didn't

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.260
know how to
optimize, their work,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.960
and so there's a couple things
that we've helped them with.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.470
And so we put out
reports every once

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:21.400
in a while that show
trends in different cities.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:25.460
And we do see that
earnings per trip, I mean,

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:26.820
they do fluctuate.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.330
In some cities they go
up, some they go down.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.120
Of course, people's schedules
are vastly different.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.840
So it's always been
very difficult to point

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:40.370
to a trend in either direction.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.970
But what I will say
is that we noticed

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:46.690
that the vast majority
of these workers

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:48.530
are doing this for
supplemental income.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:52.660
And so this might be 10 hours
a week or 20 hours a week.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.880
And that's in the range of--

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.840
they might make a couple
hundred dollars more,

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.260
in addition to full time work

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
What do you hear from
the drivers themselves?

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.220
What would they like
SherpaShare to do?

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.410
They will definitely like--

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.510
always want to make more money.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:18.260
Yeah, and so whatever we
do can increase the income,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.840
they will love it.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.810
So we basically organize all
our service in in three buckets.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:28.320
The first one is help them
to sort of like manage--

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.690
count their money, right?

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.320
Manage their money.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.470
Second is basically how to help
them to optimize their income.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:37.120
The third bucket
is basically how

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.680
to help them make more money.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.740
So if you look at our
service, basically, we

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.890
provide us some
personal utility tools

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:45.840
to help them to
count their money.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.130
There will be a community.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.160
So with some cross
[INAUDIBLE] information, so

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.270
they can make better
decisions every day.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:56.550
Hopefully they can optimize
their work and maximize income.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.850
The third thing we
eventually will do

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:02.040
is connect them with a
new working opportunity,

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.720
so they can make more money.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.480
Yeah.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.650
And so that's what the
drivers get from you.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:11.980
What's your revenue model?

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:17.170
How do you survive,
and you have investors

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.140
know as a startup
organization, but you

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.840
are a for profit business?

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:27.390
So what's the model
for generating revenue?

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.760
Yeah, so we are an
intermediate layer

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.650
between the on-demand
services and workers.

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:39.780
And so we're also a
layer between workers

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.700
and, other work
related services,

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.920
and worker and consumer, right.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:49.190
So we eventually will make
money from every relationship.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:52.630
So we will start with some
premise of this on the worker

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:56.920
side, then try to make some
money on the company side,

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:01.000
through some marketing and
[INAUDIBLE] kind of things.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.980
So marketing opportunities
for companies,

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.330
and pay for services,
from drivers,

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:11.830
for more premium kind of
information and material.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:12.420
Exactly.

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.710
So an example of that would be
what's most valuable to drivers

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:19.740
now is tracking
mileage, because that's

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:23.680
a direct number they can look
at and use for a tax direction,

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.500
and so that's something where
a lot of other utility services

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.440
charge for, and drivers
are willing to pay for.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.280
So that's one example
on the worker side

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.430
they'll pay for that utility.

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:37.400
And the company
side, they'll see

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.910
that there's a
network of drivers

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:42.280
who have a certain level of
experience in this space.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.070
And of course, those
are potential drivers

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:47.430
that they want to target.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:49.982
So that's, of course, they're
interested in both acquiring

00:13:49.982 --> 00:13:51.440
those drivers and
then once they've

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.580
acquired them, convincing
them to work on a certain day.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:59.990
Yeah, so in some respects, you
can be a recruiting agency,

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:04.660
or help them to identify the
pool of potential drivers

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:05.160
for them.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.120
So that's a really
important service

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.190
because that must
be very difficult,

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:12.570
what do you find is-- how
stable are these drivers?

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:13.850
How long do they stay?

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:15.700
Do they turn over a lot?

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:19.427
What's your experience
telling you?

00:14:19.427 --> 00:14:20.260
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.870
There's a natural turn
for this industry.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:28.130
Yeah, and sometimes we use
a metaphor, travel industry,

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:30.730
so more like the
travel industry.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:35.154
Like every family, they want
travel two to three times

00:14:35.154 --> 00:14:36.320
a year, something like that.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.236
Before this industry
extreme, more like people

00:14:38.236 --> 00:14:41.280
work on and off kind of thing.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.100
So for us it's more like
a we provide a platform

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.700
with data and information
that, whenever

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.630
they decide to do
something in this industry,

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:51.280
they will go to SherpaShare.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:55.100
And hopefully, with
the entire industry

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.390
become more mature,
average higher,

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:00.420
I think the people will
find that this is more

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:04.190
a legit viable work option
for them to make a living.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:07.730
So an example of
that would be someone

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:11.040
who was on boards with
Uber, for example,

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.820
might only really want
that income for a month,

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.340
or a week even, to have
some supplemental income,

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.170
and then leave for six months.

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:20.350
And that's a pattern we
see, where people really

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.457
want someone come for
a fixed period of time,

00:15:22.457 --> 00:15:23.540
and then they might leave.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.300
And the question that we're
always wondering is at--

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.800
and we believe at
some point they'll

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.280
come back, because
they'll want extra income.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:35.410
It's a question of when is
the next phase of their life

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:37.866
where they'll need
supplemental income?

00:15:37.866 --> 00:15:40.240
So it could be students is a
good example, where students

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.700
will-- on our way
over here we had

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.710
an Uber driver who was
also a full time student,

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:45.850
and a full time driver.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:48.090
And he fits in his driving
when he's a student,

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:50.842
but after he's done,
after he graduates,

00:15:50.842 --> 00:15:52.300
he'll probably find
a full time job

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.470
and scale back on the driving.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:16:00.380
So you fit it into sort of the
life courses, people's life

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.920
changes, and responsibilities
change, and time allocations.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:04.420
Right.

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:08.769
And then the other end
is when people are older,

00:16:08.769 --> 00:16:10.310
and they have more
free time, they'll

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:13.780
also become drivers as well.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.740
There are a lot of
controversies in this industry,

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:21.350
as you know, questions
about whether drivers

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.810
should be independent
contractors or employees.

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:34.450
Concerns on some chat rooms
and various online linking

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:38.785
mechanisms that Uber doesn't
really care about the drivers.

00:16:38.785 --> 00:16:39.660
What are you hearing?

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.530
Where are you positioned?

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:43.630
Do you hear these
kinds of things?

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:45.720
Do you see them as credible?

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.660
What's your view of
some of the critiques

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:52.610
of this industry at the moment?

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:57.030
I think some concerns
are true in some degree,

00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:00.700
and we are kind of
happy that we see

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.430
some other groups
supporting workers as well,

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:07.190
and we are honored to be a very
important channel for drivers

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:10.130
to voice out their concerns.

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.990
We actually want to take a
neutral, independent position.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.541
I think that the entire
on-demand industry

00:17:15.541 --> 00:17:16.540
needs protection, right?

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:19.170
So they would definitely
need to protect workers,

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:22.020
but we'll also need to
protect the service side.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:25.569
So I think the better
way is, collect data,

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:29.200
build some channels,
allow them to communicate,

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:34.530
I think eventually they will
find a balance somewhere, yeah.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:38.110
Well I think this role
of providing information

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:44.200
as a basis for fostering more
communications between all

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.300
of the parties who have
a stake in this industry

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:50.070
as an important service
that you're providing.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.630
So help me envision
where you will

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:58.620
be five years from now
what will SherpaShare look

00:17:58.620 --> 00:17:59.890
like if you are successful?

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:04.380
We want to become the
number one support

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:09.040
platform for on-demand
workers around the globe.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.690
And so currently we are only
focused on the driver vertical

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:17.660
only US bucket, but we want
to expand to other verticals

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.880
and other regions as well.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:24.400
So that's we will hope in
the next five years, yes.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.760
So basically all those workers
will be exchanging information

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.500
on our platform, and
so whatever service

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:33.100
they want to work for
whatever opinion they have,

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.510
they're use SherpaShare
as like they're

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:37.740
in the exchange for
that information.

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.202
So your point earlier
about giving them a voice

00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:41.910
is something we really
want to emphasize.

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:45.050
So that we don't necessarily
care what the voice is,

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:49.200
but we give you the channel
to basically express yourself.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:54.060
The ultimate vision, I'm
thinking, is it's more like a--

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.760
drivers say, I have
eight hours for work.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:01.070
And SherpaShare put up a
working portfolio for him,

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:04.360
so he can hit his financial
goal on a daily basis.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:09.550
So they can look at where their
optimal opportunities are,

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:13.160
what times of day,
what days of the week,

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.830
and how to balance that
with all of their other

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:19.410
responsibilities, and
be efficient in making

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:20.986
those choices.

00:19:20.986 --> 00:19:22.110
Well it's very interesting.

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:24.410
It's a very creative
organization.

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:27.830
We appreciate your sharing
your insights with us

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.020
for this course.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.480
We wish you all
the best, and thank

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.550
you very much for
taking the time

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:35.240
to come across the country.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.740
You don't have an Uber
service in the area.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:41.210
So I guess you had to
go by commercial airline

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:43.249
until you land, and
then you could--

00:19:43.249 --> 00:19:44.540
We didn't take Uber helicopter.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.070
You didn't take Uber helicopter.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:49.640
Well maybe some day that will
be part of all of our future.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.841
So, thank you very much.

00:19:50.841 --> 00:19:51.340
Thank you.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.890
Thanks.
