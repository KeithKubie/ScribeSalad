00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:15.160
Do Scientists finally have something less
than depressing to say about global warming?

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:22.940
Hello all! Crystal Dilworth here with DNews
and an interesting development in our attempt

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.690
to understand climate change.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.990
The earth’s temperature is rising and the
process of this change is complicated to say

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.000
the least. Greenhouse gases are building up
in our atmosphere but global air temperatures

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.540
have stopped rising proportionally with these
gases. So where is the heat going? Because

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.120
of water’s incredible ability to absorb
energy before changing temperature … specific

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.040
heat capacity? anyone? anyone? ... *shrug*
our oceans can act as an insulator, absorbing

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.390
heat, and buffering the planet.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.541
Now its true that the temperature at the top
of the ocean is warming and expanding, but

00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:58.149
its not doing so fast enough to explain the
slower growth in air temperatures.

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.500
So could the deep waters and unknown abyss
at the bottom of the ocean be taking up the

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.500
slack?

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.490
To assay how much the rise of our sea levels
and air temperatures was due to the warming

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.970
and expansion of the deepest ocean waters,
Scientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.550
combined data taken from space with measurements
made on earth.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.050
Ocean surface topography data from the JASON
satellites as well as satellite data from

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.650
NASA’s Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment,
were combined with direct measurements of

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.570
ocean temperatures. Now, its really hard to
measure ocean temperature at great depths,

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.960
so researchers used data taken from an army
of floating temperature probes jointly called

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.260
the ARGO array that have been providing information
about the surface temperature of our oceans

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.260
since 2005.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.170
From the total amount of sea level rise, researchers
subtracted the amount of rise from the expansion

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.810
in the upper ocean, and the amount of rise
that came from added meltwater. The remainder

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.430
represented the amount of sea level rise caused
by warming in the deep ocean...But the remainder

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.380
was essentially zero!!

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.350
Apparently, warming in the top half of the
ocean is continuing unabated, but Deep Ocean

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.990
Warming was not contributing to this temperature
change … at least not during the years of

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.700
2005 - 2013.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.760
So what does this mean? Well, for now, it
means that deep sea creatures, are not yet

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.010
feeling the heat from global climate change.
But it also means that scientists will have

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.660
to look elsewhere for their missing energy.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.500
