00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.586
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; For the first row, I just have 2 dimes divided by 3 quarters, or 2 3rd, 2 to

00:00:04.586 --> 00:00:08.471
3. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; For the second row I have 4 to 6. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I know a 2 can to go into the

00:00:08.471 --> 00:00:13.286
numerator and the denominator so, I'm left with 2 3rd. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; And, for 6 to 9 I'm

00:00:13.286 --> 00:00:17.936
also left with 2 3rd. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I can remove a 3 as the common factor. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Notice that

00:00:17.936 --> 00:00:22.782
in every case the ratio stayed the same. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; As we gain 2 coins here, we always

00:00:22.782 --> 00:00:27.539
gain 3 here. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's why the ratio stays constant, 2 to 3. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Even though our

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.342
amounts of dimes and quarters is increasing, the ratio, or that fraction

00:00:32.342 --> 00:00:36.334
comparing their quantities, is always the same. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Pretty neat.
