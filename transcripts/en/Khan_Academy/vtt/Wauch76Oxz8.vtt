00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.880
- [Instructor] So let's
say that I have matrix A

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.720
and its elements.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.460
It's a two-by-two, a, b, c, d.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.540
We have a lot of practice
taking determinants

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.610
of matrices like this.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.560
The determinant of this matrix,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.350
same thing as determinant of a, b, c, d.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.350
It's going to be equal to a
times d, ad, minus b times c.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.150
Now what would happen
if we multiply one row

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.830
of this matrix by a constant?

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.140
What would happen to its determinant?

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.860
Well, let's try it out.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.693
So you have your original,

00:00:35.693 --> 00:00:40.693
the determinant of your
original matrix, a, b, c, d.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.150
I'm just rewriting what
I just did up here.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.983
That's ad

00:00:44.957 --> 00:00:47.000
minus bc.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.380
Now if I were to multiply,

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.750
let's say, this first row by a constant k,

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.880
how would that change the determinant?

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.470
Well, instead of this being
just an a, this is now a ka.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.343
And instead of this being
just a b, it is now a kb.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.521
And so this is equal to k times

00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:08.610
ad minus bc,

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.450
which is the same thing as

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.930
it's equal to k

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.000
times our original
determinant of our matrix A.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.470
So that seems pretty interesting,

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.620
and I encourage you to see that if you,

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.380
instead of doing the first
row, you did the second row,

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.410
you would have gotten the same outcome.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.560
And then you could also verify that look,

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.040
if I multiply both of these
rows by that constant k,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.623
how would that change things?

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.450
Well, then I'm gonna have ka times kd,

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.500
so you're gonna have
a k squeezed in there.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.130
And then you're gonna have kb times kc.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.880
And so this would actually be,

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.770
you could factor out a k squared.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.750
And so this is going to be k squared

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.870
times the determinant of A.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.080
And that can be extended to
a generalized property that,

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.730
if I have some

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.340
n-by-n matrix A,

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.060
then the determinant,

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.943
the determinant of k

00:02:05.943 --> 00:02:08.700
times that n-by-n

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.163
matrix A,

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.130
the determinant of this,

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.080
when I multiply a constant
times all, entire matrix,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.390
I'm multiplying that
constant times all the rows,

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.070
we could say all of the elements.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.620
Well, this is going to be equal to,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.453
pause this video.

00:02:21.453 --> 00:02:23.180
See if you can intuit

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.960
what this general formula is going to be.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.700
You might be tempted to say it's k

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.650
times the determinant of A,

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.270
but remember that's only
if I multiply one row by k.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.970
But if I multiply the entire matrix by k,

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.020
well, then this is going,

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.730
this determinant is going
to be the constant k

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.420
to the nth power

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.200
times the determinant

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.890
of our n-by-n

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.680
matrix A.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.820
And you could see this play
out in a three-by-three case.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.440
In fact, I encourage you to try it out

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.570
with some three-by-threes.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.640
And you could also do a generalized proof

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.860
for an n-by-n case, but
I won't do that now.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.910
This is really just to give you the idea.
