in this energy policy and my answer is

00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:34.839
in this energy policy and my answer is
 

00:13:34.839 --> 00:13:43.829
in this energy policy and my answer is
so far the previous policy is

00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839
so far the previous policy is
 

00:13:43.839 --> 00:13:47.829

consumption I'm rather pessimistic and

00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:47.839
consumption I'm rather pessimistic and
 

00:13:47.839 --> 00:13:51.310
consumption I'm rather pessimistic and
of course it's not that pipeline project

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:51.320
of course it's not that pipeline project
 

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:55.540
of course it's not that pipeline project
is is something which determines our our

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:55.550
is is something which determines our our
 

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.930
is is something which determines our our
our our situation now and our approach

00:13:58.930 --> 00:13:58.940
our our situation now and our approach
 

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:03.430
our our situation now and our approach
to this to this problem in Poland but

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:03.440
to this to this problem in Poland but
 

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.420
to this to this problem in Poland but
also in in Germany in Germany this is

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:07.430
also in in Germany in Germany this is
 

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:11.650
also in in Germany in Germany this is
the problem of the industry which is

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:11.660
the problem of the industry which is
 

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:15.519
the problem of the industry which is
very strong involved in this project and

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:15.529
very strong involved in this project and
 

00:14:15.529 --> 00:14:17.949
very strong involved in this project and
is very influential in the political

00:14:17.949 --> 00:14:17.959
is very influential in the political
 

00:14:17.959 --> 00:14:21.699
is very influential in the political
sphere and this is a project of the some

00:14:21.699 --> 00:14:21.709
sphere and this is a project of the some
 

00:14:21.709 --> 00:14:24.400
sphere and this is a project of the some
parts I wouldn't say the whole of course

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:24.410
parts I wouldn't say the whole of course
 

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:26.920
parts I wouldn't say the whole of course
but this is a problem of course of some

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:26.930
but this is a problem of course of some
 

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:33.600
but this is a problem of course of some
parts of SPD and the way in which this

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:33.610
parts of SPD and the way in which this
 

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.790
parts of SPD and the way in which this
political party would like to to pursue

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800
political party would like to to pursue
 

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.740

the policy toward Russia in in in in
future the second problem related to

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:47.180
future the second problem related to
 

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:51.280
future the second problem related to
this Russian issue is is the stability

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:51.290
this Russian issue is is the stability
 

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:56.410
this Russian issue is is the stability
of the post-soviet region and this is

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:56.420
of the post-soviet region and this is
 

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.319
of the post-soviet region and this is
the question not only of the relations

00:14:59.319 --> 00:14:59.329
the question not only of the relations
 

00:14:59.329 --> 00:15:02.350
the question not only of the relations
between the European Union and enter

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:02.360

to the whole a post-soviet area and my

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:16.430
to the whole a post-soviet area and my
 

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:21.370
to the whole a post-soviet area and my
problem is have we have we really the

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:21.380
problem is have we have we really the
 

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:25.269
problem is have we have we really the
same approach we Europeans and the

00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279
same approach we Europeans and the
 

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:28.540

Russians to this to this ridge of course

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:28.550
Russians to this to this ridge of course
 

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:31.689
Russians to this to this ridge of course
my answer is no this approach is is

00:15:31.689 --> 00:15:31.699
my answer is no this approach is is
 

00:15:31.699 --> 00:15:35.740
my answer is no this approach is is
quite different and what we have to

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:35.750
quite different and what we have to
 

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.559
quite different and what we have to
clarify

00:15:37.559 --> 00:15:37.569
clarify
 

00:15:37.569 --> 00:15:41.439
clarify
with with Germany is what we really

00:15:41.439 --> 00:15:41.449
with with Germany is what we really

maybe my assessment is it's not so it's
 

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:46.090
maybe my assessment is it's not so it's
not correct and the firts a problem

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:46.100
not correct and the firts a problem

to this part of my presentation would be

00:18:06.759 --> 00:18:06.769
to this part of my presentation would be
 

00:18:06.769 --> 00:18:13.950
to this part of my presentation would be
I I think that what we need is ready an

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:13.960
I I think that what we need is ready an
 

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:18.669

Eastern policy but i think that faced

00:18:18.669 --> 00:18:18.679
Eastern policy but i think that faced
 

00:18:18.679 --> 00:18:23.669
Eastern policy but i think that faced
with this dis questions and with this

00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679
with this dis questions and with this
 

00:18:23.679 --> 00:18:27.129
with this dis questions and with this
with this need of clarification what is

00:18:27.129 --> 00:18:27.139
with this need of clarification what is
 

00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:29.019
with this need of clarification what is
the german position what is the polish

00:18:29.019 --> 00:18:29.029
the german position what is the polish
 

00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:31.629
the german position what is the polish
position this Eastern policy which

00:18:31.629 --> 00:18:31.639
position this Eastern policy which
 

00:18:31.639 --> 00:18:34.950
position this Eastern policy which
naturally help us very much in

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960
naturally help us very much in
 

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.169
naturally help us very much in
consolidating this this eastern eastern

00:18:38.169 --> 00:18:38.179
consolidating this this eastern eastern
 

00:18:38.179 --> 00:18:41.169
consolidating this this eastern eastern
policy at this stage maybe in future it

00:18:41.169 --> 00:18:41.179
policy at this stage maybe in future it
 

00:18:41.179 --> 00:18:44.289
policy at this stage maybe in future it
will be easier but now I don't don't

00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:44.299
will be easier but now I don't don't
 

00:18:44.299 --> 00:18:50.100
will be easier but now I don't don't
believe in it the second point is the

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:50.110
believe in it the second point is the
 

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:55.409
believe in it the second point is the
leadership in in Europe so maybe I will

00:18:55.409 --> 00:18:55.419
leadership in in Europe so maybe I will
 

00:18:55.419 --> 00:19:01.480

the situation is much more complex
 

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:45.960
the situation is much more complex
because we have done largement and this

because we have done largement and this
 

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:48.930
because we have done largement and this
is even more difficult to have a good

belgium and so complicated so it's much

00:24:13.769 --> 00:24:13.779
belgium and so complicated so it's much
 

00:24:13.779 --> 00:24:16.409

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.810
states which is of course a very
important question when we consider the

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:15.820
important question when we consider the
 

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.659
