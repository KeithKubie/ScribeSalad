00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.740
You are listening to radio lab radio from w n y.

2
00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:07.170
S c e.

3
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.040
Can I just tell you a story? I don't have a choice. Do I?

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.550
What's the story? This takes me back to when I was 14 uh, Jack Kennedy,

5
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.050
John F. Kennedy was the president and he's very glamorous. I mean you really,

6
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.830
he was on television. He was fun to watch and he would, he,

7
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.140
he would go to mass in my neighborhood in New York when he come to New York,

8
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.660
he go to a particular church all the time. And just out of enthusiasm,

9
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.830
some of my friends and I would go and stand there and watch him.

10
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:41.310
Just walk up the steps with you can even see the president of the United States

11
00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:44.770
and his wife. So you did this multiple times? Many times. Yes. Cause he,

12
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.780
we were big fans and then one day we went to do that and I can't remember

13
00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:52.860
whether he zipped by or zipped in, but anyway, we missed it.

14
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.020
And my friend John had, damn,

15
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.840
but he was a New York kid so he thought it would be interesting.

16
00:00:57.841 --> 00:00:59.760
He knew that the place where President Kenny was staying,

17
00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:01.920
which was a famous hotel on Madison Avenue,

18
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.550
and he came up with this crazy plan that he was going to ask for his aunt when

19
00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:08.220
we walk into the lobby. So the secret service wouldn't have to worry about us.

20
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.260
So we go to the hotel, he does the thing,

21
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.270
we're in the lobby and then crazily the elevator door opens and there is

22
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.540
president Kennedy steps out of the elevator with Jackie. Wow.

23
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.660
She's immediately grabbed by these reporters and they were asking her something

24
00:01:22.661 --> 00:01:24.640
and he's got nothing to do. So he used to politician,

25
00:01:24.641 --> 00:01:29.641
he glances around and I am standing behind the potted plant staring at him.

26
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.810
And so he steps towards the Bush and he reaches over the Bush and goes,

27
00:01:32.811 --> 00:01:34.130
hello young man, or something like that.

28
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.580
And I couldn't speak because there was so much phlegm coming flooding into my

29
00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:39.620
throat that I thought I might drown standing up.

30
00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:42.410
But they took his hand and I shook it

31
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.180
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

32
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.650
<v 0>and then he released,</v>

33
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.380
he went off to do something else and I was just staring at my hand

34
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.620
later that day. I said to my sister, I shook president Kennedy's hand,

35
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.660
and I guess I'm not gonna wash it for like two days, two weeks maybe.

36
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.600
What did she say to you? I don't remember what she said, but,

37
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.510
but that's a funny thing to say.

38
00:02:06.511 --> 00:02:08.880
When 50 years later you're a science reporter.

39
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.963
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

40
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.143
<v 0>look good,</v>

41
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:14.623
<v 1>Huh?</v>

42
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.650
<v 0>Because at the moment I thought, oh, Kennedy on unpopular.</v>

43
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.060
Ooh, I didn't, I didn't know that was true. It was a panic.

44
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.170
Kind of like a dream thing that everybody has. I think with celebrities, I do.

45
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:27.803
<v 1>Okay.</v>

46
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.830
<v 0>But now it turns out we can examine the question scientifically.</v>

47
00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:38.030
There's now a science that can do that. What do you mean? Well,

48
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.900
first of all, we all know this. We're covered with Germans. With bacteria. Yes.

49
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.670
But what I did realize is that there are scientists who say the bacteria,

50
00:02:46.671 --> 00:02:48.950
honest, they clean to us almost like for life,

51
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.160
so you can be identified by your microbes and these scientists are now making

52
00:02:54.501 --> 00:02:59.390
the bold claim that they can check those microbes to solve crimes,

53
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.520
to detect diseases, to do public health kind of things. I thought, well,

54
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:04.740
really I'm going to I,

55
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.750
why not put them to the test areas [inaudible] people and go after this small

56
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:16.470
little bit of personal history I got. So I decided to,

57
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.520
to reproduce the John F. Kennedy,

58
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:21.640
Robert Krulwich handshake as an experiment.

59
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.810
I thought we can, we could have,

60
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:30.040
I could find somebody who would beat President Kennedy who would shake my hand

61
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.770
and we would measure and calculate and see.

62
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.460
So I got a team of producers on our w NYC show,

63
00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:40.690
only human to help me doing this. And we found a scientist,

64
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.090
Jack Jack, Jack. Jack Gilbert is director of the microbiome center,

65
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.620
the University of Chicago.

66
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.550
And then I don't have president Kennedy around anymore, so I got myself,

67
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.590
you're going to be president Kennedy for these purposes.

68
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.830
Substitute President Kennedy. Okay. Can you do a JFK by the way,

69
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.760
our nation will put a man on the moon safely through, no,

70
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.510
no. This is Neil degrasse Tyson,

71
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:07.510
director of the Hayden Planetarium with the American Museum of Natural History

72
00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:09.490
here in New York. Well, have you ever been shot?

73
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.270
Have you ever had your handshake and by a person who you let that you feel like

74
00:04:13.271 --> 00:04:17.720
you'd like to have his or her stuff sustained? Yeah, I, I'm,

75
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.470
I'm not that weird or creepy.

76
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.370
No, this, there's no part of anyone else. I just want to,

77
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.240
<v 2>what about, what about if a, if you got Carl sagans underwear,</v>

78
00:04:30.241 --> 00:04:31.740
would you keep Karl sagans underwear?

79
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.780
<v 0>No, but I have,</v>

80
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.110
I have come to love and embrace all bacteria that want a part of my body.

81
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.050
You are awesome and so am I your man for this.

82
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.380
You absolutely need a man for this and

83
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.510
I will so pick up food that fell on the floor and needed me to do that.

84
00:04:57.511 --> 00:05:00.890
Me Too. I don't even wait five seconds, which is always booked.

85
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.990
We knew it was bullshit. Anyway, I said, let me, let me,

86
00:05:03.991 --> 00:05:06.330
let me explain what it is. Wait, I want to do, I don't think,

87
00:05:06.331 --> 00:05:08.760
no one exactly knows the answer to this question,

88
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.680
but if a person shakes in another person's hands for eight ordinary interval,

89
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.280
then the question is how much a person a lands on person B and how much of

90
00:05:19.471 --> 00:05:23.120
person a stays on person B, but most crucially fork.

91
00:05:23.121 --> 00:05:27.720
How long presumably there's an exchange. Yes. So we're, we're nicking off.

92
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.160
You do back and forth. No Miss Hands though. Now that I'm looking at them, it's,

93
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.830
I know when I tried to find gloves it doesn't work. So it's three x l.

94
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.740
All right, so, so just so you,

95
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.450
we can give us like the fact that you are carrying all these microbes on you.

96
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.430
First of all, where are they predominately,

97
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.860
<v 2>sorry. Every mucosal surface in your body, so your mouth,</v>

98
00:05:47.861 --> 00:05:52.210
your gastrointestinal tract, all the way down your skin, your fingernails,

99
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:56.590
you urogenital tract, your is every part of you that your butt, your butt,

100
00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.380
especially your butt is covered in bacteria. And just sitting here,

101
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.150
you're actually releasing into the air around you think pig pen from the peanuts

102
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:09.950
cartoon. Remember about 36 million bacterial cells an hour. So every minute,

103
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.800
how do they come off of me? They are literally leaving on the,

104
00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.750
on the surface of your skin cells that you're shedding and through your rest

105
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.040
respirations coming out of your nose and your mouth. Okay. Also detaching.

106
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.850
So they, a lot of them on,

107
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.620
they dry out on the surface and they can literally just drift off as dust or so.

108
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.870
But just so you understand this, the, the, uh,

109
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.010
the anatomy of the room all over this room on the doorknob,

110
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.900
on the table surface, on his pants, on the desk, and on the chairs,

111
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.860
there's Neal everywhere. A lot of them had, um, colonic kneel, right?

112
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:42.980
So a lot of them actually coming out of his, out of your pants, right?

113
00:06:42.981 --> 00:06:46.640
And there they are on the surface of the chair and they deposit final Patina of

114
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:49.310
multi syllabic word. But we, I think we understand what you're

115
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.540
[inaudible] is it just, it's the largest resource.

116
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.530
It's there just to get out of me. And it does cry all the time. All the time.

117
00:06:57.531 --> 00:07:02.150
So that means this is not a bathroom or boxes of chairs would have the most.

118
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.750
Yes. All right, so now let me just time question real quick. So Jay,

119
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.020
so Jack needs about 20 minutes to do for us to do this handshake.

120
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.690
That's by the way producer Kenny Malone. Why don't we,

121
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.800
why don't we start the experiment now and then we have time to talk in between.

122
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.630
Okay. All right. What are you going to do?

123
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.210
So what we're going to do is we have little tests.

124
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.170
I'm not offering you my butthole, [inaudible] and Tyson.

125
00:07:24.171 --> 00:07:28.580
It doesn't mean I'm offering you my micro stand up. Sony's in front of me.

126
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.560
You we're going to do hands. Absolutely.

127
00:07:30.561 --> 00:07:33.120
So we have these little stare out tubes, reach tubes,

128
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.320
they will green cap tube has a sterile swab in it with a,

129
00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:37.490
with a completely sterile tip.

130
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.410
We're going to open that up and very quickly rub very vigorously each of your

131
00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:43.610
hands. So your palm,

132
00:07:43.611 --> 00:07:47.060
the inside of your fingers and we're going to do that very big scene and put it

133
00:07:47.061 --> 00:07:49.640
as quickly as possible back into this, there on this your control sample.

134
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.020
This is the start starter. Okay.

135
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.470
Then you are going to shake hands with the a young man over there.

136
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.900
Right with Robert. And we're going to definitely,

137
00:07:56.901 --> 00:08:01.760
I try and see how many you have received from Neil and how many Neil is received

138
00:08:01.761 --> 00:08:02.570
from Robert.

139
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:02.781
<v 3>Wait,</v>

140
00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:07.640
he is swabbing your hands before you handshake so that he can figure out what's

141
00:08:07.641 --> 00:08:10.340
the baseline that you've got on both of your hands. [inaudible] right.

142
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.640
And he sure you're going to have different bacteria on your, on your hands,

143
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:14.570
you and Neil. Yes.

144
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.310
<v 2>So this is where it gets very interesting.</v>

145
00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:20.630
So you have very specific types of bacteria and he has very specific types of

146
00:08:20.631 --> 00:08:22.310
bacteria, but they're unique to you.

147
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.680
<v 3>I mean I guess like, I mean like if I just think about it for a second,</v>

148
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:27.500
like the two of you had different days, you arrive in this office,

149
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:31.010
you've probably touched different places, you've eaten different things.

150
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:34.310
So okay, maybe you have a little bit of difference. But in general, hmm.

151
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:38.450
You are both men living in New York City breathing the same air,

152
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.460
riding the same subways. Exactly.

153
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:44.870
So why would you be that different from one another? Well,

154
00:08:44.871 --> 00:08:48.710
because there's one very important difference between us. Oh, okay.

155
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:49.970
We have different mothers.

156
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.090
<v 2>So have you been told anything? Like what?</v>

157
00:08:54.091 --> 00:08:56.640
This is about a little bit about the microbiome,

158
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.130
<v 5>but I'm happy to hear more. This is Dr Chavonne Dolan.</v>

159
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.520
I'm an obstetrician gynecologist and I'm actually a clinical geneticist as well.

160
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.580
And we brought her in because she knows more than most of a when it comes to

161
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:08.010
moms and babies. During my training years,

162
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.670
probably delivered a hundred babies a year. So that was about 500 babies.

163
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.880
Then I was in private practice at Yale new haven hospital for a bunch of years

164
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.630
and I probably delivered another couple hundred and I have three kids myself.

165
00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:21.050
So I was on, I was on the other side as well. Okay.

166
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:25.470
And she says as a fetus before you're born, you're, you know,

167
00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:28.110
exposed to what's in the amniotic fluid.

168
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.530
But it's a pretty clean set up in utero.

169
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:36.680
But then you go through the vagina and the vagina is just a host of bacteria and

170
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.980
you know, he [inaudible] amniotic fluid. There's blood.

171
00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:45.310
<v 6>And this moment is in essence, your bacterial baptism. Right, exactly.</v>

172
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:49.810
Because at this point you're this pristine, unadulterated hunk of biomass,

173
00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:54.420
<v 5>the bacteria, they're like, yeah, give me a ride. I'm going to jump on.</v>

174
00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.360
<v 6>Yeah. The bacteria colonize that, that surface cause that's what bacteria do.</v>

175
00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:01.780
And so finally, when the baby's born,

176
00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:04.510
the doctors, they take it,

177
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.680
<v 5>you make sure they're stable breathing and then right up onto mom to start to</v>

178
00:10:08.681 --> 00:10:11.470
immediately promote the bonding and the skin to skin.

179
00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:14.590
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

180
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:18.130
<v 5>in your own case, if you can remember like what happened,</v>

181
00:10:18.131 --> 00:10:22.490
like what I remember is just crabbing for him, like your mind and I,

182
00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:25.930
I've been waiting nine months to meet you and here you are.

183
00:10:25.931 --> 00:10:29.890
And like just kind of embracing him and looking in his eyes.

184
00:10:29.891 --> 00:10:33.460
And so there's a third of bonding there that I will never forget.

185
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.070
<v 6>And in the same moment you're going to get some micro bonding too. Um, it's a,</v>

186
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.850
it's a very dynamic. Yeah. Hug and bacteria go pew.

187
00:10:41.851 --> 00:10:44.830
They leap from the mom's skin onto the baby. Um, I,

188
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.710
I did this for both my children. I,

189
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.410
I took both of them onto my bare chest at birth. And,

190
00:10:49.411 --> 00:10:52.650
but you wanted to compete against your wife, Huh? Absolutely.

191
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.790
Maybe a little bit of daddy was a, was a helpful thing, you know, who knows? So,

192
00:10:56.791 --> 00:11:00.960
yeah, I uh, that, that was the reason I did it. And the thing is, well,

193
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.060
we'll start, so I'll, I'll take your first one.

194
00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.720
You just strains of bacteria that we get in those first few hours. Okay.

195
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.180
I'm sorry. Give me a right hand. And then to a lesser degree,

196
00:11:09.181 --> 00:11:11.910
the bacteria that we meet later in the first year of our life,

197
00:11:11.911 --> 00:11:16.110
when we stick weird things in our mouth at the dog comes by. You're ready? Yup.

198
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:20.580
Those strains of bacteria stick with us forever. God, nope.

199
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.320
I'm gonna swap it as much as possible. Even the bacteria, the Jack,

200
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:28.860
we'll find it tickles now in Neil's hand, rub it on my hand.

201
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.410
All over the finger between okay.

202
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:35.940
Are descendants of those first moments of contact area and I'm okay.

203
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.600
And crazily enough. Gotcha.

204
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:44.040
Even if you try to get rid of your bacterial inheritance, you know,

205
00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:46.350
put up Savlon, get rid of all your skin bacteria,

206
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:49.020
take lots of antibiotics and get rid of all you're telling me bacteria,

207
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:52.290
and then move to some completely different part of the world where the food is

208
00:11:52.291 --> 00:11:54.220
different than the different still

209
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.020
<v 0>the bacteria you got from your mom will come creeping back. Why, why would they,</v>

210
00:11:59.021 --> 00:12:00.850
why would that be? Well,

211
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.470
<v 8>the thing in ecology called the founder effect,</v>

212
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.720
whereby the first organisms to get there and to be successful in an environment,

213
00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.420
um, they alter the trajectory of the rest of the ecosystem and change how it

214
00:12:15.421 --> 00:12:20.340
develops, right? So, you know, if a tree species interrupt the tree,

215
00:12:20.341 --> 00:12:23.280
lands on an island and, and becomes dominant,

216
00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:27.300
then it will support the types of birds and the types of monkeys and the types

217
00:12:27.301 --> 00:12:31.610
of insects that love that type of tree. Um, and so the same is true in,

218
00:12:31.611 --> 00:12:34.560
in the microbiome. So you, you know, you have a,

219
00:12:34.561 --> 00:12:37.320
a lifelong partnership with the bacteria you interacted with.

220
00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:42.510
<v 0>So we know that Neil and I each have a unique mix of microbes almost to the</v>

221
00:12:42.511 --> 00:12:45.810
point where they're like a fingerprint. But if we shake hands,

222
00:12:45.811 --> 00:12:49.770
just a mere hello handshake, how much of his is going to get on me,

223
00:12:49.771 --> 00:12:53.280
how much of mine is going to get on him and most important of all is how long

224
00:12:53.281 --> 00:12:56.760
will the exchange microbially last.

225
00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.600
<v 2>So next step you guys got to shake hands.</v>

226
00:12:58.601 --> 00:13:00.910
I want you to shake hands like just as if you were meeting in the hall and you

227
00:13:00.911 --> 00:13:05.410
were like, Hey Neil or hey Robert, nice to meet you and just shake hands.

228
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:09.530
Okay. Yep, they're ready now I have to like think about how to actually shake

229
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:15.520
[inaudible] to three Robert

230
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:19.091
[inaudible]. Okay,

231
00:13:19.091 --> 00:13:24.091
now right hand go can feel like I'm going to grab my index finger too cause you

232
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:28.400
got to look on the palms. Didn't, didn't touch her as much as me.

233
00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:32.650
And so every five minutes for the next 20 minutes and then we're going to swap

234
00:13:32.651 --> 00:13:33.484
your hand again.

235
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:37.390
Jack Swab both Neil's hand and my hand actually pulling off a slight Patina of

236
00:13:37.391 --> 00:13:38.120
bacteria. But yeah,

237
00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:42.200
<v 0>just checking to see if any bacteria moved and for how long. So wait, wait,</v>

238
00:13:42.201 --> 00:13:45.200
what happened? Did he did? Yeah. Wait, what happened? Wow.

239
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.350
Why would I tell you now when we have the advantage of a short break,

240
00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:51.440
we'll be right back.

241
00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:57.723
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

242

<v 0>hello, this is Tom leads from Oaklawn, Illinois radio lab and need your help,</v>

247
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.100
please visit w n y c Dot.

248
00:14:22.101 --> 00:14:26.510
Podcasting survey.com and tell them a little bit about yourself and the podcast

249
00:14:26.511 --> 00:14:29.930
you love and a five minute anonymous survey I did.

250
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.650
You can find the link on the show page for this episode Radio Lab.

251
00:14:33.651 --> 00:14:35.000
Really appreciate your help.

252
00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:38.900
Knowing more about you helps them make more of the shows that you enjoy.

253
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:40.130
Thank you very much.

254
00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.150
Jad Robert Radiolab. By the way,

255
00:14:46.151 --> 00:14:49.510
do you have a hint as the outcome of this thing that we've just done like, okay.

256
00:14:49.511 --> 00:14:52.070
Just before we went to break, Robert Neil had just

257
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:56.710
<v 6>shaking hands and Jack Gilbert was going to swap those hands right while minutes</v>

258
00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.680
off the handshake and then around every five minutes for about 25 minutes.

259
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.750
What exactly does he do after he swaps him? He takes the,

260
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:07.550
takes our bacteria back to the lab and he identifies our bacteria by their DNA.

261
00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:11.600
Yeah, that's exactly it. I mean it's true. This is a whole new science,

262
00:15:11.601 --> 00:15:15.710
isn't it? I mean like there are a thousand things you could wonder about. Well,

263
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.640
yes, it is a whole new science. It's the science that is on the cutting edge.

264
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:23.840
We know we're still researching and developing it and it will take many years

265
00:15:23.841 --> 00:15:25.880
before we were ready for prime time, but Jackson has,

266
00:15:25.881 --> 00:15:29.210
they are now at the phase where they can look into all kinds of different

267
00:15:29.211 --> 00:15:33.680
applications for this new microbiome detecting ability. Take for example,

268
00:15:33.681 --> 00:15:34.514
forensics.

269
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:39.640
Imagine if somebody comes into a room and doesn't evil deed right now.

270
00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:44.150
We know that when somebody interacts with that space for 15 minutes,

271
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:48.500
they leave behind enough of the signature too for us to be able to detect 30

272
00:15:48.501 --> 00:15:49.560
minutes later, Huh.

273
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:53.600
If I had to pick between three people or four people that were to break into a

274
00:15:53.601 --> 00:15:54.434
room,

275
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:57.770
there's a good possibility that I could detect which one of them had broken into

276
00:15:57.771 --> 00:16:01.340
that room. Wow. And they're only going to get better and better. He says,

277
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.940
do you think maybe one day you'll be able to track somebody like outside moving,

278
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:09.050
moving around purely on the, based on the bacteria that they leave behind?

279
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.820
That's exactly what we're investigating.

280
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.590
He also says being able to identify bacteria in a town sewer system will be

281
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.680
really useful in helping us to predict a potential outbreak by noticing that

282
00:16:20.721 --> 00:16:23.450
there's a disease causing bacteria right in the sewage.

283
00:16:23.451 --> 00:16:26.600
So you can go to town and before anyone begins to show symptoms,

284
00:16:26.601 --> 00:16:29.420
you could say something like, wait a second, we've got a quarantine, vaccinate,

285
00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:32.180
we gotta do something here and nip it in the bud, if you will,

286
00:16:32.181 --> 00:16:35.120
before it becomes a problem. And as you may have heard,

287
00:16:35.121 --> 00:16:38.750
there's plenty of research looking at the microbiome inside of you.

288
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.300
It's revolutionizing medicine. I mean,

289
00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:45.680
we already have evidence that we can determine whether somebody will have a bad

290
00:16:45.681 --> 00:16:49.940
response to a drug based on the bacteria that are present inside them.

291
00:16:49.941 --> 00:16:54.020
So we can screen them using their microbiome to determine if they have that

292
00:16:54.021 --> 00:16:58.520
likely outcome. But for now, come on. Yes, come on. It's not true.

293
00:16:58.521 --> 00:17:02.180
This absolutely crucial and breathtaking experiment.

294
00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.750
So let me just quickly remind you of the situation. When we last left you,

295
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.130
you and I.

296
00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:10.130
So a couple of weeks later we got the results from Jack and so I decided to go

297
00:17:10.131 --> 00:17:14.360
to Neil to deliver them. Right. And just to set up expectations here,

298
00:17:14.361 --> 00:17:18.370
Jack told us what he expected was immediately after our handshake.

299
00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.880
A little bit of me would be on Neil,

300
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:24.980
a little bit of Neal would be on me and that we know pretty fast the bacteria

301
00:17:24.981 --> 00:17:28.280
would die and be gone. However,

302
00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:32.330
I am very happy to say that. Isn't that what happened?

303
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:37.450
What percentage change would you guess you caused on me of me on you?

304
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:43.720
A 10% 10% that I, I can't imagine it.

305
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:48.980
I would say 1% 10%, but not much. Less than 1%.

306
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:49.980
While it

307
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.290
<v 0>was less than 10 [inaudible] when they came back,</v>

308
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.800
it was a significantly less than 10. Okay.

309
00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:02.670
It was zero. Zero. Well, it can't be zero.

310
00:18:02.671 --> 00:18:06.300
It'd be below there, whatever it is. Right. Okay.

311
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:09.030
Actually they found a teeny number of bacteria, but they died.

312
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:13.920
There was essentially nothing. Nothing from Neal. Yes. Nothing.

313
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.290
It's just, it's just, it's just odd.

314
00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.140
<v 8>Should I put it that way? I mean, um, that was quite shocking.</v>

315
00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:24.120
We were expecting there to be a lot more bacteria being transferred and,

316
00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.610
and to have an exchange of microbes so that, you know, yeah,

317
00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.460
one person picks up 10 bacteria, the other person picks up, you know, 10,

318
00:18:30.461 --> 00:18:31.390
12 bacteria.

319
00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.000
<v 0>I didn't think you might've washed your hand immediately. Previous,</v>

320
00:18:34.001 --> 00:18:37.400
I don't think. No, no. There was no, no, no sabotage or anything.

321
00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:42.520
Use an alcohol wipe. But I hate antibacterial. I don't use,

322
00:18:42.521 --> 00:18:45.340
what do you call the, um, Purell? I never use any of it.

323
00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:48.910
So for reasons that are at this moment totally unknown,

324
00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:53.280
Neil's bacteria simply failed completely to, uh,

325
00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:54.603
affect my hand.

326
00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:59.050
The other side of this equation is what would you guess the presence of my

327
00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.480
microbes on you was? Percentage. Okay.

328
00:19:01.481 --> 00:19:06.481
What I know from physics of surfaces is if they have approximately the same

329
00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:12.460
coefficient of friction, then it's, it's a complete two way street.

330
00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.050
So if I gave you nothing you would have given me nothing is my guess.

331
00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.160
Here's what happened.

332
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:23.240
<v 8>He definitely picked up bacteria from you and that led to quite substantial</v>

333
00:19:23.491 --> 00:19:24.300
disruption.

334
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:28.140
<v 0>It turns out I smog your hand.</v>

335
00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.960
You telling me you were skank nasty. I

336
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:37.120
told you what happened. They don't understand what happened.

337
00:19:37.121 --> 00:19:40.630
Skank I came on funky.

338
00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:45.690
The percentage before the handshake was that you and I were 60% the same,

339
00:19:46.571 --> 00:19:47.740
40% different

340
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.410
<v 8>post shake. You were more than 75% correlated</v>

341
00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:53.973
to you.

342
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:59.110
<v 0>You made him more you by 15% at least I was swerving all over again.</v>

343
00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:03.290
I'm slightly proud and kind of trouble, but at the same time,

344
00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.720
not only did you get my microbes,

345
00:20:05.721 --> 00:20:10.160
but my kept staying and staying and staying every time they swamp.

346
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:14.330
I was still there six minutes later, 12 minutes later. That's nasty.

347
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.940
Could it have been an hour later? I might might still be on his hand.

348
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.500
<v 8>Yeah. I mean I'm, there's no indication that they were in decay</v>

349
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:22.890
<v 0>when I left. You were covered with</v>

350
00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.270
let the record show he beat his chest. In that moment

351
00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.790
<v 8>it looks like there was a possibility that they,</v>

352
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.640
some of them could have gone on ad infinitum

353
00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.340
<v 0>and then for night. And what do you mean?</v>

354
00:20:34.341 --> 00:20:36.290
Even though you think that I might stay on him?

355
00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:37.010
<v 8>Oh,</v>

356
00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:41.380
what I think is that there's a high probability that some of those organisms,

357
00:20:41.381 --> 00:20:45.580
once they set up shop on his hand in those initial 20 minutes could stay on his

358
00:20:45.581 --> 00:20:46.090
hand. What

359
00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:48.070
<v 0>do you mean like forever? Like forever and ever?</v>

360
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:52.600
<v 6>There is a possibility. There is a possibility. Precisely.</v>

361
00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.073
<v 10>Uh,</v>

362
00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:02.110
<v 6>do we have any idea whether what we've just described is typical of a common</v>

363
00:21:02.111 --> 00:21:06.560
handshake experience? My, my gut feeling is this is atypical. Why I'll wait,

364
00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:08.650
because they may be out all out competed.

365
00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.830
Jack says to understand just how strange this result is.

366
00:21:11.831 --> 00:21:15.460
Let me think about it this way. Two hands coming together,

367
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:16.970
<v 8>taking a right in forest.</v>

368
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:22.060
I'm from Bolivia in extra and dumping it on top of a rain forest in Brazil.

369
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:22.810
And,

370
00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.890
and wondering whether any of the trees from the Bolivian rainforest will take

371
00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:30.530
root and you know, and uh, adapt and become prolific in that environment. Oh,

372
00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:34.130
so the invaders don't really have a huge shot here. Then, you know,

373
00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:37.120
you'll bacteria have home field advantage.

374
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:39.700
They are abundant and they are dominant in that environment.

375
00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:44.170
So we would generally suspect that very quickly the invading microbes start to

376
00:21:44.171 --> 00:21:48.760
die. That killed off. Um, they starve and they just become inactive.

377
00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:51.940
<v 6>So it's happens and it's over and nobody wins. Precisely.</v>

378
00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.070
There's mutual decay.

379
00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:59.950
So am I now a successful invasive species on his hands where some of your

380
00:21:59.951 --> 00:22:03.610
microbes are successful invasive species, but yeah, absolutely.

381
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.580
How would you explain my success?

382
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:11.050
What we think actually happened is that something disrupted Neil's ecosystem,

383
00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.400
right? Um,

384
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.840
and we think based on the analysis that there was a strip to caucus,

385
00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:20.200
which is usually quite rare, but that doesn't sound so good step to caucus.

386
00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:22.360
Well there are lots of species of streptococcus,

387
00:22:22.361 --> 00:22:24.190
but not all of them are pathogenic.

388
00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:29.140
So there was a strip to caucus that was very abundant on your hand at the

389
00:22:29.141 --> 00:22:33.790
beginning that was transferred to Nielsen and we see that transfer occurring and

390
00:22:33.791 --> 00:22:36.040
that streptococcus somehow, um,

391
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:41.130
disrupted Neil's ecosystem and allowed for a greater transfer of bacteria from

392
00:22:42.611 --> 00:22:45.670
your hand to his hand. Oh man, that's so interesting.

393
00:22:45.671 --> 00:22:49.240
So you have like a little band of like murderous little bacteria and then when

394
00:22:49.241 --> 00:22:52.270
and, and, and, and cleared away the forest and then let,

395
00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.850
so that the rest of you could come in and colonize. I don't know.

396
00:22:54.851 --> 00:22:58.180
I don't think anybody knows the answer to that question. All I know is that I'm,

397
00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:00.560
I'm all over the map.

398
00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:04.540
<v 0>I don't mind some of Robert slathered on my body. That's fine.</v>

399
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.410
Do you feel any defensiveness towards the fact that he managed to

400
00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:12.690
<v 6>conquer your microbiome and yet yours was unable to do the same to him?</v>

401
00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:17.880
<v 0>That by the way, is producer Simon Adler. So the word conquer in that context,</v>

402
00:23:17.881 --> 00:23:22.881
I would reword the sentence and say my microbiome was perfectly content staying

403
00:23:23.101 --> 00:23:23.934
where it is

404
00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:32.190
and apparently Robert's microbiome can't wait to get the hell off his body,

405
00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:34.963
man.

406
00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:39.420
I came here thinking I would find out how long President Kennedy stayed on me.

407
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:44.340
Now there's suddenly a new question because if he's a cool cucumber,

408
00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:46.130
it's I want you stayed on him.

409
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.153
Yeah.

410
00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.390
<v 11>I believe in this nation.</v>

411
00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:03.930
[inaudible] turn and turn safely. Say you're here.

412
00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:06.730
<v 1>Mm.</v>

413
00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:09.270
<v 0>Yeah. Maybe you're the anomaly. Yeah.</v>

414
00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:14.130
You're the creepy sweaty man with wet palms. That's what you come here for.

415
00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:15.660
Like the repast

416
00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:22.503
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

417
00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.460
system such as you

418
00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:33.050
need an old immovable object like me.

419
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.380
You can, as your resume,

420
00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:42.570
something's gotta give something's gotta give something to God.

421
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:48.950
<v 0>Big thanks to astrophysicist and author Neil degrasse Tyson for putting up with</v>

422
00:24:49.221 --> 00:24:54.020
this shenanigans. I can go five days without a shower and you wouldn't know it.

423
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.330
The man is smelling his armpits for the moment,

424
00:24:56.331 --> 00:25:00.920
but with just the look that moment like I just don't smell.

425
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:01.780
You want me smell your art?

426
00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.060
I don't want you to just wonder if it smells terrible.

427
00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:09.070
Then if you on the way to smelling Ben. Oh yes.

428
00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:11.160
But it's not repulsive. I'm never

429
00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:21.720
<v 1>[inaudible] has got a gift.</v>

430
00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:31.080
<v 3>This story was produced by Simon Adler.</v>

431
00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:33.690
<v 0>Big thanks to Jared, myself,</v>

432
00:25:33.691 --> 00:25:36.180
who did a lot of the technical work of the lab work that gave us higher

433
00:25:36.181 --> 00:25:41.181
microbial analysis also to the Montefiore medical center also to science writer

434
00:25:41.761 --> 00:25:43.920
and author Ed Young, whose book I contain.

435
00:25:43.921 --> 00:25:48.921
Multitudes is a primer on all things microbiomics and it was talking to ed where

436
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.630
I began thinking, Oh yeah, that Jack Kennedy handshake.

437
00:25:51.631 --> 00:25:53.040
So that's how this whole thing got started.

438
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.500
And then when things really got going,

439
00:25:55.530 --> 00:26:00.120
that's when the team at Wny sees only human kicked in. That's Amanda Aronchick,

440
00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:04.200
Elaine Chan, Kenny Malone, Julian Weinberger. These are the ones who were,

441
00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:09.300
who were with me all the way and stuck with this whole crazy thing with the

442
00:26:09.301 --> 00:26:10.500
swabs and whatever.

443
00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.160
<v 3>And speaking of which, if you want to get in on the action,</v>

444
00:26:13.161 --> 00:26:17.330
this is kind of cool. Uh, so, uh, the whole JFK situation that Robert just did,

445
00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:22.370
you can kind of do it to this company called ubiome has offered the chance 4,000

446
00:26:22.881 --> 00:26:25.580
listeners, a thousand listeners to get sent some swabs,

447
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:29.090
which you will swipe on your hand, put it in a envelope, I assume,

448
00:26:29.091 --> 00:26:29.880
and then mail it back.

449
00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.600
They will sequence it and then tell you all the stuff that's on your hand.

450
00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.450
And you can start that whole process by going to our website,

451
00:26:35.451 --> 00:26:38.550
radiolab.org or only human.next

452
00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:39.870
<v 0>week. They are putting on their own show,</v>

453
00:26:39.871 --> 00:26:44.100
which involves a microbial robbery that is, can catch the robber.

454
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:47.220
<v 1>If all you can see you the microbes. I believe your house figures into that.</v>

455
00:26:47.221 --> 00:26:50.310
Yes. There's an actual robbery in my home. Yes.

456
00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:53.040
And also go to our website because along with only human,

457
00:26:53.041 --> 00:26:58.041
we are putting up a very short animation of the handshake situation done by Nate

458
00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:03.660
Milton, which is a, it's just gloriously weird.

459
00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:07.200
Oh, a quick reminder. You can listen to radio lab anytime on Spotify.

460
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.920
Good yet I would shake your hand, but I.
