they just short an episode so they

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600
they just short an episode so they
 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.060
they just short an episode so they

furthers the story but I think all that

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800
furthers the story but I think all that
 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.740
furthers the story but I think all that

there I guess in some respects it's a

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340
there I guess in some respects it's a
 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.040
there I guess in some respects it's a
bit more realistic not to have the first

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050
bit more realistic not to have the first
 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.680
bit more realistic not to have the first
attempt succeed but it's also realistic

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690
attempt succeed but it's also realistic
 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.900
attempt succeed but it's also realistic
that Appa would most likely eat Momo at

that Appa would most likely eat Momo at
 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.460
that Appa would most likely eat Momo at
some point but that doesn't mean to want

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470
some point but that doesn't mean to want
 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.470
some point but that doesn't mean to want
to see it when the episode finally does

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480
to see it when the episode finally does
 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.270
to see it when the episode finally does
get going with the real plan in part two

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280
get going with the real plan in part two
 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.759

it's great it's a lot of fun it's just

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769
it's great it's a lot of fun it's just
 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.979
it's great it's a lot of fun it's just
seeing through part one that isn't bad

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989
seeing through part one that isn't bad
 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.830
seeing through part one that isn't bad
but it isn't necessary either probably a

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840
but it isn't necessary either probably a
 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.720
but it isn't necessary either probably a
nitpick but like I said this is the

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730
nitpick but like I said this is the
