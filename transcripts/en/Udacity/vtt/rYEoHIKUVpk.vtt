00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.850
Up until now, we've been assuming a connection between related individuals. It's

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.170
a rather fundamental assumption. So fundamental, we don't even know we do it.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.830
&gt;&gt; Well, that's because it goes without saying. At some point,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.500
we all had to have a biological mother and a biological father.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.482
&gt;&gt; And this is true. But for our purposes, it's important to make

00:00:17.482 --> 00:00:17.920
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.990
An explicit connection about the traits we share as a

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.110
family as well as the genetic component that we also

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.920
share. Here are two pictures of my parents, my biological

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.600
mom and my biological dad. Take a look at both

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.850
and which do you think I look most like? Do

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.100
you think I look more like my mom or more

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.590
like my dad? Oh, Matt, that's a tough one. I

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.320
think I'm going to have to go with your mom, though.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so, too.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.800
Outside of our appearance, though, we may identify with

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.060
one parent or another because we may share a

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.540
particular trait that's visible or hidden, innate, or learned.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.110
But it really raises a more interesting question. Why

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.290
do some of our traits looks like one parent,

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.260
and other traits look like the other? So if

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.680
you're familiar with your bioloical parents, who do you

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.690
think you most resemble? Check the box that applies.
