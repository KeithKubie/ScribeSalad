00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.520
The Sun is White... and 8 other Astronomy
Facts

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.520
1.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.030
The energy required to stop the Earth orbiting
the sun is about 2.6478 × 10^33 joules or

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:21.320
7.3551 × 10^29 watt hours or 6.3285*10^17
megatons of TNT.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.859
For reference, the largest nuclear explosion
ever detonated (the Tsar Bomba by the Soviet

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.999
Union) produced 50 megatons of TNT worth of
energy.

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:37.520
So assuming the Earth wouldn’t be obliterated
in the process, it would take about 12,657,000,000,000,000

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.170
of those nuclear bombs detonated at the correct
location to stop the Earth in its tracks.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.440
2.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:56.100
In 2011, astronomers discovered an enormous
12 billion year old water reservoir floating

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.790
in space estimated to be about the volume
of 140 trillion Earth oceans!

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.940
This further confirmed the theory that water
has been present in the universe for much

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.670
of its existence, with our universe about
13.8 billion years old.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.670
(QF 723)

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.670
3.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.490
Russian cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev has spent
more time in space than any other human in

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.490
history.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.490
How long?

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.580
803 days, 9 hours and 39 minutes.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.080
That is approximately 2.2 years, over the
span of six spaceflights.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.080
(QF 775)

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.080
4.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.659
You are simultaneously hurtling around the
sun at 66,600 mph while sitting on a rock

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.000
that is spinning at 1,070 mph.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.390
On top of that, our whole solar system is
rocketing through space around the center

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.870
of the Milky Way at around 559,234 mph.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:50.659
On top of that, our galaxy is hurtling through
space at around 671,080 mph, with respect

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.450
to our local group of galaxies.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.860
On top of that, for all we know, our entire
Universe is hurtling through some unknown

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.770
medium at some other ridiculous speed.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:00.770
5.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.030
It takes approximately 225 million Earth years
for our solar system to make one trip around

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.030
the Milky Way.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.590
Our solar system has made this trip approximately
20.4 times since it formed about 4.6 billion

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.150
Earth years ago.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.150
6.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.829
In 5 to 6 billion years, the Sun will be around
the peak of its Red Giant phase, and according

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.999
to many of the latest models, even with the
Sun losing quite a bit of mass during this

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:28.779
process, thus making the Earth’s orbit farther
out, the Sun should just barely consume the

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:29.779
Earth.

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:33.439
This won’t matter match to us though as
in about 1 to 2 billion years or so, the Sun’s

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:37.459
brightness will have increased sufficiently
to vaporize all water on the surface of the

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:38.459
Earth.

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.019
Bottom line, at some point in the next billion
years or so, humans will need to either find

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.620
another home, or figure out how to manually
move our current one to a farther out orbit,

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.419
keeping Earth in the changing habitable zone
of our solar system.

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:51.419
7.

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:56.779
The dwarf planet Pluto takes 248 Earth years
to orbit the Sun; meaning that since its discovery

00:02:56.779 --> 00:03:00.799
in 1930, it has only traveled around 33% of
its orbit.

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:01.799
(QF 511)

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:02.799
8.

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.529
While it only takes 8 minutes and 19 seconds
for the light from the surface of the sun

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:12.419
to reach Earth, it actually takes about 10,000-170,000
years for a photon to travel from the core

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:14.719
of the sun to the surface.

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:15.719
9.

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:19.569
If you could look at the Sun outside of our
atmosphere (without blinding yourself), you’d

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.879
see that the Sun actually is white in the
human visual spectrum, not yellow, despite

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:39.319
being classified as a yellow dwarf.
