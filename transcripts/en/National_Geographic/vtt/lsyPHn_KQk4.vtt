00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:06.005
Mark:<i> My years in Yosemite were
the best years of my life.</i>

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:07.573
<i>That was where I was training</i>

00:00:07.573 --> 00:00:09.642
<i> and I was learning the
skills of big wall climbing.</i>

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:14.080
<i>And I wanted to find walls
that people hadn't done before</i>

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.116
<i> and I wanted to pioneer
 my own routes.</i>

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.052
<i>But, you know what conclusion
 that I did come to</i>

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:22.455
<i> from going on all
 these expeditions?</i>

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:26.225
<i> Climbing is kind of,
 a selfish pursuit.</i>

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:29.696 line:0%
( audience applause )

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:32.165 line:0%
So, I start thinking,
"What can I do with this

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:34.367
with these skills that I've
built up as a climber."

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:37.937
<i>And I come across this issue
 of National Geographic.</i>

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:42.241
<i>Tepuis, Venezuela's Islands
 in Time, May 1989.</i>

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:43.676 line:0%
I don't know how I found it.

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:46.112 line:0%
I opened it up. Guess what?

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:49.649
<i>There's giant rock towers
 in the Amazon jungle.</i>

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.017
<i> They're called Tepuis.</i>

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:54.587
I thought, "Wow! How do you
get up one of those cliffs?

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.088
That looks awesome."

00:00:56.088 --> 00:00:58.324
The article, of course,
is not about that.

00:00:58.324 --> 00:00:59.692
It's about science.

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:02.628
<i> It's about the summits
 of these mountains</i>

00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:06.231
<i> being the home of all
 these endemic species.</i>

00:01:06.231 --> 00:01:08.234
<i>And they've evolved separately.</i>

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:11.804
<i>We're talking, plants and
animals from their cousins</i>

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:13.872
<i> that live down in
 the jungle below.</i>

00:01:13.872 --> 00:01:15.741
<i>Everything up there is unique.</i>

00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:19.745
<i>One of these unique creatures
 is called Pebble Toad.</i>

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:22.047
<i>There's a couple things about
them that are really unique.</i>

00:01:22.047 --> 00:01:24.851
<i> If you look at the--
 the hind feet,</i>

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:29.522
<i>they are adapted for climbing
in a way that's totally unique.</i>

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:31.691
I think, there's eight
species of Pebble Toads.

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:34.527
Five of them, have been
found on the top of Tepuis.

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:36.362
And I'm thinking

00:01:36.528 --> 00:01:40.166
"Okay. I'm starting to get
the beginning of an idea here."

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.236
<i> The guy who's trying
 to figure this all out</i>

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:45.571
<i> "Why do these creatures
 happen to exist</i>

00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:47.406
<i>on the summits of these Tepuis?"</i>

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:49.008
<i> Dr. Bruce Means.</i>

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:53.947
This guy has been on 32
expeditions to the Tepuis.

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:58.084
He's a biologist,
he's found tons of new species.

00:01:58.084 --> 00:02:00.753
<i> So, Bruce and I,
we come up with this plan.</i>

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:04.223
<i>And this plan is custom made
 for National Geographic.</i>

00:02:04.223 --> 00:02:06.658
We say, "So, have
your people been up

00:02:06.658 --> 00:02:08.861
on the summit of this mountain?"

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:10.196
And they're looking at
it and they're like

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:11.931
"Oh yeah, our guys
have been up there."

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:14.734
"They go up a helicopter,
they found a lot of cool stuff."

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:16.169
I'm like, "Okay, that's cool.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:18.338
Have your guys been down at
the bottom, in the jungle?"

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:19.906
They're like, "Oh yeah, totally.

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:21.741
Our guys have been
all over the jungle.

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:23.976
They found a lot of
stuff down there."

00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:27.814
We're like, "Oh, that's cool.
Have your guys been here

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:30.683
in the middle, on the veg
patch, on the actual wall?"

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.086
And they're all like, "Hmm".

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:35.354
They're like, "Actually no

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:37.222
I don't think our guys
have been on the wall."

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.128
And that's when Bruce slams his
fist down on the table and says

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:43.695
"I guarantee that

00:02:43.695 --> 00:02:46.599
I will find new species
on the Tepuis wall."

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:47.900
( audience laughter )

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.069
<i> The only problem is,
 now we've told them</i>

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.339
<i>that we're gonna go up where
 the veg is on the wall</i>

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:56.242
<i>and as a climber, that's really
not the way you wanna go.</i>

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:58.110
<i> You wanna avoid the veg.</i>

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.880
<i>So, we've got ourselves a
 little bit of a problem.</i>

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:03.049
<i>Like most of these adventures</i>

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.653
<i> the best part of it is,
connecting with local people.</i>

00:03:07.653 --> 00:03:11.557
So here, in the Amazon
are some Amerindians.

00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:14.260
And we needed these
guys to help us

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.228
to get into the
base of the tower.

00:03:16.228 --> 00:03:19.465
There's no possible way that
we... we could've found it.

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:22.968
<i>We did not anticipate that the
hardest part of this trip</i>

00:03:22.968 --> 00:03:26.705
<i>was gonna be just getting
to the base of the tower.</i>

00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:28.741
<i> You can see this ridge,
 right here?</i>

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:30.109
This doesn't look that bad.

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.344
This looks like a ridge, like
in the Shenandoah's, right?

00:03:32.344 --> 00:03:34.413
You hike up this thing.

00:03:34.413 --> 00:03:37.016
That little section there,
which is half a mile

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:38.718
took us five days.

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:39.919
And what you can't see

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.422
is that it's actually
really steep under there.

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:45.224
<i> And... it's
 jungle mountaineering.</i>

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:49.061
<i> And we would scrape our
way up these little walls</i>

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:50.529
and then we'd build
these ladders.

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:53.198
We'd put ropes down,
we'd put these rungs on

00:03:53.198 --> 00:03:55.467
so that we could all
move up with our gear.

00:03:55.934 --> 00:03:57.804
<i> But eventually,
 we came to this spot</i>

00:03:57.804 --> 00:04:01.207
<i>that we called the slime wall.
 Bonafide slime!</i>

00:04:01.207 --> 00:04:02.375
<i> So like at this point</i>

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:05.210
<i> we've climbed all kinds
 of different stuff.</i>

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.412
<i> Like all different
 kinds of rock and ice.</i>

00:04:07.412 --> 00:04:11.617
I even climbed grass in
Poland in the Tatras

00:04:11.617 --> 00:04:13.252
which is another great story.

00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:14.753
But, I'd never climbed slime.

00:04:15.354 --> 00:04:18.523
The closest that I came, was
trying to climb the grease pole

00:04:18.523 --> 00:04:20.759
at the Fryeburg Fair in Maine.

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.630
But, slime is really, really,
really hard to climb.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.999
We were relying on
going up these vines.

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:29.936
We think, the highest we got up
this wall was like, ten feet

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.837
and then the vines
would break off.

00:04:31.837 --> 00:04:35.341
We'd slide down the wall and
then hit this little ledge.

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:36.642
And you had to hit the ledge

00:04:36.642 --> 00:04:39.145
because there was a huge
drop-off right to the side.

00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:41.881
The Amerindian guys thought that

00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:43.383
this was probably the
greatest show that

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:45.017
they had ever seen
in their life.

00:04:45.518 --> 00:04:48.021
<i> And, eventually we were
like, "Hey, you know what?</i>

00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:50.023
<i> Guess what dude,
you're giving this pitch a go."</i>

00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:53.959
Edward was like--
he didn't speak English

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:55.094
but he kind of got the message.

00:04:55.094 --> 00:04:57.129
He was like, "What?
I'm leading it?"

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:58.497
And we were like, "Yeah, dude.

00:04:58.497 --> 00:05:02.434
Here's your harness and...
we suited him up."

00:05:02.868 --> 00:05:05.037
Well, guess what,
the Amerindians like

00:05:05.037 --> 00:05:07.306
these guys must have Gecko
blood or something.

00:05:07.306 --> 00:05:09.275
'Cause this guy got
on the slime wall...

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.577
and he just went right up it.

00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:14.813
The problem was that we hadn't
really looked that carefully

00:05:14.813 --> 00:05:16.682
at like, the upper section.

00:05:16.682 --> 00:05:17.750
And we just thought

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.785
"Get past this slime part,
it'll get easier."

00:05:19.785 --> 00:05:21.253
Well, it didn't get easier.

00:05:21.253 --> 00:05:25.024
It went from slime to dirt,
which was good.

00:05:25.024 --> 00:05:27.993
But, it went from
80 degrees to like, 90.

00:05:27.993 --> 00:05:30.563
So, he went for another
20 feet up the dirt

00:05:30.563 --> 00:05:33.566
by putting his hand in, all
the way up to his shoulders

00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:36.602
and he was like, grabbing onto
roots and kicking his feet in.

00:05:36.602 --> 00:05:38.103
Like he was ice climbing.

00:05:38.837 --> 00:05:44.010
This eventually, brought him
to a roof of vegetation.

00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:46.579
And we looked up and
we saw him up there

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:48.914
and we're like "Oh man,
this is bad, you know."

00:05:48.914 --> 00:05:51.683
And we're like,
"He'll figure it out, he has to.

00:05:51.683 --> 00:05:53.419
Because he can't down-climb it."

00:05:54.086 --> 00:05:55.988
So, he's got his arms in,
all the way like this...

00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:57.690
and he starts going like this...

00:05:58.224 --> 00:06:01.126
( grunting ) And he starts
head-butting the wall.

00:06:01.126 --> 00:06:03.528
And we're all looking at each
other like, "This is bad."

00:06:03.528 --> 00:06:05.531
We're like,
"He's head-butting the wall."

00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:09.167
And then, on one of the head
butts, he bit on and he went...

00:06:09.167 --> 00:06:11.637
And he tore off a patch of moss.

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:13.272
And we're like, "Wow. Now,
he's biting the cliff."

00:06:13.272 --> 00:06:14.206
I'd never seen that...

00:06:14.206 --> 00:06:14.907
( audience laughter )

00:06:14.907 --> 00:06:16.408
never seen anyone do that.

00:06:16.975 --> 00:06:20.679
Well, he starts biting
off chunks and...

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:22.181
we quickly realize, like

00:06:22.181 --> 00:06:24.416
he's chewing a hole,
through the wall.

00:06:24.416 --> 00:06:27.753
And he chewed the hold, big
enough to get his head started

00:06:27.753 --> 00:06:29.188
and then he started
burrowing into it.

00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:31.724
And he... he turned
into "Mole-man".

00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:33.559
( audience laughter )

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:38.296
And... took a long time,
over the course of

00:06:38.296 --> 00:06:39.998
like about an hour and a half.

00:06:39.998 --> 00:06:43.336
He burrowed his way
all the way into the dirt.

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:47.306
And the last thing I saw, was
his leg sticking out in the back

00:06:47.306 --> 00:06:49.074
and he was like this...

00:06:49.074 --> 00:06:51.310
And he was shaking to try
to get himself deeper in.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.412
I remember, one of
his shoes fly off

00:06:53.412 --> 00:06:54.146
( audience laughter )

00:06:54.547 --> 00:06:57.883
and spin through the mist and
disappear off the ledge.

00:06:57.883 --> 00:07:00.185
And for the rest of the
trip he had one shoe.

00:07:00.185 --> 00:07:01.420
( audience laughter )

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.755
But, he did it.

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:04.256
And he burrowed all
the way through

00:07:04.256 --> 00:07:05.791
and he got out onto the ledge.

00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:07.760
We couldn't see him
at this point.

00:07:08.027 --> 00:07:12.798
But, he let loose with
this bloodcurdling scream

00:07:12.798 --> 00:07:16.969
that I think, was half
triumph and half terror.

00:07:17.403 --> 00:07:19.371
And the story was,
is they heard it

00:07:19.371 --> 00:07:22.141
in the village 40 miles away.

00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:23.242
( audience laughter )

00:07:23.242 --> 00:07:26.312
But, he was
definitely stoked and

00:07:26.312 --> 00:07:29.882
he... allowed the
expedition to proceed.

00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:32.618
<i> We made a little camp,
 up here on this ridge.</i>

00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:35.287
<i> And we have this,
 one last little...</i>

00:07:35.287 --> 00:07:37.756
<i>little hill, to get to the base.</i>

00:07:37.756 --> 00:07:40.459
So, I get up early in the
morning before everybody else

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:42.694
and honestly, I was feeling bad.

00:07:42.694 --> 00:07:44.596
I'm like, "I'm making
the Amerindian guys

00:07:44.596 --> 00:07:45.764
do the hardest stuff.

00:07:45.764 --> 00:07:47.299
I gotta redeem myself."

00:07:47.299 --> 00:07:51.303
Now, it's matted, dead wood
laying over the cliff.

00:07:51.737 --> 00:07:53.205
It's really steep,

00:07:53.205 --> 00:07:55.874
but instead of being slime,
it's rotten wood.

00:07:55.874 --> 00:07:58.444
And I'm trying to climb it,
it's all the just breaking off.

00:07:58.444 --> 00:08:00.580
But there's... it's
like this layer

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.615
and a couple of times,
the whole thing collapses

00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:05.017
and I fall through
into the inside.

00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:09.688
And I look up and I can see that
there's a space on the inside.

00:08:09.688 --> 00:08:11.023
It's almost like,
kind of a chimney

00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:12.391
that you could slither up.

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:16.462
And I looked up in there and I
thought, "What would Edward do?"

00:08:16.462 --> 00:08:17.529
( audience laughter )

00:08:17.529 --> 00:08:19.999
I'm like, "He would go in.
For sure."

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:21.534
I'm like,
"That's what I'm doing.

00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:23.068
I'm going Mole-man."

00:08:23.068 --> 00:08:25.805
So, I put my hood up, I
cinched everything up

00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:29.408
and I started squirming
my way up, through here.

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:34.013
And I was in there for hours
and... straight up

00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:38.550
there were tarantulas in there,
scorpions, it was wicked hot.

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:41.620
It was probably the nastiest
thing I've ever done in my life.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.922
Finally, I hit a
wall at the end.

00:08:43.922 --> 00:08:48.360
I broke all the wood and veg out
above me and I popped out...

00:08:48.927 --> 00:08:51.930
and the Amerindian guys
are sitting there.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:56.135
( audience laughter )

00:08:59.704 --> 00:09:03.075
<i> They're looking at
 me and they're like</i>

00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:05.778
"Marco, where the
hell have you been?"

00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:09.415
I was like,
"I was down under the veg.

00:09:09.415 --> 00:09:12.184
I was doing what you
did yesterday."

00:09:12.184 --> 00:09:14.186
They were like, "You idiot!"

00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:16.688
They were like, "We found
this trail around the side."

00:09:16.688 --> 00:09:17.789
( audience laughter )

00:09:17.789 --> 00:09:21.494
"We've been here for
hours waiting for you."

00:09:22.694 --> 00:09:26.332
<i> Well, don't forget,
we've told National Geographic</i>

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:28.567
<i> that we're gonna climb
 up onto the veg patch</i>

00:09:28.567 --> 00:09:31.437
<i> and we're gonna try to
find some, some new species.</i>

00:09:31.437 --> 00:09:34.339
<i>But, the veg isn't really where
you wanna be on these cliffs.</i>

00:09:34.339 --> 00:09:36.575
<i> The veg is a
 nightmare, actually.</i>

00:09:36.575 --> 00:09:38.277
We kind of found this route

00:09:38.277 --> 00:09:41.113
where we hit a little
veg patch partway.

00:09:41.113 --> 00:09:45.551
We dug in, we... we
actually got some samples.

00:09:45.551 --> 00:09:47.886
Every time, you would stick
your hand into the wall

00:09:47.886 --> 00:09:49.722
and you would pull it out,
you would have

00:09:49.722 --> 00:09:52.724
either a tarantula or
a scorpion in your hand.

00:09:52.724 --> 00:09:55.194
<i>We had slightly more scorpions</i>

00:09:55.194 --> 00:09:58.163
<i>so we ended up calling our
climb, "The Scorpion Wall".</i>

00:09:58.163 --> 00:10:02.368
<i>We had an awesome adventure
 up on this mountain.</i>

00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:04.636
<i> We're on the mountain
 in the background there</i>

00:10:04.636 --> 00:10:06.839
<i> and we're flying away
 in a helicopter.</i>

00:10:07.373 --> 00:10:09.274
<i>We fly over this other Tepuis.</i>

00:10:09.274 --> 00:10:10.409
<i>Bruce doesn't even know about it</i>

00:10:10.409 --> 00:10:12.878
<i> he's been on 32
 expeditions here.</i>

00:10:12.878 --> 00:10:16.648
<i>And as we go over the top,
we see this giant sink hole</i>

00:10:16.648 --> 00:10:19.150
and there's a forest,
down inside.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.688
And so, Bruce looks
at that and he thinks

00:10:22.688 --> 00:10:24.757
"You know what, that is
exactly the kind of place

00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:26.125
where I need to go.

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:29.695
Because, it's an environment
that's right in-between

00:10:29.695 --> 00:10:32.497
the Tepuis summits and
the jungle down below.

00:10:32.497 --> 00:10:37.235
And... I think, like, this
missing link type of frog

00:10:37.235 --> 00:10:40.539
that I'm looking for is gonna
be down in that hole."

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:44.410
<i>And my only job is to get
 Bruce down in the hole</i>

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:48.079
<i> and then, to get Bruce
 back out of the hole.</i>

00:10:48.747 --> 00:10:51.817
<i> So, we get Bruce down
 in the hole and...</i>

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:53.318
<i>we leave him down in there.</i>

00:10:53.318 --> 00:10:56.822
<i> It's really kind of, wet
 and nasty down in there.</i>

00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:58.958
<i>So, we have this nice dry
 camp, up on the top.</i>

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.560
<i> So, we go back up to our
 camp and we hang out</i>

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.229
<i> and we drink scotch
 and we look down in</i>

00:11:04.229 --> 00:11:06.098
<i>and we see Bruce down in there.</i>

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:09.001
<i> Like the frogs,
he's basically nocturnal.</i>

00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:12.370
<i>And we hear him rooting around
and he's gotta find this thing.</i>

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:15.173
<i> But, he's having a
 hard time finding it.</i>

00:11:15.173 --> 00:11:17.276
<i>And it's like, day after day.</i>

00:11:17.276 --> 00:11:20.880
<i>And here's a little video clip
that tells the story pretty good</i>

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.848
<i> about what happened to
 Bruce down in the hole.</i>

00:11:23.315 --> 00:11:25.584
Bruce:
<i>And there, on a little leaf</i>

00:11:25.584 --> 00:11:29.455
<i> sat one of these
 priceless little babies.</i>

00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:32.257
<i> And then I realized "Oh!</i>

00:11:32.257 --> 00:11:37.496
<i> They do what the
lower elevation one does.</i>

00:11:37.496 --> 00:11:39.064
<i> They may sit on leaves."</i>

00:11:39.064 --> 00:11:41.133
<i> And I start looking,
 within ten minutes</i>

00:11:41.133 --> 00:11:42.768
<i> I found another one!</i>

00:11:42.768 --> 00:11:46.205
<i> And then,
 by 9:30 I'd found four.</i>

00:11:46.605 --> 00:11:50.876
This is fabulous, I... I do
wanna stay another night.

00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:52.878
I'd like to do some
more work on their ecology.

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:55.681
I didn't have my camera with me,
on and on and on

00:11:55.681 --> 00:11:57.616
yada yada yada... but we're

00:11:57.616 --> 00:12:00.285
<i> successful!</i>

00:12:00.285 --> 00:12:02.854
<i> Yahoo!</i>

00:12:02.854 --> 00:12:07.526
( frog croaking )

00:12:08.627 --> 00:12:10.028
Mark:
<i> After he found the frog</i>

00:12:10.028 --> 00:12:12.564
we had a little celebration
down in the hole.

00:12:12.564 --> 00:12:14.099
<i> And Bruce fell over.</i>

00:12:14.099 --> 00:12:17.136
<i>There was a tree right there and
he actually broke the tree off.</i>

00:12:17.136 --> 00:12:19.204
<i> It was like, super lucky</i>

00:12:19.204 --> 00:12:22.874
<i>because he was gonna hit the
ground, like a sack of potatoes.</i>

00:12:22.874 --> 00:12:27.079
I'm thinking, "Okay, I gotta
get this guy out of the hole."

00:12:28.413 --> 00:12:31.851
<i>So, here's another little clip
showing how I got him out.</i>

00:12:33.185 --> 00:12:37.055
I'm trying to set up...
basically the beefiest rig

00:12:37.055 --> 00:12:39.558
that I've ever set up in
my life,

00:12:39.558 --> 00:12:43.829
just to make sure that we can
get Bruce out of the hole.

00:12:44.763 --> 00:12:49.901
<i>I pretty much tied together,
this entire troll forest.</i>

00:12:49.901 --> 00:12:52.204
<i> I think, I have
 ten trees interlinked.</i>

00:12:54.806 --> 00:12:57.977
This is one of the crazier
things that I've ever set up.

00:12:59.544 --> 00:13:02.948
I can confirm that he just
moved up about six inches.

00:13:04.015 --> 00:13:07.786
<i> So, he's got 199 and
 a half feet to go.</i>

00:13:07.786 --> 00:13:09.788
( audience laughter )

00:13:10.422 --> 00:13:13.258
Well, we did it and we
got him out of the hole.

00:13:13.658 --> 00:13:15.761
<i> Bruce loves to
 show this picture.</i>

00:13:15.761 --> 00:13:16.795
<i> And if he was here</i>

00:13:16.795 --> 00:13:18.597
<i> he would tell you that
 I tried to kill him.</i>

00:13:18.597 --> 00:13:19.464
( audience laughter )

00:13:19.464 --> 00:13:22.301
But, I did have a back-up rope.

00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:23.702
So, I had two ropes.

00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:26.204
But, he likes to sort of,
pretend that that didn't happen.

00:13:26.671 --> 00:13:29.475
But it's... it's one
of his stories.

00:13:30.409 --> 00:13:33.812
<i>So, Bruce has looked at the
 DNA of the Pebble Toads</i>

00:13:33.812 --> 00:13:35.013
<i> and guess what he found.</i>

00:13:35.013 --> 00:13:38.082
The separation is only like,
a few thousand years.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:43.288
The Tepuis have been isolated
for... more, like millions.

00:13:43.288 --> 00:13:44.389
So, what does that mean?

00:13:44.456 --> 00:13:47.459
It means that the frogs have
been climbing up and down.

00:13:47.893 --> 00:13:50.429
And there's exchange going on

00:13:50.429 --> 00:13:53.331
between the frogs that
live down in the jungle

00:13:53.331 --> 00:13:57.169
and frogs that live up on the
top, with this one species.

00:13:57.669 --> 00:14:00.539
<i> There's another species
 that he's found</i>

00:14:00.539 --> 00:14:02.575
that has been separated from

00:14:02.575 --> 00:14:04.876
it's cousins by
millions of years.

00:14:04.876 --> 00:14:07.513
And so, Bruce says to me,
"That makes perfect sense

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:10.015
because those ones aren't
adapted for climbing."

00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:12.651
So, you have both things
going on at the same time.

00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:16.088
So, you have the old paradigm
and you have the new paradigm.
