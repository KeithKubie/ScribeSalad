00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:11.559
To human eyes, the world at night
is a formless canvas of grey.

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.313
Many nocturnal animals, on the other hand,

00:00:14.313 --> 00:00:19.599
experience a rich and varied world
bursting with details, shapes, and colors.

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.490
What is it, then, that separates moths
from men?

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.398
Moths and many other nocturnal animals
see at night

00:00:26.398 --> 00:00:30.148
because their eyes are adapted 
to compensate for the lack of light.

00:00:30.148 --> 00:00:32.909
All eyes, whether nocturnal or not,

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:36.757
depend on photoreceptors in the retina
to detect light particles,

00:00:36.757 --> 00:00:38.938
known as photons.

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:42.969
Photoreceptors then report information
about these photons to other cells

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:44.869
in the retina and brain.

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:48.429
The brain sifts through that information
and uses it to build up an image

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:50.691
of the environment the eye perceives.

00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:54.399
The brighter the light is,
the more photons hit the eye.

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:55.729
On a sunny day,

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:00.259
upwards of 100 million times 
more photons are available to the eye

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:02.650
than on a cloudy, moonless night.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.420
Photons aren't just less numerous 
in darkness,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.890
but they also hit the eye 
in a less reliable way.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.839
This means the information 
that photoreceptors collect

00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:13.450
will vary over time,

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.600
as will the quality of the image.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.620
In darkness, trying to detect the sparse
scattering of randomly arriving photons

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.010
is too difficult for the eyes
of most daytime animals.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.841
But for night creatures, 
it's just a matter of adaptation.

00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:31.391
One of these adaptations is size.

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:35.980
Take the tarsier, whose eyeballs
are each as big as its brain,

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.990
giving it the biggest eyes compared 
to head size of all mammals.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.461
If humans had the same brain to eye ratio,
our eyes would be the size of grapefruits.

00:01:45.461 --> 00:01:48.830
The tarsier's enlarged orbs haven't 
evolved to make it cuter, however,

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.881
but to gather as much light as possible.

00:01:51.881 --> 00:01:55.041
Bigger eyes can have larger openings,
called pupils,

00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:56.561
and larger lenses,

00:01:56.561 --> 00:01:59.831
allowing for more light to be focused
on the receptors.

00:01:59.831 --> 00:02:04.223
While tarsiers scan the nocturnal scene
with their enormous peepers,

00:02:04.223 --> 00:02:08.432
cats use gleaming eyes to do the same.

00:02:08.432 --> 00:02:12.352
Cats' eyes get their shine from
a structure called the tapetum lucidum

00:02:12.352 --> 00:02:14.791
that sits behind the photoreceptors.

00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:18.733
This structure is made from layers
of mirror-like cells containing crystals

00:02:18.733 --> 00:02:22.336
that send incoming light
bouncing back towards the photoreceptors

00:02:22.336 --> 00:02:24.062
and out of the eye.

00:02:24.062 --> 00:02:25.812
This results in an eerie glow,

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:30.342
and it also gives the photoreceptors
a second chance to detect photons.

00:02:30.342 --> 00:02:35.973
In fact, this system has inspired the
artificial cats' eyes we use on our roads.

00:02:35.973 --> 00:02:39.653
Toads, on the other hand, have adapted
to take it slow.

00:02:39.653 --> 00:02:41.376
They can form an image

00:02:41.376 --> 00:02:45.701
even when just a single photon 
hits each photoreceptor per second.

00:02:45.701 --> 00:02:47.846
They accomplish this with photoreceptors

00:02:47.846 --> 00:02:51.353
that are more than 25 times slower 
than human ones.

00:02:51.353 --> 00:02:54.486
This means toads can collect photons
for up to four seconds,

00:02:54.486 --> 00:02:57.362
allowing them to gather many more
than our eyes do

00:02:57.362 --> 00:02:59.743
at each visual time interval.

00:02:59.743 --> 00:03:03.762
The downside is that this causes toads
to react very slowly

00:03:03.762 --> 00:03:08.034
because they're only receiving
an updated image every four seconds.

00:03:08.034 --> 00:03:11.474
Fortunately, they're accustomed
to targeting sluggish prey.

00:03:11.474 --> 00:03:14.793
Meanwhile, the night is also buzzing
with insects,

00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:16.792
such as hawk moths,

00:03:16.792 --> 00:03:21.254
which can see their favorite flowers
in color, even on a starlit night.

00:03:21.254 --> 00:03:23.383
They achieve this by a surprising move -

00:03:23.383 --> 00:03:26.213
getting rid of details 
in their visual perception.

00:03:26.213 --> 00:03:29.754
Information from neighboring
photoreceptors is grouped in their brains,

00:03:29.754 --> 00:03:32.244
so the photon catch of each group
is higher

00:03:32.244 --> 00:03:34.745
compared to individual receptors.

00:03:34.745 --> 00:03:38.422
However, grouping photoreceptors
loses details in the image,

00:03:38.422 --> 00:03:42.014
as fine details require a fine grid
of photoreceptors,

00:03:42.014 --> 00:03:45.784
each detecting photons from one
small point in space.

00:03:45.784 --> 00:03:49.574
The trick is to balance the need
for photons with the loss of detail

00:03:49.574 --> 00:03:51.243
to still find their flowers.

00:03:51.243 --> 00:03:54.194
Whether eyes are slow, enormous,
shiny, or coarse,

00:03:54.194 --> 00:03:57.245
it's the combination 
of these biological adaptations

00:03:57.245 --> 00:04:00.956
that gives nocturnal animals their unique
visual powers.

00:04:00.956 --> 00:04:03.907
Imagine what it might be like to witness
through their eyes

00:04:03.907 --> 00:04:06.676
the world that wakes up
when the Sun goes down.
