00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.241
The answer is 3.60.

00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:08.415
In 3.5955, to round to the second
decimal place, we first find

00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:14.220
the second decimal, which is 9, and
then we look to the right, and we get 5.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.540
That means that we have to round up.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.590
How do we round up a 9 though?

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.384
Well, we don't increase the 9 to a 10,
so it's not this one.

00:00:23.384 --> 00:00:29.541
Instead, let's look at a zoomed
in number line, around 3.5955.

00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:32.920
Here we have 3.58 and 3.59.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.180
And here we have 3.60 and 3.61.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:44.146
And somewhere in between 3.59 and
3.60, we have 3.5955.

00:00:44.146 --> 00:00:49.939
We also know that
the midpoint between 3.59 and

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:52.911
3.60 is 3.595.

00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:57.117
3.5955 is bigger than 3.95.

00:00:57.117 --> 00:00:59.270
It's to the right, over here.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.485
So, it's closer to 3.6
than it is to 3.59.

00:01:04.485 --> 00:01:07.714
That means we round it to 3.60.
