00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.960
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World History,
and today were going to talk about the Congo.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.480
Mr. Green! Mr.Green! We're gonna to talk about
the Conga?

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.340
No, Me From the Past, you idiot, that is a
dance. However, your epic, epic ignorance

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.840
does indicate that perhaps we don't do a
particularly good job when it comes to talking

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.020
about African history in world history classes.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.920
So today we're gonna look at what happened
to the Congo after decolonization but in particular

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.220
what happened during the 1990s and early 2000s
as Congo, or Zaire, or the Democratic Republic

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.720
of Congo was embroiled in what some people
have called Africa's World War.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.120
European colonization in Africa was generally
pretty, you know, bad. But it was particularly

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.530
terrible in the Congo. There's a great book
about it called King Leopold's Ghost, which

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.149
details the brutality of life under Leopold's
Congo Free State, and the international efforts

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.530
to improve things there. Leopold essentially
owned Congo, and he ruled it as his private

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.330
fiefdom from 1884 until 1906, when he was
forced to turn over the colony to the Belgian

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.880
government. From 1906 until independence in
1960, the territory was known as the Belgian

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.709
Congo and while the Belgians were far less
brutal than Leopold's agents had been, life

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:22.249
for the Congolese under Belgian rule was also
not good. And then there was this sudden decolonization

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:26.609
in the Congo and in a lot of ways the region
was unprepared to become an independent state,

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:30.860
like the Congo's new leaders didn't have much
formal education or leadership experience.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.340
There weren't many trained experts in, really
anything, there were very few college graduates,

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.049
no one had the skills to run an army or a
government or an economy. But I wanna be clear:

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.289
that wasn't the Congo's fault, it was because
there weren't educational or leadership opportunities

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.259
available to Congolese people.

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.429
In 1965, a former army sergeant and journalist
named Joseph Mobutu staged a coup and seized

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.889
control of the government. Now, he turned
out to be a terrible leader, but in his first

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:59.459
decade in charge, he did some good stuff.
For instance, he hosted The Rumble in the

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:03.649
Jungle, arguably the greatest heavy-weight
boxing match of all time between Muhammad

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.940
Ali and George Foreman, featuring the famous
rope-a-dope.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.720
Stan says he did some actually important things
and that boxing isn't actually important.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.560
Okay! From 1965 to 1975, Mobutu was able to
build the economy based on this huge copper

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.680
boom. And then he destroyed the economy by
appropriating most of the local businesses

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.290
and turning them over to his cronies. He built
the first hydroelectric dam in the region

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.459
as well as hospitals and, most importantly
for his rule, a state television system that

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.560
could broadcast national pageantry that celebrated
Mobutu and his family. Mobutu also changed

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.560
the name of the country in 1971 from Congo
to Zaire and he changed the names of many

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.379
colonial cities like Leopoldville became Kinshasa,
Stanleyville became Kisangani, Elisabethville

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:49.140
became Lubumbashi. And initially his coup
was seen as a positive by many Congolese,

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.220
but pretty early on it became clear that this
wasn't going to be like a peaceful open government.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.740
And Mobutu's Zaire was also really corrupt,
like the underlying source of Mobutu's power

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:04.989
was his ability to grant favors to his friends,
a strategy known as clientelism or cronyism

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.519
and Mobutu was great at it. And in order to
keep his cronies happy, Mobutu raided the

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.269
National Treasury again and again, he actually
stymied development, in order to get more

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.060
foreign aid, which he then used as an alternative
source of income. And then there was this

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.390
huge crash of commodity prices, including
copper, that followed the Vietnam War and

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:29.180
that plunged Zaire into debt. In 1975 Zaire's
foreign debt totaled 887 dollars.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.639
The next year, the IMF launched its first
stabilization plan for Zaire, a loan of 47

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:38.999
million dollars. In exchange for that loan,
Mobutu agreed to cut public spending, devalue

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:43.459
the currency, raise taxes and put the country's
financial house in order. Needless to say,

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.969
that did not happen, there was a need for
more and more and more loans, and by 1990

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:51.650
Zaire's total national debt topped out at
10 billion dollars.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.310
But even as Mobutu drove Zaire into decline,
there were no serious challenges to his power,

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.839
because opposition was incredibly risky, critics
of the regime faced arrest, torture, exile

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:06.829
-- at times murder. And in the end it was
outside forces that forced Mobutu from power.

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.469
So the Rwandan genocide of 1994 is familiar
to many Americans, often as an example of

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:17.289
the impotence of America in the face of post-Cold
War problems, and also because it was horrific.

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:21.120
But less well known is the role that these
events played in the disintegration of the Congo.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.060
So conflict in Rwanda between Hutu and Tutsi
people probably pre-dates Rwanda's independence

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.370
from Belgium in 1962. But the path to genocide
began in 1990, when the Tutsi-led Rwandan

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.750
Patriotic Front began to cross the border
into Rwanda from their bases in Uganda.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:44.180
Between 1990 and 1994 approximately 20,000
people were killed and 1.5 million displaced

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.979
in this conflict.
And then in 1994 the plane of Rwanda's Hutu

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:53.460
president was shot down and Rwandan Hutus
began murdering Rwandan Tutsis, killing between

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.789
800,000 and a million people in three months.

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:01.680
This did not stop the Rwandan Patriotic Front,
which in fact increased its attacks on Rwanda

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.870
and then under leader Paul Kagame, they succeeded
in taking over the country, leading to more

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:12.979
than 2 million people fleeing, most of them
to Eastern Zaire. Almost 850,000 people crowded

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.039
into refugee camps around the city of Goma
in Zaire.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.820
Kagame desperately wanted to hold the Hutus
living in those refugee camps accountable

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.229
for crimes against Tutsis, but in order to
do that, he would have to invade a sovereign

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:30.770
territory, so he helped to set up the Alliance
des Forces Démocratiques pour la Libération

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.560
and yes, I did take three years of high school
French.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:40.080
The AFDL or ah-eff-deh-ell for us French speakers,
was made up of Zairians and would do the dirty

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.090
work of killing Hutu refugees for Kagame,
and to outside eyes, it would appear to be

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.500
a domestic uprising against Mobutu.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.780
So on May 29th, 1997, the victorious AFDL
leader Laurent Kabila was sworn in as

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.960
president of the newly renamed Democratic
Republic of Congo. Mobutu fled to Morocco

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.250
and died there four months later. And that's
where the story should end, with the fall

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.759
of the dictator and the rise of a new nation
that lives up to the "democratic" in its name.

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:10.050
But that did not happen.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.620
Between 1997 and 2000, everything in the Congo
fell apart and the country descended further

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.330
into chaos. Kabila's rapid conquests of Zaire
and the ouster of Mubutu along with the killing

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.520
of hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees
was what some call The First Congo War. The

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:32.180
Second Congo War was the revolt against Kabila
that lasted from 1998 to 2002. Kabila proved

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.220
inept and authoritarian and an astonishingly
poor head of state, but his biggest mistake

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.580
was expelling the Rwandans who had helped
put him into power, which is what started

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.610
The Second Congo War. Like a lot of conflicts,
this isn't a straightforward good versus evil

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.370
thing, and it's also not a thing with just
two sides. There are also a lot of initialisms

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.289
involved, which makes it a little bit hard
to follow, but its basic contours are relatively

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:57.069
straightforward. Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:06:57.069 --> 00:07:01.659
So Rwanda invaded the Congo and nearly took
Kinshasa, but Kabila was able to put together

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:06.770
a coalition of other countries that saw Rwanda,
Uganda, and Burundi as a threat. This coalition

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.250
which included Angola and Namibia stopped
the Rwandan advance and the fighting, leading

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:15.810
to the Lusaka peace agreement, which, as you
might suspect, did not last. The fighting

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:20.789
instead shifted to the eastern part of the
DRC, especially the rich mining regions of

00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:25.419
Kivu and Katanga, and pretty quickly, the
cause of the fighting turned from politics

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:30.220
to profit. Kabila's government supported local
militias who fought the Rwandan and Ugandan

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:35.120
armies, and then eventually each other over
control of the valuable gold, diamonds and

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.270
other resources there. Fighting provided a
sense of purpose, and also one of the only

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:44.710
ways to make a living in a failed economy.
It was also incredibly brutal. According to

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:46.710
one man who participated in the horror,

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:51.039
"A soldier is like a dog. If you open the
gate, he causes damage. In the morning, before

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:55.060
we were sent out, our leader would say: 'Go
out and do something foolish.' We ransacked

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:59.139
houses, we took cell phones, money, and gold
necklaces from people."

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:03.469
There was also widespread rape and murder.
The war continued so long because it was so

00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:07.580
profitable, but a turning point came when
Laurent Kabila was assassinated by some of

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:14.150
his own child-soldier bodyguards in January,
2001. African diplomats negotiated a ceasefire,

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:18.569
largely in South Africa, and the resulting
peace accord required a two-year transitional

00:08:18.569 --> 00:08:22.419
period monitored by the largest UN peace-keeping
force ever assembled.

00:08:22.419 --> 00:08:26.590
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So, this transitional
government continued the Congolese pattern

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.650
of corruption. According to historian David
Van Reybrouck,

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:35.330
"They emulated the abuses of Mobutuism with
a zeal that would have startled Mobutu himself."

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:40.450
In the absence of an effective central government,
non-profit organizations and local civil society

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:45.880
agencies including Pentecostal churches stepped
in to provide some of the services that governments

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:51.130
usually provide. And then on July 30th, 2006,
The Democratic Republic of Congo held elections

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:55.340
for president and parliament. Now, no single
presidential candidate won a majority and

00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:01.200
in the runoff election on December 6th, Joseph
Kabila, son of Laurent Kabila became Congo's

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.860
first democratically elected president since
1960.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:10.020
What kind of democracy elects family dynasties?
The Adams, the Roosevelts, the Bushes, we

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.340
tried to do the Kennedys, but they kept getting
assassinated.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:15.770
Sorry, this isn't a particularly funny episode.
Even the jokes are dismal.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:20.860
The DRC created a new constitution with checks
and balances, a new parliament, and a constitutional

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:25.680
court. On paper it looked good, but Kabila
proved to be a ruler in his father's mold.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.600
He used violence to silence his main rival
and had little control over most of his soldiers.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:35.120
The parliament voted salary increases for
themselves while shirking most of the other

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.420
responsibilities of governing.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:42.000
By 2009, only 5 countries scored lower than
the DRC in the UN Human Development Index.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.140
Today, 30% of the population is illiterate
and 54% have no access to clean drinking water.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:52.600
Now, for many westerners, this is continued
proof of Congo's backwardness, perhaps

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:56.520
even hopelessness. And it's true that this
region has had tremendous struggles in the

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.870
50 years since Europe left more or less over
night. Having created an infrastructure that

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:06.020
was designed not for a nation state, but for
a colony, whose resources were to be extracted

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.800
for the wealth of the colonizer.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.700
But these days, there is a new player in the
world of international economic development

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:15.940
- China. And this is one of the most interesting
stories in the world today. Initially, the

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:20.460
first Chinese investors in the DRC were private
traders willing to gamble on the wild west

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:26.320
aspects of Congolese capitalism, but in 2007,
the DRC negotiated a huge deal with the People's

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.470
Republic of China.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:32.480
China would invest 9 billion dollars in the
DRC's infrastructure in return for future

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:38.150
revenue from DRC resources. Now, to many,
this looks a lot like neocolonialism - we'll

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:42.280
help build your country if only we can extract
your resources.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.860
But at least so far, the biggest complaints
have come not from the Congolese people, but

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:51.150
from the IMF and other western financial institutions
that stand to lose the only leverage over

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.170
the DRC that they still possess.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:57.000
So this is a very complicated relationship,
like, for instance, Congolese women are taking

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.540
advantage of new commercial relationships
with China to start their own businesses.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.800
And that's really cool. On the other hand,
cheap Chinese textiles are destroying local

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.380
manufacture in the DRC just as they are almost
everywhere. And it's far too soon to say whether

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.680
this is going to be great for the people of
the DRC or will be just another example of

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:20.420
large powers using less powerful countries
as, like, pawns in some big geopolitical game.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:25.340
Americans tend to have very negative views
about Africa, which they tend to imagine very

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:32.340
monolithically. But Africa is huge and it
is also hugely diverse. Seven of the ten fastest

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:37.820
growing nations in the world are in Africa.
The DRC is not one of them, precisely because

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:41.800
of the instability that it has seen in the
last 50 years. This is one of the largest

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:46.340
nations in Africa -- probably the richest in
natural resources. It's a magnet for Chinese

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:50.400
investment, which will certainly be one of
the most important stories in coming decades.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:54.610
And it's played a pivotal role in Sub-Saharan
African history in the last 50 years. Conflicts

00:11:54.610 --> 00:12:00.100
in the DRC also led to the largest UN peace-keeping
intervention to date, the first joint European

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:04.940
Union military action, and the first arrests
and trials of The International Criminal Court.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:09.780
So this is a vital place in the world to understand
and to study and to pay attention to. The

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:13.260
events of the past 50 years in this part of
the world are important for Congolese people
