00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.450
We're on problem 80.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.760
If a, b, and c are integers,
is a minus b,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.940
plus c greater-- OK.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:22.730
So what they want to know is a
minus b, plus c greater than a

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.470
plus b, minus c?

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.230
Fair enough.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.520
And if you think about it,
there's an a on both sides of

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:31.950
this equation.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.200
So what they're really wanting
to know is minus b plus c

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.660
greater than b minus c?

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.220
Or another way, they're just
trying to say-- I just took a

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.000
from both sides of this
inequality, so it doesn't

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.430
change anything.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.410
Really what they're asking, if
you just rearrange this, is c

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.480
minus b greater than
b minus c?

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.840
Which is another way of saying,
well, is one of them

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.750
greater than the other one?

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.020
Right?

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.900
If c is greater than b,
this is going to be

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.900
greater than this one.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.420
If b is greater than c,
this is going to be

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.560
greater than this one.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.720
So let's look at our
statements now.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.660
Statement number one.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.910
b is negative.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.400
Well, that by itself doesn't
help us much because b could

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.830
be negative, but c could
be even more negative.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.010
So c could still be smaller
than b, right?

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.650
If b could be minus 5,
c could be minus 6.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.490
Or c could be plus 6.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.870
So it really tells us nothing
about c relative to b.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.595
Statement two says
c is positive.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.470
So this statement by itself,
once again, it tells us

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.460
nothing about the value
of b relative to c.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.690
If c is positive, maybe
b is positive as well.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.190
Maybe b is more positive.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.530
Or maybe b is negative.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.340
Who knows?

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.370
But this by itself
doesn't help us.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.610
But if we use both of these
together, if c is positive and

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.890
b is negative, then we know, if
this is positive, this is

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.740
negative, we know this is
going to be positive.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.820
And we know that this is
going to be negative.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.570
Essentially, we know that c is
larger than b, so this will be

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.860
positive and this will
be negative.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.920
And we can answer
our question.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.000
If c is larger than
b, this is true.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.070
The left-hand side is greater
than the right-hand side, or

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.400
this holds good.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.700
So we need both of the
statements together.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.290
Both statements together
are sufficient

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.540
to answer this question.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.950
Switch colors.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.230
81.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:37.470
If a certain animated cartoon
consists of a total of 17,280

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.680
frames on film, how many minutes
will it take to run

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.510
the cartoon?

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.310
So they want to know
how many minutes.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.240
So essentially, if we knew how
fast the frames have to go

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.140
through-- if it's x frames per
second-- if we knew that

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.130
number, we'd be able to figure
out how long the cartoon runs.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.520
So statement one is, the
cartoon runs without

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.450
interruption at a rate of
24 frames per second.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.660
Well, that's exactly what
I just asked for.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.740
24 frames per second.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.740
So using just that information,
how many seconds

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.730
does it run?

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.580
Well, it runs 17,280
frames divided by

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.510
24 frames per second.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.660
This will give you seconds, and
then if you divide this

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.570
number by 60, you'll
get minutes.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.510
Divide seconds by 60,
you get minutes.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.200
So this is the answer.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.830
So one alone was enough to
answer the question.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.120
What does statement
two give us?

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.850
I'll write it here.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.080
Statement two.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.520
It takes 6 times as long to run
the cartoon as it takes to

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.940
rewind the film.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.030
And it takes a total of
14 minutes to do both.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.680
6 times as long to run the
cartoon as it takes to rewind.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.065
Let's say 6 times to play.

00:04:00.065 --> 00:04:01.440
I want different letters.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.280
So to play the cartoon takes
6 times as long as

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.130
to rewind the cartoon.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.580
And they say it takes a total
of 14 minutes to do both.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:21.600
So they say play plus rewind
is equal to 14.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.180
And what we want to know
is, how long does it

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.110
take to play the movie?

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.720
And we don't even have to use
that information alone, the

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.670
17,280, but just looking at
this, we have two linear

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.580
equations and two unknowns, so
we can just solved for P.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.540
P is the playtime
of this movie.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.860
And if you wanted to figure it
out-- not that you would have

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.050
to, because we would be
done at this point.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.450
We would say oh, one and two
are each independently

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.890
sufficient to answer
this question.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.320
But just to show you that
we could figure it out.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.610
Say R is equal to 14 minus P.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.200
Then you substitute
that into that.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.180
You get P is equal
to 6 times R.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.030
So 6 times 14 is 60, plus 24.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.440
84 minus 6P.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.180
You get 7P is equal to 84.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.880
P is equal to 12 minutes.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:06.470
And we'd be done.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.520
But actually, we didn't have
to do all of that.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.430
All of that is a
waste of time.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.080
I just want to prove it to you.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.780
82.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.710
A box contains only red chips,
white chips, and blue chips.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.080
If a chip is randomly selected
from the box, what is the

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.270
probability that the chip will
either be white or blue?

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.000
So essentially, to answer this,
we just have to know

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.160
what proportion of the chips in
the bag are white or blue.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.090
All right.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.220
So statement one says, the
probability that the chip will

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.250
be blue is 1/5.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.880
So probability of blue
is equal to 1/5.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.080
That also tells us that 1/5 of
the chips in the bag are blue.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.550
But we don't know what
proportion are white, so we

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.770
still can't answer that
top question.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.970
Statement two tells us, the
probably that the chip will be

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.300
red is 1/3.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.270
The probability of red
is equal to 1/3.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.840
So, once again, just this
alone-- actually, just this

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.010
alone is fine, right?

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.160
I correct myself.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.080
The probability of getting
white or blue, that's

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.400
probability of white-- we could
write, do set notation,

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.400
white or blue-- that is
just equal to what?

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.490
It's 1 minus the probability
that we get a red.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.820
Think about that.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.700
Either this is going to be
true, I'm going to pick a

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.980
white or blue, or I'm
going to pick a red.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.080
Because there's only red, white,
and blue in the bag.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.200
So the probability of white or
blue is equal to 1 minus the

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.450
probability of red, which is
equal to 1 minus 1/3, which is

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:48.530
equal to 2/3.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.770
So statement two alone
is sufficient.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.990
And then if we have statement
number two, statement one

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.160
alone is not sufficient.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.970
83.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.990
See, this is tricky because, I
think, at least when I first

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.260
read it, I was like, oh, I could
use this and this to

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.230
figure out the probably
of getting a white.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:08.100
So I need both statements.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.750
But we don't even need to know
the probability of a white.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.940
We just need to know the
probably a white or a blue,

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.710
which is just 1 minus the
probability of red.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.970
So statement two alone
gets us there.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.970
Let me do the next problem.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.030
83.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.920
If the successive tick marks on
the number line are equally

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.130
spaced, and if x and y are the
numbers designating the

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:35.150
endpoints of the interval as
shown, what is the value of y?

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.320
OK, so let me see if I can draw
what they have drawn.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.360
So they have a number line.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.850
And I probably have to draw the
exact same number of ticks

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.660
as they did.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.560
So they have 0.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:53.290
And then let's see, there's 1
tick, 2 ticks, and then they

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.070
have a third tick.

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:57.176
And they say this is x.

00:07:57.176 --> 00:07:59.330
And then they have three more.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.000
1, 2, 3.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.330
And then they have y.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:05.880
And then they have one more.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.720
And this keeps going
on and on.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:14.450
And they ask us, if the ticks
are equally spaced, and if x

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.680
and y are the numbers designated
at the endpoints of

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.640
intervals as shown, what
is the value of y?

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.355
So they're equally spaced, but
they're not telling us that

00:08:22.355 --> 00:08:22.770
these are integers.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.280
We don't know that this is
1, this is 2, this is 3.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.380
We don't know that.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:35.200
But what we do know is y is
how much further than x?

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:41.600
So let's see, x is
1, 2, 3 spaces.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:47.980
So we could say x is equal to 3
times, let's say, s, where s

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.050
is the length of each interval,
or each tick.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:57.550
And y is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:01.200
So y is equal to 7s.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.980
And so we could use this
to come up with a

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.110
relation with x and y.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.340
This is before they've
done anything.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.610
This is just looking
at the diagram.

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:14.050
So we could say that
s is equal to y/7.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:18.270
Or if we substitute this back
here, we could say that x is

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.335
equal 3/7 y.

00:09:22.335 --> 00:09:24.710
And actually, you didn't have
to even do this s stuff.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.890
You could have just said, oh,
well, x is 3/7 as far

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:28.940
as y is from 0.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.660
Because these are
equally spaced.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.290
So just the problem setup, just
looking at it, gives us

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:35.430
that information.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.590
But we want to know what the
value of y is, and that by

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:38.350
itself isn't enough.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.760
What does statement
one tell us?

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.010
x is equal to 1/2.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.520
Well, that's enough
to figure out y.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.730
If x is equal to 1/2, you
just substitute there.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.310
1/2 is equal to 3/7 y.

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.480
Multiply both sides by 7/3.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.350
You get y is equal to what?

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:56.290
7/6.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:57.080
And you're done.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:57.980
You don't have to solve that.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.480
You just know that I have
this, I have that.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.130
I can solve it.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.870
So one alone is sufficient.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:10.500
Statement two tells us, y
minus x is equal to 2/3.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.390
So once again, we
have two linear

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.510
equations with two unknowns.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.990
We can just substitute
and solve them.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.780
And just to prove it to you,
x is equal to 3/7 y.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.110
I can substitute that
right there.

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:29.850
So I have y minus 3/7
y is equal to 2/3.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.430
So 7/7 minus 3/7.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:35.460
So that's just to go here.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:42.390
7/7 y, so that's 4/7
y is equal to 2/3.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:45.075
y is equal to 2/3 times 7/4.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:52.870
Which is-- that's 1, this is 2--
which is 7/6 once again.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.350
See you in the next video.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.420
So once again, each of these are
independently sufficient

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:02.945
to answer the question.

00:11:02.945 --> 00:11:04.195
See you soon.
