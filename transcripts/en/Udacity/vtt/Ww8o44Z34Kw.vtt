00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.910
After you start seeing changes
in the metrics, keep testing.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.110
See if you can further perfect
your offering, landing page or

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.350
messaging or
whatever it is that you're testing.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.500
I don't want you to get discouraged
of your hypothesis was wrong.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.280
That's actually great.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.030
You learned something new.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.300
You now know that's not what you need
to do to improve your business and

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.680
you can narrow down other options and
keep working through your list of ideas.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.140
So let's hear from Talley,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.410
who was proven wrong with
a hypothesis she once made.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.090
&gt;&gt; So it's interesting,
we ran some experiments lately and

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.540
I'm going to say something
really controversial and

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.000
all the design people
are going to be outraged, but

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.030
what I found out is that the language
and the text that you use on your

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.240
landing page have tremendously
more effect than the imagery.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.300
So it's interesting, right?

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.680
We were trying, what you really
want to get right is the message,

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.340
is what you're saying to
people that the product is and

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.000
every single product can be represented
probably in 30 different ways.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.845
So figure those out and try to find the
one sentence that resonates with your

00:01:05.845 --> 00:01:09.262
user, that they read the sentence and
they say, yes, this is it,

00:01:09.262 --> 00:01:10.558
I want to sign up for that.

00:01:10.558 --> 00:01:13.121
And we experimented a lot
with this language and

00:01:13.121 --> 00:01:17.030
we improved our conversion rate on
the home page by hundreds and hundreds

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.130
of percentages and then we did the same
with the imagery and we thought, oh,

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.060
now we'll do the imagery and it will be
another 100% increase, but not so much.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.970
Once we found the right
language people just knew, oh,

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.820
they read it, they knew they wanted it,
and they signed up.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.203
&gt;&gt; When you're setting up an A/B test,
one of the things you want to have in

00:01:34.203 --> 00:01:36.820
mind is what's the effect
you want to say.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.270
Usually we will saw with
the metric we want to move.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.800
So for instance, if we have a new
product like voice messaging and

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.048
we want more people to put use it,
we can assign a test group and

00:01:47.048 --> 00:01:51.300
a control group where we advertise
more heavily to the test group, and

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.010
see how the product is used
differently by the testing control.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.370
The first step to diagnosing any
problem that you see in your data

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.430
is cutting it by different dimensions.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.557
So a dimension can be
pretty much anything.

00:02:03.557 --> 00:02:07.391
It can be country, if you have
an app that's out internationally,

00:02:07.391 --> 00:02:11.494
it can be by platform if you have out
on Android and iOS and by anything else

00:02:11.494 --> 00:02:16.300
that you know about your users that you
can use to try and isolate the issue.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.080
If for example, your app is aBarkment
and you suddenly see that the number

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.590
of postings that are going up onto
your site have dropped really heavily,

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.060
you could then cut that by the different
interfaces that people can post from.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.070
So you can look at the number of
posts which are coming from iOS,

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.220
from Android, and
from your desktop site.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.356
If you see that one of those
is the one that's dropping,

00:02:40.356 --> 00:02:44.435
you can then look in the code and
see if you have a problem with your.

00:02:44.435 --> 00:02:48.152
An important thing to look out for when
doing an A/B test is to make sure that

00:02:48.152 --> 00:02:51.456
you have enough people going into
either side of your experiment,

00:02:51.456 --> 00:02:55.114
that you can be confident that the
result that you're seeing is real, and

00:02:55.114 --> 00:02:56.900
not just a result of random chance.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.240
If you Google for
A/B test significance calculator,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.890
you can actually get free on line tools
where you can put in the number of

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.100
people going through your experiment and
the number of people successfully

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.200
completing whatever objective it is you
have in mind and it can tell you what's

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.620
called a confidence interval and in
the industry normally, we look at a p95.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.020
And that means for any result that
you see, you can be 95% sure that

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.020
the experiment is really giving the
result and it's not just random chance.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.550
And also when you found out which one
of your experience is the better one,

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.040
you can actually roll out that
new user experience to everyone.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.210
You can do it without having to go
through a new App Store submission,

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.750
either through the Play Store or
the App Store.
