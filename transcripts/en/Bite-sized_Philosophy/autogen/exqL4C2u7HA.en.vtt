modern idea in some ways for growing up
as a distinctly gendered society is that

as a distinctly gendered society is that
 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.090
as a distinctly gendered society is that
it's very easy for men to suppress and

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100
it's very easy for men to suppress and
 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.549
it's very easy for men to suppress and
fail to develop to develop those

elements of their character that might
 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.600
elements of their character that might
be considered classically feminine and

personality that might be classically
considered masculine but so Jung

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910
considered masculine but so Jung
 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.270

aggressive and assertive because that's

now that doesn't mean that Jung thought

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630
now that doesn't mean that Jung thought
 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.710
now that doesn't mean that Jung thought
that there was that people should be

thought that once you had established a

developed to be acceptable socially and
 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.170
developed to be acceptable socially and
functional on the individual level then

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180
functional on the individual level then
 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.270

you could have the opportunity to expand

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280
you could have the opportunity to expand
 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.399
you could have the opportunity to expand
that personality and to take into

that personality and to take into

that you wouldn't have had the

an earlier stage of development so young

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910
an earlier stage of development so young
 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.780
an earlier stage of development so young
would say perhaps that if you're a male

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790
would say perhaps that if you're a male
 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.940
would say perhaps that if you're a male
you have to become masculine before you

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950
you have to become masculine before you
 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.950
you have to become masculine before you
could become feminine and if you are a

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960
could become feminine and if you are a
 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.710
could become feminine and if you are a
female the reverse is true but that if

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720
female the reverse is true but that if
 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.370
female the reverse is true but that if
your development only stops with a

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380
your development only stops with a
 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.190
your development only stops with a
narrow and categorical gender identity

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200
narrow and categorical gender identity
 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.810
narrow and categorical gender identity
then there are elements that of being

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820
then there are elements that of being
 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.150
then there are elements that of being
that you could draw on that aren't at

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160
that you could draw on that aren't at
 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.250
that you could draw on that aren't at
your disposal and that will make you

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260
your disposal and that will make you
 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.290
your disposal and that will make you
weak so the shadow breaks up into the

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300
weak so the shadow breaks up into the
 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.220
weak so the shadow breaks up into the
anima animus and the anima is the female

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230
anima animus and the anima is the female
 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.200
anima animus and the anima is the female
inside the male so to speak and the

animus is the male inside the female and
 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.000
animus is the male inside the female and
Jung believed that he could see those

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010
Jung believed that he could see those
 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.210
Jung believed that he could see those
partial spirits manifesting themselves

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220
partial spirits manifesting themselves
 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.690
partial spirits manifesting themselves
in people's behavior and so he talked

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700
in people's behavior and so he talked
 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.730
in people's behavior and so he talked
about a couple of typical behaviors that

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740
about a couple of typical behaviors that
 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.610
about a couple of typical behaviors that
he thought were associated either with

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620
he thought were associated either with
 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.140
he thought were associated either with
anima possession so that would be in the

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150
anima possession so that would be in the
 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.120
anima possession so that would be in the
case of a man or animus possession in

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130
case of a man or animus possession in
 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.460
case of a man or animus possession in
the case of a woman and so he would

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470
the case of a woman and so he would
 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.860
the case of a woman and so he would
regard if you ever talked to someone

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870
regard if you ever talked to someone
 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.760
regard if you ever talked to someone
who's female who seems to respond to all

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770
who's female who seems to respond to all
 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.570
who's female who seems to respond to all
of your propositions with nothing but

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580
of your propositions with nothing but
 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.230
of your propositions with nothing but
argumentation for the sake of

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240
argumentation for the sake of
 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.960
argumentation for the sake of
argumentation you would regard that as a

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970
argumentation you would regard that as a
 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.360
argumentation you would regard that as a
manifestation of possession by the

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370
manifestation of possession by the
 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.570
manifestation of possession by the
animus and if you ever talk to a man who

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580
animus and if you ever talk to a man who
 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:53.530
animus and if you ever talk to a man who
is irrationally possessed by second-rate

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540
is irrationally possessed by second-rate
 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.950
is irrationally possessed by second-rate
and futile emotions then he would regard

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960
and futile emotions then he would regard
 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.820
and futile emotions then he would regard
that as possession by the anima so and

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830
that as possession by the anima so and
 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.220
that as possession by the anima so and
you can see that if you watch for it and

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230
you can see that if you watch for it and
 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.840
you can see that if you watch for it and
if you believe in such things the best

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850
if you believe in such things the best
 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.550
if you believe in such things the best
thing to do when confronted with someone

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560
thing to do when confronted with someone
 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.470
thing to do when confronted with someone
whose animus possessed is just shut up

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480
whose animus possessed is just shut up
 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.660
whose animus possessed is just shut up
because you're not going to make any

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670
because you're not going to make any
 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.880
because you're not going to make any
headway because the point of the

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890
headway because the point of the
 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.820
headway because the point of the
argument of an animus inspired argument

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830
argument of an animus inspired argument
 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.099
argument of an animus inspired argument
is to get you to argue not to win

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109
is to get you to argue not to win
 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.860
is to get you to argue not to win
because by getting you to argue the

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870
because by getting you to argue the
 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.560
because by getting you to argue the
animus wins
