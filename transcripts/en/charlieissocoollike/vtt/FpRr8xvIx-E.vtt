00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.000
Movies. We all love them, we all watch them,
and sometimes they change our lives.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.420
Mostly they don't, but sometimes they do, and here
are some of the ones that did for me. 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.190
Number 1: Spider-Man. It's not a perfect film.
It's not even the best

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.250
Spider-Man film, but when I saw it, it was the first
time that I ever experienced

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.070
Spider-Man's origin story, and it was that which
cemented him as being

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.300
my favorite superhero. As a kid, I loved Spider-Man
because he was just

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.020
really cool, and I spent literally years of my life

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.350
fantecizing about having all of his powers.
Pretty standard, really. As I grew up, however,

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.410
I realized that the reason I liked Spider-Man so
much was because he was just

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.440
the most relatable superhero for me.
He's given this great power

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.540
that he doesn't ask for. He instantly goes out and
uses that power for personal gain,

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.290
and it's only after his arrogence catches up with him that
he then decides to go and use his power for good. 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.600
Maybe it's weird for me to relate to the
character so much, but I

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.680
never felt like I asked to be charlieissocoollike.
It's just something that's kind of

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.720
happened to me, and now that it is who I am,
I do feel a responsibility

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.850
to try and use that for good as opposed to just
using it for myself,

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.610
and, of all people, Spider-Man was the one who
taught me that.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.970
Number 2: Jiro Dreams of Sushi. So this is a
documentary about an 85-year-old

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.070
sushi chef called Jiro that my friend Mickeleh told
me to watch because he felt like

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.130
Jiro, the 85-year-old sushi chef, reminded
him of me, and

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.140
I don't even like sushi, so obviously I was intriged.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.220
I really love this film, but I was simultaneously flatered
and a bit worried that Jiro reminded Mickeleh of me.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.270
Flatered because Jiro's crazy dedecation to sushi
has made him arguably 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.210
the best in the world at what he does. I don't think I deserve it,
but yes I am happy to be compared to that. 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.400
But it scared be because while Jiro does seem to
be happy,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.420
it's hard to really know if he feels fulfulled by the life
that he's led,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.510
and he also seems to have some pretty serious
regrets about not being close to his family

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.370
because of his dedication to his work.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.560
I always thought that I wanted to be the kind
of person 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.390
who would work, and work, and work, and work at
one particular thing and become

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.770
the best that I could at that one thing. And I still
kind of do want, but at the same time

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.500
this film reminded me not to work so hard that I
forget to live as well.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.910
Number 3: Toy Story 3. I'm pretty sure that the
original Toy Story was my first ever favorite film. 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.000
I have good memories of sitting right here in this
very spot, actually,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.940
watching it over and over and over again on VHS.
I remember acting

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.800
it out with my little brother in front of the television, and obviously
I got my own Buzz Lightyear for Christmas too. 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.070
Then twelve years passed, and I see a trailer for
this film called Wall-E,

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.080
which I initially dismiss as just being another
animated film for kids, but then I see it

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.260
in the cinema, I fall in love with it, completely in
love with it.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.300
I go home, I look up Pixar, the people who made the film,
I discover they're the same people who made Toy Story

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.810
my mind is blown, and instantly I'm a Pixar fanboy.
Again. 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.470
Two more years pass, and I find myself at Pixar
Studios about to see a preview screening of

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.240
Toy Story 3 before the film has even finished and
after introducing it,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.890
the director of the film, Lee Unkrich, turns around
and says, "Hey Charlie, my kids love your videos." 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.640
I don't know if I really learned any lessons from the
whole thing other than that just

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.760
sometimes things can come full circle in ways that
you do not expect them to, and when they do

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.870
it can be unbelievably cool.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.360
Number 4: Kiki's Delivery Service. So a teenage boy,
relating to Spider-Man. Maybe that's not much of a leap,

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.010
but finding myself at 20-years-old relating very
heavily to a 13-year-old animated witch 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.070
with a talking cat was slightly more
unexpected for me.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.290
Mild spoilers: in the film, Kiki, who loves to fly on her broom,
leaves home and sets up a delivery service, 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.230
and so the thing that she loves, flying, becomes her job. 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.230
As a result of this, Kiki then finds herself losing her
ability to fly and it's only through an effort to

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.240
try and get her powers back that she realizes she
has to find a new purpose in order

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.320
to be able to fly again. Basically, the film is a
perfect analogy for writer's block

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.090
and for what it's like to lose your passion for
something that you used to love.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.470
I'm a massive fan of Studio Ghibli's films. If you haven't heard of them,
they are basically the Japanese equivalent of Disney,

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.680
and Kiki's always been my favorite film of theirs simply
because of that lesson it taught me about creativity, 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.490
which it taught me at a time when I really needed to
hear it and when

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.990
nobody in real life seemed to be giving me the
answer I was looking for. I had to find it in a movie.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.630
Number 5: Shaun of the Dead. Every single film
that I have ever watched has

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.760
in some way contributed to me wanting to be a
filmmaker, but if I had to pick one 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.840
that tipped me over the edge, it would undoubtedly be
Shaun of the Dead. This might not come as a massive surprise 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.050
given that, like Shaun of the Dead, every film I've
made so far has been a

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.980
low-budget British comedy that plays off of a bigger genre
and given that Edgar Wright's movies 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.040
are a massive influence on many aspiring
filmmakers my age, almost to the point

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.250
of clichÃ©, but I can't deny my influences just 'cause
they're the same as everyone else's.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.150
It's such a brilliant film, it is so well written and
well shot, but the key for me

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.190
was that it was those things while simultaneously
being low-budget and British,

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.310
and it was thinking about those things that made
me realize that filmmaking is

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.550
a real-life thing that I can actually do if I wanted to,
and now I am. 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.640
So, yay. That's my list. Thanks for watching.
Goodbye!

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.510
STEPHEN FRY VOICE: You've just had the almost
imponderable joy of watching charlieissocoollike,

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.570
which makes you, like, cool.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.070
Thank you for watching. Here's my most recent
video in case you missed it.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.830
I was inspired to make this video after seeing
Mickeleh's videos on this topic,

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.710
and he, in turn, was inspired by Jon D. Barker,
so do check out their videos as well,

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.050
and if you'd like to do your own personally
significant films, then feel free to.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.810
You're allowed. It's your life. Do what you wish.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.590
But don't murder or all of the other illegal things.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.910
But you can make video responses-- no you can't even do
that anymore, can you? I guess just don't do anything then.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:21.810
Heh heh...

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:29.090
SILENCE

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.912
SILENCE
