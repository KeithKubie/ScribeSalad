00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.850
I remember watching this video online and
being mesmerized.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.820
The more liquid they spilled on the items
the more I thought “how was this even working?,

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.660
what’s going on here?”

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.360
This is a superhydrophobic coating with properties
that are seemingly impossible.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.920
But this material science field is making
some exciting developments with materials

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.100
that are even more impressive, and omniphobic.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.280
You might have heard of a term called hydrophobic,
which can mean you’re really scared of water,

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.610
but in this case we’re talking about an
object being extremely water repellent.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.430
You might see this with water on a nonstick
cooking pan when it beads up and rolls around

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.430
with ease.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.090
But surfaces can not only be only hydrophobic,
but omniphobic, meaning virtually any kind

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.501
of liquid, from water to oil can slide off
a surface with ease.

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:43.501
Which isn’t material you’d find in nature.

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:45.180
The applications for a property like this
are endless.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.820
They could help with the day to day cleaning
of your house, make electronics water resistant,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.690
could help ships glide through water faster
and even help heat transfer at nuclear power

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.690
plants.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.149
Reasons like these are probably why scientists
have spent years trying to get it right.

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:00.620
Soo what’s the hold up?

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.989
Well let’s start with the fact not all liquids
are the same and they have different surface

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.860
tensions, which causes them to interact with
materials differently.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.620
Let’s take water for example.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.870
Inside the liquid, there are intermolecular
attractive forces at play, meaning the water

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.710
molecules want to cling together.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.400
But when there are dissimilar molecules above
them, like air for instance– those cohesive

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.350
forces help the water molecules bond stronger
with their neighbors - creating a thin “barrier”

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.420
of sorts.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.740
This is the phenomenon that creates droplets,
and help water bugs stay afloat.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.369
But like I mentioned before, this surface
tension changes from liquid to liquid.

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.780
Water has a very high surface tension whereas
oil has a very low surface tension, so it

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.260
seeps into everything.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.470
So knowing that, material scientists have
created nanostructures made of small pillars

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.310
spaced out just enough so that liquid can
sit on small pockets of air.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.090
That way the liquid’s own surface tensions
lifts it up, causing all of these beads and

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.090
droplets to form.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.780
And it totally works!

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.870
Buut it relies on every pillar being perfect
and this structure is only as strong as its

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.870
weakest link.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.700
If one pillar breaks, the liquid can seep
through the air pockets and there goes all

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.700
your omniphobicity.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.590
And just to keep things more complicated,
the materials also have to withstand condensation.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.420
If water vapor makes its way into the pockets
within the omniphobic structure, it can condense

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.590
into liquid and destroy repelling properties.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.500
This has been one of the biggest hurdles that
material scientists have tried to overcome.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.900
And now researchers at MIT are tackling this
problem head on, They’ve used nanotechnology

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.760
to create not only microscopic, but condensation-resistant
“T” shaped structures.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.341
The difference between this new development
and earlier studies is that they made the

00:02:35.341 --> 00:02:38.260
air pockets disconnected, rather than connected.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.460
The disconnection would prevent a liquid from
penetrating a single air pocket and spreading

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.070
throughout the whole material, which helps
with the issue of condensation!

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.819
They’ve nailed a proof of concept, but they
still need more work to bring it into market.

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.080
But MIT isn’t the only team working on omniphobic
materials.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.530
A US Navy funded project from the University
of Michigan made an omniphobic coating.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.860
Instead of building it, the material can be
sprayed on.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.450
And as far as durability and clarity goes,
it’s one of the best coatings yet.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.080
Typically, researchers mix together a filler,
giving it repelling properties, and a binder,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.620
giving it durability.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.510
But that doesn’t always work, instead the
team focused on a property called “miscibility”.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.769
They did mathematical calculations of the
properties of many chemical substances in

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.910
order to predict the best solution.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:20.910
And it worked.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.360
Their coating is clear, durable, can be applied
to numerous surfaces and sheds just about

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.400
any liquid.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.340
They’re hoping it could last up to a year.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.730
Which sounds like a good goal since they’re
interested in putting it on naval ships to

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.510
reduce drag and save on fueling cost.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.659
However, some of the chemicals they used might
not be the safest and they want to reformulate

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.200
so they’re nontoxic and more commercially
viable.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.450
They have a goal to get the coating out in
the next year or two, so we’ll keep a lookout.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.430
It’s almost a race of who will create the
perfect omniphobic innovation, but regardless

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.310
who gets there first, the real winner will
be us, reaping the benefits of decades of

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.930
work like we always do and it’s going to
be amazing.

One last fun fact before you go, The MIT design
is so nice to look at because the periodic,

nanoscale features on the surface diffract
light, causing the colors in the image.
