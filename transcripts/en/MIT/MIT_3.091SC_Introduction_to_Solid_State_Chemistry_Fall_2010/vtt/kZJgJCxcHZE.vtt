00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.960
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.220
OK.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.890
Settle down.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.680
Settle down.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.450
Settle down.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.940
So the weekend doesn't begin
until after the 3.091 lecture.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.270
OK.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.240
A couple of announcements.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.110
Tuesday, Quiz 3 based
on Homework 3.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.260
The final exam has
been scheduled.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.080
In fact, all the finals are
scheduled now, so please

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.990
consult the Registrar's
listing.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.260
The celebration of celebrations,
the 3.091 final

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.430
exam, will be Tuesday, 15th of
December in the morning, 9:00

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.190
am to 12:00 noon over in the
Johnson Athletic Center.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.640
So I urge you to go through the
final exam schedule and

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.810
then make your travel plans when
you know what your last

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.630
obligation is.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.010
And book them soon, because
we've got about a quarter of a

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.660
million students in the Boston
area and the semesters all

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.550
come to a close within a very
narrow time window, and

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.030
everybody's trying to get
through a wormhole called

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.060
Logan Airport.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.950
So you want to be ready.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.290
Do not try to leave town before
you've met all of your

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.940
obligations.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.160
You can't leave before you've
finished all of your finals.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.620
But you know what they are now,
so call your travel agent

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.870
or make your internet booking.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.890
And an announcement for
Professor Paul's section.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.280
Owing to the holiday on Monday,
he's going to have

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.910
office hours from noon
to 1:30 today.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.620
So if you're in Professor Paul's
section, you'd like to

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.470
catch up with him, noon
till 1:30 today.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.800
All right.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.210
Let's get to the lesson.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.070
The last day we started looking
at octet stability,

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.450
and we looked at octet stability
and what it means in

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.940
terms of shell filling and some
sweet spot in energy with

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.420
respect to reactivity.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.200
And a filled shell leaves
us with this electron

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.290
configuration, ns2np6 for
n greater than 1.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.480
In the case of n equals 1,
there's just ns2 for helium.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.420
Otherwise, ns2np6.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.400
2 plus 6 is 8.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.160
There's the octet stability.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.070
It's observed trivially
in noble gases.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.250
And then we saw that
it can also be

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.350
observed in certain ions.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.110
And how do we get to
octet stability?

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.330
Electron transfer.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.350
And here's the prototypical
reaction.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.150
I like this.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.750
This is very iconic.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.850
It puts it in broad terms. The
marriage of an electron donor

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.640
with an electron acceptor leads
to the formation of a

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.120
cation and an anion, thanks to
electron transfer from the

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.400
donor to the acceptor.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.430
It doesn't end there, though.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.720
You have cations and anions in
the gas phase and they're

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.990
attracted to one another
by coulombic forces, or

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.050
electrostatic forces, and that
leads to ionic bonding.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.560
And today I want to go deeper
into it and study the

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.370
energetics of ion-pair
formation.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.100
So let's do it.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.810
And what I'm going to do is
study this with reference to

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.530
an example of sodium chloride.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:36.520
So we will go through the
energetics of sodium chloride,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.290
which we know is going
to exist as

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.550
Na plus and Cl minus--

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.350
sodium being the electron donor
and chlorine being the

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.430
electron acceptor.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.500
So what I'm going to do is show
you a plot of energy as a

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.200
function of separation.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.570
So you're going to have
to be pluralistic

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:56.650
here in your ideas.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.780
So, for example, if I wrote this
word by itself you don't

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.760
know if I'm saying lead or I'm
talking about the metal lead.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.920
The only way you know
is in context.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.450
And so you have to know
in context here.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.720
So r is not the radius
of the atom.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.730
In this case it's the symbol.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.580
And I'm using this symbol
not to confuse you.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.080
This is what professionals
use.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.170
So if you go to the text and the
literature you'll see r.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:26.220
This is the interionic
separation, and it's

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.170
determined nucleus to nucleus.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:35.920
So I'm going to put a sodium
ion at the origin.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.940
This is the origin.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.140
Energy is on the ordinate.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.725
So I'm going to model this
as a hard sphere.

00:04:42.725 --> 00:04:47.210
So this is sodium ion,
Na plus, and it's

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.780
got some finite radius.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.750
And its radius, I'm going
to call it r-plus.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.660
That's the radius
of the cation.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.530
And next to sodium I'm going
to put the chloride anion.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.170
And it's bigger.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.650
It's bigger.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.130
It's not to scale,
but it's bigger.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.200
So this is chloride, the
Cl minus, and it has

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.440
its radius, rCL minus.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.050
And then the interionic
separation is measured from

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.670
the sodium nucleus to the
chloride nucleus, and it's

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:22.920
given the symbol r0.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.370
That's the interionic
separation.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:34.460
And we could we write that r0,
in fact, is strictly r-plus

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.020
plus r-minus because we're using
a hard sphere model.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.490
So there's no shrinkage
when the two touch.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.300
So that makes sense.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.040
Now what I want to do is
calculate the energy here.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.030
The only energy that we have
here is electrostatic.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.320
So we're going to start and say,
imagine if we had these

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.890
two ions separated by infinite
distance and we brought them

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.410
to a separation of r0.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.510
How much electrostatic energy
would be stored there?

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.680
So I can write that as E,
and I'm going to call it

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.300
attractive.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.280
There's a force that attracts
these two ions together, and

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.540
that's given by Coulomb's Law.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.940
So that's the product
q1 q2 over 4 pi

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.940
epsilon0r, in general.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.670
I'm making this as a function
of r and then we're going to

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:24.920
figure out how to get to r0.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.710
Let's put a little
ledge in here.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.890
So q1, I'm going to make
that the sodium just

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:33.860
for grins and chuckles.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:43.090
So q1 is equal to the z, the
valence on the sodium, times

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.900
the charge, the elementary
charge.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.960
So the charge on the sodium is
plus 1-- so it's plus 1e--

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.220
and q2 is going to equal
the charge on the

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.120
chloride times e.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.620
And in this case the chloride
ion is negative 1, so q2 is

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.720
minus e, q1 is plus e.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.720
Now if instead I were doing
magnesium oxide, magnesium

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.760
would be plus 2, oxide
would be minus 2.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.940
So that's where the charge on
the ion comes into play.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:16.350
So we can put that in here and
will make this z-plus times e,

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:18.520
z-minus times e.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.870
So there's q1 q2 over
4 pi epsilon0 r.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.910
And in this case, for sodium
chloride, this is plus 1 times

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:36.640
minus 1 is minus 1 e squared
over 4 pi epsilon0 r.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.300
So this is a function of r.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.950
This e is 1/r.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:45.450
That's the hyperbole, and
I can draw that here.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.690
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:48.600
All right?

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.400
It's going to be a
right like this.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:53.890
Good.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.540
So that's the attractive
force.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:03.490
Now how do we avoid the ions
just blending together?

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.150
Why do they stop at r0?

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.180
What puts the brakes on
the coulombic force?

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:08.460
Ah!

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.790
For that we have to look at the
fine structure of sodium.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:14.580
So let's look at the fine
structure of sodium.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.750
So sodium is net
charge plus 1.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.960
But sodium more properly, if
I go to the next level of

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:25.310
structure, is really 11 protons
in the nucleus and

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.300
it's got electrons around it--

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.520
in total, 10 electrons.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:35.610
So it's net charge is
plus 1, all right?

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:41.680
Now if I'm way over here and
I look at sodium I just see

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.980
something of charge plus 1.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:48.640
And, in fact, I could model
sodium as just a point charge,

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.060
a plus 1, and do all the
electrostatics and I would be

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.010
perfectly accurate
in my estimation.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:59.450
But as I get closer I see
there's fine structure.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:00.780
It's like so many other
things in life.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.885
You know, from a distance it
looks really good, and you get

00:09:02.885 --> 00:09:05.190
up close you go, eww.

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:06.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.960
PROFESSOR: I'm not going to
mention any names, all right?

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.380
But it's Friday.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:10.920
Be careful.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:16.150
So as I get up closer I realize
that it's plus 1, but

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:21.660
the plus 1 is plus 11 mediated
by minus 10.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:26.710
So when things start getting
close together this exterior

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:30.350
of negative charge becomes
manifest, palpable.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.090
So let's look at the chlorine.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.660
The chlorine's coming,
sees plus 1, plus 1.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.180
It starts getting closer
and closer.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.680
And now what happens?

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.360
The negative electronic
configuration on the outside

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.190
of sodium is interacting with
the negative electronic

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.270
configuration on chlorine, and
the result is you have

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.540
electron-electron repulsion.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:55.200
And we've got an equation for
that, and that's given by E

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:02.240
repulsion is equal to some
constant b over r to the n.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.890
And this n is called
the Born exponent.

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.630
It's not the quantum number.

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.680
So r today means interionic
separation,

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.450
n means Born exponent.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.800
And you have to determine it
by experiment and the value

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:22.760
lies between 6 and 12.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.210
And we have to determine
b by experiment.

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:26.750
So let's say this thing's
got a-- pick a

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:27.410
number in the middle.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.520
Say it's 8.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.610
So let's plot r to the eighth.

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:37.680
So that's going to hug the
abscissa, and it's going to

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.890
come in really, really close.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:44.570
And then somewhere around this
distance here, where the

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:47.580
electron-electron repulsion
starts to be felt,

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.000
this thing takes off.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.870
But 1 over r to the 8 goes way,
way up fast. So instead

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:54.890
of being a gentle curve
it's more like a

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:56.900
hockey stick shape here.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.770
And so now the net energy is
the sum of the negative

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:04.080
attractive energy and the
positive repulsive energy.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.840
And if we sum the two what
are we going to get?

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.780
Well, way out here 1 over r
to the 8 is negligible.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.550
And the net value--

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:17.960
so E net, in red--

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.430
is essentially equal
to E attractive.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:25.820
And at very, very low values of
r, r to the 8 dominates r.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.770
So we have this as
the net value.

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:30.840
And the two sum--

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.650
and I can't quite do it because
of the way this is

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.460
drawn, but I think
you can see.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.780
These two eventually
equilibrate and

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:39.850
go through a minimum.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.410
So I'm going to cheat a little
bit here and I'm going to add

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.900
these two in such a way as to go
through a minimum value of

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:50.790
energy at r equals r0, which is
the sum of E attractive and

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.500
E repulsive.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:12:00.730
So we can sum those two and
let's see what we get.

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:12.980
At r equals r0, E net is equal
to its minimum value.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.070
So how do you find a minimum
in a function?

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:16.650
You take the derivative.

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.180
I'm going to put some
math to work here.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:23.890
So we'll take dE by dr and
set it equal to 0.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:30.820
And the value of r at which
it equals 0 is termed r0.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:31.500
OK?

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.020
So we'll just go through
and take the

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.450
derivative of that thing.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.940
And I'm not going to go through
all the math but just

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.120
show you the set-up here.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.830
What's the other thing
that we know?

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.200
dE by dr represents what?

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.700
That's force.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:50.520
So I could say that at r equals
r0 the net force is 0,

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.540
which is what you'd expect.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.390
Because if the net force isn't
0 it's going to either push

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:57.240
the ions farther apart or draw
them closer together.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.060
So this is mathematics
imitating reality.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.300
What a concept.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.610
Math working for you instead
of you working for math.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.070
So what do I have?

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.270
I have everything in these
equations except

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.540
the value of b.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.400
I'm assuming we know the value
of n from experiment.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.860
We don't know the value of b.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:20.420
And so you can solve to get
the value of b, and once

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:23.500
you've got that you can put
everything together and give

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:28.350
an expression for the energy of
the system at r equals r0.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:32.920
When you plug everything in you
get this: z-plus, which is

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.465
the net charge on the cation,
times z-minus, which is the

00:13:36.465 --> 00:13:42.890
net charge on anion, divided
by 4 pi epsilon0 r0.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:47.310
1 minus 1/n, where n is
the Born exponent.

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:50.060
And this is valid at
r equals r0 only.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:58.850
If you're not at r equals r0
then you can get the value of

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:02.460
b and then put it into this
expression, where E net will

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.630
equal E attractive
plus E repulsive.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:06.890
So there it is.

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:08.150
And so this represents--

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:16.370
this is the energy of a single
ionic bond, because that's all

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:17.320
the energy that's there.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.840
It's the single ionic bond.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:25.360
And the second thing that we
realize is plus times minus is

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:29.080
net minus, so this means that
it's negative quantity,

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:29.980
as it should be.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.790
It has to be a negative
quantity.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:33.080
All right.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.020
So what do we have here?

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.800
What we've seen by going through
this derivation is the

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:42.880
recognition that the ionic
bond is electrostatic

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.980
attraction mediated by
electronic repulsion.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.800
It's the balance of the two.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.745
And those words sound so good
to me that I'm going

00:14:50.745 --> 00:14:52.070
to write them down.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:59.140
Electrostatic attraction
mediated--

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.420
another lovely word--

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:06.170
mediated by electronic
repulsion.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:16.040
So that's how you get to the
final setting here of the

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.410
interionic separation.

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:20.110
So what are the characteristics?

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:22.380
What does this lead
to in terms of

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.280
characteristics of this bond?

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:31.020
Characteristics of
the ionic bond.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.750
First of all, it's
omnidirectional.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.270
This is a concept based on the
fact that the electric field

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:43.950
radiates in all directions
uniformly.

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:48.060
So the negative field coming
from the chloride ion is

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.630
uniform in all directions.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:52.200
There's no preferred
direction.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.660
Omnidirectional.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:54.470
OK?

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.160
E field--

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.170
oh, I better not say that.

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:07.230
Electric field, not the energy
field, radiates in all

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:10.380
directions uniformly.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.180
And that's going to
have consequences.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.640
I'm not just telling
you this because we

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.600
like cataloguing things.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.070
This isn't a bookkeeping
class.

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.820
So we're going to come
back, use this fact.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:33.720
And the second thing is that the
bond is unsaturated, which

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:38.110
is a chemical way of saying that
a given ion can bond to

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.510
more than one other ion.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.430
In other types of bonds
that's not the case.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:47.430
A given atom can only bond
once and then it's done.

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:52.050
Whereas in this case the ion
can bond to a plurality of

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:53.240
other ions.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:58.440
So ions bond to more than one.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:03.000
OK?

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.560
Plurality of bonds is formed.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.300
They're polygamous,
if you like.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.000
So what does that mean?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.270
That means that here
is what happens.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:17.600
We've got the blues as the
sodiums, and for any given

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:22.240
sodium it forms bonds without
limit until the number of

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:27.800
bonds is stopped by physical
limitations--

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.020
not because the E field
was saturated.

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.310
It's unsaturated.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:35.140
You just can't jam any more
chlorides physically around

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:35.740
the sodium.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.930
That's why the sodium is only
bonding to the number of

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:40.205
chlorides that it bonds to.

00:17:40.205 --> 00:17:42.605
There's no intrinsic
limitation.

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:51.140
So what happens when you get
to this situation where you

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:56.090
have omnidirectional forces,
unsaturated bonds, and ions

00:17:56.090 --> 00:18:00.280
that you can model as hard
spheres of constant radius?

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:03.190
All the sodiums have the same
radius, all the chlorides have

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.950
the same radius.

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:08.270
You make a 3-dimensional
ordered array.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:19.500
So you can make an infinite
atomic ordered array, which we

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.650
use the simple Anglo-Saxon
word last day

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:23.145
to describe: crystal.

00:18:23.145 --> 00:18:25.670
You form a crystal.

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:33.650
And as a result ionics have to
be solid at room temperature,

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:38.240
because if you've got thousands
and thousands of

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.490
atoms together in one
aggregate they're

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:41.560
not going to float.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.980
They're going to settle.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.690
Put another way, the strength
of the bond, the amount of

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:48.900
energy in here, is so great that
the thermal energy of the

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.763
room isn't great enough
to disrupt this bond.

00:18:52.763 --> 00:18:57.420
It's a combination of
unsaturated, omnidirectional,

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.310
and high energy.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:02.470
So we form solids at
room temperature.

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:03.470
OK.

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:05.860
Now I want to show the
energetics of that one because

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:06.850
this is good.

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:09.320
You know, I promised you I
wouldn't do derivations, so

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.300
I'm not going in
detail on this.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.710
I'm giving you just enough so
that I can introduce the

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:15.040
characters here.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.100
You know, how else
am I going to

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.860
introduce the Born exponent?

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:20.510
Am I'm just going to say,
there's this exponent n, the

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:21.330
Born exponent.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:22.850
We're going to introduce
it in context.

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:24.630
So now you know what
the energetics are.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.980
So now I want to prove to you
energetically along this line

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.830
that crystals will form.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:35.010
So let's imagine--

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:36.520
we're going to do this
thought experiment.

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:47.100
We're going to take three
ion-pairs of sodium chloride.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.090
So here's three ion-pairs
of sodium chloride.

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.850
And I want to compare these
three ion-pairs.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:57.240
So this is an ion gas.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:03.430
And the distance between
ion-pairs is great enough that

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:05.100
one pair doesn't affect
the other.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.350
The electrostatics are only
strong within the pair.

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:12.530
So we'll just label this
infinity with quotation

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:13.690
marks around it.

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.260
They're very far apart.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.860
When a physicist says they're
very far apart, very is code

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.370
for infinity.

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:22.820
So this one doesn't interact
with this one, which doesn't

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:23.900
interact with this one.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.530
And I want to compare the
energetic state of the ion

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:33.820
dispersion to what would happen
if I were to put all of

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:37.600
those in a single line.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.830
Plus, minus, plus, minus,
plus, minus.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.320
So then this has a certain
energy state, it's the energy

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.642
of the ion line.

00:20:44.642 --> 00:20:49.300
And I want to show you that
there's an energy decrease in

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:54.312
collecting all of these and
ordering them into a line.

00:20:54.312 --> 00:20:56.250
So there's more energy
in a line dance

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:57.520
than in ballroom dancing.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.150
That's what we're going
to say ultimately.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:20:59.450
OK?

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:01.300
So let's compare the energies.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.930
That's all we're going to do.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:05.060
So what's the energy of this?

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:08.720
Well, we're not going to do 3
versus 3 Let's think big.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:09.170
It's Friday.

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:12.690
So let's take Avogadro's number
of pairs, shall we?

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:22.350
So the energy of the ion
dispersion would then equal--

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:25.610
that's the energy of one pair,
and they're infinite distance

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:28.450
apart, so there's nothing to be
gained by putting them in

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:31.220
the same chamber.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.330
So it's just going to be N
Avogadro, if that's the

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:38.100
number, times the energy
evaluated at r equals r0.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.160
So we're done.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.550
And we know what that is.

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.300
I don't have to rewrite
it for you.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:42.620
OK.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:46.640
So now what I have to do is get
an estimate of the energy

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.040
of the line and show you
that the line is at a

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.165
lower energy state.

00:21:50.165 --> 00:21:52.420
Well, let's see.

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:56.240
Jocelyn, take the top one and
the middle one, please, but

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.360
not the bottom one.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.090
Thanks.

00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:58.380
OK.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.960
So now let's look at the
energy of a line.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.270
So we're going to do--
here's my line.

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:06.950
I'm going to get the
colored chalk.

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:08.720
Green and blue.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.880
You know, some people think
being a professor is so cool

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:14.540
because you get to travel, you
get to research, and so on.

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:15.580
It's the colored chalk.

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:16.855
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:16.855 --> 00:22:19.280
PROFESSOR: It's the
colored chalk.

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.400
All right.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.100
So there's a sodium.

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.860
And on each side of the sodium
we'll put a chloride.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:25.470
All right?

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.450
And I'm going to just
keep going this way.

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:30.690
Here's a sodium and
here's a chloride.

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:31.530
All right.

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:33.960
And now what I'm going to do,
I'm going to start here at

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:38.120
this sodium and I'm going
to count the energy,

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.610
electrostatic energy, that's
in this system.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.090
So we're going to count to the
left, we're going to count to

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.060
the right, and then we're going
to multiply it by the

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.780
total number of ion-pairs.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.540
And I know that the ones on the
end aren't the same, but

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:53.650
the number of ends over N
Avogadro, that's peanuts.

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:56.390
The edge effects are negligible
because there's

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:57.670
such a giant middle.

00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:58.760
That's how you model
this stuff.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.960
You don't obsess over the fact
that the last ion doesn't see

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.080
anything on that side.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.960
You just do it and forget about
it, because you know you

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.060
wouldn't do it for 5.

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.300
This would be a big problem.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:12.130
But if you have Avogadro's
number, who cares?

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:13.280
It's called risk assessment.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:13.610
All right.

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:17.050
So let's look at the
energetics here.

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:24.820
So what we've got is the
energy of the ion line.

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:25.470
OK?

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.970
So let's start with
this central one.

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:32.380
And separated by distance r0 is
the chloride, and there's

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.950
an attractive energy here.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:38.190
So that's going to equal
minus e squared over

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:42.400
4 pi epsilon0 r0.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.290
Now I'm going to keep going,
because the field is

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:46.710
unsaturated and goes
in all directions.

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:51.490
So this sodium, that's
a distance 2r0 away.

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:55.920
It's got a repulsive force
exerted on this sodium.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.920
So let's add that.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.040
So that's going to be plus.

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.020
A repulsive force raises
the energy of a system.

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:07.180
That's e squared over 4pi
epsilon0 times 2r0.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:08.620
And let's keep going.

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:10.940
So now let's go 3r0 away.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:15.330
So 3 times r0, that gets me out
to the chloride over here.

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:17.040
Let's put 3r0.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:20.570
Now that will take me from the
center of the sodium to the

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:22.610
center of the next chloride.

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:24.540
And that's going to
be attractive.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:30.180
So that'll be minus e squared
over 4pi epsilon0 times 3r0

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.180
plus, et cetera.

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.820
So you see how this goes.

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.560
So you go all the way out, you
add them all up, and you go

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.610
the other way.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:37.670
And so on and so forth.

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:39.400
So that's how the
derivation goes.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.370
You might say, hey
wait a minute.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:43.520
What happened to the Born
exponent and the repulsive

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.870
energy term?

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:48.190
Well, where's the repulsive
energy term going to be felt?

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:51.960
It's called electron-electron
repulsion.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.980
Axiomatically, the electrons
here are

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.980
nowhere near these electrons.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:00.130
See, you only have to count it
for the nearest neighbor.

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:02.530
So we can patch that
in at the end.

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:04.130
And we do.

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:05.610
I haven't forgotten.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:08.390
But I'm not going to spend a
whole day trying to derive

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:08.940
this thing.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.720
I'll show you how it
starts to evolve.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.290
At some point you end
up with something

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:13.490
that looks like this.

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:15.450
e squared over--

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:17.310
in fact, I'll put the
minus sign up here.

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:22.210
Minus e squared over
4 pi epsilon0 r0.

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:24.450
And you're going to double it,
because you're going to go one

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:26.710
side and the other side, and
you're going to get a series

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:33.830
that looks like this: 1 minus
1/2 plus 1/3 minus 1/4 plus

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.150
blah, blah, blah.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:36.090
Yeah.

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:36.760
OK.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:39.800
So what does this look like?

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:44.660
I've really broken this
into two pieces.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:49.570
So this coefficient out in front
here, you should now be

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.500
able to repeat this in your
sleep: e squared over 4 pi

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:53.740
epsilon0 r.

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:58.170
This is electrostatics,
isn't it?

00:25:58.170 --> 00:25:59.000
Electrostatics.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.580
This is the consequence
of Coulomb's law.

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.830
What's this second term here?

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:06.000
What's this all about?

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.440
Geometry.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.450
This is dictated by atomic
arrangement.

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:20.810
So I could calculate this if I
took, instead of a line, what

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:24.960
if I put them in a sheet subject
to the constraints of

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.400
those sizes and plus
1 and minus 1?

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.150
So what would be?

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.900
I'd start at the sodium and
count how many chlorides?

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:35.710
If I'm on a plane there'd be
one, two, three, four.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:36.820
And then how many sodiums?

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.810
Well, they'd be on the backside

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:40.090
of each of the chlorides.

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.430
And I'd add them all up in
2-space and I'd end up with

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:45.045
another coefficient here.

00:26:45.045 --> 00:26:46.070
All right?

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:50.490
And we compress all of this into
a coefficient which we

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:52.170
call the Madelung constant.

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.890
And it's a function of the
atomic arrangements.

00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:00.320
So different crystal structures
have different

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.450
Madelung constants.

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:06.302
It's named after a German
professor, Madelung.

00:27:06.302 --> 00:27:10.630
In 1910, he published
calculations for the energy of

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:12.230
a system of point charges--

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:14.510
just abstract theoretical
paper.

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:18.925
And then about 10 years later
another German professor by

00:27:18.925 --> 00:27:20.970
the name of Paul Ewald--

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:22.970
he did his PhD for
Sommerfeld--

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:25.770
he published a paper in which
he actually made the

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:30.310
calculation for ion crystals,
and he came

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:31.390
up with this constant.

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:34.380
And to show you the class of the
guy, instead of naming the

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.790
constant after himself he
named it after Madelung.

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:38.870
Now that's class.

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:42.190
So Madelung did the first
calculation so he gets named.

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:45.620
So now what we're going to do is
we're going to multiply by

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:48.970
the N Avogadro, because I've
got N Avogadro of these

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:52.510
things, and we're going to
put in the Born exponent

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:53.690
patch and so on.

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:56.260
And here's what the final
expression looks

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:59.220
like for the line.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.620
There are a few algebraic tricks
that I'm not willing to

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.140
do in class because I don't
think that's a profitable use

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.930
of our time in a chemistry
class.

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:08.940
But if you want to try the
derivation I have it in full

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.450
and we can compare notes.

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:13.350
So once we get the patch in it's
going to look like this.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:14.490
It'll be minus.

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:17.060
There'll be the Madelung
constant times

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:19.750
N Avogadro e squared--

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:22.020
and this is already assuming
it's plus 1, minus 1.

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:25.100
If this were magnesium oxide
there'd be a 4 in here.

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:32.170
4 pi epsilon0 r0 times
1 minus 1/n, where

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:33.870
n is the Born exponent.

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:38.730
So compare this to
this one here.

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:40.060
What's the only difference?

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.870
The only difference is the
Madelung constant, right?

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:44.160
It's the only difference.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:56.480
So E of the pair dispersion is
really equal to E of the line

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.240
divided by the Madelung
constant.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.670
So what I'm trying to prove to
you is that E line is more

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:03.860
negative than E of
the dispersion.

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:06.140
So it all hinges on the
magnitude of M.

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:08.240
If M is greater than 1 we win.

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:12.050
If M is less than 1 I've just
proved to you that water runs

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:13.390
uphill, so that's a bad day.

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:14.240
All right?

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.600
So let's calculate
the value of M.

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:21.020
And you can go to your
algebra books.

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:24.680
And you've got this series
natural log-- and engineers

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.160
write natural log "ln." I know
the mathematicians write

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.770
"log." Uh-uh.

00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:29.650
Engineers--

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:30.320
uh.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.620
That's 1 plus x.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:32.240
OK?

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.070
Natural log, 1 plus x.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:43.120
You can expand this as x minus
x squared over 2 plus x cubed

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.510
over 3, dah, dah, dah, dah.

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:46.080
You know, look that one up.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:50.250
Set x equal to 1, which is
what we've got, right?

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:54.510
Because we've got 1 minus 1/2,
1/3, dah, dah, dah, dah.

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:57.920
Go through it and you'll get the
value that M, according to

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.740
this, will give you 2 times the
natural logarithm of 2,

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.990
which is 1.386--

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:06.330
which is greater than 1.

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:08.170
And so we're golden.

00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:12.840
That means that the energy of
the line is lower, more

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.800
negative, than the energy
of the dispersion.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.400
So I'm going to do
this pictorially.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.780
Let's make an energy
level diagram.

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.370
And the energy level diagram
will look like this.

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:28.010
So up here the energy is 0 and
everything is negative.

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:31.595
So if I put this as
minus 1 unit.

00:30:31.595 --> 00:30:32.340
All right?

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:35.980
These are all negative values
increasing in this direction.

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:45.370
So this is the dispersion
of ion-pairs.

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:47.070
So all we've done is
take a cation and

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:48.270
put it to the anion.

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:52.670
We've just seen that if we do
the calculation for the line

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:56.580
it's 1.386 times whatever
this is.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:01.695
So that gives us-- this is for
the ion line, which I'm going

00:31:01.695 --> 00:31:05.650
to take the liberty of calling
a 1-dimensional crystal.

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:07.250
It's a 1-dimensional
ordered array.

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:15.580
And what I can do is go to the
3-dimensional array, start at

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:18.690
the lower right-hand corner
with that chloride.

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:21.630
Calculate the distance to each
of the nearest neighbor

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:23.860
sodiums. Go through
the geometry.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.440
The next nearest neighbor
chlorides, the next nearest

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:29.570
neighbor sodiums. And you'll
build an infinite series and

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:30.570
you'll evaluate it.

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:33.880
And in three dimensions
it's even lower.

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:38.140
It's 1.7476.

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:41.230
So this is for the 3-dimensional
crystal.

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:44.760
This is for the ionic crystal.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.410
All right?

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:48.390
3-D crystal.

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:52.400
So what this is showing is that
the system keeps making

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:53.660
more and more bonds.

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.110
Why does it make bonds?

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:58.590
Because the more nearest
neighbors it has the lower the

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:01.510
energy goes.

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:03.630
So making a 3-dimensional
crystal is

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:04.820
energetically favored.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:07.400
Now there are different
Madelung constants for

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.550
different crystal structures.

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:09.340
You say, well wait a minute.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:11.020
How do you get different
crystal structures?

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:13.780
Suppose instead of sodium
it's potassium.

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:14.850
What's the only difference?

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:16.940
Potassium is plus 1.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:18.300
What's the difference?

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:19.650
Size.

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:21.080
Potassium is larger.

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:24.470
They're not going to pack
quite the same.

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:26.800
And so depending on the
relative ion sizes--

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:31.440
I mean what if I have something
like silver iodide?

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.000
Iodide is huge.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.630
Silver is so small it'll fit
into the interstices between

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:39.980
touching iodines.

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.720
So it's going to have a
different crystal structure,

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.860
and the different crystal
structure will give us a

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:46.370
different Madelung constant.

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:48.130
And there it is.

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:52.210
So we've come a long way with
that little assumption of

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:53.660
octet stability.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.490
So now let's take a look at
what the properties are of

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:57.540
these things.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.400
They're solid at room
temperature because we've got

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.070
strong bonds.

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:02.400
High melting points.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.390
Bonding is related
to melting point.

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:07.640
Now think point is dictated by
bonding, because now you're

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:11.240
comparing thermal energy versus
the cohesive energy of

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.180
the crystal.

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:15.720
So tightly bonded substances
melt at high temperatures,

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.710
weakly bonded substances melt
at low temperatures.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:21.010
Transparent to visible light.

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:23.690
How do I know that?

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:24.970
Because I'm the professor.

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:25.570
No.

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:26.840
How do I know that?

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.970
How do we think about it when
someone says to you is

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:32.490
something transparent, in this
case to visible light.

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:37.310
Well, what I do is I say,
here's the solid.

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:41.780
This is the ionic solid and here
is visible light, h nu.

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:46.700
And I'm going to write 2 to 3
electron volts per photon.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.730
And what happens when I want
to decide whether this is

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:51.000
transparent to visible light?

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.690
Now look at the modeling here.

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:54.140
Photon is a squiggle.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:55.960
I don't know if that's
Cartesian space.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.425
This is like a crystal, right?

00:33:58.425 --> 00:33:59.700
I'm speaking California.

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:00.860
It's like a crystal.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:05.080
So now if I go inside I want
to make the energy diagram.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.360
So what's the energy
diagram look like?

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.260
All right?

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:12.270
So now the question
is how does--

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:17.510
if this is the energy diagram of
the crystal and I make this

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:21.960
the energy of the photon of
visible light, I'm going to

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:25.460
compare how much energy the
photon has versus how much

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:28.780
energy it takes to excite
electrons all the

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:30.710
way to a new state.

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:31.980
Because if you don't
excite them all the

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.140
way to a new state--

00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:35.720
they can't go part way,
so nothing happens.

00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:38.270
And if nothing happens the
photon goes through and that's

00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:40.440
transparent.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:43.830
Now what do I know about the
binding energy and the energy

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:46.240
level diagram of Na plus?

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:49.560
Well, it's isoelectronic
with neon.

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.960
And I know that neon has an
average valence electron

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:55.490
energy of about 20
electron volts.

00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:57.660
So my guess is the
visible light is

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.550
not going to do anything.

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:03.160
And so it just passes
right on through.

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.940
See, we got all that.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.090
Electrical insulator.

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:06.840
How do I know that?

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:09.160
Well, all that glitters
is not gold, but it

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.040
must have free electrons.

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.510
And these electrons
are all bound, and

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:16.490
they're tightly bound.

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:18.532
Hard and brittle.

00:35:18.532 --> 00:35:22.350
If it's going to be ductile the
atoms need to be able to

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:24.260
slide over one another.

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:26.890
Well, there's no way these can
slide over one another because

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:29.900
to slide over one another
requires that at some point

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:32.160
the two sodiums are going to be
nearest neighbors, and the

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.570
repulsive forces are so high
the crystal fractures.

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:39.890
So if you try to deform an ionic
solid you will get it

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:43.660
moving in accordance
to the elasticity.

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:46.790
So force will be proportional
to the extension--

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:49.270
Hooke's Law-- but if you try
to plastically deform

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:52.270
it, you shear it.

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:53.170
Soluble in water.

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:54.580
We'll come back to that later.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.530
Melt to form ionic liquids.

00:35:56.530 --> 00:36:00.150
And good for electrolytic
extraction of metals.

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:01.580
I showed you magnesium
last day.

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:04.700
Today I'll talk a little
bit about aluminum.

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:06.640
But that comes later.

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:07.120
OK.

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:11.520
So where do we find elements
that are going

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.510
to form ionic solids?

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:14.920
Well, you go back to the
beginning of the lecture.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.930
What do you look for?

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:19.580
You've got to find the box of
really good electron donors

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:22.130
and the box of really good
electron acceptors.

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:24.220
That's where you go.

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:28.340
So the good electron donors are
at the left side and the

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.990
good electron acceptors
are at the right side.

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:33.220
So if you take sodium
plus chlorine

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.360
you get sodium chloride.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:36.750
If you get calcium plus
fluorine, calcium fluoride.

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:39.332
Magnesium plus oxygen,
and so on.

00:36:39.332 --> 00:36:41.300
OK?

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.330
Yeah, this shows.

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:45.030
Yeah.

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:48.850
Aluminum plus oxygen, yeah.

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:50.780
There's Max Born.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:54.180
Max Born, he got
a Nobel Prize.

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:56.070
And so did Fritz Haber,
but we're going to

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:57.420
come to him in a minute.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:57.770
All right.

00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:04.820
So now I want to do this
energetic calculation one more

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:08.340
way, because right now we've
been operating with ion gas

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:11.130
but sodium isn't found
normally in the

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:12.250
form of an ion gas.

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:15.320
So let's do something
that starts with

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.810
elements found in nature.

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:26.670
So we want to form an ionic
crystal from elements in their

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:27.920
natural state.

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:33.660
And what's going to happen is
en route we're going to be

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.870
able to define a few more terms.
So that's going to make

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:39.090
everybody happy because we
get more definitions.

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:44.900
And this is called the
Born-Haber Cycle, named after

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:48.070
Born and Haber.

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:50.880
And what we're going to
do is we're going to--

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:53.360
pardon me, there's a C in
there-- we're going to invoke

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.570
Hess's Law.

00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:59.710
And Hess's Law is sort of
like Kirchhoff's law

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:00.740
for electric circuits.

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:05.050
Hess's law says that the energy
of a chemical change is

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:06.650
path independent.

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:18.380
So energy change in a chemical
reaction is path independent.

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:23.950
It's sort of like potential
energy in Newtonian mechanics.

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:26.090
It doesn't matter if you take
the elevator to the top of the

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:29.420
Hancock Tower or if you walk up
the stairs, the change in

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:33.320
potential energy is the same
when you express it from the

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:36.850
top of the Hancock Tower,
although you might be somewhat

00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:39.920
more exhausted having walked
the steps instead of taking

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:40.720
the elevator.

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.240
But you don't get any
credit in terms of

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.000
the potential energy.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:52.070
So let's use Hess's Law in
order to describe the

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:53.250
formation of sodium chloride.

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:56.940
So I'm going to start with
sodium as it's found in

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:58.980
nature, and I'm going to talk
about room temperature.

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:02.480
So sodium is a solid at room
temperature, and I'm going to

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:07.010
react it with chlorine gas.

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:08.755
Chlorine's a gas at room
temperature and it's a

00:39:08.755 --> 00:39:11.090
diatomic molecule.

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:16.640
And we're going to react it to
form sodium chloride, which is

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.810
a solid and a crystal.

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:20.590
Now you might say, well isn't
that kind of redundant?

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:23.230
No, because later on I'm going
to teach you about a form of

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:26.980
solid matter that does
not consist of atoms

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.310
in a regular array--

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:29.580
disordered solids.

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:33.300
So we're specifying, I want to
form crystal and solid sodium

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:35.775
chloride, because that's the
reaction that would occur if

00:39:35.775 --> 00:39:37.540
we were to do it in the lab.

00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:39.700
And what have we calculated
so far?

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:42.490
What we've calculated
so far is this.

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:48.630
We've calculated chloride ion
in the gas phase plus sodium

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:52.560
ion in the gas phase reacting
to form the crystal.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:57.720
And we've called this the energy
of crystallization.

00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.960
That's this Madelung stuff.

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.860
This is the Madelung
energy here.

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:02.430
All right?

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:04.370
I'll even put M here.

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:05.280
Madelung energy.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.320
And why am I using H?

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.850
Because that's what
the books use.

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:10.580
H is enthalpy, and for
condensed matter the

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.060
difference between enthalpy
and energy

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:13.660
doesn't amount to much.

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:17.870
So H, just for the record,
is enthalpy.

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:20.750
And we've been operating
with E as energy.

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:24.930
It's almost equal to
E, which is energy

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:26.250
for condensed matter.

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:31.090
For the gas phase
it gets hairy.

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:36.710
OK.

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:41.320
So I want to get us from sodium
solid, chloride solid

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.440
over to here.

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:43.410
So how am I going to do that?

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:47.090
Well, first of all, I know how
to make sodium ion gas.

00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:52.630
I start with sodium gas and then
by ionization I make the

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:55.280
electron plus sodium ion.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:58.730
So this is called the ionization
energy, isn't it?

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:00.170
This is the ionization energy.

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:02.060
Sodium gas goes to that.

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.090
And now how do I get sodium
gas from sodium?

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:06.310
Well that's just called
sublimation.

00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:09.050
So this I'm going to need
delta H of sublimation.

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:12.560
Sublimation is the conversion
of solid to vapor.

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:16.640
And you can look that up
on the Periodic Table.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.310
I'll show you how to get
that in a second.

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:19.780
And now how do I get
chloride gas?

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:23.370
Well chloride gas is going to
start with atomic chlorine

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:27.320
gas, but instead of losing an
electron I've got to acquire

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.420
an electron.

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:33.720
And this action of adding an
electron is sort of an inverse

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:38.860
ionization, and this is called
electron affinity.

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:41.230
And there are tables of
electron affinity.

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:44.620
So each element has the ability
to lose an electron,

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:45.950
it has the ability to
gain an electron.

00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:48.485
Losing an electron is ionization
energy, acquiring

00:41:48.485 --> 00:41:50.000
an electron is electron
affinity.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.100
And just as with ionization
energies, if you have multiple

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:55.730
electrons you have a first
electron affinity, second

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:57.580
electron affinity, and so on.

00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:00.270
And now how do I get
to atomic chlorine?

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:02.760
I've got to dissociate
diatomic chlorine.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:04.120
So this is called
dissociation.

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:08.790
So that's the whole thing.

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:11.000
And I'm going to now put
some numbers on here.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:11.200
Let's see.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:16.120
I'm going to call sublimation
step one, dissociation step

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:22.280
two, ionization I've got here
is step three, electron

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:25.810
affinity is step four, and
crystallization or

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:27.630
Madelung is step five.

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:32.390
And so working off of Hess's law
we can say that the total

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:36.380
energy required for the
formation of the crystal--

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.930
delta H for the reaction.

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:39.560
What's the reaction?

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.260
The reaction of sodium
plus chlorine

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:42.470
to make sodium chloride--

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:47.210
is going to be the sum of all of
the constituent components.

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:49.870
The sum of all the delta's H.

00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:51.160
Not delta H's.

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:52.990
delta's H, like attorneys
general.

00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:53.660
All right?

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:54.850
So now let's add these up.

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:56.500
So we go number one.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:01.120
Number one I can look up
on the Periodic Table.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:01.510
Where is it?

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:03.810
There's Fritz Haber.

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:05.310
So that's given here.

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:06.630
If you look on the Periodic
Table that'll

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:07.770
give you the number.

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:12.640
And for sodium it's 108
kilojoules per mole.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.990
Number two, get that
from tables.

00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:16.660
It's 122.

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:20.310
Number three is just the first
ionization energy.

00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:22.250
You look it up on the
Periodic Table.

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:25.220
First ionization energy of
sodium is about 5.3 electron

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:29.320
volts, which turns out to be
496 kilojoules per mole.

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.230
But look, these are all positive
energies and we're

00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:33.140
trying to make a net
negative energy.

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:35.340
So these three steps
are all raising the

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:36.600
energy of the system.

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:40.820
Finally, acquiring an electron
by chlorine is going to

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:43.190
decrease the energy of the
system, because chlorine is a

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:44.655
good electron acceptor.

00:43:44.655 --> 00:43:46.430
So that's minus 349.

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:47.900
But watch this people.

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:51.550
The energy in forming the
crystal from the discrete

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:57.220
ion-pairs is 787 kilojoules per
mole, which gives us a net

00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:02.690
value of minus 410 kilojoules
per mole.

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:05.580
So what this is showing you
is what the relative

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:07.830
contributions are
of the different

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:10.630
components of that thing.

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:12.450
So here it is in
graphical form.

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:15.350
There's the vaporization
of sodium.

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:18.390
This is the dissociation
of chlorine.

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:20.500
This is the ionization
of sodium.

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:21.810
All positive energies.

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:23.110
And now electron affinity.

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:25.870
And look at this contribution
from the Madelung energy.

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:28.970
So when things crystallize a
lot of heat's given off.

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:35.160
In fact, we can use that in
cooling and moderating climate

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.700
if we're clever about it.

00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:37.400
All right.

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:41.960
Now just to show you what the
different values are here that

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.500
you're going to go in and get
the lattice energies, you need

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:47.750
to know the various
r values, you see.

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:50.970
The r0 is simply going to be
the r-plus and the r-minus.

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:53.440
So lithium fluoride,
there it is.

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:57.600
There's the lattice energy and
it's based on the combination

00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:00.090
of lithium cation and
fluoride anion.

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:02.710
So they've gone through and
calculated these values.

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:05.090
So there's sodium
chloride is 787.

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:07.020
And, you know, you even get
things like the boiling

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:08.020
points, melting points.

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:11.920
So sodium chloride, for example,
melts at about 800

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.290
degrees Celsius.

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:17.310
Now if you take magnesium oxide,
magnesium oxide is,

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:19.860
look, 3,700 versus 700.

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:22.170
And the melting point of
magnesium oxide is

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:24.480
2,800 degrees C.

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:25.250
Look at aluminum.

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:29.340
Aluminum plus oxygen, look at
the end binding energy there.

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:33.200
It's phenomenal, which means
it might be useful for--

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.820
I'm standing underneath
the shuttle here.

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:37.800
This is the tiles underneath the
shuttle, and they're made

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:40.730
of aluminum oxide because the
Madelung energy is so high so

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:43.120
it's got the thermal
shock resistance.

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:46.810
So now you know how to go and
design things for thermal

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:48.340
ablation resistance.

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:49.990
All you need is this table.

00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:50.800
That's all.

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.650
No, you need a little more than
that, but this is a good

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:53.740
place to start.

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:56.320
If you don't understand this
table I don't want you working

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.080
on the project.

00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:58.980
OK?

00:45:58.980 --> 00:45:59.700
What else?

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.850
All this shows you-- yeah,
we're going skip that.

00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:02.160
All right.

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.390
So now we've got a
few minutes here.

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:06.360
What I want to do is last day
I talked about magnesium,

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.020
today I want to talk
about aluminum.

00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:11.510
And it is also made in an
electrochemical process.

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:14.370
In this case the electrodes
are horizontal.

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:16.980
We feed aluminum oxide in
and we pass current--

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:17.870
and huge currents.

00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:22.615
This thing typically runs at
300,000, 400,000 amperes and

00:46:22.615 --> 00:46:24.770
about 4 volts.

00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:27.250
So with the cathode we are
running-- remember, we're

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:28.910
running nature in reverse.

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:31.720
Instead of the electron donor
that aluminum is, we're

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.370
shoving electrons onto aluminum
ion and converting it

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:35.460
back to aluminum.

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:39.090
Unfortunately, on the anode side
we have to use carbon,

00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:41.330
and the carbon itself
is consumed.

00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:43.320
So we consume about a half
a ton of carbon to

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:44.910
make a ton of aluminum.

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:47.820
So aluminum smelters generate
a lot of greenhouse gases.

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:53.730
So you can see this is like
a drafting pencil: it's

00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:54.810
constantly being fed.

00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:56.340
And to give you a sense of scale
this is probably about

00:46:56.340 --> 00:47:00.520
10 feet across, and this gap is
about 2 inches, and this is

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:02.780
about, I don't know, a
foot and a half deep.

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:04.720
It's going to get about 1,000
degrees Centigrade--

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:07.710
liquid aluminum and
liquid salt.

00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:09.660
So this is what a smelter
looks like.

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:13.232
What's the sound of
electric current?

00:47:13.232 --> 00:47:13.650
Yeah.

00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:16.810
The only sound you hear is the
fans on the top that keep the

00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:17.470
place clean.

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:19.450
There's the busbars that are
bringing in the current.

00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:23.410
And all of these various
posts are these things.

00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:25.710
So all of the magic
is occurring

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:26.940
below the floor here.

00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:29.780
It was invented simultaneously
in the United States by

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:32.700
Charles Martin Hall and in
France by Paul Heroult.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:35.390
In the same year they filed
patents independently and

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:38.080
eventually crossed license
when they collided at the

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.260
World Court.

00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:41.450
So this is what happens.

00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:44.820
We dissolve aluminum oxide in
a molten fluoride called

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:48.000
cryolite, which originally
came from Greenland, make

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.530
liquid aluminum carbon
dioxide.

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:52.330
Now if we wanted to make this
truly green, we want to

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:55.100
eliminate greenhouse gas
emissions, you need to find an

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:56.490
inert anode.

00:47:56.490 --> 00:47:59.970
So on an inert anode aluminum
oxide would be converted into

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:01.560
aluminum and oxygen.

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:06.540
So not only would you not
produce greenhouse gases but

00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:10.760
you'd produce tonnage oxygen,
which is marketable.

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:14.520
So some of the work that goes
on in my lab is in advanced

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:18.380
materials with a view to trying
to find an inert anode

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:21.660
that would then make this
process very, very clean and

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:25.700
justify substituting aluminum
for steel in cars.

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:32.680
By the way, when you have the
field, even though it's a DC

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:34.980
current it's a divergent
field.

00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:39.580
And this is me in a magnesium
smelter just in Utah.

00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:41.690
There is the busbar for
the magnesium cell.

00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:44.360
So I'm about, oh, two
meters away from

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:46.240
the edge of the busbars.

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.180
The magnetic field is so high
I've got one, two, three,

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:54.560
four, five paper clips standing
against gravity.

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:57.720
And I asked them for paper
clips and there

00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:58.560
was no office there.

00:48:58.560 --> 00:48:59.920
They managed to find a few.

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.540
I wanted to see how
many would go.

00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:04.520
I'm willing to bet I could
probably have about seven or

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:07.510
eight paper clips up before the
gravity would cause them

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.970
to collapse.

00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:09.290
That's the intensity
of magnetic

00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:10.770
fields in these smelters.

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:14.230
So when you drive up to the
smelter for the tour you park

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:16.940
a fair distance away, you leave
your wallet with the

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:19.940
credit cards in it, because
this is the biggest bulk

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:22.410
demagnetizer you can imagine.

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:25.630
If you've got a watch that's
got hands that move they're

00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:26.655
going to be going like this.

00:49:26.655 --> 00:49:28.590
[GESTURING]

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:30.640
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.430
This is the shuttle.

00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:34.870
This is forged aluminum
wheels.

00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:37.410
The shuttle lands on Centerline
racing wheels.

00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:39.140
They're forged at a place
in California.

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:40.810
They're made of aluminum
alloy.

00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:42.870
And I don't know if you can read
on the side here, it's a

00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:45.340
little bit light, but these
are special tires.

00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:48.800
They're made by Michelin

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:54.880
So, anyways, the whole message
here is learn the lessons here

00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:59.760
in 3.091 and then we can work
together to make metal in an

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:01.230
environmentally acceptable
way.

00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:04.050
And just before I send you on
your way for the weekend I

00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:06.890
thought I'd tell a little
joke related to

00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:08.400
the uncertainty principle.

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:09.380
So the joke goes like this.

00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:13.740
Heisenberg is racing down the
Autobahn and he gets pulled

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:18.410
over by the state trooper who
comes to the car and says,

00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:20.610
where's the fire buddy?

00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:22.560
Do you know how fast
you were going?

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:25.860
And Heisenberg looks at
him he says, no, but I

00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:27.122
know where I am.

00:50:27.122 --> 00:50:28.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:28.670
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:29.270
Get out of here.

00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:30.890
Have a good weekend.
