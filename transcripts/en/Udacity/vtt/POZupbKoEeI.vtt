[MUSIC]

00:00:03.505 --> 00:00:06.783
Because this orientation is prerecorded
for use semester after semester,

00:00:06.783 --> 00:00:09.497
we're not going to spend much time
talking about things that will

00:00:09.497 --> 00:00:11.150
change fairly often.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.330
For example, we won't talk about
specializations, course offerings, and

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.080
curricula because those all
change semester to semester,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.220
especially as the program is growing.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.160
Instead, there are several websites
that contain up-to-date information on

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.100
the program, and we've provided links
to those in the instructor notes below.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.470
We recommend checking out
the OMSCS program website for

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.550
information on graduation
requirements and course offerings.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.690
You can check out the registrar's
website for calendars,

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.790
payment information, and
other general Georgia Tech policies.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.740
And you should make sure to
check your email often, for

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.880
messages from your advisors and
your professors.
