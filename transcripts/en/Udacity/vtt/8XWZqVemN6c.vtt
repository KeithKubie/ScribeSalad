00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.680
There are multiple ways to do this, but here is the one I chose. I chose to

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.370
make one printf statement for each row. We want eight spaces with the number of

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.430
cookies, followed by a vertical bar. Followed by eighth spaces with the number

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.780
of boxes of cereal. Followed by another bar, followed by the name. I'll need to

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.056
print all three variables, so I'll include them as parameters separated by

00:00:21.056 --> 00:00:26.364
commas. The format string will start with int value, so I'll use a d. And it'll

00:00:26.364 --> 00:00:32.780
be eight wide, so I have 8. Then, that vertical bar, then the decimal value,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.407
percent f with a width of 8 and 2 decimal places and then the string. The

00:00:38.407 --> 00:00:41.543
formatting string will look the same for my row and for cay's row, but I'll use

00:00:41.543 --> 00:00:46.098
cay's variables instead of mine. Since I'm using this pattern twice, maybe I

00:00:46.098 --> 00:00:49.923
would want to make a variable for it. And call it, Row Pattern or something

00:00:49.923 --> 00:00:54.540
like that, but since I'm only using it twice, I'm going to leave it for now. So

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.923
far it looks like I'm eating all of the cookies on my own. But I haven't

00:00:58.923 --> 00:01:02.216
surveyed all of my coworkers yet, the answer could change. Now, if I'm going to

00:01:02.216 --> 00:01:04.900
collect more data, I may want to change my program to use a scanner to take in

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.050
input and put it in the table. We'll leave that for now though.
