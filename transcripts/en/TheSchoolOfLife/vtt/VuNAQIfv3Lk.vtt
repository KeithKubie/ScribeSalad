00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:06.640
Given how pejorative the term is, we’re
understandably keen to locate snobs somewhere

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.220
far from us. They are the people in the newspaper,
or the ones who live in the other part of

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.300
town or went to the school we didn’t go
to – but it’s nice not to imagine them

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:24.970
too near to home. Yet that’s to deny an
obvious eventuality: snobs may lie closer

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:32.989
to us. Snobs form couples; they have children.
And we might be among them. However painful

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:40.440
the unvarnished thought, we might be the children
of snobs. It’s a situation it can be therapeutic

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.770
to face up to and to try to make sense of.
Related image What is a snob? It has little

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.149
to do with an old-fashioned love of aristocracy.
A snob is simply someone without an independent

00:00:53.149 --> 00:01:00.339
center of judgement, who can only value what
the ‘in’ group in society happens to esteem

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:07.110
at any point in time. Snobs’ opinions and
tastes might be quite sane (or not); the key

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.850
thing is that they aren’t their own. They
cannot tell what to make of anything until

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:21.120
other, prestigious voices have made up their
minds for them. There is a particular conundrum

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.230
that sets in when snobs have a child: how
should they evaluate this new creature, in

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.720
whom the world has no particular interest
and who cannot wow or dazzle it? The thing

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:40.760
merely sits in its cot, dribbles and screams
a lot. It cannot do, it can only be. The snobs’

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.650
first reaction is often to say that they don’t
‘like babies’ as a generic category. It

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:53.030
sounds innocent enough, but the distaste is
more fundamental: babies are unlikeable first

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.660
and foremost not because they are messy and
noisy, but because they are so unimpressive

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.880
in worldly terms. Image result for 1950s family
At heart, the snob suffers from low self-confidence,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.950
which is why the incompetence of their own
small child is so galling, threatening to

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.200
evoke their own sense of fragility and vulnerability.
The baby can’t buy or sell a company, star

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.300
in a movie, or even drink neatly from a cup
– and may on this basis generate panic and

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.580
fury in their snobbish carers. Fortunately,
with a little time, school comes along – granting

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.410
snobs the perfect tool with which to manage
their feelings. Snobs make it very clear to

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.230
their offspring that doing well at school,
very well indeed, is not merely pleasing or

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.060
cautionary, it is quite simply essential.
Life more or less depends on it. There need

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.130
to be cups, prizes, trophies and high scores
in pretty much every subject. Doing well enough

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.840
isn’t enough; excelling is the goal. If
you don’t perform, you cannot be loved:

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.200
whether this is directly spelt out or merely
artfully suggested, this is the ideology under

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.700
which the offspring of snobs grow up. Unsurprisingly,
most children of snobs do very well at school.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.201
And at university. And later on, in the job
market. A feeling that one doesn’t deserve

00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:26.760
to exist unless one meets the criteria of
worldly success can do wonders for one’s

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.290
productivity. Offering conditional love has
a habit of getting people to meet one’s

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.680
conditions. Image result for 1950s office
But that is also why the children of snobs

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.030
are uncommonly likely to be on their way to
a nervous breakdown, which often sets in just

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.459
when most of the worldly boxes have been ticked.
The longing that one should be recognised

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.110
for being and not just doing – even if one
has done quite a lot – is an extremely stubborn

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.300
part of human psychology, which has a habit
of periodically rearing its head and creating

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.989
serious trouble if it keeps being ignored
across a lifetime. We may well be able to

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:10.400
meet conditions, but we can’t quite forget
the desire to be loved without them, simply

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.879
for being ourselves, in all our original messiness
and confusion. Through a breakdown, by deliberately

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:24.050
sabotaging what we have achieved in the world,
we may be trying to go back and taste a simple,

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.810
condition-less love that was denied to us
in the early years. We’re trying – at

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.960
huge cost – to re-experience a missing stage
of development. We are tired of decades of

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.349
making symbolic offerings under emotional
duress to the ghosts of emotionally withholding

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:49.439
parents. It might be better to sit in hospital
for a while and disappoint everyone. The more

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:54.490
we understand the risks we face, as children
of snobs, the less danger there will be of

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.599
having to act out our complaints. To be a
child of snobs is a diagnosis like any other

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:07.930
– and deserves its own taxonomy, treatment
and pathway to health. Part of this involves

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:15.460
overcoming anger towards one’s carers – and
realising that snobs are not evil, merely

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.220
wounded. As their child, one will have to
put extra effort into the delicate task of

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:27.339
finding oneself valuable and worthy outside
of achievement, not because of anything one

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:34.309
has said or done, but just because one exists
– which should always, of course, have been

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.400
enough.
