00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.030
To see the difference between
cash accounting and accrual

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.820
accounting, I'm going to go
through this little example.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.528
And first I'm going
to account for things

00:00:06.528 --> 00:00:09.040
using a cash basis
of accounting.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.064
And then we'll do it
with an accrual basis.

00:00:11.064 --> 00:00:12.480
And just so you
have some context,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.300
the cash basis is any time
you get cash from a customer,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.720
you would count that as revenue.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.530
And any time you
have to spend cash,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.130
you count that as an expense.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.320
And you'll see that that's
what most small businesses do,

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.340
while most slightly more
sophisticated businesses would

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.590
use accrual-based accounting,
because that matches up

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.750
your actual expenses and your
revenue a little bit better

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.630
in each period.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.213
So let's just go
through this example,

00:00:38.213 --> 00:00:40.150
using the cash basis first.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.770
And we're going to assume that
we start off with no money.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.500
So in Month 1, you cater an
event where the cost to you

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.230
was $100.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.130
The customer pays you
$200 for your services.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.510
And maybe they pay your
$200 ahead of time,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.100
so that you have the cash to go
buy the food and the paper cups

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.410
and paper plates or whatever.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.270
So you get $200 in revenue.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.300
This is a cash
basis of accounting.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.490
And you get to spend
$100 of that on supplies,

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.790
and maybe you had
to hire some help,

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.450
and you had to pay
yourself a salary.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.400
So if you got $200, and
you used $100 of that,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.880
your profit here-- I'll
do profit in green --

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.670
your profit is going to
be-- no, that's not green--

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.490
your profit is going to be $100.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.320
And if you started
with no cash, your cash

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.820
at the end of
period-- this is going

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.500
to be the cash at
the end of Month 1--

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.890
you will now have $100 of cash.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.230
Now let's go to Month 2.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.000
You cater an event where
the cost to you was $200.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.840
You and the customer
agree that they

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.450
can pay you $400 the next month.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.210
So in this month,
we have to use $200,

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.390
maybe our bank
lets us overdraft,

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.904
so let's say-- I shouldn't
write-- This is an expense,

00:01:55.904 --> 00:01:57.320
so I don't have
to write negative,

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.240
we're assuming this is going
out, I'll write it in red.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.810
So we are going to use $200,
but we don't get any revenue

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.830
because we're doing the
cash basis accounting.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.660
The customer's not
paying us in that month.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.720
They're paying us
$400 the next month.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.702
So we get no revenue
in that period.

00:02:12.702 --> 00:02:14.160
So it looks like
we got no revenue.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.870
We had $200 of expenses.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.745
Our profit here is going
to be negative $200.

00:02:20.745 --> 00:02:22.860
And when we look
at how much cash,

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.830
we had $100 of cash
entering into Month 2.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.060
We're using $200 of that.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.840
And so now we've kind of
overdrawn our bank balance.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.000
Maybe we owe our bank now $100.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.570
Let's go to Month 2.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.240
You get $400 from the customer
in the previous month.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.135
You also get $200 in
advance from a customer

00:02:43.135 --> 00:02:45.920
that you have to
cater for next month.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.582
So we've done no
catering this month,

00:02:47.582 --> 00:02:48.790
but we've got a lot of money.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.200
We got $400 from the
previous month's customer

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.780
and $200 for a
customer that you're

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.230
going to cater for next month.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.120
So we got $600 on the
cash basis in revenue.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.780
And we had no expenses
in that month.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.380
So we have $600 in profit,
and our cash balance increases

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.955
by $600.

00:03:06.955 --> 00:03:11.680
So at the end of this
month, we now have $500.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.360
Now Month 4, you cater
the last customer's event.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.580
It cost you $100.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.690
So once again, you
just have to spend--

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.910
I want to do that in
magenta-- you just

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.540
have to spend the $100 in Month
4 to cater the actual event,

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.400
but you got no
revenue in that month.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.920
So it looks like you took
a loss, negative $100.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:40.810
And then your cash balance
will go down to $400.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.100
So this is a cash basis.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.780
This is how a lot of
businesses run it.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.571
But as you can see,
there's a problem here.

00:03:45.571 --> 00:03:49.360
It looks like our profit is
jumping all over the place.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.360
Sometimes we're profitable,
sometimes we're not.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.450
Sometimes we're profitable,
sometimes we're not.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.290
Even though our business is a
little bit steadier than that

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.010
would seem to imply.
