00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So, now for the answer. I already gave you a couple of hints:

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
doesn't work on Sunday, doesn't work on Monday, doesn't work on Tuesday either.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
However, what happens on a Wednesday?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You see the word Wednesday doesn't really fit into this day-of-week array.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
What we get here is a simple buffer overflow,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
so the okay variable gets overwritten with Y,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
which actually is the exact value that the program needs in this variable in order to work.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.538
So we have the curious situation of a program that works only on Wednesdays.
