00:00:00.113 --> 00:00:01.733
- [Voiceover] All right grammarians,

00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:02.793
let's get down to it,

00:00:02.793 --> 00:00:05.513
and start talking about
possessive pronouns.

00:00:05.513 --> 00:00:07.993
A possessive pronoun is a pronoun

00:00:07.993 --> 00:00:10.892
that we use to show
possession of something

00:00:10.892 --> 00:00:13.525
which is just sort of
a fancy way of saying

00:00:13.525 --> 00:00:16.885
"you have it."

00:00:16.885 --> 00:00:21.885
So possession equals having stuff.

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:26.495
Now we can essentially divide
possessive pronouns in half,

00:00:26.495 --> 00:00:28.235
because on this side of the divide,

00:00:28.235 --> 00:00:32.795
we have a list of pronouns
that behave like adjectives,

00:00:32.795 --> 00:00:33.895
and on this side,

00:00:33.895 --> 00:00:38.755
we have a group of pronouns
that behave like nouns.

00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:41.215
I'll list them and then
we'll give some examples.

00:00:41.215 --> 00:00:42.415
So the possessive pronoun

00:00:42.415 --> 00:00:45.395
that behaves like an
adjective for me is my.

00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:46.496
The possessive pronoun

00:00:46.496 --> 00:00:50.896
that behaves like a noun for me is mine.

00:00:50.896 --> 00:00:52.799
Our behaves like an adjective;

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:55.099
ours behaves like a noun.

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:57.039
Your behaves like an adjective;

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.079
yours behaves like a noun.

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.879
Her behaves like an adjective;

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.858
hers behaves like a noun.

00:01:02.858 --> 00:01:04.978
His behaves like an adjective;

00:01:04.978 --> 00:01:06.898
his behaves like a noun.

00:01:06.898 --> 00:01:08.518
Its behaves like an adjective;

00:01:08.518 --> 00:01:10.159
its behaves like a noun.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.378
And their behaves like an adjective,

00:01:12.378 --> 00:01:14.538
and theirs behaves like a noun.

00:01:14.538 --> 00:01:16.422
Now I'd like to point out that nowhere

00:01:16.422 --> 00:01:18.748
in any of these words does there appear

00:01:18.748 --> 00:01:21.688
such a thing as an apostrophe.

00:01:21.688 --> 00:01:23.028
That little guy.

00:01:23.028 --> 00:01:24.268
I know this much is true:

00:01:24.268 --> 00:01:29.118
there are no apostrophes
in possessive pronouns.

00:01:29.118 --> 00:01:33.515
So it's not ours,

00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:35.595
it's ours, like that.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:39.298
It's not yours with an
apostrophe like that,

00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:41.918
it's yours with no apostrophe.

00:01:41.918 --> 00:01:43.659
Likewise it's not

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.219
hers, his,

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:49.700
it's is the big one.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.240
That means something entirely different.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.409
Or theirs.

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.320
Across all varieties of English,

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.860
the possessive pronouns don't
have any apostrophes in them.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.960
So this is a very handsome looking chart

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.400
if I do say so myself,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.659
but it doesn't really do the work

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:11.879
of explaining what I mean

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.439
by saying my behaves like an adjective,

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:16.280
and mine behaves like a noun.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.620
So let me get some example sentences down

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.139
and we'll see what I mean.

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:26.540
So let's say that there
was a book that I owned.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.100
How would I talk about it?

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.379
Well I could do it two different ways

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.059
using these possessive pronouns.

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:35.759
I could say, "That is my book."

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:39.160
And here my is working as an adjective

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.019
that modifies and describes book.

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.819
Or I could say, "That book is mine."

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.719
And here we're using is
to connect book to mine,

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:55.649
and so in that case we're
using mine as a noun.

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:58.679
How do we know it's acting like a noun?

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.979
Because we can use it
independently of the word book.

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:04.479
So if someone says to me,
"David, where is your book?"

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:09.479
I can say, "Mine is on the bedside table."

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:12.325
Nowhere in this sentence
does the word book appear,

00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:14.945
but we can use mine independently

00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:16.785
because we've established
in a previous sentence

00:03:16.785 --> 00:03:20.435
that the thing we're
talking about is this book.

00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:24.150
So let's talk about my coworker Girish.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.870
Nice fella.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.451
And let's say that Girish
has a very nice hat.

00:03:29.451 --> 00:03:32.111
"We would say,

00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:37.111
"That is Girish's hat."

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.650
This is what we'd call a possessive noun.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.710
But talking of Girish again, we could say,

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.710
"That is his hat."

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.772
Now we're using that possessive
pronoun as an adjective

00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:01.042
to modify hat.

00:04:03.152 --> 00:04:04.253
Whose hat is it?

00:04:04.253 --> 00:04:06.252
It is his hat.

00:04:06.252 --> 00:04:08.213
If we wanted to use the personal pronoun

00:04:08.213 --> 00:04:09.433
that acted like a noun,

00:04:09.433 --> 00:04:13.333
we would say, "That hat is his."

00:04:13.333 --> 00:04:16.424
And we can also use his
independently of the word hat

00:04:16.424 --> 00:04:21.076
by saying, "His is the
hat with polka dots."

00:04:25.576 --> 00:04:29.416
So we've got two piles of
possessive pronouns here.

00:04:29.416 --> 00:04:32.055
And one pile behaves like adjectives:

00:04:32.055 --> 00:04:36.055
my, our, your, her, his, its, their,

00:04:36.055 --> 00:04:38.255
and the other behaves like nouns:

00:04:38.255 --> 00:04:40.215
mine, ours, yours, hers,

00:04:40.215 --> 00:04:44.315
his, its, theirs.

00:04:44.315 --> 00:04:48.916
And remember, none of them
contain an apostrophe.

00:04:48.916 --> 00:04:50.715
You can learn anything.

00:04:50.715 --> 00:04:51.991
David out.
