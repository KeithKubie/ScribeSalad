personal note one of the things I've
 

00:32:26.769 --> 00:32:29.100
personal note one of the things I've
realized in life is how little I know

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:29.110
realized in life is how little I know
 

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:33.029

about technology and having come from

00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039
about technology and having come from
 

00:32:33.039 --> 00:32:37.169
about technology and having come from
the law side of the scholarly world it

00:32:37.169 --> 00:32:37.179
the law side of the scholarly world it
 

00:32:37.179 --> 00:32:39.830
the law side of the scholarly world it
has been more and more apparent to me

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840
has been more and more apparent to me
 

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.830

that you as engineers and people who
 

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:57.240
that you as engineers and people who
work in science how important it is for

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:57.250
work in science how important it is for
 

00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:00.539
work in science how important it is for
you to recognize that there are values

00:33:00.539 --> 00:33:00.549
you to recognize that there are values
 

00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:02.520

nology and science and how important it
 

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:08.790
nology and science and how important it
is for you to grasp the full complexity

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:08.800
is for you to grasp the full complexity
 

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:13.050
is for you to grasp the full complexity
of the subjects that you take on we've

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:13.060
of the subjects that you take on we've
 

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.590
of the subjects that you take on we've
also said to you on many occasions that

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600
also said to you on many occasions that
 

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.990

ultimately is a problem of Engineering

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:28.690
ultimately is a problem of Engineering
 

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:31.920
ultimately is a problem of Engineering
and Technology and science but what we

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:31.930
and Technology and science but what we
 

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:34.380
and Technology and science but what we
don't often say to you is that we have

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:34.390
don't often say to you is that we have
 

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:37.170
don't often say to you is that we have
more to learn from outside of your field

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:37.180
more to learn from outside of your field
 

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:41.010
more to learn from outside of your field
then you have to learn about our side of

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:41.020
then you have to learn about our side of
 

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:43.980
then you have to learn about our side of
the field and so for you I want to

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:43.990
the field and so for you I want to
 

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:46.890
the field and so for you I want to
acknowledge that you graduate from one

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:46.900
acknowledge that you graduate from one
 

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.540
acknowledge that you graduate from one
of the greatest institutions of the

can think of have that capacity to
 

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:59.820
can think of have that capacity to
bridge both technology and values but

00:33:59.820 --> 00:33:59.830
bridge both technology and values but
 

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:02.370
bridge both technology and values but
you also have to recognize that you must

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:02.380
you also have to recognize that you must
 

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:05.670
you also have to recognize that you must
teach us on the other side what you know

when I graduated was to build dams

01:16:42.410 --> 01:16:42.420
when I graduated was to build dams
 

01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:45.000
when I graduated was to build dams
unfortunately I hadn't done my my

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:45.010
unfortunately I hadn't done my my
 

01:16:45.010 --> 01:16:47.010
unfortunately I hadn't done my my
homework and all the good dam sites were

01:16:47.010 --> 01:16:47.020
homework and all the good dam sites were
 

01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:49.830
homework and all the good dam sites were
already taken so I became a rocket

01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:49.840
already taken so I became a rocket
 

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:54.360
already taken so I became a rocket
scientist instead and and when you think

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:54.370
scientist instead and and when you think
 

01:16:54.370 --> 01:16:56.030
scientist instead and and when you think
about it there's a lot in common between

01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:56.040
about it there's a lot in common between
 

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:58.980
about it there's a lot in common between
rocket engines and dams dams are all

01:16:58.980 --> 01:16:58.990
rocket engines and dams dams are all
 

01:16:58.990 --> 01:17:00.900
rocket engines and dams dams are all
about stress and fluid flow and rocket

01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:00.910
about stress and fluid flow and rocket
 

01:17:00.910 --> 01:17:03.420
about stress and fluid flow and rocket
engines are both stress fluid flow and

01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:03.430
engines are both stress fluid flow and
 

01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:06.480
engines are both stress fluid flow and
gas flow but I was fortunate enough to

01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:06.490
gas flow but I was fortunate enough to
 

01:17:06.490 --> 01:17:08.490

industry in the final quarter of a very

01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:11.710
industry in the final quarter of a very
 

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:14.430
industry in the final quarter of a very
remarkable century and I really believe

01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:14.440
remarkable century and I really believe
 

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.920
remarkable century and I really believe
that aerospace did more to change the

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:16.930
that aerospace did more to change the
 

01:17:16.930 --> 01:17:19.640
that aerospace did more to change the
20th century than any other industry in

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:19.650
20th century than any other industry in

the advent of commercial jet travel and
 

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:34.920
the advent of commercial jet travel and
then of course aerospace also changed

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:34.930
then of course aerospace also changed
 

01:17:34.930 --> 01:17:36.600
then of course aerospace also changed

aerospace forever changed the way that

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:52.210
aerospace forever changed the way that
 

01:17:52.210 --> 01:17:53.700
aerospace forever changed the way that
