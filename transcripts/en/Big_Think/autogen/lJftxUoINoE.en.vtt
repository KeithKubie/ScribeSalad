00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
and because of that we need things that

you do a favor to me I like you more and
then<00:37:07.260><c> it</c><00:37:07.380><c> might</c><00:37:07.560><c> put</c><00:37:07.800><c> me</c><00:37:07.920><c> in</c><00:37:08.010><c> such</c><00:37:08.190><c> in</c><00:37:08.400><c> conflict</c>
