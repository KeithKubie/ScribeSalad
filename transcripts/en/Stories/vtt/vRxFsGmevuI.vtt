BRENNON EDWARDS:
When I was a kid,

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.100
I always wanted to be
a marine biologist.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.240
And I was the person
that would always

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.590
be spouting off random facts.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.462
Like did you know a blue whale
can be 110 feet long, like just

00:00:09.462 --> 00:00:10.670
to people I didn't even know.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.890
And I always felt
that there's something

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.140
that we can learn from them.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.830
What really attracted
me to the program

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.080
was the idea that I would
be able to still do science.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.660
My role is a volunteer
citizen scientist.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.150
What I do is I fly my drones on
the beaches on the California

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.567
coast to help map and determine
the effects of El Nino.

00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:29.150
MATT MERRIFIELD:
This year, California

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.509
is experiencing a sort of
unprecedented El Nino event.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.834
We've got very extreme weather.

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:36.250
And given how strong it is
gives us a sort of crystal ball

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.707
about what sea
level rise and what

00:00:37.707 --> 00:00:39.790
climate change is going
to look like in the future

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.140
along the California coast.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.000
Using phones or drones,
UAVs, to document that change

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.370
would be a good way to do that.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.330
So we've asked people
to take photos of events

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.200
where there's been real
high water along the coast

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.960
or water that's been
overtopped dunes or inundating

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.950
coastal areas.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.324
So we'll end up with
larger pository of photos.

00:00:57.324 --> 00:00:58.740
And once we have
that information,

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.823
we'll use the geospatial
information in the photos

00:01:00.823 --> 00:01:03.360
to map because the
phone photos actually

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.611
have a location tag with them.

00:01:04.611 --> 00:01:06.526
BRENNON EDWARDS: There's
a lot of factors that

00:01:06.526 --> 00:01:08.061
go into what areas that I map.

00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:09.560
Everyone loves going
to the beaches,

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.120
and I normally make
a day out of it.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.220
What the Nature Conservancy
has us looking for

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.140
is signs of erosion or
change on the coastlines,

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.040
and things that you can tell are
happening because of the water.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.590
I tend to just kind of
go back to the same spot

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.530
and just see if I can notice a
difference from what I've done.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.780
Another big reason that I
really wanted to be involved

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.990
was that there's a lot of
publicity about drones,

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.842
and a lot of it isn't
necessarily good.

00:01:30.842 --> 00:01:32.300
There's a lot of
that drones can do

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.383
that are good for the
community and for the world,

00:01:34.383 --> 00:01:36.630
and it's just getting
the word out there.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.080
MATT MERRIFIELD: So mapping
typically in the past

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.871
has either been done
with satellite imagery

00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:41.300
or aerial photography.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.060
The benefit of
drones is the ability

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.510
to actually go out and capture
things that happen really

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.790
quickly and then go away.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.050
You couldn't necessarily
task a satellite for it

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.240
to be right at the right
place for those four hours.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.740
BRENNON EDWARDS: The thing that
I like about being a citizen

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.150
scientist is that I know that
I'm being a part of something

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.780
bigger than me.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.740
I'm contributing to something
good that's helping everyone.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.530
This protects the
beauty of California,

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.220
so why wouldn't
you want to do this

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.980
if it's something that's free
for you, it's easy to do,

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.680
and honestly it's fun?

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.620
Why not?

00:02:11.944 --> 00:02:14.110
SUBJECT 1: Please be sure
to watch this next episode

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.100
about a woman who completely
changed the concept of school

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.310
to combat poverty.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.110
SUBJECT 2: If all you can
do is make it to school,

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.410
we'll take care of the
rest-- food, clothes, shoes,

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.200
health care.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.860
SUBJECT 3: What kind
of changes did you

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.730
start to see in your students
when you will started

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.170
to remove those barriers?

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.580
SUBJECT 2: So when kids
knew that we cared,

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.970
there was almost like
this light bulb went off,

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.484
this willingness to try.

00:02:37.484 --> 00:02:39.650
SUBJECT 1: Thanks for
watching and sure to subscribe

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.650
