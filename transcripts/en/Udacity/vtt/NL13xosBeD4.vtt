Sw-precache works well with either Gulp
or Grunt or any other built screen.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.460
I personally, tend towards Gulp so
I'll show you that, but

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.020
the same process applies for Grunt.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.570
Since I already have a simple Gulp
file to build parts of my project,

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.613
I first need to install sw-precache.

00:00:20.613 --> 00:00:22.600
Great, done.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.880
Next I need to add sw-precache
to my Gulp file and

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.195
add a new task to build
the service worker.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:33.936
Sw-precache takes two parameters,
the location where I want it to

00:00:33.936 --> 00:00:38.740
write the service-worker to, and
the options I want it to use.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.340
Specifying the staticFileGlobs,

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.390
tells it where we wanted to pre-cache
any files that match the Glob.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.420
You can also specify runtimeCaching
options, which will cache

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.860
any other network request, specifically
the request to the weather API.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.860
You can see here I've created my
task to generate the service worker,

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.280
and I pass it the two parameters.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.870
The location where I want it
to write the service file to,

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.940
and the parameters I want it to use
to generate the service worker.
