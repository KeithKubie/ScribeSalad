25 hydroxy vitamin d3 level of 80 which

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849
25 hydroxy vitamin d3 level of 80 which
 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.940
25 hydroxy vitamin d3 level of 80 which
is considered more or less the best

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950
is considered more or less the best
 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.429
is considered more or less the best
level everybody in my practice of

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439
level everybody in my practice of
 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.649
level everybody in my practice of
thousands of patients is below that

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659
thousands of patients is below that
 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.140
thousands of patients is below that
number so I think just across the board

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150
number so I think just across the board
 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.670
