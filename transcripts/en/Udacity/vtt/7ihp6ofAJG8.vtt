We want you to develop a mindset of being both curious and skeptical, when

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.510
you work with data. To help you get into this mindset, I want to share

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.250
another conversation that I had with Aude. In this next video, I want you

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.860
to listen to Aude's work and look

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.600
out for how she demonstrated this exact mindset.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.880
&gt;&gt; So we gathered all the home towns and current cities from the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.160
users and I was looking at conditional probabilities given

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.420
a hometown. What is the probability that you currently live

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.330
in each different cities? Like, for example given that your

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.970
hometown is New York, what is the probability that you

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.110
live in Chicago or that you live in, that you

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.620
still live in New York or that you live in

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.490
San Francisco or Paris and so on. And what I

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.830
was expecting is that, at least, the most likely city,

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.180
where you would live right now would be the city where

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.570
your home town is. If you grew up in

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.330
Chicago, the most likely place that you're going to

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.440
be now is still Chicago. You could be moving

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.030
as well but the most likely place would remain your

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.880
hometown. But I saw a fair number of cases

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.130
where the most likely current city was different from

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.080
the home town and, and that was, was a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.570
fairly high probability. I was really surprised. I was wondering

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.840
if I had, had a prime in my computations, If there was some issues upstream of

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.280
what I was doing. So I decided to put all the cities on a map. All the pairs of

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.400
hometowns and current cities for which the most

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.960
likely current city was different from the hometown. And

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.200
what we saw on this map was really fascinating

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.760
because it was really not what we we're expecting.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.340
It was not a bug in the code. We were really seeing patterns arise. Here we only

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.980
plotted pairs of hometown and current city, so

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.760
there's no movement between the pairs but what we

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.550
see is that a lot of these cities for which the most likely

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.510
current city is different from the hometown arise in western Africa or in

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.940
India or in like Turkey, which we were not

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.780
necessarily expecting at the beginning. And there were a

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.240
lot of small cities all moving to the same current

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.620
city and so we decided to dig a bit

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.590
more into it. One thing that happens is that sometimes

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.250
the distribution of the current city is very flat.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.100
Given that you grew up in, let's say Paris, maybe

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.165
you're still living in Paris but maybe you live in

00:02:29.165 --> 00:02:32.420
like one of the thousand cities in the suburbs and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.230
so the distribution is really flat and so we

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.615
have to decide what was considered as a coordinates

00:02:38.615 --> 00:02:41.990
demarcation. We decided yeah, the probability to move to

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.616
that city is high enough that we're considering that.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.540
And the other thing we have to think about is that if you look at the map at

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.120
the world scale or if you zoom to a

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.515
very specific area, you don't want to see the same things.

00:02:57.515 --> 00:03:04.600
So,we also want it to have interactivity in the visualization. And so we

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:11.650
decided to use D3, which is a Javascript-based visualization framework, which

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.340
enables you to have a lot of interactivity with with your data

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.810
and enabled us to do a lot of that exploration and so on.
