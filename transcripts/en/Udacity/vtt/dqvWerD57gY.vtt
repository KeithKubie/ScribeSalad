00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.650
So, next we're talking with Elaine
Fontaine who's director of Data Quality

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.980
and Analytics at the Rhode Island
Quality Institute in CurrentCare.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.870
Thank you very much for
being with us today.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.660
&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.980
&gt;&gt; We all know, Elaine, that we
need new financial models to make

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.790
healthcare work the way
we'd like it to work.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.990
The students are quite familiar with
that from earlier lessons in the course.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.670
And they recognize that those are
intimately tied to quality reporting and

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.490
quality improvement.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.020
So, can you tell us the things that
CurrentCare is doing to support

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.360
providers here in Rhode Island
to achieve those things?

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.885
&gt;&gt; So I think that we are currently
providing actually outside of

00:00:38.885 --> 00:00:43.710
CurrentCare data, quality data
management on reporting services for

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.230
the Chronic Care
Sustainability Initiative,

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.250
which is Rhode Island's
patient-centered medical home project.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.390
And for that project, we're actually
collecting and aggregating data on

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.660
about 15 quality measures that
are sort of related to meaningful use.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.220
We're also doing
utilization reporting and

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.800
patient experience through the patients
under medical home caps survey which is

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.960
what NCQA requires of those practices.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.510
And with those data we're really sort
of looking, grouping them up and

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.210
aggregating them in
a variety of ways to help

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.300
the practices see their
performance over time.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.600
And assess their success with
regard to improving the quality and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.295
reducing costs which is
of course not that easy.

00:01:29.295 --> 00:01:35.825
But we think that the differences
in the data sources associated with

00:01:35.825 --> 00:01:40.915
what's available to the HIE,
relative to what's available to a EMR,

00:01:40.915 --> 00:01:43.515
relative to what's available
in a claims data set.

00:01:43.515 --> 00:01:48.870
All of which are trying to be used for
this same purpose of looking at cost and

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.760
quality really can potentially result
in different answers to the same

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.340
questions because the populations
are a little bit different.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.340
So for example, we're working on
a chlamydia screening analyses.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:08.310
And I'll be presenting it, Amy,
in November of this year, in 2014, to

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.108
look at the differences in those rates
between those three population groups.

00:02:13.108 --> 00:02:17.430
So commercial payer will have
a different result than a Medicaid payer

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.730
which will have a different result
than what's coming out of the EMR and

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.560
the HIE.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.790
So we're trying to understand those
differences before we report them

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.440
publicly from the perspective of
here's how you do a better job taking

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.140
good care of quality
docs in the community.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.990
&gt;&gt; So, is it fair to assume that
the HIE does serve to help collect and

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.680
help aggregate the data so
that you can do this quality report?

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.760
&gt;&gt; I feel like we're really pretty
nascent in that regard, and so

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.980
these chlamydia screening rates
are our first entry into it, but I'm

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.160
pretty sensitive to the idea that we
need to understand those differences.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.470
Is it that we as the HIE have
a sub-selective population which

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.270
might have a higher screening rate or a
lower screening rate than another group.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.860
Are we including the uninsured,

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.310
which are not really represented
in anybody else's measures.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.540
So until we sort of dig into that and

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.160
really are able to benchmark against
known metrics, I'm reticent to sort of

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.234
just say here's the real answer for
the population of Rhode Island.

00:03:24.234 --> 00:03:29.250
And I think that's the goal and I feel
confidant we're going to get there.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.730
But, it's one that we
need to move cautiously

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.000
in that regard because
the worst possible thing to do

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.420
is to report data without really
understanding what it means.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.570
I think that you can do that
in some situations where

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.170
it's sort of marketing, but quality and
cost analytics are not marketing.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.060
And when you're presenting
information that would reflect how

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.240
a provider is performing.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.580
You need to make sure you have their
full engagement and input in how that

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.760
measure is calculated, and they need to
be able to be very, very confident of

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.820
its accuracy before you report it
&gt;&gt; Half the students remember these

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.390
comments when we, later on in the
course, we get into quality reporting,

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.140
and I try to show that it sounds great,
but it isn't so easy to do.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.360
&gt;&gt; Yes, it's really quite
challenging without a doubt.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.570
&gt;&gt; But it sounds like your long
goal is to have a unified statewide

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.130
population in public health
electronic reporting system for

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.370
the whole state of Rhode Island.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.540
Is that where you're heading?

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.100
&gt;&gt; It is absolutely where we're heading.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.090
And I believe, I have utmost confidence
that we're going to be there,

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.480
and I feel like we talk internally
a lot about where we are today

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.130
is light years behind where we're
going to be in six months and

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.000
it's light years ahead of
where we were six months ago.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.850
I feel like the progress
is really rapid, and

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.500
I think that's in large part due
to a high degree of interest.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.860
As coming full circle to
the beginning of your question,

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.120
the provider community is
becoming more and more interested

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.510
in these data because they are being
held accountable for them.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.010
The Accountable Care Organization

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.650
news releases that the cycle
moving very rapidly.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.300
We've just seen in the last three weeks,
three or

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.190
four announcements in
the news of payer provider

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.240
arrangements that are outside of
Medicare so that's pretty interesting.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.270
&gt;&gt; So, one quick final question.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.090
We look in the course
at some of the public

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.600
quality metrics that the Indiana
Health Information Exchange posts

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.570
through their
Quality Health First Initiative.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.160
Are you doing that sort of thing here,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.610
and what's the reaction from providers
to that idea if you are doing it?

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.140
&gt;&gt; So, I think that we have not been so
public yet.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:06:00.250
I think that too is a progression coming
back to really needing provider buy in,

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:06.510
and so we're presenting that data
to providers on their groups.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.960
Not at the provider level yet even.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.511
And that's a real challenge
with regard to N anyway, but

00:06:15.511 --> 00:06:21.060
we are presenting that to the group
of practices that are participating

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.210
in the patient-centered medical home
initiative, where they can actually

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.540
see their performance relative to their
peers in other healthcare settings.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:36.160
But that's what reported publicly
at this point is the aggregate

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.350
of all of those programs relative to

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.170
the non-patients center medical home
data that's available in the state.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.460
So, it's a process.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.240
&gt;&gt; Well thank you very much for
taking the time to be with us.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.740
&gt;&gt; My pleasure.
