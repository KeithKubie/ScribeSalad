00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.400
So, in the previous lecture, we started looking at,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.230
how are we going to represent images as digital representations?

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.990
Now, let's start looking at what we can do with these images.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm just showing you again, a color and a black and white image.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.770
Now, what we want to do is we want to start looking at individual elements,

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.430
pixels, of each and every one of these images, and

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.920
start looking at what we can do by simply doing point-process arithmetic on it.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.800
That would allow us to start combining one image to the other.
