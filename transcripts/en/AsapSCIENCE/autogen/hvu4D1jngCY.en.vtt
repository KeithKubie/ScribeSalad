00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.760
 I will list 15 words in your ears 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.420
 Then, I want you to write as much as you can. 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.660
 Ready to listen? Okay 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.920
 Acid 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.860
 Nice 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.720
 Dessert 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.500
 honey 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.340
 sugar 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.260
 Soda 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.180
 Over 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.120
 chocolate 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.880
 good 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.900
 heart 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.900
 Taste 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.800
 Cakes 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.920
 age 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.820
 Pie 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.800
 Candy Pie 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.060
 Stop this section now and without words you can not cheat 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.180
 Even if you get confused, close your eyes and think, you will often bring more of them. 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.240
 Are you ready to show your work? 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.000
 Well, maybe some of you picked up a few of the words you finally listed like: 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.840
 age 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.400
 Pie 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.920
 And pancake candy 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.460
 But do you remember a word? 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.200
 Sweet? 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:48.520
 Be honest, most of you now suddenly began to write the word "sweet" although they were not listed at all. 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.220
 This is what we call 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.280
 Counterfeit Memory. 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.160
 It is a psychological phenomenon in which the person invokes things that have not happened. 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.480
 For example, how many people remember well that the monopolist wears glasses with one lens? 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.740
 But he never had a single glasses. 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.600
 Or who remembers the sentence in Star Wars "Luke, I am Your Father" 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.160
 While he did not say "neither, I am your father" 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.120
 Or who remembers the evil witch saying "My mirror, my mirror on the wall ..." 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.520
 She said, "My mirror on the wall ... 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.180
 Memories are initially formed in the hippocampus part of the brain, one of the only members to build completely new neurons 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.920
 This information is maintained by neurotransmitters and the establishment of neural links. 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.020
 Sometimes, however, they focus on the big details of your experience 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.420
 You may remember time, place and people but you do not have to remember the color of their hats. 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.060
 However, your memories are not complete. 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.700
 If new information overlaps during the period between your living and an event, 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.300
 And your attempt to restore it. 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.200
 For example, if someone tells you something different from what happened 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.500
 This may change but may replace your memory entirely. 

00:01:44.505 --> 00:01:50.000
 Then these memories gradually migrate away towards the cerebral cortex until they become your real memories. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.120
 Whenever you think about an event, or fail to invoke it 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.120
 This new reality is further entrenched. 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.880
 This simple effect may have somewhat incredible consequences 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.720
 Such as the case of eyewitnesses in crimes, or incidents when they conjure false details 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.120
 Indeed, a study has come to the conclusion that when a car accident is presented to people 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.580
 Then the question of two teams, how fast the two cars when colliding with each other? 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.940
 Or, how fast were the cars when they smashed each other? 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.580
 The answer to those who heard the word "smash" often tells higher speeds 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.540
 It is the same word that often made them say they saw the glass debris in the accident, although there was no glass at all 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.400
 In a similar study, a car was shown heading towards the stop signal causing an accident 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.560
 However, when asked if the reference to road priority is indicated, many witnesses will confirm that it was indeed the priority of the road. 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.100
 This has sometimes reduced the testimony of witnesses, unless they are reinforced and confirmed. 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.260
 Finally, some studies have established false childhood memories in the minds of some test specimens 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.500
 The researchers gave the samples four short stories describing childhood events they had experienced 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.520
 But without the knowledge of the samples, the stories included a false account of their loss of commercial status in their childhood 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.680
 Thus, 25% of the samples said they remembered the fake incident 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.320
 Do you think your memory is better? 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.140
 So, how did this section begin? 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.000
 I mean, in addition to our logo, which we present at the beginning of each section we present 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.920
 Can you remember what happened next? 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.680
 Except that we did not display the logo at the beginning of the section. 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.200
 If you think we did, your memory has a false memory. 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.500
