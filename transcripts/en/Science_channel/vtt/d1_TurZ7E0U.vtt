Narrator:
LAUNCHED IN SEPTEMBER 1977,

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:07.640
VOYAGERS 1 AND 2

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.544
ARE THE LONGEST CONTINUOUSLY
OPERATED SPACECRAFT IN HISTORY.

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:14.647 line:0%
HURTLING ALONG
AT 38,000 MILES PER HOUR,

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:19.218
VOYAGER 1 IS NOW THE FARTHEST
HUMAN-MADE OBJECT FROM EARTH.

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:21.888
OVER 11 BILLION MILES AWAY

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:25.658
AND 124 TIMES FARTHER
FROM THE SUN THAN WE ARE,

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:29.295
IT IS THE ONLY SPACECRAFT
TO EVER LEAVE THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:32.131
IN THE 30 SECONDS
SINCE THIS SEGMENT STARTED,

00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:35.000 line:0%
IT'S GONE OVER 300 MILES.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.236
GAS DOESN'T POWER VOYAGER.

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:40.539
NUCLEAR ENERGY DOES,
ALONG WITH A PHYSICS TRICK

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:43.009
THAT HELPED IT LEAVE
OUR SOLAR SYSTEM.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.782 line:0%
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN LEARN A LOT
ABOUT PHYSICS

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:52.552 line:0%
BY PLAYING BASKETBALL, LIKE
TRAJECTORY AND BALANCE AND...

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:55.921
OOF.

00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:57.523
ANGLES OF DEFLECTION.

00:00:57.523 --> 00:01:00.627
BUT IF YOU ADD A TENNIS BALL
TO THE EQUATION,

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:02.261
THEN YOU CAN LEARN HOW VOYAGER 1

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:04.397
SUCCESSFULLY EXITED
THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:06.498
IT'S CALLED
THE SLINGSHOT EFFECT.

00:01:06.498 --> 00:01:09.502 line:0%
Narrator: THE SLINGSHOT EFFECT,
OR GRAVITATIONAL ASSIST,

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:12.638 line:0%
EXPLAINS HOW SPACECRAFTS
USE A PLANET'S GRAVITY

00:01:12.638 --> 00:01:15.508
TO GAIN ENOUGH MOMENTUM
TO ENTER INTERSTELLAR SPACE.

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:17.910
TO GET AN IDEA
OF HOW STRONG THE EFFECT IS,

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.582
LET'S PLAY SOME BASKETBALL
AND TENNIS AT THE SAME TIME.

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:24.417 size:78% position:39%
ALL RIGHT, SO I WANT YOU
TO BOUNCE THIS BASKETBALL

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:26.019 align:start position:0%
FROM ABOUT WAIST HIGH.

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:30.490
GOOD BOUNCE THERE,
NOT QUITE TO THE SAME HEIGHT.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.292
-MM-HMM.
-WHAT ABOUT THE TENNIS BALL?

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.328 size:75% position:38%
WELL, THAT DIDN'T BOUNCE
NEARLY AS HIGH, DID IT?

00:01:36.328 --> 00:01:37.597 align:start size:25% position:75%
MNH-MNH.

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:40.032 size:81% position:41%
BUT SOMETHING
REALLY INTERESTING HAPPENS

00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:42.267 size:88% position:44%
WHEN YOU DROP THEM TOGETHER.

00:01:42.267 --> 00:01:44.103 size:59% position:30%
WHAT DO YOU THINK'S
GONNA HAPPEN?

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:45.271
-REALLY?
-YEAH.

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:46.538 size:50% position:75%
I WOULD THINK
NOTHING SPECIAL.

00:01:46.538 --> 00:01:48.842 size:84% position:42%
NOTHING SPECIAL? ALL RIGHT.
WHY DON'T YOU TEST IT OUT?

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:49.942 align:start size:16% position:84%
OKAY.

00:01:49.942 --> 00:01:53.278 size:72% position:36%
THE TRICK HERE
IS TO HOLD IT IN A LINE

00:01:53.278 --> 00:01:55.448
AND DROP THEM TOGETHER.
-OKAY.

00:01:58.183 --> 00:01:59.818 align:start size:66% position:34%
WHOA, THAT'S AWESOME.

00:01:59.818 --> 00:02:02.755
-NOTHING SPECIAL RIGHT?
-I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:04.357 size:88% position:44%
ACTUALLY,
WHEN YOU DO THIS EXPERIMENT,

00:02:04.357 --> 00:02:07.493 size:84% position:42%
ON AVERAGE, THE TENNIS BALL
BOUNCES NINE TIMES HIGHER

00:02:07.493 --> 00:02:08.828 size:75% position:38%
THAN IT WOULD OTHERWISE.

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:11.063
-WOW.
-WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?

00:02:11.063 --> 00:02:12.532 align:start size:66% position:34%
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE.

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:15.001
WELL, THE THING IS THAT THEY'RE
DROPPING AT THE SAME TIME,

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:17.436 size:56% position:28%
BUT THE BASKETBALL
BOUNCES FIRST.

00:02:17.436 --> 00:02:19.038 size:84% position:42%
SO, WHEN IT BOUNCES BACK UP

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:20.906 size:81% position:41%
AND TRANSFERS
ALL OF ITS INERTIAL ENERGY

00:02:20.906 --> 00:02:23.876 size:88% position:44%
TO THE TENNIS BALL,
IT JUST FLIES UP IN THE AIR,

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:25.878 align:start position:0%
KINDA LIKE A SPACESHIP.

00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:28.714
Narrator: SO HOW DO YOU LEAVE
THE SOLAR SYSTEM?

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:30.750
HITCH A RIDE ON VOYAGER 1.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.218
JUST LIKE A TENNIS BALL,

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:34.487
VOYAGER 1 USED
THE SLINGSHOT EFFECT

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:37.823
TO HURL ITSELF
INTO INTERSTELLAR SPACE,

00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:40.359
EXCEPT VOYAGER DIDN'T COLLIDE
DIRECTLY WITH A PLANET

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:41.627
TO PUSH IT ALONG.

00:02:41.627 --> 00:02:44.763
IT COLLIDED WITH A PLANET'S
GRAVITATIONAL PULL.

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:46.199
AND LIKE THE TENNIS BALL,

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.367
VOYAGER 1 HAD ITS INITIAL SPEED.

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:51.871
BUT AS IT HIT THE GRAVITATIONAL
FIELD OF GAS GIANTS JUPITER,

00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:54.106
SATURN, URANUS, AND NEPTUNE,

00:02:54.106 --> 00:02:56.743
IT GOT PULLED AROUND IT
LIKE IT WAS IN ORBIT.

00:02:56.743 --> 00:02:57.776
BUT THEN THE FORCE

00:02:57.776 --> 00:02:59.912
OF THE PLANET'S ROTATION
AROUND THE SUN

00:02:59.912 --> 00:03:03.015
SHOT IT OUT OF ORBIT
AT TWICE ITS INITIAL SPEED,

00:03:03.015 --> 00:03:07.587
AND IT CONTINUED ON ITS JOURNEY
INTO INTERSTELLAR SPACE.

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:09.555
UNFORTUNATELY, THE SLINGSHOT
EFFECT WON'T DO MUCH

00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:10.957
FOR MY JUMP SHOT.

00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:16.563
OR HIS.
