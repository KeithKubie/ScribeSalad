We want to keep the Netherlands dry, which means that when water comes

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
into the area that's supposed to be land, we need to get it out.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Now, there's a lot of factors that affect how quickly water can enter here.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
What I want to know is, if I can know how quickly water is entering this area over here,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
how many windmills will I need to pump it back out?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And that is a matter of figuring out exactly how much one windmill can do?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Each of these windmills has access to about 1000 W of wind power.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Of that 1000 W,  a lot of it is lost to friction.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
In fact, 400 W is lost as this rotates as the water sloshes along in here,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
There's many sources of friction here. We said the average dike is about 6 m high.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I want to know how much water can each of these windmills move

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
from down here all the say up to here in 1 day?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This is a tricky problem but try your best and enter your answer here in kilograms.

00:00:55.000 --> 99:59:59.000
