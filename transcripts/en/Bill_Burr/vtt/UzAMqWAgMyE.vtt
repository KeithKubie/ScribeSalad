00:00:23.201 --> 00:00:27.910
Just seeing how your week's going.
Huh?
Is it going the way you planned it?

8
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.630
Did you have any plans?
Think about that.

9
00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:35.350
That's like some self helps you think about that.
People like when you start

10
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.020
<v 0>your Workweek d do you have a plan?</v>

11
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.010
<v 4>I mean other than getting in your car,
kissing your wife or,
or,
or,
or,</v>

12
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.900

or,
or,
or,
or,
or are,

13
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.933
are,
are,
are,

14
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.700
<v 1>and you drive down the street and an n n and you get yourself a coffee and you</v>

15
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.771
going to work.
But,

16
00:00:57.771 --> 00:01:02.771
but do you have a plan beyond just taking the vessel that holds your Saul

17
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.740
<v 0>into that workplace?
Do you have a plan?
Because I'll tell you right now,</v>

18
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.660
God has planned,

19
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.850
God has a plan for you and you and you and each and every one of you,

20
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.850
but you have to listen.

21
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.310
<v 1>How can we know what our plan is,</v>

22
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.100
what his plan is for us

23
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.370
<v 0>if we don't listen?</v>

24
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.360
That right there is why I don't go to church.
The the,
the,
the use of,

25
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.520
of vocal dynamics,
they always get way up.
Yeah.

26
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.930
<v 2>Dang.
I got both.
I got willow</v>

27
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.260
<v 1>and they come in for the whisper.
Right?
That's how it works.</v>

28
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.830
It's called the Sandusky.
I'm sorry,

29
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.890
everyone from Penn state.
I know your teams ranked.

30
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.940
I know you're thinking you're gonna fucking somehow slip and slide your way out

31
00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:09.770
of the horrors of that shower and that no asshole sports fan like me is going to

32
00:02:09.771 --> 00:02:13.460
bring it up.
Oh No.
It's going to be brought up.
Jesus Christ.

33
00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:17.390
I'm going to take all this shit I took for some fucking air pressure.
You know,

34
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.240
I think you're going to take down one goddamn statute.

35
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.110
We all know you're going to put it back up one of these days.
We all know Joey.

36
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.150
Pause coming back up.
Where you going to put it?
Huh?

37
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.440
<v 0>Were you going to put it probably in the boosters room,</v>

38
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.750
right when they bring all the money in,

39
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.420
they're all sitting there going,
it's okay Joe,
you didn't know what we all know.

40
00:02:37.421 --> 00:02:41.500
You never took a shower in fucking 60 years.
Why am I,
why am I doing this?
I,

41
00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:42.530
you know what?
I don't know why.

42
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.910
Cause I got a bunch of shit to do today and that's the first thing that came to

43
00:02:45.911 --> 00:02:50.380
my head.
You know why?
Because God,
God has a plan for me.

44
00:02:50.381 --> 00:02:55.381
He has a plan for me to go on this podcast each and every Thursday and just

45
00:02:55.841 --> 00:02:59.260
checking on your week.
That's my mission.
You what?

46
00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:04.261
I finished Westworld and I have to rewatch the final episode again because I

47
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:09.130
didn't get it all right.
Granted I was fucking nod enough,

48
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.750
like a big headed drunk jackass on a cross country flight,
you know,

49
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.040
head waken me up.
You know,

50
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.710
I didn't quite get it.
Um,
but I know there's going to be a season two,

51
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.090
so I would think that would be,

52
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.490
I gotta I gotta figure out what the fuck happened.
Uh,
I'll watch it again.

53
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:35.491
But it was really hard to watch it because my wife wasn't in,

54
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.570
she wasn't into this series,
so she would,
every time I would watch an episode,

55
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.810
she would come in when the song was coming on and she would just sing along.

56
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.570
She would sing like a

57
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.440
<v 1>robots fucking people.</v>

58
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.780
People dress like cow boys something blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

59
00:03:56.781 --> 00:04:00.320
blah,
Blah blue.
What does it mean?
Like,
I don't know,
there's a certain,
you know,

60
00:04:00.321 --> 00:04:03.470
there's certain kinds of white shit that Nia just can't watch.

61
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.250
And I found that it's like pre,
I don't know what it is.
It's,

62
00:04:07.251 --> 00:04:12.160
there's a a I think anything pre happy days,
you know,
she's just like,

63
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:14.680
yeah,
this was not,
you know,
it's like the Louis CK bit like,
you know,

64
00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:16.240
these weren't the good old days for us.

65
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.660
So I think when she sees white dudes walking around in cowboy hats,
yeah,

66
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:21.820
she just does not get a good warm,
fuzzy feeling.

67
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.083
<v 0>Sorry.</v>

68
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.640
If you could have been tuning in late to the podcast you haven't told tuned in

69
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.710
lately?
Um,
I,
I have a touch of a bowler,

70
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.930
but fortunately it's just quarantined into my trope.
You know what it is,

71
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.160
is I got this cough and then I smoked a couple of cigars and then I came back

72
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.640
and do a house with,
you know,
whenever they say the job is finished,

73
00:04:44.641 --> 00:04:46.990
it's not finished.
They have their punch list and that's a,

74
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.070
all this shit they need to do and then the jobs fucking done so they keep

75
00:04:50.071 --> 00:04:53.040
kicking up dust here and um,
anyways,

76
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.000
so all Billy red velvet cake is,
um,

77
00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.940
the last few weeks was not working out because he

78
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.470
had this little bit of a cough and I am exaggerating the cough before you guys

79
00:05:07.471 --> 00:05:11.760
are like j just shaking my head,
fuck my life.
Lol.
You only live once,

80
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.650
um,
all over my Twitter account.
I uh,

81
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.650
yeah,
I haven't been working out or anything,

82
00:05:19.651 --> 00:05:23.100
so I just got on the little fucking scale and I,
in the five I lost.
I type,

83
00:05:23.101 --> 00:05:24.930
I just put it right back on.
You know what I mean?

84
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.540
I'm really disappointed in myself.
So,
uh,
I did the half hour cardio this morning.

85
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.100
<v 1>Do it with me.
Here you go everybody.
I'm doing a half hour cardio every day,</v>

86
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.310
every fucking day of getting on that fucking elliptical.

87
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.310
And I'm going to try to lose two pounds a week.
Drop eight pounds,

88
00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:44.311
get my fucking fed freckled ass down to about a buck 75 sliding into the fucking

89
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.710
new.
Yeah.
You don't like is God.

90
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.590
God wants you to be skinny.
He doesn't want you.

91
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.390
One of the seven deadly sins is that spaghettio fatty motherfucker laying face

92
00:05:56.391 --> 00:05:57.730
down in his bull shit

93
00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.910
<v 0>from that movie seven.
Um,
so anyways,</v>

94
00:06:02.911 --> 00:06:05.410
so I've gotten back in,
I got my,
I got the sports channels now.

95
00:06:05.411 --> 00:06:08.830
So I've been watching my bro ends.
Is there a,
you know,

96
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.220
get through this fucking season here,
trying to figure out what's gonna work,

97
00:06:12.221 --> 00:06:16.320
what doesn't?
Um,
we lost to the filthy flyers.

98
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.620
You know what sucks?
It was,
I watched the first two periods.
It was too.

99
00:06:20.621 --> 00:06:23.500
Nothing flyers and a very subdued,

100
00:06:23.501 --> 00:06:27.550
quiet fucking crowd too would made me feel bad.

101
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.910
You know what I mean?
Usually the Bruins and flyers get together.

102
00:06:30.911 --> 00:06:35.140
It's a rowdy fucking crowd I think because we're both fucking transition.

103
00:06:35.141 --> 00:06:36.760
I don't even,
I,
you know what,
I haven't looked at the standings.

104
00:06:36.761 --> 00:06:40.000
Maybe the flyers are good this year.
I don't know.
So I go out to the kitchen,

105
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.940
you know,

106
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.080
the brand new kitchen that's still is the fucking punch lists to make myself

107
00:06:44.081 --> 00:06:46.750
something to eat.
And I swear to God,
I felt like I was gone for five minutes.

108
00:06:46.751 --> 00:06:51.310
I came back,
it was two to two,
right.
Marshawn scored,
I forget who else.

109
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.160
And uh,
we went into overtime and then we lost it.

110
00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.190
Sorry.
No,
we fucking lost it.
So,
and I've been kind of keep my eye on the Celtics.

111
00:07:02.191 --> 00:07:06.970
I know we got Sacramento next.
Um,
but uh,

112
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:12.570
you know what's so fucking dumb was that complete nonstory of our center,

113
00:07:12.941 --> 00:07:16.480
Al Horford getting criticized for four missing.
Uh,

114
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.860
I think he missed the Miami Heat game because he,
the,

115
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.400
cause you know he was with his wife because she was giving birth to his
daughter.

116
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.630
Oh Jesus.
Who has the fucking nerve to call me during podcasts.

117
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.660
Don't you know God has a plan.

118
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.500
People when you walk away from your recorder,

119
00:07:40.501 --> 00:07:42.810
always make sure you take off your headphones.

120
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.930
Cause if you know you're gonna Yank that fucker right across the Roman and then

121
00:07:45.931 --> 00:07:47.790
you're gonna have all that silence that you just heard.

122
00:07:47.791 --> 00:07:51.270
Unless I took the time to edit it out,
which I probably will.

123
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.380
I'll probably do your salad.

124
00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.130
And I know what a lot of you millennials are probably saying.
Actually,

125
00:07:56.131 --> 00:07:59.010
I don't know what you're saying.
You know,
you probably too busy having a fucking,

126
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:03.570
uh,
doing the mannequin challenge or something else.
Really important.
Um,

127
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.690
why talk down to the youth bill?
Why would you do that?
Huh?

128
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.500
Is it cause you're your everyday creeping towards death?
Um,

129
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.910
[inaudible] I know what you,

130
00:08:12.911 --> 00:08:16.680
you fucking technological douche bags are probably thinking,
why don't you,
can

131
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:19.700
<v 1>we just get some wireless headphones?
You know why?</v>

132
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.180
Cause I think I got enough satellites pointed at my fucking head.
How about that?

133
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.940
I've got enough signals going in there.
I can't remember shit.

134
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.260
I've had this cough for two weeks.
You know when I'm blaming wireless headphones,

135
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:35.450
um,
you hear that echo in my office.
That's cause I cleaned the fuck her up,

136
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.940
Cli this fucker up and I got rid of a bunch of shit.

137
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.070
I organized a bunch of stuff.

138
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:47.660
I shredded a bunch of shit and I'm feeling good about it.

139
00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:52.400
I know where all my stuff is.
I'm selling the Prius and you know,
it's funny,

140
00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:56.250
I have the title to every God Damn fucking car I've ever,
except for one,

141
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.790
<v 0>you know my first one,
but I,
I had an [inaudible] 88</v>

142
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:08.150
I had an 88 fucking a Honda accord LX that I bought in like 1996,

143
00:09:09.421 --> 00:09:11.700
five speed.
I fucking loved that car.

144
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.630
And I had it for like four or five years before I sold it.

145
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.320
When I moved back to New York.
And,
uh,
I found a copy of that title.

146
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:24.090
I found every fucking goddamn title that I needed except for the fucking,

147
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.020
the one for the car that I'm selling.
So now I had to send it away.

148
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.880
I got to send away for it for the,
uh,
to the fucking DMV.

149
00:09:32.881 --> 00:09:35.850
So I gotta do that bullshit today and do it.
I gotta tell you something,

150
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:39.450
just laugh all you want about the Toyota Prius.

151
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.400
Say as much homophobic stuff as you want at people who drive Toyota.

152
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:49.020
Prius's not only is that a great God damn car,
it's got great resale value.

153
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.200
People want that fucking car.
You know,

154
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:57.190
<v 1>Tony,
that gas smells laugh all you want.
Say it looks like a doorstop.</v>

155
00:09:57.191 --> 00:10:01.450
Say it's gates solely as she got no balls.
You know,

156
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.690
I don't understand people that identify themselves with their car.

157
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.600
I understand liking cars.
I love cars,
you know what I mean?

158
00:10:07.601 --> 00:10:11.650
But I don't like look at something that another man built an act like I had

159
00:10:11.651 --> 00:10:13.930
something to do with it.
Like a lot of these other cons.

160
00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.960
Now there's one thing if you fucking,
you know,
you,
you,
you know,
whatever,

161
00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.760
you go down to the goddamn junkyard like the gas monkey guys and your build it

162
00:10:20.761 --> 00:10:23.860
from fucking scratch,
then you can have some pride,
all right?

163
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.600
But if you're that fucking huckleberry that walks out of their lot and then buys

164
00:10:28.601 --> 00:10:32.500
it for four to five grand more than what you should have fucking paid for,

165
00:10:32.501 --> 00:10:37.120
then you walk around leaning against it as you drink in Austros beer.
Right?

166
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.020
Staying in there like you won a war.
I don't understand that aspect of it.

167
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:45.640
Which brings me back to the Toyota Prius.
All right.
The Toyota Prius.

168
00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.250
Like most of you,
I did not build that car.

169
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:53.580
<v 0>All right,
so
why you try to put that on to my personality?
You know,</v>

170
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.070
it takes a strong man to drive a Prius.

171
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.863
Nia.

172
00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:01.240
<v 2>Yeah,
you up?</v>

173
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.760
<v 1>What do you mean?
How can you not be your awake earlier when I talked to you?</v>

174
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:12.143
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

175
00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:16.090
<v 1>no,
pull that shit.
You already ruined my day with all the jobs you have for me.</v>

176
00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.640
Can you please come up here and sing your Westworld Song?

177
00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:21.160
<v 2>Okay.</v>

178
00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.250
<v 1>Can you do that?
Poo Poo,

poo,
booboo.</v>

179
00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:30.280
<v 0>What are you so grumpy about?
The goddamn door open.</v>

180
00:11:30.281 --> 00:11:33.880
You're screaming at the top of your lungs.
It's like,
what are you doing to me?

181
00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.900
What do you want?
I'm making money.
Well,
how are you doing?
Quieter?

182
00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.600
<v 1>Hey,
let me hear the uh Oh,
shut up.
You've already awake.</v>

183
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:48.920
<v 0>That's your big complaint that you pick complaint in life.
What are you doing?</v>

184
00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:53.740
I need a place to six.
Well,
sit here.
Well,

185
00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.190
I'm moving all my shit.
Come over.
You got to sing the song.
What?

186
00:11:57.191 --> 00:12:01.420
Are you pregnant or something?
Just came up the stairs and I'm out of breath.

187
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.980
Do you want from me?
I'd like a little sunshine today.

188
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.710
Do you want another microphone or what?
You want to be on the podcast

189
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.793
<v 6>in a minute?</v>

190
00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.580
<v 0>Yeah.
Jesus.
I got to hit pause.
Let her catch your breath.</v>

191
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.850
<v 6>All right.
What back?
Hell,
Nia,</v>

192
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:24.270
<v 0>I want you to show called Westworld.
Please do flash me.</v>

193
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.760
I'm not flashing.
Sorry.
I got my bathrobe.

194
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:31.383
Sorry.

195
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.900
You like Sharon Stone right now it's like,
oh,

196
00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.280
there's the,
there's the Photoshop for the pocket week.

197
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:47.010
You're in your red sox row with nothing on underneath there.
Nick,

198
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.410
can you have a little consideration for the listeners?

199
00:12:49.411 --> 00:12:54.000
They don't want to think about that.
Jesus Christ,
they worked out.

200
00:12:54.001 --> 00:12:56.970
I'm a fuck a guy.
You know,
you take your shower,
you put on a robe,

201
00:12:56.971 --> 00:12:58.470
you have a couple of fucking eggs.

202
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.020
What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to get all this shit done before you fucking

203
00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:08.160
all the crap that you decided in your head that I was doing today without

204
00:13:08.161 --> 00:13:12.870
checking with my schedule.
Yeah,
yeah,
I did that.
Yes,

205
00:13:12.871 --> 00:13:16.890
you did.
All right.

206
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.610
Well,
Noah,
sing Westworld song.

207
00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.313
<v 6>Okay.</v>

208
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:31.230
<v 0>Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo.
Fucking people.
People dressed as cowboys.</v>

209
00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.580
Boy Is that as far as I can.
God Are you?

210
00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.690
Do you fucking ruin the whole song every time I went to go watch it?

211
00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:39.310
Now let me ask you this.
You kind of,

212
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:42.700
I noticed like this certain types of fucking white movies you don't like and

213
00:13:42.701 --> 00:13:47.170
cowboys is one of them.
Anytime the cowboys you fucking tune out.

214
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:51.880
I'm just not particularly interested in certain era's of white history.

215
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:52.803
That's what I'm saying.

216
00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:57.840
I knew that I called that earliest certain things I'm just not particularly

217
00:13:58.301 --> 00:13:59.620
interested in.
I talked them,

218
00:13:59.621 --> 00:14:02.690
you don't see a lot of black cowboys in those movies.
It's weird.
Huh?

219
00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:07.270
Where were the black people during that time?
They,
let's see.

220
00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.240
Well it depends on when it was and it was like the 1880s you mean they had,

221
00:14:10.241 --> 00:14:13.570
you know,
did you guys have your own stage coaches at that point?
Oh yeah.

222
00:14:13.571 --> 00:14:17.210
Definitely.
Had our own states.
The air shocks on him and show him businesses.
Yep.

223
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:21.610
I thought you did initially and you started kicking the shit out of white
people.

224
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.320
Cause then they went whoa,
Whoa,
easy.

225
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:28.300
Didn't it happen right after slavery now there wasn't then you guys,

226
00:14:28.301 --> 00:14:31.430
a bunch of you got elected and shit and then it into what?

227
00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.660
Well cause you had numbers.
Numbers for what?

228
00:14:34.661 --> 00:14:37.990
What are you talking about right now?
I can't remember if this is a video game.

229
00:14:37.991 --> 00:14:38.824
If this was

230
00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:45.380
no like right after you guys got free or your sense of history is just,

231
00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:46.963
it's amazing.

232
00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:52.370
I thought like you guys got freed and then you started

233
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:56.930
<v 1>succeeding and then all the broke ass white people around you lie.
Why?</v>

234
00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.660
Why are you don't man?
And that's when they came up with the client.
Maybe.

235
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:04.490
Maybe too many of these terantin no movies where he fucks with history.

236
00:15:04.491 --> 00:15:06.530
I don't know what's going on,
but I thought I thought you were doing it right.

237
00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:11.150
None of this,
none of this is correct.
I'm not a historian,
but I didn't.

238
00:15:11.151 --> 00:15:15.410
The clumps do something around them to the whole,
the clumps.
Who are the clumps?

239
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.770
Eddie Murphy and fucking knows.
Oh,
you're just being silly.
Yeah,
pizza.
Silly.

240
00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:19.763
All right,
whatever.

241
00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:25.550
<v 0>So Nia,
what exactly are you that,
that that song was a little disappointing,</v>

242
00:15:25.551 --> 00:15:27.620
but I don't really have much.
What was I saying?

243
00:15:27.621 --> 00:15:30.440
I was like Anthony Hopkins playing God.

244
00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:34.320
<v 1>Yeah,
you'd ruin the whole fee.
Every time I would go to watch it,</v>

245
00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:35.920
you'd stick your head in the room.

246
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:40.460
<v 0>Jeffrey ry,
they're a kid.
Thandie Newton.
Then</v>

247
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.880
<v 1>HPO is a bunch of perverts.
They always have these shows.</v>

248
00:15:43.881 --> 00:15:48.870
Everybody's just fucking naked Ahs.
Westworld,
three kings.
What are the,
fuck.

249
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:53.420
Hey,
we're all in the castle.
Look out for the Dragon,
game of Thrones,

250
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:56.840
game of Thrones,
eight year old king.
Hey,
hey,
we're all,

251
00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.230
I don't get how an eight year old guy,
the dragon.

252
00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:02.780
How does an eight year old king fucking sentence someone to death.

253
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.390
I never watched.
Why don't you just say,
would you say you little shit?

254
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.900
I have no idea.
Tip you over in that giant fucking chair.

255
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:12.040
What are you gonna do about it?
A little evil fucker.
Yeah.

256
00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.270
That kid needed the living shit kicked out of him.

257
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:16.110
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

258
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.100
<v 1>And yeah,
I didn't watch a lot of episodes,</v>

259
00:16:18.101 --> 00:16:22.050
but if ever I could throw an eight year old off a building or a castle,

260
00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.510
<v 0>definitely I'd want him to live to zap over this theory is,
I,
I have no idea.</v>

261
00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:29.453
<v 1>I saw one of them.</v>

262
00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.910
He pulled the guy's fucking tongue out cause he didn't like the song he was

263
00:16:32.911 --> 00:16:33.744
playing.

264
00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:38.200
<v 0>Yeah.
There's like too much like incest and dragons and shit.</v>

265
00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:41.140
I'm just that kind of genre.
I am not really into,

266
00:16:41.141 --> 00:16:45.790
although I did love game of [inaudible] um,
uh,
Lord of the rings.

267
00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.720
That was an awesome movie.
The part of white history.
Does that take place in?

268
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.480
It doesn't.
It's make believe it's not real.

269
00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:58.270
I like fan like some fantasy stuff,
but I don't like,
there's no middle earth,

270
00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.220
I don't think so.

271
00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:09.310
Middle Word,
head to vote.
Which way would they go near?
Hm.
That's a good question.

272
00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:14.020
I don't know.
You'd have to talk to some like token nerds for that.

273
00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:19.390
They might be able to tell you if they're more liberal or conservative in this

274
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:24.160
fantasy.
Speaking of nerds,
Chris Hardwick from the Nerdist,

275
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:28.340
<v 1>he's doing a fucking game show that I'm calling it right now is going to be the</v>

276
00:17:28.341 --> 00:17:31.610
biggest hit game show since.
Who wants to be a millionaire?

277
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:35.060
It's called the wall.
I don't know what it is,

278
00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:40.540
but it's fucking broke ass people who could possibly win 12 million bucks in the

279
00:17:41.721 --> 00:17:46.310
fact that so many people are upside down in their houses and the look of fucking

280
00:17:46.311 --> 00:17:49.200
hope on these people's faces.
It's just

281
00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:52.100
<v 7>like</v>

282
00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.970
<v 1>literally almost breaking down crying like you never see that on the prices.</v>

283
00:17:55.971 --> 00:17:58.400
Right?
You don't see that on the wheel of fortune.

284
00:17:58.401 --> 00:18:01.070
You certainly don't see it on jeopardy,

285
00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.100
but this wall thing,
they got these fucking people like,

286
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:10.150
like these people are so excited to win the fucking prize in the trailer that

287
00:18:10.281 --> 00:18:15.080
they're gonna need some sort of counseling if they lose,
if they blow it.
Right.

288
00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.230
Did they ever do that shit anymore on game shows member back in the day when you

289
00:18:18.231 --> 00:18:20.750
could fucking bully people and tease them where it's like,

290
00:18:20.751 --> 00:18:25.530
do you want to take that money in my pocket now?
I'd buy dye number two.

291
00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:30.750
It'd be like,
and people always just like,
fuck them.
Right?

292
00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:34.940
Then they would listen to the crowd and there'd be 700 bucks,

293
00:18:34.941 --> 00:18:36.980
which could buy you like a fucking,
you know,

294
00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.680
I don't know why they probably buy a a mercury monarch back then or some shit

295
00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.080
and nice down payment on one.
Anyways,

296
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.320
you'd put it back into the guys Ron Burgundy sport coat,

297
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:49.070
and then they would open up the door and half the time it'd be like a fucking

298
00:18:49.071 --> 00:18:54.071
donkey or a yak or some shit and they go dump off the tome that on let's make a

299
00:18:55.491 --> 00:18:58.820
deal with Wayne Brady or do they still do that?
Still have that show?
Yeah,

300
00:18:58.821 --> 00:19:02.050
he's the host of it.
I've only,
yeah,
but this is the thing,
but they all dressed,

301
00:19:02.051 --> 00:19:03.110
they're all dressed up though,

302
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:06.830
so that takes the shame away from it because you can hide in your costume.

303
00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.400
Back in the day you stood there and you looked like what you look like and then

304
00:19:10.401 --> 00:19:13.280
the next day you were walking down the street and you're like,
oh my God,

305
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:16.790
you're that guy that could have fucking one seven or eight it.
Wait a minute,

306
00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.890
I didn't.
I when we were in that,

307
00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.910
that rental home with the Campbell that only had oldies television for some

308
00:19:22.911 --> 00:19:25.910
strange reason,
I saw an episode of let's make a deal,

309
00:19:25.911 --> 00:19:29.420
and there was a couple that was dressed up as raggedy Ann and raggedy Ann.
No,
no,

310
00:19:29.421 --> 00:19:32.090
absolutely.
It was like in the 70th that show they did,

311
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:33.100
but I'm saying they were all,

312
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.950
there was all these other games shows where people didn't dress up and there was

313
00:19:36.951 --> 00:19:41.951
always the booby prize is what they called it and it was not titty.

314
00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.600
Um,
all right,
when you something fucking nuts,

315
00:19:47.601 --> 00:19:50.000
this is what we want to come to a complete non fucking story.

316
00:19:50.001 --> 00:19:53.960
I started to talk about it and then of course they'll fucking went away and the

317
00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:58.850
goddamn cable's out.
Not the cable,
the fucking Goddamn Internet.

318
00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:03.200
Like press the reset button on the,
all right,
the router.

319
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.660
So this Guy Al Horford who plays for the Celtics,

320
00:20:05.661 --> 00:20:08.100
he used to play for the land for the sallies.

321
00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:11.540
He used to play for the Atlanta Hawks.
This year we were making a big,
uh,

322
00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:13.490
we want to try to get Kevin Duran and then we couldn't.

323
00:20:13.491 --> 00:20:16.730
So then evidently all the money that we were going to give him [inaudible] we

324
00:20:16.731 --> 00:20:18.260
gave three quarters of it to this guy.

325
00:20:18.261 --> 00:20:22.370
Al Horford gave him like 130 fucking million dollars over four years or

326
00:20:22.371 --> 00:20:24.770
something crazy like that.
Um,

327
00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.470
maybe a little less than that came out to about 28 million years.

328
00:20:27.471 --> 00:20:31.610
So listen to this shit.
So this fucking guy,
his wife has a kid,
right?

329
00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:32.601
Has a daughter.

330
00:20:32.601 --> 00:20:37.601
So he misses a game and some fans bitched about it on like a social media and it

331
00:20:39.561 --> 00:20:41.210
actually became like a story.

332
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:45.020
He sat out a game because he wanted to go to his daughter's birthday,
like yeah,

333
00:20:45.021 --> 00:20:48.010
party.
And then a couple of Douche bags are like,
know what the fuck to

334
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:52.870
<v 0>pay you?
All the money was put ball ballroom and then the media picked up on it.</v>

335
00:20:52.871 --> 00:20:53.740
And then he actually,

336
00:20:53.741 --> 00:20:58.360
he actually had the comment on Twitter nerds and it was like one sports show

337
00:20:58.361 --> 00:21:02.940
that brought it up.
Are His priorities true?
Hmm.

338
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.180
What are you going to do in here if I don't show up?
You know,

339
00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:12.490
if I'm at the Rose Bowl hammered and you give birth or um,
um,

340
00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:16.330
we've already discussed that.
You don't even joke about,
Huh?
Hammered.

341
00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.680
We've already discussed the,
the,
the plan for the Rose Bowl.

342
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.340
Can I tell you something to you?
And having given,

343
00:21:21.341 --> 00:21:24.730
even if I walked into the delivery room blind drunk,
you can't,

344
00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:29.760
you're still going to be totally fine because everybody doing all the heavy

345
00:21:30.191 --> 00:21:33.610
lifting is there.
I,
I shouldn't even be there.

346
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:38.320
I don't understand why you keep trying to like evade any kind of like role of

347
00:21:38.321 --> 00:21:42.460
being like my support and comfort Mike.
My emotional support.
Yeah.

348
00:21:42.461 --> 00:21:45.130
You don't even stay in the room when I get my teeth cleaned.

349
00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.970
That's a little bit different I think.
Yeah.

350
00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.640
What if they were removing a tooth?

351
00:21:51.641 --> 00:21:55.720
Would you stand there and hold my fucking hand?
You know,
for God damn sure.

352
00:21:55.721 --> 00:21:59.040
That is not the same thing.
Why are you even bringing that up?
Because it's,

353
00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:03.760
it's fucking bullshit that the guy has to be in there.
And every guy I talked to,

354
00:22:03.761 --> 00:22:05.950
nine out of 10 of them go,
yeah,
it's bullshit.

355
00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:09.550
Just stay north to the fucking blanket.
It keeps him happy.

356
00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:12.340
You just want us just emotionally support me.

357
00:22:12.341 --> 00:22:16.090
And when we went to the class the other day and you watch the birthing story,

358
00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:21.210
you leaned over to me.
You were like,
oh,
I understand now I understand why.
No,

359
00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.650
when he was walking with her,
walking with her in the halls,

360
00:22:23.651 --> 00:22:26.080
I understood that being in there for the procedure,

361
00:22:26.081 --> 00:22:30.130
I completely don't understand and I just think that that is one of those things

362
00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:32.730
that it's just one of those,
it's that fucking hat.

363
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.510
It's that thing that you guys do and rub.
Right.
Rub My back and be like,

364
00:22:37.511 --> 00:22:42.130
you got this,
you're good.
Just breathe.
Like you're okay.
Yeah.

365
00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.600
All that kind of,
it's like,

366
00:22:43.601 --> 00:22:47.530
it's just like every time I walk out the fucking door and I got all this shit to

367
00:22:47.531 --> 00:22:51.190
do.
You always throw a couple more things.
Hey,
go get the dry cleaning.

368
00:22:51.191 --> 00:22:54.520
Can you go do this?
Can you go do that?
And yet you're dumping your fucking,

369
00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:58.210
you taking the eight off of whole pile.
You take the dog to the vet.
Actually

370
00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:08.150
I'm not taking the doctor that you're taking the dog to the vet.
Okay.

371
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.780
Yeah,
I'm moving all that other shit down there.
[inaudible]

372
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.470
you're going to have some help.
You're not the only,
I mean,

373
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:18.220
you know my brother is he,

374
00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.490
cause you're on the podcast that you're coming with this,

375
00:23:20.491 --> 00:23:24.390
this fucking arrogant tone I don't know is because you're on the podcast that

376
00:23:24.391 --> 00:23:27.150
you're coming at me with this extra fucking Douchey vibe.

377
00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:32.310
I always have this vine.
Fair enough.
Fair enough.

378
00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:37.860
Fair enough.
I've got some ads to read.
Oh,

379
00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:43.320
um,

380
00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.170

381
00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:48.380
<v 1>it?
No,
I knew who they were until you just said it.</v>

382
00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:51.290
Is these people that advertise?
Yeah.
Oh,

383
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.770
on our podcast they send us a couple of frame things.

384
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:59.090

Ah,

388
00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.940
Oh well you go figure it out.

529
00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:55.520
I did a little bit of the church this morning because I'm wearing a robe with

530
00:32:55.521 --> 00:33:00.380

I feel like an underlying time,
you could have been one of those TV evangelists.

535
00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.550
I could literally do it as a joke and just to see how far I get and then the

558
00:34:48.591 --> 00:34:51.940
deliver.
So I'm like,
all right,
I'm thinking of a walk around.
Yeah,

559
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:56.930
look at those nurses.
They're pretty hot.
Let's go here,
right?
We fucking show up.

560
00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:00.830
We got to sit down in another class and she's like,

561
00:35:00.831 --> 00:35:04.640
this is going to be 90 minutes long.
It's like,
fuck me.

562
00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:11.330
Fuck me.
90 fucking minutes.
So we're sitting there and she goes,
fringe first.

563
00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.420
Let's go around the room and introduce each other.

564
00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:17.630
Say Your names and what you're having and all that.
So right there,
I'm like,

565
00:35:17.631 --> 00:35:19.970
this is going to be by the end.
I loved her.
I thought she was great,

566
00:35:19.971 --> 00:35:23.000
but like I am,
I,
you know,
I'm a comedian.
Yeah,
I don't,

567
00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:27.440
I don't do well in the group dynamic.
You how bad I wanted to say.

568
00:35:27.441 --> 00:35:30.200
My name was Russel.
This lie.
Yeah.

569
00:35:30.201 --> 00:35:33.110
I wanted her to lie and I just wanted to lie about what we were having.

570
00:35:33.111 --> 00:35:34.910
I just wanted to lie.
I want to lie to all of,

571
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:39.690
it's none of your fucking room for just show me where she's going to fucking

572
00:35:39.691 --> 00:35:42.620
have it.
I sat there for 90 minutes people,

573
00:35:42.621 --> 00:35:46.130
all I have to do is fucking pull up,
drop her off,

574
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:51.320
go to the fifth floor,
make a right and I dial four numbers and I'm done.

575
00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:54.020
And I had to sit there for 90 minutes.

576
00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:02.270
One hour was her talking and then 30 minutes is a great speaker though.
She was,

577
00:36:02.271 --> 00:36:05.960
and she was adorable and she was a great mom and I loved her and they gave all

578
00:36:05.961 --> 00:36:10.670
the dads diaper bags at the end,
which was very,
very cool,
I thought.

579
00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:15.440
But the last day he always talked to us like put dopes the last 30 minutes we

580
00:36:15.441 --> 00:36:16.570
actually walk guys.
I mean,

581
00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:19.130
you're going to be standing there with your fucking head up your ass.

582
00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:20.510
I'd so want to sit there and be like,

583
00:36:20.511 --> 00:36:24.620
you realize men built this hospital and all major medicine was because of men.

584
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:28.250
I'm just saying they took every fucking thing when it comes to the male and

585
00:36:28.251 --> 00:36:31.820
female dynamic,
when they talk about the guy,
if there's a woman running it,

586
00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:34.940
the shit that they say,
they always talk to us like we're fucking stupid.

587
00:36:34.941 --> 00:36:39.350
The exact fucking thing that all these broads who are feminists say they don't

588
00:36:39.351 --> 00:36:43.730
want done to them happens all the time to us all the fucking time.
Hmm.
Okay.

589
00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.370
And look at you.
You could care less the same way.

590
00:36:46.371 --> 00:36:50.480
I don't give a shit that you make a dollar less an hour than I do to go down to

591
00:36:50.481 --> 00:36:53.540
the Laverne and Shirley plant and put little caps on those beer bottles.

592
00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:59.970
Jamil schmozzle what does that mean in Yiddish?
Oh,
I don't know.
Is that,

593
00:36:59.971 --> 00:37:04.560
is it Yiddish?
Yeah,
I love Yiddish.
I don't know a she meals that guy.

594
00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:08.160
He's the kind of guy who goes out to a restaurant.
He spills some soup.

595
00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:12.840
A schmozzle.
I think that's how you say he's the guy who spills it on.

596
00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:20.020
That is right.
It is.
You want to,
Oh,
you want to bet?
Sure.
You want to,

597
00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:22.510
how much you want bet bills,
soup.
I swear to God.
Bill,

598
00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:27.110
how much you want to put some fucking clothes?
I so I'm standing up now.
No,

599
00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:31.640
but that Rove just can not be contained.
Containment.
What?
Uh,

600
00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:35.450
how much you want to bet?
I don't know.
10 Bucks.

601
00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.210
All right.
All right.
Let's look it up right now.

602
00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.870
We're talking about the baby low jack.

603
00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:44.280
Third 30 minutes of it as we walked around the hospital.
Oh yeah.

604
00:37:44.281 --> 00:37:46.280
They got these little,
these little fucking,

605
00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:50.340
he showed us some newborns and it was so cute.
But they have a,

606
00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:54.090
they have a security in place these days for babies,

607
00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:57.130
which I did not know a little ankle bracelet on the thing like,

608
00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:02.250
like it was on house arrest just in case somebody came into the hospital and

609
00:38:02.251 --> 00:38:05.140
started stealing babies,
which I've never fucking heard of that Everett,

610
00:38:05.141 --> 00:38:08.370
that it's slowly getting you used to having that thing now.

611
00:38:08.371 --> 00:38:10.480
It's just on their ankle.
Oh boom.

612
00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.550
[inaudible] and then eventually it's fucking in a,
I mean,
Tony,
take it off.

613
00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:19.320
It's not like that's all when baby steps,
baby steps your baby.

614
00:38:19.321 --> 00:38:20.390
Step your way into someone.

615
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:24.300
They have an id tag on one ankle and then they have a little

616
00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:25.530
<v 3>okay.</v>

617
00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:28.710

speaking of that,
speaking of a,
you know,
I'm in my forties.

644
00:40:14.061 --> 00:40:16.580
I have a lot of friends that are no longer here.

645
00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:20.780
I got a couple of benefits to promote,
uh,
p common.
Um,

646
00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:24.980
this Tuesday,
great friend of mine unfortunately passed away,
uh,

647
00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:29.930
uh,
bought a month ago and uh,
we're having a benefit for him.

648
00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.000
Eight o'clock at the laugh factory.

649
00:40:32.001 --> 00:40:34.730
I'm going to be doing a bunch of time trying out of all this new stuff.

650
00:40:34.731 --> 00:40:39.370
We're going to have a great time.
And I'm,
he really was,
you know,

651
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.900
92 to 99.
He was just somebody I saw,
like practically almost every day.

652
00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:47.080
And we had so many great gigs before he went into writing and all that type of

653
00:40:47.081 --> 00:40:51.220
stuff.
So it's an honor to do something in his memory,
um,

654
00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.360
for,
uh,
for,
as is wonderful kids.
Um,

655
00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:57.910
and then we have the Patrice O'Neal benefit.
You know,

656
00:40:57.911 --> 00:41:02.140
yesterday was the five year anniversary.
Can you believe that?
Wow.

657
00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.170
I can't believe I haven't talked to him in five years.
That's crazy.

658
00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:08.440
I'm been trashed by him.
Heard him laughing.
Oh yeah.

659
00:41:08.441 --> 00:41:11.080
And think of everything that happened.
I remember when,

660
00:41:11.081 --> 00:41:15.760
when he speaking of sent Dusky right after he died was when all of that shit

661
00:41:15.761 --> 00:41:17.200
came out.
And I just remember

662
00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:22.260
just trying to imagine what he would have been talking about and I know that his

663
00:41:22.261 --> 00:41:24.960
angle,
somehow he would've made,

664
00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:29.170
he would have made that absolutely hilarious.
Um,
but anyways,
uh,

665
00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:33.150
the next benefit is,
um,
Tuesday,
February 21st,

666
00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:38.030
um,
tickets as always have been and been going along steadily.

667
00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:41.300
It makes a great Christmas gift.
Ladies,

668
00:41:41.301 --> 00:41:44.390
if you want to get something for your husband,
um,

669
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:49.550

Gary Gulman,
Dan Soder,

670
00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:53.540
Jim Norton,
Rich Vos,
Bobby Kelly,
myself,

671
00:41:53.541 --> 00:41:56.180
Keith Robinson.
I think I got everybody.

672
00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.690
We always try to have an eight or nine people.
Um,
it's such a,

673
00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:03.790
<v 0>Oh,
I'm so bummed I'm going to miss it.
I'm going to miss a Leslie Jones.
Oh,</v>

674
00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.990
she's going to Marie,
I love to hear,
do you stand up?

675
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:10.520
I better not be going on after,
uh,

676
00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:14.300
can I just say being in the Green Room at tough crowd with Colin Quinn,

677
00:42:14.301 --> 00:42:16.610
with Patrice,
like,
I dunno,

678
00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:20.810
like two times a week is probably the most like fun.

679
00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:25.820
I lacked every single day on that job and he was definitely him.
Geraldo,

680
00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:29.930
you know,
we're such like a big part of that.
And like,
I dunno,

681
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:36.140
it's just having Patrice around saying the most offensive,

682
00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:41.510
like a horrible,
horrible things that you can say as a man to a woman.

683
00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:45.890
But they were always funny,
like I can't deny the fact that like,
I'd be like,

684
00:42:45.891 --> 00:42:49.310
fuck you,
but I would be so funny at the same time.
It's like,

685
00:42:49.311 --> 00:42:52.250
that's the infuriating thing about comedians.
It's like,

686
00:42:52.251 --> 00:42:55.220
it's like you guys say the most fucked up shit,
but it's so funny.

687
00:42:55.490 --> 00:43:00.470
So it's hard to stay mad at you.
So we just fucking around.
I know.
No,

688
00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:04.190
and it's all in,
it's all like,
whatever you do shouldn't be laughing at this.

689
00:43:04.191 --> 00:43:05.024
But it's so fun.

690
00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:08.270
<v 1>You want a red classic comedians story.
Real cause it David tells story.</v>

691
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:13.990
So we're at fucking standup New York and there was a little person in the room,

692
00:43:14.421 --> 00:43:16.780
right?
A little person in the comedy club.

693
00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:20.180
And I think I kind of just fucked the whole thing up.
Right.
Was there.

694
00:43:20.181 --> 00:43:23.540
So the fucking club owner was all like,
you know,
okay,
there's a,
you know,

695
00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:27.740
it's a little person is,
you know,
at the show tonight,

696
00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:29.210
let's not make any joke with Bob Blasco,

697
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:32.280
so everybody's not doing jokes and stuff,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And he says,

698
00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:35.360
it's to Dave Attell.
Dave just goes,
AH,
okay.
Yeah.
Right.

699
00:43:35.361 --> 00:43:38.480
And he walks right up on stage and me,
first thing in his mouth,
he just goes,

700
00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:40.970
I understand.
We have a little man in the room.

701
00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:46.120
<v 0>Yeah.
Whole place labs.
The dude laughed.
Ah,
sorry.
Sorry.
I</v>

702
00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:50.550
<v 1>just went red line that he fucking laughed any fucking set all of this shit and</v>

703
00:43:50.551 --> 00:43:55.470
the guy loved it and had a great fucking time.
Yeah.
And I,
I dunno man,

704
00:43:55.471 --> 00:43:57.810
I was just one of those things where I'm at.

705
00:43:57.811 --> 00:43:59.820
I was brand new when I saw him do that,

706
00:43:59.821 --> 00:44:04.821
like to meet up to just disobey an order from a New York City club owner.

707
00:44:05.491 --> 00:44:07.920
I was like,
oh my God.
And he's still gonna get spots.

708
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:11.010
If I went a minute over where I was on the,
on the ladder at that point,

709
00:44:11.011 --> 00:44:13.860
if I went over like one fucking minute,
um,

710
00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:18.810
David tell at a bunch of those that he did the gator growl one time,

711
00:44:18.811 --> 00:44:20.280
which is you went down to the swamp,

712
00:44:20.281 --> 00:44:24.840
which is like this fucking with the gators play football and um,

713
00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:26.980
you were supposed to work squeaky clean.
The,
uh,

714
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:30.390
Dean didn't want you to fucking say anything dirty.

715
00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:32.760
Brewer told me this story.
It's another one.

716
00:44:32.761 --> 00:44:37.270
I'm going to fuck up and cough my way through.
Sit.

717
00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:38.700
Everybody works.
Squeaky clean.

718
00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:41.910
And he was sitting there wondering how David Tell was going to handle it.

719
00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:47.420
And Dave came out and just did the most filthy as fucking joke from his act

720
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:50.450
right up front.
And then looked right over at the,

721
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.370
at the whole board of the things.
And he goes,
fuck you Dane.

722
00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:56.580
This one's for this students.
And the whole place went fucking nuts.

723
00:44:56.581 --> 00:45:00.930
And then he murdered for like a half hour and then I coughed myself to death.

724
00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:05.340
All right.
I gotta put some clothes on.
Oh,
Billy Ball valve.

725
00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:10.050
Hopefully Paul second.
You cough your robe.
Opens this a little bit more.

726
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:14.910
Well,
you know what,
Nia,
you got to tease the crowd a little.
All right.

727
00:45:14.911 --> 00:45:19.100
That's the podcast for Thursday.
Have a great weekend.
You conch.

728
00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.020
Um,
and I'll talk to you on Monday there.

729
00:45:38.350 --> 00:45:39.090
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

730
00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:43.890
<v 11>um,
anyways,
new pope a Boston.
Billy loved the podcast.
Keep up the good work.</v>

731
00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:48.480
Thank you.
What do you make of all this news about the pope retiring?

732
00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:52.680
Oh Geez.
Personally,
I'm not that religious and don't really care that much.

733
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:56.010
Maybe if they elected a new pope that was young,
well that was a young,

734
00:45:56.011 --> 00:45:59.850
some young hot lady in her twenties I would give a shit.

735
00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:02.550
What do you think bill?
Is there more to the story that,

736
00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:05.610
that they're not telling us where his age and health issues.

737
00:46:05.611 --> 00:46:10.170
The only reason he retired is the church covering anything up.
Um,

738
00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:11.790
I'll come on do it.
Are they covering anything up?

739
00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:14.760
They fucking have been an aisle.

740
00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:19.880
Certain percentage of them have been covering up other fucking kids

741
00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:26.490
for a long time.
You know,
during World War Two there was a,
you know,

742
00:46:26.491 --> 00:46:29.220
they got in bed with the Nazis.
I mean,

743
00:46:29.221 --> 00:46:33.150
it really is one of the worst organization as far as some of the shit that

744
00:46:33.151 --> 00:46:35.760
they've done,
you know,

745
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:40.740
but people are so wrapped into not pissing off the invisible guy in wanting to

746
00:46:40.741 --> 00:46:44.250
go to the happy place and get to eat marshmallows for the rest of your fall.

747
00:46:44.251 --> 00:46:48.900
Fucking eternity that they are actually,
it's really,
it's,

748
00:46:48.901 --> 00:46:53.670
it's disturbing
that people can still be part of that religion.

749
00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:57.680
Do you know what I mean?
I,
I don't understand how,
you know,

750
00:46:57.710 --> 00:47:00.470
the stuff that they've done.
So,
uh,
yeah,
I would say,
yeah,

751
00:47:00.471 --> 00:47:05.060
there's probably something going on.
I don't know.
Maybe he said something like,

752
00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:09.290
Hey,
you know,
uh,
maybe we should apologize for,
uh,

753
00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:12.170
having that clam bake with Adolf Hitler.

754
00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:17.180
Should we maybe clear the air with that one?
Hey,
what do you say?

755
00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:18.230
Yah.

756
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:23.230
We actually don't help to pay for the lawyers of the people in our organization

757
00:47:23.811 --> 00:47:27.890
who put their dicks in the asses of kids.
You know,

758
00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:32.080
maybe he said something like,
I have no idea.
Anyways,
she said also,

759
00:47:32.081 --> 00:47:35.170
what are some of some of the ways that they could make the church more

760
00:47:35.171 --> 00:47:38.750
interesting?
For example,
maybe let broads become a priest.

761
00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:41.890
I bet more people would pay attention.

762
00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:45.610
Or how about letting people sit in the lazy boys instead of sitting and kneeling

763
00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:49.900
and those terrible rock hard benches they call pews.
I know,
it's so dumb.

764
00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:54.310
The whole thing is to get you like you're not worthy.
You're not worthy.

765
00:47:54.311 --> 00:47:58.660
You're not worthy.
Get on your fucking knees and it's in,
it's all,

766
00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:04.220
it's all made up by human beings taking a guess and,

767
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:09.070
and other adults because they get into it as kids.
They,
they,
I don't know why.

768
00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:10.953
I actually know why,

769
00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:14.770
because I believe that there was like a spirituality and I believe that you feel

770
00:48:14.771 --> 00:48:16.000
good when you do good things.

771
00:48:16.001 --> 00:48:21.001
And I just think that you can't corral that nobody owns it and you can't put a

772
00:48:21.041 --> 00:48:22.060
fucking,
like,

773
00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:27.250
I think that all churches should just be philosophies rather than this,

774
00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:30.940
this hardened way of looking at things.
Um,

775
00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:34.450
just the amount of deaths that it has caused.
I don't,

776
00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:37.870
I'm not saying anything fucking,
do you guys know how I feel in this shit?
Um,

777
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:42.070
finally,
how about we live in up the music a bit and add some newer sounds.

778
00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:43.990
Maybe a little guitar and drums.
Well,

779
00:48:43.991 --> 00:48:46.060
what you need to do is go to a Baptist church,

780
00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:51.320
go to a church where you don't see any white people going in there.
Um,
the,

781
00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:54.280
that would be a good one to start with and I bet you amazing.
You'll,

782
00:48:54.281 --> 00:48:57.610
you'll hear people who are actually in those churches probably sing bay better

783
00:48:57.611 --> 00:49:00.310
than half the people who won grammys that year.
I mean,

784
00:49:00.311 --> 00:49:03.970
how many times you've seen some amazing created whore sticking her finger in a

785
00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:06.850
year loud,
trying to act like they know how to sing and what are they,

786
00:49:06.851 --> 00:49:08.590
what's behind them all the fucking time.

787
00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:13.270
It's always like fucking three black chicks or two black chicks to some black

788
00:49:13.271 --> 00:49:15.880
dude.
I mean,
that's where the music is.
That's where it's coming from.

789
00:49:15.881 --> 00:49:20.320
If that's what you want,
just fucking go there.
They're not going to give a shit.

790
00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:21.490
Right.
They might look at you weird,

791
00:49:21.491 --> 00:49:24.040
but after a while I wants to see you feel in the music.
You should be fine.

792
00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:26.630
You should be fine.
The rest of the shit.
I Dunno.

793
00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:29.650
I think that they should maybe update the stories

794
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:35.150
every once in awhile.
Maybe.
Uh,

795
00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:39.170
just make up some new shit.
Just say,
Oh,
you know what God,

796
00:49:39.171 --> 00:49:43.790
God came back again and the burning Bush said,
uh,
you know,

797
00:49:43.791 --> 00:49:48.590
let he who never a illegally downloaded the song.

798
00:49:48.591 --> 00:49:50.720
Just something to fucking update it.
I don't know what to tell you.

799
00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:52.423
You know what I mean?

800
00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:54.423
<v 6>I don't know.</v>

801
00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:58.830
<v 11>Updated,
I guess,
you know,
there are some sort of,
some of those new age,</v>

802
00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:03.580
<v 1>the new age ones that just as scary because then somehow somebody always ends up</v>

803
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:05.260
saying there,
Jesus,
and the next thing you know,

804
00:50:05.261 --> 00:50:08.980
you're surrounded by the FBI and his tanks shooting flames at you,

805
00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:12.550
or you're waiting for some aliens to come.
And next thing you know,

806
00:50:12.551 --> 00:50:17.110
everybody's drinking some poison and you die in a fucking bunk bed,
you know,

807
00:50:17.111 --> 00:50:22.111
or in the middle of the jungle with some sweaty fucking Congo player,

808
00:50:22.271 --> 00:50:23.830
whatever the fucking that guy's name was.

809
00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:26.473
<v 11>You know,</v>

810
00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:30.560
I think better is when it comes to a spirituality and that type of shit.

811
00:50:30.561 --> 00:50:35.240
I think you're really,
you're better off on your own.
Um,

812
00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:40.840
I think,
you know,
I think generally speaking,
if you're not a psycho,

813
00:50:40.841 --> 00:50:42.880
you kind of know how to be a decent human being.

814
00:50:42.881 --> 00:50:47.860
I'm not saying that you're always succeed in it.
I certainly don't.
But,

815
00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:52.420
um,
I don't know how the fuck do I put it.

816
00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:57.300
I would rather sit at a bar about six,

817
00:50:57.301 --> 00:51:02.301
seven beers in and talk to somebody else who is in the same mind frame and talk

818
00:51:02.461 --> 00:51:07.461
about life than I would to actually go to a church and listen to some guy up

819
00:51:07.771 --> 00:51:12.240
there going.
And then he did shop there.
Gaddy did shop thing.

820
00:51:12.241 --> 00:51:16.350
Aus.
Hey did it for you.
He died painfully.

821
00:51:16.351 --> 00:51:21.030
I hope you appreciated the ally little.
Yeah,
we,

822
00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:24.990
we are.
You are not fucking worthy.

823
00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:29.280
We want you to remember this.
Your a piece of shit.

824
00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:34.170
You better hope he's not mad at you that way Lou.

825
00:51:34.171 --> 00:51:37.260
Yeah.
Hallelujah.
I mean,

826
00:51:37.261 --> 00:51:39.180
who the fuck wants to sit there through that?

827
00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:45.380
I mean there's still telling stories about lepers.
Can we fucking update it?

828
00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:47.900
<v 6>You know,</v>

829
00:51:50.130 --> 00:51:55.130
<v 11>the world was flat and other world is flat and there was some lappers and a guy</v>

830
00:51:59.431 --> 00:52:03.930
at a big is stuck some animals on,
what am I singing?

831
00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:07.590
I don't even know.
Well,

832
00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:11.520
I shouldn't have listened to my mother like,
do you?
How do you end up in that?

833
00:52:11.550 --> 00:52:13.230
Okay,
here's a job where you,

834
00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:16.440
you're not going to be able to ever fuck another woman again.

835
00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:18.513
<v 6>You know?</v>

836
00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:23.060
<v 11>Yeah.
Well do I get a wife now?
You don't get that.</v>

837
00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:26.480
You're going to sit in this dorm room with a bunch of other guys.

838
00:52:26.481 --> 00:52:30.530
None of you are we going to are going to get any pussy whatsoever.

839
00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:34.140
Okay.
There you go.
There's a natural,

840
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:38.010
like the whole thing is just like as far as the Catholic way is just like,

841
00:52:38.011 --> 00:52:42.670
just flogging yourself.
Do you understand how fucked up,

842
00:52:42.671 --> 00:52:47.290
but you got one fucking life.
You should be out having the time of your life,

843
00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:47.870
you know,

844
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:50.800
not hurting anybody but having the time you life and enjoying it because you

845
00:52:50.801 --> 00:52:54.610
fucking deserve it because you were lucky enough to be born a human being and

846
00:52:54.611 --> 00:52:59.150
not a fucking house fly.
What if reincarnation is true?
All right,

847
00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:02.860
and you're going to fucking come back.
Is is a,
uh,
I don't know.

848
00:53:02.861 --> 00:53:06.170
Something is snakies.
What else?

849
00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:08.350
Little fucking lizards sitting at darting around.

850
00:53:09.130 --> 00:53:11.770
Even if you don't get eaten by a snake,
you only live like 14 days.

851
00:53:13.570 --> 00:53:16.520
You can fucking drive a car.
You know,

852
00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:20.260
you never see a lizard doing that shit.

853
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:25.430
<v 12>Do you
sleep?</v>

854
00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:07.140
<v 11>Battled Scottish Cardinal.
Oh,
Brian.</v>

855
00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:12.090
Cardinal O'brien apologizes for my sexual conduct.
You know,

856
00:54:12.091 --> 00:54:14.400
I'm getting sick of people apologizing for shit,

857
00:54:14.401 --> 00:54:19.360
and they dance around this guy basically to use my new word,

858
00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:22.060
he buggered some kids.
All right?

859
00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:27.040
He took out his holy Cock Oleo and stuck it in their fucking,
uh,

860
00:54:27.550 --> 00:54:31.930
uh,
uh,
what the fuck was Jesus born in a shed?

861
00:54:32.170 --> 00:54:36.130
What are they always call it?
You know what are always around Christmas.

862
00:54:36.131 --> 00:54:38.500
I remember what it's called.
What was he?
He was born in a barn,

863
00:54:38.501 --> 00:54:41.350
but they give it some biblical,
what's the name for a Biblical Barn?

864
00:54:42.550 --> 00:54:43.650
I don't give a fuck.
Anyways,

865
00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:47.650
it says a Scottish cardinal who had earlier earlier challenged allegations of

866
00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:49.570
his sexual impropriety,

867
00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:55.270
claims that once again claims that once again shine an international spotlight

868
00:54:55.360 --> 00:55:00.360
in the alleged alleged sexual abuse evolving involving Roman Catholic clergy

869
00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:03.940
reverse course Sunday.
And the guy,
I apologize,

870
00:55:03.970 --> 00:55:07.840
this is how he apologizes for basically I,
for as far as I can tell,

871
00:55:07.841 --> 00:55:11.960
fucking children in the ass.
He said,

872
00:55:11.961 --> 00:55:16.961
I wished to take this opportunity to admit that there have been times that my

873
00:55:16.971 --> 00:55:21.971
sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest,

874
00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:24.500
archbishop and Cardinal.

875
00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:27.890
In recent days,

876
00:55:27.891 --> 00:55:32.690
certain allegations which have been made against me have become public
initially.

877
00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:37.880
There are anonymous and nonspecific nature led me to contest them to those I

878
00:55:38.031 --> 00:55:38.900
have offended.

879
00:55:39.110 --> 00:55:44.060
I apologize and ask forgiveness to those.

880
00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:46.340
I've offended.
You know,

881
00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:51.490
I've been lucky enough in my life to have never been unwantedly fucking banged

882
00:55:52.341 --> 00:55:54.740
in the ass by fucking priest.

883
00:55:55.970 --> 00:56:00.970
But I know I think I can be empathetic enough and say that if this was

884
00:56:01.971 --> 00:56:04.610
happening,
at no point would I be turning around going,
you know,

885
00:56:04.611 --> 00:56:08.840
that's what you're doing is really offensive.
I find this,

886
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:13.050
you know what the fuck.
When you apologize,

887
00:56:13.051 --> 00:56:15.120
you should have to say what the fuck you did.

888
00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:16.650
And if you're going to talk like this,

889
00:56:16.651 --> 00:56:21.651
there should be somebody of noxious Lee yelling off the Mike like what you did

890
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:26.290
like during this apology should have been like and wish to take this opportunity

891
00:56:26.291 --> 00:56:31.291
to admit the tariff and time that might actual conduct has fallen below the

892
00:56:31.781 --> 00:56:36.250
standards expected of me as a priest.
Yeah.
And it's a fucking human being.

893
00:56:36.251 --> 00:56:40.000
You're not supposed to fuck kids in recent days,

894
00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:45.510
certain allegations fucking of children which have been made against me have

895
00:56:45.611 --> 00:56:47.740
become public Bob flock and tide.

896
00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:53.080
Initially there were anonymous and nonspecific nature led me to contest them.

897
00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:55.870
How many different ways to we up explain it.

898
00:56:56.780 --> 00:57:01.540
You talk to your fucking Dick to put in there.
You got the point.
Um,

899
00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:06.090
good lord to those.
I have offended to those you're raped.

900
00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:09.030
You're a fucking rapist.
And like,

901
00:57:09.031 --> 00:57:12.760
like how like he tries to tie in the fact that he's a priest.

902
00:57:15.550 --> 00:57:19.480
Stay like below the standards expected of me as a priest,
Archbishop,

903
00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:21.730
archbishop and Cardinal.

904
00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:27.420
So like
what if you,

905
00:57:27.421 --> 00:57:31.830
if you were a pope that was okay.
Or is it because you never became a pope?

906
00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:36.630
So this guy basically been dental in kids ever since he got into that fucking

907
00:57:36.631 --> 00:57:39.390
hurt.
How is that thing still in business is just fucking do it.

908
00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:09.400
<v 3>[inaudible] Hey,
what's going on?</v>

909
00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:10.433
<v 11>No,
nope.</v>

910
00:58:10.890 --> 00:58:15.890
<v 13>Monday morning podcasts that I'm actually doing this week on a Sunday just</v>

911
00:58:16.501 --> 00:58:20.880
because tomorrow.
Um,

912
00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:25.050
Yeah,

Big Time Hollywood guy.
Sorry people.

913
00:58:25.051 --> 00:58:28.700
I don't have time for you tomorrow.
I have to be on set.

914
00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:33.420

915
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:36.870
I'm shooting something tomorrow,
so I gotta do that tomorrow.
There you go.

916
00:58:36.871 --> 00:58:39.360
You like,
you like how I worked at in,
you guys didn't even ask me.

917
00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:42.270
I didn't have to tell you.
I'm one of those guys.

918
00:58:42.450 --> 00:58:45.930
I arrogantly work my resume into every sort of conversation.

919
00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:49.950
Do you think it's going to rain tomorrow?
Well,
you know,
when I was taping,

920
00:58:49.951 --> 00:58:54.330
I love the 80s.
They were telling me that tomorrow it's supposed to,
you know,

921
00:58:54.331 --> 00:58:59.331
people do that and then you want to fucking do something violent or maybe,

922
00:58:59.461 --> 00:59:02.670
maybe not,
maybe not.
Maybe people aren't like me.

923
00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:05.900
It makes you realize what a fucking angry asshole I am.
Um,

924
00:59:06.730 --> 00:59:11.580
on a whole nother level.
This past month,
I just,
uh,
I'm just really,

925
00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:16.770
uh,
difficult to be around and,
um,
that's it.

926
00:59:16.771 --> 00:59:20.730
See Ya,
it's a fucking pretty hardcore moment to have with yourself.

927
00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:23.720
Stay yourself in the mirror and to be like,
dude,

928
00:59:23.721 --> 00:59:27.680
if I could somehow walk out of this fucking situation,
I would,

929
00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:33.680
and I was supposed to be here with you.
So,
um,
anyways,
I hope everybody had an,

930
00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:38.960
uh,
a nice,
happy thanksgiving.
I hope you had a good time.
And,

931
00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:44.330
uh,
I had a great one and a,
I fucked up last week though.
I was,
I was,

932
00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:49.710
I had done basically like,
you know,
seven attempts at this podcast and uh,

933
00:59:49.790 --> 00:59:50.091
you know,

934
00:59:50.091 --> 00:59:54.080
trying to make sure I was thanking everybody and I totally fucked up on the

935
00:59:54.081 --> 00:59:58.310
seventh take.
And I forgot to thank uh,
Michael Hanes,
the uh,

936
00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:03.290
the announcer for the Colorado avalanche.
A Guy I met on the road,

937
01:00:04.210 --> 01:00:08.030
whoever dental,
he likes my comedy and found out I was a hockey fan.

938
01:00:08.031 --> 01:00:09.950
So the e the fuck it avalanche.

939
01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:13.720
We're playing the kings hooked me up with some tickets and interviewed me in

940
01:00:13.721 --> 01:00:16.010
between periods.
You know,

941
01:00:16.011 --> 01:00:19.820
like I was fucking Diane Cannon at a Laker game.
You know,

942
01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:23.290
it's sort of a drop off with celebrity when you go,

943
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:27.590
when you go to the La Kings game,
you know,
you go to La Laker game,

944
01:00:27.591 --> 01:00:31.400
you know who you're going to get.
You know you got Jack Nicholson,

945
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:34.910
fucking will Smith,
all those guys.
Even if you go to a clippers game,

946
01:00:34.911 --> 01:00:39.170
Billy crystal sits court side along with that black dude from a different world

947
01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:42.800
and where that guy with the glasses,
the round John Lennon glasses.

948
01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:48.350
But when you go to a kings game,
now that John Candy died,
actually,

949
01:00:48.351 --> 01:00:51.230
when did he die?
He died a long time ago.
But ever since he died,

950
01:00:51.830 --> 01:00:54.950
the only kings like that that's like,
it's classic La.

951
01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:58.250
When Gretzky showed up then on and all the fucking people came out,
you know,

952
01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:03.110
and then he leaves and John Candy dies.
That was sort of a combo,

953
01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:07.040
you know,
boom,
boom.
And everyone was like,
fucking,
I'm not gonna go there.
So now,

954
01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:09.890
what am I trying to say here?

955
01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:13.460
I'm trying to say that if they yank a celebrity out of the fucking stands at a

956
01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:15.770
kings game,
you're going to get somebody at my level,

957
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:21.190
basically a non celebrity who hasn't had the decency to at least become fat or

958
01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:24.410
an addict.
So you can enjoy me on a reality show.

959
01:01:25.070 --> 01:01:26.750
I am a responsible,

960
01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:32.180
semi noticeable human being who pays his bills on time.

961
01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.660
And if that isn't compelling,
I don't know what it is.

962
01:01:35.770 --> 01:01:38.780
I actually know somebody went to the La Kings game one time a long time ago,

963
01:01:38.781 --> 01:01:43.160
back at the La Forum and I saw,
uh,
I saw,

964
01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:46.820
why am I thinking Mike Adam Lee?
It's not Mike Adam Lee.

965
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:51.800
That was the host of NFL 81 let's Bryant Gumbel.

966
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:53.900
I'm totally going.

967
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:58.490
Who's the fucking guy who did a e Jesus Christ.

968
01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:03.110
He was the amounts of when,
uh,
the miracle on ice,
uh,

969
01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:08.260
Michael Al Michaels,
Jesus Christ,
they go al Michaels was there,

970
01:02:08.330 --> 01:02:12.020
big fan of hockey.
I saw him and I really wanted to say something too,
but he had,

971
01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:15.050
I could see it in the wrinkles in his forehead that he was like,
I know,

972
01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:18.890
I know you like me,
but please I'm here with my kid.
And I was like,
all right.

973
01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:22.770
And we set it all with the wrinkles on our foreheads.
Pretty amazing moment.

974
01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:26.170
You know,
I've always had that kind of connection with people to be,
you know,
uh,

975
01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:30.960
communicate through the third eye.
Um,
all right.
If you new to my podcast,

976
01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:34.860
where the fuck have you been?
Huh?
I've been doing them for over a year,
you know?

977
01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:38.670
No.
Now what you jumping on the bandwagon because I'm finally over 20 listeners,

978
01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.073
you know,

979
01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:44.910
because I actually got a compliment today from somebody in a jolly old England.

980
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:49.500
I got something in England listening to this shit.
He liked that.

981
01:02:49.890 --> 01:02:53.520
I'm on two different continents,
so it's not numbers,

982
01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:56.820
it's not the amount of people you have listening to your podcast.

983
01:02:56.970 --> 01:03:00.630
It's the amount of,
of uh,
of countries.
All right,
look at me.

984
01:03:00.631 --> 01:03:05.220
I'm going global just like everybody else,
just like everybody else.

985
01:03:05.221 --> 01:03:07.220
So,
uh,
so anyways,
um,

986
01:03:07.410 --> 01:03:10.260
can I really do the podcast and I'll talk about the guy who got trampled at

987
01:03:10.261 --> 01:03:11.940
Walmart.
I mean,

988
01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:18.300
if it's just fucking unbelievable,
I just don't,
I,
you know,

989
01:03:18.330 --> 01:03:22.200
how bad is the fucking economy that,
you know,

990
01:03:22.201 --> 01:03:27.201
some guy opening the door to a fucking store that sells garbage cans,

991
01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:33.600
shack it's,
and fucking rakes gets trampled to death.

992
01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:36.990
What the fuck were those people run it for?
I Dunno.

993
01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:39.300
I like how they tried to say people broke down on the door.

994
01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.470
I really don't think they did.

995
01:03:40.471 --> 01:03:44.820
I think that they were being pressed up against it.
If you're first in line,

996
01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:48.030
why are you going to break down the door?
You know,
think about that analogy.

997
01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:51.210
You want to be extra first.
That doesn't make any sense.

998
01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:55.470
People were pushing from behind.
They basically created a,

999
01:03:55.471 --> 01:03:58.170
they had general seating like the who in Cincinnati.

1000
01:03:58.290 --> 01:04:01.680
He can't fucking do that shit.
And for years we were right every,

1001
01:04:01.681 --> 01:04:04.230
every year at Christmas,
you see the doors,
they burst open.

1002
01:04:04.890 --> 01:04:07.170
There's was always a big black girl loses her fucking wig.

1003
01:04:07.171 --> 01:04:08.520
When she falls on the ground,

1004
01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.310
there's always that dirty white dude with the wranglers and one of his pant legs

1005
01:04:14.311 --> 01:04:19.170
gets ripped off as he tries to come in through the overnight mailbox.
You know,

1006
01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:24.060
it was inevitable.
It was fucking inevitable.
What a Goddamn way to go.

1007
01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:28.080
That's absolutely fucking tragic.
And I don't even know why I brought it up.

1008
01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:33.450
I just,
I can't get over it.
I can't get over that.
Somebody died doing that.

1009
01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:38.760
You know
how you supposed to die at Walmart?

1010
01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.780
You know?
I don't know.
Maybe you stocking the shelves.

1011
01:04:44.430 --> 01:04:48.720
You just come fucking slamming down on that linoleum floor.

1012
01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:53.190
Even then coma benefit,
you know,

1013
01:04:53.191 --> 01:04:56.910
you get to meet the local sports hero.
You know,

1014
01:04:58.410 --> 01:05:01.340
you're out on long island build Garren comes in and signs of

1015
01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:06.060
Fucking Island Jersey.
It's just fucking,
you know,
you know,

1016
01:05:06.061 --> 01:05:09.030
you're not supposed to die at Walmart.
That's just,
that's like a really,

1017
01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.030
I don't know.
What do you guys think about that?

1018
01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:17.560
Do you think Walmart is at fault there?
He me for years.
You know,
I don't,

1019
01:05:17.561 --> 01:05:20.590
I don't know who's at fault there.
I mean,
Walmart,
you know,

1020
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:21.550
they come into the town,

1021
01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:25.480
they basically fucking fuck over every small business there.
Now,

1022
01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:27.400
I've met all those people with small business owners.

1023
01:05:27.401 --> 01:05:31.090
They don't have any fucking money now.
So now they pressed up against the glass.

1024
01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:35.290
Oh my God,
I need to get a rake.
[inaudible] $3.

1025
01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:40.030
It's fucking nine,
nine.
Open the doors.
I mean,

1026
01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:44.530
they literally created that fucking thing.
Jesus Christ.
Well,

1027
01:05:44.531 --> 01:05:47.350
why don't I read before I do these?
I really built it.

1028
01:05:47.351 --> 01:05:51.160
They literally created what in your head?
You fucking moron.
All right,

1029
01:05:51.161 --> 01:05:54.280
let's get to the podcast questions.
Like I said,
if you're new to my podcast,

1030
01:05:54.281 --> 01:05:57.940
people send me questions.
Uh,
they send me comments.
They,
uh,

1031
01:05:57.941 --> 01:06:01.000
they try to educate me on certain things and I them,

1032
01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:05.170
but it doesn't happen so much that way because I'm a moron.

1033
01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:07.930
So let's get to the first question of the week.
Question number one.

1034
01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:11.470
Boy Did I even think Michael Hanes?
Yeah.
So Michael,

1035
01:06:11.471 --> 01:06:15.080
thank you very much for putting me on in between periods,
man.
It was a,
uh,

1036
01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:18.490
it was unbelievable.
And uh,
they actually let me,
hey gimme,

1037
01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:21.490
Peter McNabb let me hang out as the game started.

1038
01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:25.480
And I really realized how hard it is to tell stories as you're watching the
game.

1039
01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:29.770
Like I couldn't even focus and I actually talked over a goal.

1040
01:06:29.771 --> 01:06:33.070
I was really in the middle of telling a story during a breakaway and I didn't

1041
01:06:33.071 --> 01:06:35.890
even,
I'm so into trying to be funny on TV.

1042
01:06:35.891 --> 01:06:39.940
I didn't notice that it was like a fucking two on one and then the guys scored.

1043
01:06:39.941 --> 01:06:44.360
So I had to cut my story short by saying,
oops.
I was like,
yeah.

1044
01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:47.800
And then my dad was crazy.
Oops.
That's what I literally said.
Oops.

1045
01:06:47.801 --> 01:06:48.820
On national television.

1046
01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:53.080
At that point I wanted to crawl out of the studio,

1047
01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:55.420
but it was still awesome.
Anyways.
All right,
here we go.

1048
01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:59.230
Podcast question of the week.
Question number one bill,

1049
01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:04.260
have you ever been confronted by midgets about your bit midgets or done it in

1050
01:07:04.901 --> 01:07:09.820
front of midgets?
Um,
actually,
uh,
I had a,
uh,

1051
01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:12.940
I had a small person whenever you supposed to call them,

1052
01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:17.140
send me an email.
And the bit was basically,

1053
01:07:17.141 --> 01:07:21.160
I don't understand why the word midget is offensive,
you know,

1054
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:25.810
it's not like midgets would dragged here from another country,
you know,

1055
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:28.030
packed into a boat,
you know,

1056
01:07:28.031 --> 01:07:32.530
the whole [inaudible] thing and then fucking forced to,
uh,
you know,

1057
01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:35.740
have them in 38 of their friends crawl out of a car in the middle of a circus.

1058
01:07:35.741 --> 01:07:39.070
You know,
I did jokes like that,
you know,
I don't understand.
You know,

1059
01:07:39.650 --> 01:07:42.070
it's just the word.
That's the table.
That's the lamp and you're a midget.

1060
01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:45.310
That's how the joke went.
Plus,
Mitch,
it sounds tough.
I'm a fucking midget,

1061
01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:50.410
you know,
but then this guy,
actually a little person actually wrote me and said,

1062
01:07:50.411 --> 01:07:52.840
actually midget is offensive because it came,

1063
01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:56.170
I guess somebody on Barnum Bailey came up with it and it,

1064
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:59.080
it's actually a form of the word and Mitch,

1065
01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:04.560
which I guess is some sort of little bug so it somehow came out of that.

1066
01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:08.350
So you basically say midget,
you're saying that they're just a little,

1067
01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:12.910
little bug that you could just step on or maybe tear one of their legs off and

1068
01:08:12.911 --> 01:08:17.060
watch them run around in a circle?
So yeah,
it is.
So I have been confronted,

1069
01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:20.030
um,
you know,
some,

1070
01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:23.450
like last night somebody did a joke about a dwarf and there was a,

1071
01:08:23.451 --> 01:08:27.800
I think a little person in the crowd.
And,
uh,
I looked over at him,

1072
01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:31.220
so their face,
you know,
sort of crinkle up a little bit,

1073
01:08:31.221 --> 01:08:34.250
like even on a holiday weekend,
I have to deal with this.

1074
01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.590
And I felt a little bad for them.

1075
01:08:37.310 --> 01:08:40.250
I try not to look at the crowd when I talk because,
uh,
you know,

1076
01:08:40.251 --> 01:08:44.300
I got a lot of shit that could bug people.
Can I answer that?
Okay.

1077
01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:47.120
Question note to bill.
I want to be a standup comedian.

1078
01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:51.980
Do you want to be a standup comedian?
Sure.
We all do.
We hear it to Vraie.

1079
01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:56.180
Um,
okay.
Dave said on insight,

1080
01:08:56.181 --> 01:08:59.660
I'm assuming this is Chappelle sent on inside the actor's studio that if you

1081
01:08:59.661 --> 01:09:03.440
want to be a standup comedian,
you have to take acting lessons.

1082
01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:07.280
Did you take acting lessons?
Uh,
yes I have.

1083
01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:11.360
Although you would never know it if you ever saw me act.
Thank you.
Um,
yeah,

1084
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:14.500
I've taken acting lessons and uh,

1085
01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:19.880
I haven't taken him on a while,
but,
um,

1086
01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:25.310
I dunno why.
I Dunno why I stopped taking acting lessons.
Why did I,

1087
01:09:25.311 --> 01:09:26.960
you don't mind cause I hated the classes.

1088
01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:32.510
They were too fucking long and then I was always,
um,

1089
01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:37.670
I dunno.
I was,
it was always like that one person who,
who uh,

1090
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.080
who sucks so bad that it made me want to quit the class.

1091
01:09:43.130 --> 01:09:46.580
You know,
we used to call them bathroom,
bathroom break guy.
Like,
you know,

1092
01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.520
like when they went up to do their scene,
you went to go take a bathroom break.

1093
01:09:49.521 --> 01:09:52.730
But I would tell you this,
if you do,
you want to become a comedian.
I mean,

1094
01:09:52.731 --> 01:09:55.730
I don't know if actually helps you stand up or not,

1095
01:09:55.731 --> 01:09:58.790
but I know it definitely helps you when you get to the next level of this

1096
01:09:58.791 --> 01:10:03.080
business when you have to shoot something like I do tomorrow,

1097
01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:06.620
that a,
if you've taken acting lessons that you had,
you know,

1098
01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:11.150
you actually know how to do it.
So,
um,
I mean if you want to be a comedian,

1099
01:10:11.151 --> 01:10:13.000
just write five minutes of shit you think's funny.

1100
01:10:13.390 --> 01:10:18.260
Sign up for an open mic and when they call your name,
go up there.
Um,
you know,

1101
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:21.260
you'll be fine.
You don't have to recite Shakespeare.
But um,

1102
01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:24.170
as you get going along,
I would definitely take acting classes,

1103
01:10:24.171 --> 01:10:27.170
improv classes for as much as comedians make fun of it.

1104
01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:31.100
Improv classes really help you.
Uh,

1105
01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:35.360
I think an acting because you're literally improving with other,

1106
01:10:35.450 --> 01:10:37.910
another person in stand up is so solitary.

1107
01:10:37.911 --> 01:10:40.970
You're just standing on stage in private with the crowd,

1108
01:10:40.971 --> 01:10:44.000
but it's still all you and you don't really have to wait for someone else.

1109
01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:46.820
I could go on forever.
About this shit.
So yeah,
right.

1110
01:10:46.821 --> 01:10:49.910
Five minutes of Shit you think's funny and um,

1111
01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:54.200
sign up for an open mic and then you know when she get that thing going,
take,

1112
01:10:54.201 --> 01:10:56.390
take anything.
Sketch,
sketch,

1113
01:10:56.391 --> 01:11:00.980
class as many things as you could learn.
I would,
you know,

1114
01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:05.120
I mean the amount of times I've kicked myself for not learning how to tap dance.

1115
01:11:05.210 --> 01:11:06.650
I mean I just can't tell no kid.

1116
01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:09.710
I was just thinking back to the Vaudeville days when you had to be a triple

1117
01:11:09.711 --> 01:11:14.160
threat.
Funny.
Be able to dance and sing before it became,
you know,

1118
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:18.960
it's like the NFL,
you just,
I just play on special teams,
you know,

1119
01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:23.880
I'm the long snapper you ever see like football teams back in the 20s they had

1120
01:11:23.881 --> 01:11:26.430
like eight guys on them.
All right.
Question number three.
All right.

1121
01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:31.440
Tonight me and my friends were having,
and we're having an argument about ACDC,

1122
01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:35.460
he was saying how Angus young is hands down the coolest mother fucking guitar

1123
01:11:35.461 --> 01:11:38.340
player of all time.
While I agree with that,

1124
01:11:38.341 --> 01:11:42.030
I just think it's time for him to lose the schoolboy outfit.
I mean,

1125
01:11:42.031 --> 01:11:45.840
isn't the dude like approaching 60,
believe it or not,

1126
01:11:45.841 --> 01:11:50.760
Angus is only 53 years old.
He made it when he was like 19 or 20.

1127
01:11:50.761 --> 01:11:52.350
He was born in 1955.

1128
01:11:52.351 --> 01:11:57.351
Malcolm young was born in 1953 and bond Scott I believe was born in 1946.

1129
01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:02.700
Okay.
I just established that I'm a geek.
Now let's get back to ACDC.

1130
01:12:02.701 --> 01:12:04.260
You know what I gotta agree with you.

1131
01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:09.000
I think a actually read an article recently where he was talking about,

1132
01:12:09.690 --> 01:12:13.200
Angus was talking about having to put on that schoolboy outfit and he said,

1133
01:12:13.201 --> 01:12:17.790
and quote unquote,
I have to become that guy.
But,
um,

1134
01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:23.190
I don't know.
That's a very like I would totally,
I don't know.

1135
01:12:23.191 --> 01:12:27.420
What would it look like if Angus actually put some jeans on and started bouncing

1136
01:12:27.421 --> 01:12:30.090
around the stage like that?
It would definitely take a minute.

1137
01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:33.270
But you're really fucking with,
uh,

1138
01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:38.340
the whole formula and ACDC is formula has never wavered.

1139
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:40.680
They're like,
we're singing about balls,

1140
01:12:40.681 --> 01:12:43.950
the devil and Pussy and drinking,

1141
01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:48.360
and they have not veered away from that for over 33 years.

1142
01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:50.700
So,
I mean,

1143
01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:54.120
I don't know if you put pants on as the whole house of cards come down.

1144
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:56.670
I think it would take a minute,
but I wouldn't have a problem.

1145
01:12:57.450 --> 01:12:59.040
I wouldn't have a problem you can put pants on.

1146
01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:02.250
I really would not have a problem with it.
Um,

1147
01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:04.531
you know what they should do?

1148
01:13:04.531 --> 01:13:08.040
They should do an ACDC unplugged where they still play electric.

1149
01:13:08.041 --> 01:13:12.150
But Angus gets to sit down and around with all the other band members.

1150
01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:16.050
Kind of like an Elvis has come back special where it was still like electric.

1151
01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:20.370
Well Mama,
remember that one?
All right.

1152
01:13:22.290 --> 01:13:25.200
Um,
all right,
question number four.
So don't even answer that.

1153
01:13:25.201 --> 01:13:27.930
Do I think it's time to like,
I wouldn't bother me,

1154
01:13:27.931 --> 01:13:31.950
but I can definitely see why he continues to wear that outfit because a,

1155
01:13:31.951 --> 01:13:36.270
I wouldn't want to fuck with that formula.
So podcast question number four.

1156
01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:40.980
Hey Bill,
I signed up for your email list.
Uh,

1157
01:13:41.010 --> 01:13:45.780
thanks for the confirmation email.
Very corporate like,
yeah,
fuck you.

1158
01:13:45.781 --> 01:13:48.720
Like I got a guy running my website a little bit.
What do you want from me?

1159
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:53.850
You know,
we,
we basically have,
you know,
my email list on my website.

1160
01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:57.000
Basically what happens is people who have an AOL email,

1161
01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:01.320
if two of them mark you as spam,
you get kicked off the Internet.

1162
01:14:01.321 --> 01:14:04.260
So I'm trying to get rid of all the,
all people who don't want me.

1163
01:14:04.261 --> 01:14:08.910
That's why I sent that out.
Okay.
And that's why we confirmed it.
Okay.

1164
01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:14.050
Anyways,
he says I'm 19 and I haven't had sex since 2006.
Jesus Christ.

1165
01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:18.790
Where's this going?
When I was 16 years old,
well,
first of all,

1166
01:14:18.791 --> 01:14:22.120
I'm not sympathetic because I didn't lose my virginity until I was fucking 19.

1167
01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:25.570
Um,
I dunno what the Hell's going on.

1168
01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:30.430
And I wanted to know how long your longest dry streak was and how you ended it.

1169
01:14:30.670 --> 01:14:34.720
Well,
I just ruined the joke the first 19 years of my life on how did I end it?

1170
01:14:34.721 --> 01:14:39.721
I met some chick who sang in a band who was fucking about 37 years old and I

1171
01:14:40.151 --> 01:14:44.620
think you can fill in the blanks.
Um,
okay,

1172
01:14:44.770 --> 01:14:46.990
well I know what you're saying.
Once,
once I was in the game,

1173
01:14:46.991 --> 01:14:50.800
what's the longest I went?
Uh,

1174
01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:55.870
I think the first fucking year and a half,
maybe two years of my comedy career,

1175
01:14:57.010 --> 01:15:01.930
I
swear to God I was finishing college,

1176
01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:05.800
I was living in a home with my parents and I was doing stand up at night.

1177
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:10.540
I mean I barely had time to rub one out.
Not to mention I had like,
you know,

1178
01:15:10.541 --> 01:15:14.890
people say I had,
I have no game with women if you know,

1179
01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:19.840
and technically there's no way to be lower than ground zero.

1180
01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:24.460
Somehow I was,
I was below,
I was below ground zero.

1181
01:15:24.610 --> 01:15:27.160
Have no game with women to the point like,

1182
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:31.870
do you ever hear the end of whole lot of love when Robert Plant's sings the echo

1183
01:15:31.871 --> 01:15:35.860
of what he's about ready to sing comes first to indicate that he's in hell.

1184
01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:37.840
That's like when I would hit on girls,

1185
01:15:37.841 --> 01:15:41.230
the echo of the awful line that I was going to say to them that that would come

1186
01:15:41.231 --> 01:15:42.820
out first.
And then my awful.

1187
01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:46.090
So they were already walking away before I opened my mouth.

1188
01:15:46.091 --> 01:15:49.960
So probably about two years.
So what do you won?
You're about two years.
Yeah,

1189
01:15:49.961 --> 01:15:52.870
but dude,
you know,
some,
I know another comic,
he got laid at like 14.

1190
01:15:52.871 --> 01:15:56.200
He didn't get laid again until he was like 18.
Um,

1191
01:15:57.670 --> 01:16:01.480
don't worry about it,
you know?
Um,
how can you get out of it?
It's just,

1192
01:16:01.481 --> 01:16:05.350
it's a numbers game.
Just,
you know what?
Rub One out before you go out.

1193
01:16:05.351 --> 01:16:06.640
So that takes the pressure off.

1194
01:16:06.670 --> 01:16:09.210
Now you don't give a shit and then just go out there and uh,

1195
01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:13.720
start saying the shit that your brain is telling you.

1196
01:16:13.721 --> 01:16:16.150
Not to say like don't say that that will offender.

1197
01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:18.520
That's the kind of shit you need to start saying.
I mean,

1198
01:16:18.521 --> 01:16:23.200
I don't mean walk up to her and just be like a,
Hey,

1199
01:16:23.201 --> 01:16:25.050
what's up?
You fucking cunt.
And

1200
01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:30.670
I'm not saying say that.
I'm just saying that,
you know what I mean?

1201
01:16:31.810 --> 01:16:36.520
I can't even think of a fucking example.
Just,
I don't know.
You just,
you know,

1202
01:16:36.530 --> 01:16:40.030
you start steering the conversation towards sex and when she acts like she's

1203
01:16:40.031 --> 01:16:44.440
offended,
just tell her that she's not offended,
you know?
You know,

1204
01:16:44.441 --> 01:16:45.430
you just do that shit.

1205
01:16:45.431 --> 01:16:48.760
You just keep [inaudible] it's one of those things you just have to learn.

1206
01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:52.210
You have to learn what your style of being an asshole is.

1207
01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:53.950
This is if you're going to try and get late.

1208
01:16:54.010 --> 01:16:57.430
If you want to meet the woman of your dreams,
don't do that.
Then you have to,

1209
01:16:57.431 --> 01:17:00.880
I guess listen to your heart.
I have no idea.
Wow.
That just made me feel creepy.

1210
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.100
Um,
which is probably why not married.
Okay.
Um,
all right,
let's move along.
Okay.

1211
01:17:06.101 --> 01:17:09.950
Question number five.
Thank you.
You thank you.

1212
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:14.270
In a large capital letters,
they're like,
I forgot the word capital,

1213
01:17:14.271 --> 01:17:17.480
so I had st large so I could buy time and my brain to come up with capital

1214
01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:21.650
capital's okay.
Um,
I'm so tired of people trashing conspiracy theory.

1215
01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:24.950
All this was last week.
Why defendant can sips conspiracy theory.

1216
01:17:24.951 --> 01:17:27.830
I'm so tired of people trashing conspiracy theory without looking into it.

1217
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:30.170
I'm not saying that all of the theories of valid,

1218
01:17:30.171 --> 01:17:34.640
but I also think people have a tendency to be,
to be questionless sheep.

1219
01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:38.480
I just want to say thank you for telling those fucks to think for themselves a

1220
01:17:38.481 --> 01:17:42.440
bit.
Um,
yeah,
I mean it wasn't going that hardcore.
Yeah.
But I definitely think,

1221
01:17:42.441 --> 01:17:45.830
yeah,
people just,
yeah.
If it's on TV,
it's true.

1222
01:17:45.831 --> 01:17:47.370
If it's on the Internet then it's the,

1223
01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:50.750
that's the Internet's were all the lies are,
it's kind of like racism,

1224
01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:53.420
like all the racist white people are just in the south,

1225
01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:58.310
but everybody in Connecticut is cool,
you know,
those,
that type of mindset.
Anyway,

1226
01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:01.730
here's this question.
Why aren't you coming to Chicago anytime soon?

1227
01:18:01.731 --> 01:18:06.160
Make it happen is all I'm saying.
Jesus Christ.
All right.

1228
01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:08.360
I'm very demanding.
Um,

1229
01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:12.560
while I was there in March when me and I don't know where the hell you are,

1230
01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:16.430
there's a lot of cities out there.
I try to come through about once a year.

1231
01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:21.200
Chicago is definitely on my,
uh,
it's like a politician right now.
Yeah,

1232
01:18:21.201 --> 01:18:25.430
we're definitely looking into the that and it's definitely on the agenda and

1233
01:18:25.431 --> 01:18:29.750
when the time is right,
we're going to handle the situation in Chicago Nets.

1234
01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:31.930
Next question please.
All right,
Bill,

1235
01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:35.420
how many emails do you get with the word dude in the subject?

1236
01:18:35.450 --> 01:18:40.250
Probably a shit ton.
Here's another one.
Deal with it.
You know,

1237
01:18:40.251 --> 01:18:43.550
so I think people are starting to feed off my attitude where you guys are being

1238
01:18:43.551 --> 01:18:44.840
assholes to me for no reason.

1239
01:18:44.841 --> 01:18:48.680
Kind of like how I'm assholes to people who ask me questions for no reason.

1240
01:18:48.681 --> 01:18:52.070
All right,
Bill,
I was making my breakfast in my 900 square foot,

1241
01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:57.600
$450,000 condo this morning attempting to determine what a,

1242
01:18:57.890 --> 01:19:01.940
which octane of gasoline I was going to use to burn down my bank.

1243
01:19:03.650 --> 01:19:07.940
Okay.
And then finally,
this bailout ass raping,

1244
01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:10.220
uh,
really clicked.

1245
01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:14.000
I mean I knew we were getting bent over the table on this whole deal,

1246
01:19:14.001 --> 01:19:18.650
but not in such an obvious manner.
Our government is taking our money via taxes,

1247
01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:23.270
giving it to bank so they can loan us our own money back and interest that

1248
01:19:23.271 --> 01:19:27.650
fucking taking our money so they can loan it back to us for more money.

1249
01:19:28.610 --> 01:19:33.020
And the cock mitigating ass clowns in Washington are all voting yes on this
shit.

1250
01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:36.710
How the fuck did this happen?
Um,

1251
01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:40.520
I mean I don't,
I don't know.
I'm not in the Senate,

1252
01:19:40.521 --> 01:19:42.800
but I would imagine that if you print the money,

1253
01:19:42.801 --> 01:19:44.870
you have enough money to pay off politicians.

1254
01:19:46.250 --> 01:19:50.390
So they basically do whatever the banks want them to do.
I mean,
I dunno.

1255
01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:52.250
It's,
it's brutal.

1256
01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:57.110
I'm trying to get out from underneath the house of Rothschild joined to get out

1257
01:19:57.111 --> 01:20:01.370
from underneath the red shield.
That's what I'm doing.
Um,

1258
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.030
yeah.
I don't know what to tell you do.
How do they do it?

1259
01:20:05.031 --> 01:20:09.570
Because the other guys running shit.
And uh,
if you can just print,

1260
01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:13.050
what would you do if you could print money,
you know,

1261
01:20:13.051 --> 01:20:16.710
and everybody accepted the money that you are printing.
I mean,
I

1262
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:22.590
could you handle that level of power.
I couldn't,
you know,

1263
01:20:22.591 --> 01:20:24.960
and what if your job depending on,
you know,

1264
01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:28.530
dependent on doing what those guys wanted you to do.

1265
01:20:28.531 --> 01:20:33.030
I mean they will right above you.
I guess you would do it right.

1266
01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:36.950
I have no idea.
You know?
That's fascinating.
That's like I said,
like those,

1267
01:20:36.990 --> 01:20:41.490
that's like one of those will Smith summer blockbuster movie kind of plots.

1268
01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:43.380
I don't know why they're voting yes on it.

1269
01:20:43.410 --> 01:20:46.620
I think some are voting yes on it because they want to keep their positions.

1270
01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:49.290
I don't think other people are voting yes on it cause they don't really

1271
01:20:49.291 --> 01:20:52.530
understand it.
Kind of like make like you just think,

1272
01:20:52.531 --> 01:20:54.570
well if we owe $1 billion,

1273
01:20:54.571 --> 01:20:58.020
why don't they just print $1 billion and just pay it off?

1274
01:20:59.070 --> 01:21:01.080
And the reason is because

1275
01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:07.880
I guess you still owe the money to the bank because the Federal Reserve

1276
01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:12.180
Princeton and you've got to pay interest on the billion dollars so you never get

1277
01:21:12.181 --> 01:21:16.490
out of debt.
I don't know.
I can't even fucking explain it anymore.

1278
01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:18.330
Probably sound like a moron,
which I am.

1279
01:21:20.010 --> 01:21:23.010
I've been reading meetings to read that book the case against the Federal

1280
01:21:23.010 --> 01:21:25.260
Reserve.
I really have been.
All right.
Question number seven.
Hey,

1281
01:21:25.261 --> 01:21:28.740
just wondering if you have a version of the aristocrats joke and what you

1282
01:21:28.741 --> 01:21:33.360
thought of that documentary pendulum made of it.
Um,
I don't think pen g,

1283
01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:37.830
I don't think Penn Jillette made that documentary.
I was a,

1284
01:21:39.570 --> 01:21:43.560
Oh my God,
it's for blank on his name was another comedian who made that.

1285
01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:46.830
Maybe I can Google it.
Um,

1286
01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:50.640
on anyways,
it's like Google this I MDB it.

1287
01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:55.680
Paul Paul Provenza,
he's the guy who made it.
Paul Provenza directed that.

1288
01:21:57.500 --> 01:22:00.480
Um,
anyways,
let me get back to the questions here.
I was like,

1289
01:22:00.481 --> 01:22:03.480
I have an incoming call.
I gotta wrap this podcast up here.
All right.

1290
01:22:03.481 --> 01:22:05.610
What did I think about,
do I have a version?

1291
01:22:05.670 --> 01:22:09.060
Do I have a version of the aristocrats jokes?
No,
I don't,

1292
01:22:09.061 --> 01:22:12.750
and I never heard of that joke until I saw the,
uh,

1293
01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:14.520
the documentary on it.

1294
01:22:14.670 --> 01:22:19.350
I bet in a lot of green rooms and in 16 years coming up on 17 years of doing

1295
01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:23.940
stand up,
I've never,
I never even heard the joke.
So,

1296
01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.220
uh,
but I thought I liked the movie.

1297
01:22:26.221 --> 01:22:30.000
I thought it was funny and Bob Saget was my favorite because he seemed to be the

1298
01:22:30.001 --> 01:22:30.834
guy.

1299
01:22:31.290 --> 01:22:35.880
Like he was improving so much that he was making himself laugh at all the filthy

1300
01:22:36.150 --> 01:22:40.950
ship that he was coming up with.
Um,
and yeah,
if you haven't seen it,

1301
01:22:40.951 --> 01:22:43.500
I would definitely rent it cause I think it's a funny,
funny documentary.

1302
01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:47.340
There you go.
And it's Paul Provenza not pendula.
All right.

1303
01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:51.090
And I didn't even look that up,
but I,
I'm pretty sure that's true.
All right.

1304
01:22:51.091 --> 01:22:51.571
Question.

1305
01:22:51.571 --> 01:22:54.900
Are you drinking again so that I can buy you a beer when you come to Tampa?
Yes,

1306
01:22:54.901 --> 01:22:59.130
I am.
I am drinking again.
That's the name of my neck.
Stand up.

1307
01:22:59.131 --> 01:23:00.750
Special Bill bird drinking again.

1308
01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:04.770
I'm going to come on stage completely shit face and just fucking berate people.

1309
01:23:05.410 --> 01:23:08.740
I'm glad to see that you're finally coming by the way.

1310
01:23:08.741 --> 01:23:13.330
And what better time than January.
Well,
what happens in Tampa in January?

1311
01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:18.070
I guess I'm getting out of the winter.
Um,
alright.
Overrated.
Underrated.

1312
01:23:18.071 --> 01:23:21.430
Before I wrap up this podcast,
overrated.
Barack Obama.
Seriously,

1313
01:23:21.431 --> 01:23:24.820
the guy was senator for two years and he hasn't even taken office yet.

1314
01:23:25.150 --> 01:23:28.210
And people think he's the second coming.
I'm not hating on the man,

1315
01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:31.090
but I'm not ready to worship him yet.
Um,

1316
01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:34.990
well I think a lot of it has to do with,
uh,
you know,

1317
01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:38.530
just the last eight years have been a little rough without getting too
political,

1318
01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:40.480
you know,
I mean,

1319
01:23:40.481 --> 01:23:43.630
George Bush literally should have been doing speeches with a flashlight under

1320
01:23:43.631 --> 01:23:44.170
his chin.

1321
01:23:44.170 --> 01:23:47.500
He was so busy scaring the shit out of people for the last eight fucking years.

1322
01:23:47.890 --> 01:23:52.210
I think it's just going to be a relief to have somebody come in,
uh,

1323
01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:56.980
you know,
Jesus Christ.
Just somebody different,
somebody different.

1324
01:23:56.981 --> 01:24:00.460
But yeah,
I mean,
then then will do this,
you know,
just feel good thing.
Yeah.

1325
01:24:00.461 --> 01:24:01.720
We elected a black guy.

1326
01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:07.120
That means we're not as ugly a country as we were before.
You know,

1327
01:24:07.930 --> 01:24:08.763
I don't know.

1328
01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:12.190
I think everybody's life is in the shitter and they're just hoping that somebody

1329
01:24:12.191 --> 01:24:14.950
can do something.
But I definitely agree with you.

1330
01:24:14.951 --> 01:24:18.550
If you're waiting for one guy to take that office and to turn your life around

1331
01:24:18.551 --> 01:24:22.420
you,
uh,
you know,
it's kind of like when I get in this business,

1332
01:24:22.421 --> 01:24:24.370
you get a manager and an agent,
you're like,
well,

1333
01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:27.550
I guess I don't need to do any more work.
They just going to bring shit to me.

1334
01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:31.180
It doesn't work that way.
All right.
Underrated.
Playoff hockey.

1335
01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:32.920
Every round is so fucking intense.

1336
01:24:33.850 --> 01:24:37.240
And the fact that they play a seven game series makes the drama in the bad blood

1337
01:24:37.710 --> 01:24:40.120
continued for one game to the next.
Uh,

1338
01:24:40.121 --> 01:24:44.920
I would definitely say that I think the NHL package is underrated.

1339
01:24:44.921 --> 01:24:49.060
I have that.
Here's the last one and then I'm wrapping this up for this week.

1340
01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:53.800
Um,
overrated.
I love this one.
This is such a great one.
Overrated.

1341
01:24:53.801 --> 01:24:58.120
First Impressions.
Uh,
my first impressions are wrong.

1342
01:24:58.121 --> 01:25:02.260
Most of the time,
society needs to drop the significance of first impression.

1343
01:25:02.770 --> 01:25:05.390
There goes,
there goes me generalizing.
Maybe I'm,

1344
01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:10.150
I just have horrible judgment.
Now you don't,
I think that's great.
Yeah.

1345
01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:14.140
My first impressions are mostly wrong and people's first impressions of me,

1346
01:25:14.141 --> 01:25:18.790
a lot of times they're wrong.
Um,
I think they are.
Oh,

1347
01:25:18.791 --> 01:25:22.450
my girlfriend stared at me right now.
Like,
bullshit.
You know,
I fuck you.

1348
01:25:22.451 --> 01:25:26.980
It's true.
This is a deal.
You know what?
This is what,
this is what I found.

1349
01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:32.140
If you're a quiet person and you meet an in a,

1350
01:25:32.590 --> 01:25:34.330
uh,
an insecure person,

1351
01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:37.780
they misinterpret your quietness for arrogance and they start thinking,

1352
01:25:37.781 --> 01:25:40.720
this guy thinks he's fucking better than me,
then they think you're a Douche bag.

1353
01:25:40.990 --> 01:25:45.310
That's what people used to think of me before I became a loud mouth asshole and

1354
01:25:45.311 --> 01:25:49.570
removed all doubt that I am an arrogant cunt.
But a lot of shy people,

1355
01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:54.580
lot of people considered arrogant on are not arrogant.
They're fucking,
you know,

1356
01:25:55.870 --> 01:25:56.920
they're doing what I'm doing.

1357
01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:59.860
They're being quiet because they're questioning everything they did in the last

1358
01:25:59.861 --> 01:26:03.560
17 minutes.
I don't know if that even makes sense,

1359
01:26:03.561 --> 01:26:05.750
but I definitely think that's true because I've,
you know,

1360
01:26:06.110 --> 01:26:09.980
there's a number of people I thought were dicks when I first met him and it

1361
01:26:09.981 --> 01:26:11.360
turned out that I was the Dick.

1362
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:14.350
And then there's been other people I've been like,
you know,

1363
01:26:14.530 --> 01:26:17.540
this guy's a cool fucking guy.
He's a real cool guy.

1364
01:26:17.541 --> 01:26:22.010
And then they turn out to be a complete psycho.
So,
uh,
I dunno,

1365
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:24.260
I dunno what to tell you what that,

1366
01:26:24.261 --> 01:26:26.330
that's like that thing where would for every saying,

1367
01:26:26.331 --> 01:26:29.180
there's another saying that can fucking cancel it out.

1368
01:26:29.181 --> 01:26:31.850
Penny saved is a penny earned.
You've got to spend money to make money,

1369
01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:36.410
walk softly,
carry a big stick greasy wheel.
The squeaky wheel gets the grease,

1370
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:40.250
you know what I mean?
Does that even make sense?
I don't fucking know.

1371
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:44.180
Cause yeah,
your first impressions,
you know,
your mind might be wrong,

1372
01:26:44.181 --> 01:26:47.720
but then you gotta go with your gut.
You know,

1373
01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:49.820
that gut that says,
ah,

1374
01:26:50.570 --> 01:26:53.870
I shouldn't turn this trick because I think this person's going to snap my neck.

1375
01:26:53.930 --> 01:26:56.810
You know,
it's the prostitute that listens to that.

1376
01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:00.560
They're the ones they get to continue living the dream of sucking cock until

1377
01:27:00.561 --> 01:27:02.350
they're 55,
you know,

1378
01:27:03.150 --> 01:27:06.800
and finally having enough money to get out from underneath their pimp to go to

1379
01:27:06.801 --> 01:27:09.260
night school.
Those are the ones because they listened to that guy.

1380
01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:10.430
But I got admit,
yeah,

1381
01:27:10.490 --> 01:27:13.040
I would have to go with you on the first day that I mentioned I bought a

1382
01:27:13.041 --> 01:27:17.570
Credenza.
Can you believe that it's most adult thing I ever did.

1383
01:27:17.630 --> 01:27:20.540
I like looking at him pretending like I have some sort of official business to

1384
01:27:20.541 --> 01:27:25.130
do.
Um,
okay.
That's it.
And uh,
other than that,

1385
01:27:26.090 --> 01:27:30.230
um,
what do I got?
I got
Caroline Caroline's coming up this week.

1386
01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:31.850
I've got a brand new hour for you,

1387
01:27:31.851 --> 01:27:35.900
so all you bastards who are still full of Turkey,
um,

1388
01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:39.040
hit the fucking treadmill and come down to the club.
I've got a brand new hours,

1389
01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:42.740
shit that I'm really proud of and I'm putting it together and hopefully I'll be

1390
01:27:42.741 --> 01:27:47.741
taping another special next year so I can get on this doing a special every two,

1391
01:27:47.991 --> 01:27:49.130
two and a half years.

1392
01:27:49.670 --> 01:27:52.610
So I can have some sort of body of work at the end of this shit.

1393
01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:56.270
But I will not take any special before its time.

1394
01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:02.210
What fucking what a,
what?
Advertise.
And we will serve no wine before it's time.

1395
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:06.860
Fuck was that.
I can't remember.
Anyways,
that's it.

1396
01:28:06.861 --> 01:28:09.100
Everybody have a good witch and,
uh,

1397
01:28:09.170 --> 01:28:12.290
keep the podcast questions coming and people keep asking me if I'm going to be

1398
01:28:12.291 --> 01:28:16.400
on Facebook.
Um,
I like my space,
you know what I mean?

1399
01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:19.580
I,
you know,
I like,
I gotta be loyal somewhere in my life.

1400
01:28:19.581 --> 01:28:23.870
I'm sticking it out with these fucking guys.
And,
uh,
you know,

1401
01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:26.260
I'm going to go through a couple of rough years with my space when,

1402
01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:28.340
when we looking like I'm still wearing bell bottoms,

1403
01:28:28.670 --> 01:28:32.480
but eventually it's gonna come back in style again and you guys can all be like,

1404
01:28:32.481 --> 01:28:36.770
oh yeah man,
I'm fucking back on my space again.
And I'd be like,

1405
01:28:36.771 --> 01:28:39.110
Oh yeah man.
Well I never fucking left.

1406
01:28:39.410 --> 01:28:43.040
So that means I'm cooler than you and that'll make me feel good for six minutes

1407
01:28:43.041 --> 01:28:45.650
before it become miserable again.
All right everybody,

1408
01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:48.800
thank you so much for listening to the podcast.
I hope you all have a great week.

1409
01:28:48.801 --> 01:28:52.370
Thanks again to Michael Hanes for letting me sit in on the ass game.
Sorry,

1410
01:28:52.371 --> 01:28:56.570
didn't thank you last week.
I fucking space cause I'm a moron.
And uh,

1411
01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:59.270
how about those Bruins?
Any hockey fans out there?

1412
01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:01.650
Any Canadian out there?

1413
01:29:01.651 --> 01:29:04.560
How can we not talking to any shit you like those two watts as you took it,

1414
01:29:04.561 --> 01:29:08.250
the hands and the Bruins this month.
How are you singing?
Jackasses

1415
01:29:10.230 --> 01:29:13.260
got damn at the fucking,
you got to respect the Canadians though.

1416
01:29:13.410 --> 01:29:15.780
I saw him the other night come back against the Buffalo Sabres,

1417
01:29:15.870 --> 01:29:18.450
those sons of bitches,
those fucking people start singing.

1418
01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:22.230
It's like gladiator and all of a sudden though does,

1419
01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:25.140
if they start skating faster and then you just know they're going to score that

1420
01:29:25.141 --> 01:29:28.050
goal to fucking tie it up every goddamn time.

1421
01:29:28.050 --> 01:29:32.040
It's like watching Derek Jeter didn't guy on tying runs on second,

1422
01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:35.610
you know he's going to slap it a right.
He's going to go the other way with it.

1423
01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:36.780
He's going to hit a double,

1424
01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:40.020
you know he's actually gonna do okay for all you fucking American League

1425
01:29:40.021 --> 01:29:43.790
pitchers.
He's going to look for fast ball.
The first pitch.
That's what he does.

1426
01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:46.920
He tries to pull it every fucking time in that situation.

1427
01:29:47.070 --> 01:29:50.970
That's what he looks for.
Okay?
But then if you give it to him out over the plate,

1428
01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:54.570
he'll take what he gives you and then he slaps it to right field.
All right,

1429
01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:58.920
so why don't you throw a high fucking inside fast ball that the bottom drops out

1430
01:29:58.921 --> 01:30:02.310
of and at least get strike one on the fuck.
Can you please do that?

1431
01:30:04.290 --> 01:30:08.390
Okay.
Sorry.
Let's get a little upset there.
I actually,
you know,
next time I go,

1432
01:30:08.490 --> 01:30:09.510
you know,
when I'm in New York,

1433
01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:14.130
if you're a Yankee fan and he'd come out to my Carolyn's show,
uh,

1434
01:30:14.190 --> 01:30:19.190
if you want to see my impression of Derek Jeter at taking a strike right down

1435
01:30:20.221 --> 01:30:24.300
the center of the plate,
if you want me to do that impression,
um,

1436
01:30:25.110 --> 01:30:28.020
just yell out during the show.
I'm actually encouraging people to heckle me.

1437
01:30:28.050 --> 01:30:30.210
What am I doing or whatever.
After the show,

1438
01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:35.480
I'll give you my impression of Derek Jeter at bat standing there that does not

1439
01:30:37.381 --> 01:30:41.070
move off the shoulder and it's a strike right down the center of the plate.

1440
01:30:41.071 --> 01:30:43.770
Without a fucking doubt,
it is a strike.

1441
01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:46.800
A goddamn moron could call it a strike.

1442
01:30:46.801 --> 01:30:51.801
I will do my impression of his body language taking strike right down the plate.

1443
01:30:51.991 --> 01:30:54.690
How many different times you're going to explain it.
All right,
I'm done.

1444
01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:55.773
Have a great [inaudible]

1445
01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:56.993
<v 3>take any,</v>

1446
01:31:04.330 --> 01:31:05.163
so

1447
01:31:27.870 --> 01:31:28.703
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1448
01:31:59.930 --> 01:31:59.930
[inaudible].
