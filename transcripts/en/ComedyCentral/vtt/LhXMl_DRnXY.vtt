WE GO TO ATLANTA, A
MAJOR TEACHING SCANDAL THAT

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:05.738 size:81% position:41% line:91%
LUCKILY FOR ONCE DOES NOT
INVOLVE ANY WEIRD UNDERAGE

00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:10.977 align:start position:0%
SEX-TYPE STUFF.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.414 size:78% position:39% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NEARLY A DOZEN FORMER
EDUCATORS WERE CONVICT OF

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:17.150 line:91%
RACKETEERING AND OTHER CHARGES
FOR THEIR PART IN ONE OF THE

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:18.384 align:start position:0% line:91%
NATION'S BIGGEST
CHEATING SCANDALS.

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:23.289 line:91%
&gt;&gt; INFLATING THE TEST SCORES OF
SOME OF THEIR MOST VULNERABLE

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:24.457 align:start position:0% line:91%
STUDENTS TO PROTECT THEIR OWN
JOBS AND THEIR PAYCHECKS.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.658 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THEY WERE GOING BACK AND
CORRECTING THE WRONG ANSWERS.

00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:29.295 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S, LIKE, THE SICKEST THING
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO THIS

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:30.162 align:start position:0% line:85%
TOWN.

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:36.169 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Jon:  YOU'RE-- YOU KNOW,

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:38.838 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU LIVE IN ATLANTA.

00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:42.241 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
SO I GUESS, YOU KNOW, EXCLUDING

00:00:42.274 --> 00:00:46.212 size:84% position:42% line:91%
SLAVERY AND YOUR CITY BEING
BURNED TO THE GROUND, AND

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:53.453 line:91%
SEGREGATION AND NOTORIOUS SERIAL
KILLER AND THE OLYMPIC BOMBING.

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:54.954 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
AND CNN.

00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:57.557 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
BUT, YOU KNOW, STILL. SICK.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.896 align:start position:0% line:91%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SICK. SICK. SICK.

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.732 line:91%
CLEARLY, WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A
WIDESPREAD CHEATING SCANDAL,

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:07.933 align:start position:0% line:85%
FRAUD.

00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:12.105 line:91%
BY WHY DO THE PARTICULARS OF
THIS GRADE INFLATION SCANDAL

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:13.339 size:75% position:38% line:85%
SOUND SO FAMILIAR TO ME?

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:16.742 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE COMPANIES REPEATEDLY GAVE
A.A.A. RATINGS TO INVESTMENTS

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:21.347 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY KNEW INCLUDED RISKY
SUBPRIME LOANS.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.152 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  I JUST CANNOT PLACE
WHERE I HAVE EXTENSIVELY HEARD

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:30.623 line:91%
ABOUT SYSTEMIC, JUST FLAT-OUT
FALSIFYING OF INFORMATION AND

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:31.791 align:start position:0% line:85%
CHEATING.

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:34.494 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LOAN OFFICERS WOULD FALSIFY
CUSTOMERS' JOB OR FINANCIAL

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:36.229 size:78% position:39% line:91%
INFORMATION SO THEY COULD
QUALIFY FOR MORTGAGES.

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:40.700 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE PATTERN OF INFLATED
APPRAISALS AND EMPLOYEES

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.301 size:81% position:41% line:85%
COACHING BORROWERS TO LIE.

00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:44.770 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  IT WILL COME TO
ME...

00:01:44.803 --> 00:01:50.610 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT... WHERE,

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:52.245 size:75% position:38% line:85%
PINK FLOYD'S "THE WALL."

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.413 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT HAS TO
DO --

00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:55.948 align:start position:0% line:85%
MERYL STREEP?

00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:57.283 align:start position:0% line:85%
MINUS A "P."

00:01:57.316 --> 00:01:59.085 align:start position:0% line:85%
PLUS A CUP OF TEA.

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:05.024 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DON'T -- WALL STREET-- WALL
STREET!

00:02:05.057 --> 00:02:05.791 align:start position:0% line:85%
OH!

00:02:05.824 --> 00:02:08.528 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT'S WALL STREET!

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:11.531 align:start position:0% line:85%
SON OF A BITCH!

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:14.934 line:91%
ARE THERE ANALOGOUS REFERENCE
POINTS BETWEEN THE ATLANTA

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:18.905 align:start position:0% line:91%
CHEATING SCANDAL AND THE
WALL STREET MELTDOWN?

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:20.106 align:start position:0% line:85%
HMMM.

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:24.076 align:start position:0% line:91%
TELL ME AGAIN, WHAT WAS THE
ACTUAL FRAUD COMMITTED IN EACH?

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:29.115 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; EDUCATORS GAVE STUDENT
ANSWERS.

00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:32.718 line:91%
&gt;&gt; COOK COUNTRYWIDE LOAN OFFICER
TOLD HER TO CLAIM SHE MADE MORE

00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:34.820 line:85%
THAN TWICE HER ACTUAL INCOME.

00:02:34.853 --> 00:02:38.958 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  SO, BOTH FALSIFIED
INFORMATION.

00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:43.496 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; TEST ANSWER SHEETS WERE
ALTERED, FABRICATED AND FALSELY

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:44.730 align:start position:0% line:85%
CERTIFIED.

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:48.901 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I SAW PEOPLE ALTER W2s AND
ALTER PAYSTUBS TO MAKE IT APPEAR

00:02:48.934 --> 00:02:53.306 align:start position:0% line:91%
AS IF PEOPLE MADE MORE MONEY TO
QUALIFY FOR A LOAN.

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:54.941 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: MOTHER ( BLEEP ).

00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:56.676 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY.

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.880 align:start position:0% line:91%
AN ELABORATE PURPOSEFUL SYSTEMIC
CULTURE OF FALSIFIED

00:03:00.913 --> 00:03:01.981 align:start position:0% line:85%
INFORMATION.

00:03:02.014 --> 00:03:02.448 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO, ALL RIGHT, LACK OF ETHICAL
LIMITS, COACHED ANSWERS,

00:03:02.481 --> 00:03:04.650 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALTERED DOCUMENTS.

00:03:04.683 --> 00:03:06.152 align:start position:0% line:91%
SOUNDS LIKE PRETTY SIMILAR
BEHAVIOR.

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:09.789 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT WHY DID SCHOOLS AND
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TAKE

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:10.890 align:start position:0% line:85%
THESE SHORTCUTS?

00:03:10.923 --> 00:03:14.193 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ATLANTA EDUCATORS COULD
RECEIVE BONUSES WHEN STUDENT

00:03:14.226 --> 00:03:15.194 align:start position:0% line:85%
PERFORMANCE IMPROVES.

00:03:15.227 --> 00:03:19.599 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LOAN OFFICERS RECEIVED
BONUSES, COMMISSIONS.

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:22.368 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  PERSONAL
ENRICHMENT, INCENTIVIZE FOR

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:23.736 align:start position:0% line:85%
PERSONAL ENRICHMENT.

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.938 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND WHY WAS THIS CULTURE OF
FRAUD NOT STOPPED?

00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:30.743 line:91%
&gt;&gt; EDUCATORS WHO TRIED TO REPORT
THE CHEATING FACED A CULTURE OF

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:32.044 align:start position:0% line:85%
FEAR AND INTIMIDATION.

00:03:32.077 --> 00:03:33.646 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THERE WERE THREATS AND
INTIMIDATION.

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:35.748 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT KINDS OF THREATS ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT?

00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:37.550 size:88% position:44% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YOUR TIRES WOULD BE FLAT.

00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:39.051 size:88% position:44% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YOUR TIRES WOULD BE FLAT?

00:03:39.084 --> 00:03:39.919 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:03:39.952 --> 00:03:43.189 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Jon:  IN NEW JERSEY,

00:03:43.222 --> 00:03:45.858 line:85%
THAT'S CONSIDERED A COMPLIMENT.

00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:46.992 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:50.229 size:88% position:44% line:91%
I GOTTA SAY MORTGAGE LENDER
INTIMIDATION IS PRETTY WEAK.

00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:52.732 line:91%
SOMETIMES I WOULD BRING YOGURT
TO THE OFFICE, AND CHAD WOULD

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:56.535 align:start position:0% line:91%
EAT IT, EVEN THOUGH IT HAD
MY NAME ON IT.

00:03:56.568 --> 00:03:58.070 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO MANY EERIE SIMILARITIES,
THOUGH.

00:03:58.103 --> 00:04:01.574 line:91%
IT'S SORT OF HOW LINCOLN HAD A
SECRETARY NAMED IT KENNEDY AND

00:04:01.607 --> 00:04:05.911 align:start position:0% line:91%
KENNEDY BANGED HIS SECRETARY IN
THE BACK OF A LINCOLN.

00:04:05.944 --> 00:04:06.945 align:start position:0% line:85%
( LAUGHTER )

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:07.746 align:start position:0% line:91%
OR SOMETHING LIKE -- ANYWAY,
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:10.182 align:start position:0% line:91%
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO
STORIES.

00:04:10.215 --> 00:04:11.517 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT COULD IT BE?

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.887 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THREE DISGRACED EDUCATORS,
FORMER TEACHERS AND

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.089 align:start position:0% line:91%
ADMINISTRATORS, WERE SENTENCED
TO 20 YEARS.

00:04:17.122 --> 00:04:20.026 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE OTHERS, INCLUDING A
PRINCIPAL AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:23.829 align:start position:0% line:91%
TEACHERS, WERE SENTENCED TO FIVE
YEARS, SERVING ONE TO TWO OF

00:04:23.862 --> 00:04:24.964 align:start position:0% line:85%
THEM BEHIND BARS.

00:04:24.997 --> 00:04:26.732 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  ALL RIGHT.

00:04:26.765 --> 00:04:27.866 align:start position:0% line:85%
AND?

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.569 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; A RECENT "NEW YORK TIMES
MAGAZINE" STORY FOUND THAT 

00:04:30.602 --> 00:04:35.574 line:91%
ONLY ONE PROSECUTION RELATING TO
THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS LED TO

00:04:35.607 --> 00:04:37.677 size:84% position:42% line:85%
A CONVICTION AND JAIL TIME.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.713 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  I THINK I FOUND
THE DIFFERENCE.

00:04:40.746 --> 00:04:42.682 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
PUNISHMENT!

00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:46.585 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE TEACHERS AND SCHOOL
ADMINISTRATORS ARE GOING TO BE

00:04:46.618 --> 00:04:51.924 align:start position:0% line:91%
PUNISHED WITH JAIL TIME, OR WHAT
THEY MIGHT KNOW AS DETENTION

00:04:51.957 --> 00:04:53.893 align:start position:0% line:85%
EXTREME RULES.

00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:56.896 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
WHEREAS THE ENTIRE FINANCIAL

00:04:56.929 --> 00:05:01.067 align:start position:0% line:91%
SECTOR IS TIED, JAIL
TERM-WISE, WITH THE ECONOMY'S

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.638 align:start position:0% line:91%
EQUALLY CRITICAL "REAL
HOUSEWIVES OF NEW JERSEY"

00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:06.472 align:start position:0% line:85%
SECTOR.

00:05:06.505 --> 00:05:08.140 align:start position:0% line:91%
OH, ACTUALLY, THEY'RE BEHIND, 2
TO 1.

00:05:08.173 --> 00:05:12.511 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO WHY DID THE TEACHERS RECEIVE
JAIL TIME AND THE FINANCIAL

00:05:12.544 --> 00:05:13.979 align:start position:0% line:85%
INSTITUTIONS FINES?

00:05:14.012 --> 00:05:18.150 line:91%
PERHAPS THIS NUGGET IN THE JUDGE
WHO SENTENCED THE TEACHERS WILL

00:05:18.183 --> 00:05:19.351 align:start position:0% line:85%
SHED LIGHT.

00:05:19.384 --> 00:05:23.022 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ALL I WANT FROM ANY OF THESE
PEOPLE IS JUST TO TAKE SOME

00:05:23.055 --> 00:05:23.856 align:start position:0% line:85%
RESPONSIBILITY.

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.726 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THE TEACHERS WERE
REMORSELESS.

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:29.962 size:88% position:44% line:91%
THEY WERE CHEATERS WHO WOULD
NEVER ADMIT TO WRONGDOING.

00:05:29.995 --> 00:05:31.330 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S THE CONTRAST.

00:05:31.363 --> 00:05:39.939 line:91%
AT LEAST THOSE WHOSE FINANCIAL
CRIMES NEARLY BROKE THE EARTH--

00:05:39.972 --> 00:05:41.007 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
WERE REMORSEFUL.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.045 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE STATES REACHED A $325
MILLION SETTLEMENT WITH

00:05:46.078 --> 00:05:46.979 align:start position:0% line:85%
AMERIQUEST.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.949 align:start position:0% line:91%
AMERIQUEST NEVER ADMITTED TO ANY
WRONGDOING.

00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:53.152 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; U.B.S. DID NOT ADMIT ANY
WRONGDOING.

00:05:53.185 --> 00:05:55.388 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; MORGAN STANLEY ISN'T
ADMITTING TO ANY WRONGDOING.

00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:58.257 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; GOLDMAN SACHS WILL NOT ADMIT
ANY WRONGDOING.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.827 size:78% position:39% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BANK OF AMERICA IS NOT
ADMITTING ANY WRONGDOING.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.399 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  WHO PAYS $300
MILLION AND DOESN'T ADMIT

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:07.600 align:start position:0% line:85%
WRONGDOING?

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:09.869 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO THE THE NINE-FIGURE CASH
SETTLEMENT IS NOT SO MUCH A FINE

00:06:09.902 --> 00:06:12.938 size:78% position:39% line:91%
AS IT IS, WHAT, A LITTLE
SOMETHING FOR THE JUSTICE

00:06:12.971 --> 00:06:15.841 align:start position:0% line:91%
DEPARTMENT FOR LOOKING THE OTHER
WAY?

00:06:15.874 --> 00:06:18.677 line:91%
GOOD THING JUSTICE IS BLIND
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS WHAT'S GOOD

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.580 align:start position:0% line:85%
FOR HER, HA, HA.

00:06:21.613 --> 00:06:23.482 align:start size:91% position:9% line:91%
HERE'S WHAT, SHE KNOWS SHE
DIDN'T SEE NOTHING.

00:06:23.515 --> 00:06:26.952 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
SO AT THE END OF ALL THIS, YOU
HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHAT

00:06:26.985 --> 00:06:27.452 size:75% position:38% line:91%
IS THIS HARSH PUNISHMENT
FOR ATLANTA'S EDUCATORS

00:06:27.486 --> 00:06:29.688 align:start position:0%
MEANT TO ACCOMPLISH.

00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:33.025 line:91%
&gt;&gt; MY HOPE IS THAT THIS VERDICT
WHICH SHOWS SOME ACCOUNTABILITY

00:06:33.058 --> 00:06:34.193 size:88% position:44% line:85%
WILL SEND A SERIOUS MESSAGE.

00:06:34.226 --> 00:06:37.563 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  AND WHAT DID THE
LESS-HARSH PUNISHMENTS FOR WALL

00:06:37.596 --> 00:06:38.564 align:start position:0% line:85%
STREET ACCOMPLISH?

00:06:38.597 --> 00:06:42.435 size:75% position:38% line:91%
&gt;&gt; A FEW YEARS AFTER THE
MELTDOWN THAT IT'S STILL

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:43.035 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUSINESS AS USUAL INSIDE SOME OF
THESE WALL STREET BANKS.

00:06:43.068 --> 00:06:44.103 line:85%
&gt;&gt; I KNOW.

00:06:44.136 --> 00:06:46.272 size:78% position:39% line:91%
