00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.269
well first thing is that we've collected

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:06.279
well first thing is that we've collected
 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:09.360
well first thing is that we've collected
a huge amount of data and we've curated

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.370
a huge amount of data and we've curated
 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.090
a huge amount of data and we've curated
this data so it's it's data where we've

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.100
this data so it's it's data where we've
 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.650
this data so it's it's data where we've
gone typically to sort of primary

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660
gone typically to sort of primary
 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.439
gone typically to sort of primary
sources of data and made arrangements to

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:16.449
sources of data and made arrangements to
 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.679
sources of data and made arrangements to
get either the static data or a feed of

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689
get either the static data or a feed of
 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.630
get either the static data or a feed of
data that comes in every minute every

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640
data that comes in every minute every
 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.479
data that comes in every minute every
second every hour whatever and we've

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:24.489
second every hour whatever and we've
 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:27.179
second every hour whatever and we've
organized this data so that it's sort of

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189
organized this data so that it's sort of
 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.460
organized this data so that it's sort of
set up to be clean and computable so

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470
set up to be clean and computable so
 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.689
set up to be clean and computable so
that's sort of the first component is

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699
that's sort of the first component is
 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.819
that's sort of the first component is
all this data that exists in the system

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829
all this data that exists in the system
 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.500
all this data that exists in the system
whether it's about chemicals or

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510
whether it's about chemicals or
 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.660
whether it's about chemicals or
countries or foods or or nuclear

the right expert what we've tried to do

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860
the right expert what we've tried to do
 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.900
the right expert what we've tried to do
is to actually accumulate all of the all

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910
is to actually accumulate all of the all
 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.490
is to actually accumulate all of the all
of the algorithms necessary to do those

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500

computations typically that's done by
 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.920
computations typically that's done by
talking to the world's experts in these

that we get in the form of algorithms
well then another aspect of this is so

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630
well then another aspect of this is so
 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.360
well then another aspect of this is so
it's okay so we know all the stuff we

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370
it's okay so we know all the stuff we
 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.490
it's okay so we know all the stuff we
can compute all these things how does a

alpha how do they communicate with it so
 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.300
alpha how do they communicate with it so
that's then another big challenge is to

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310
that's then another big challenge is to
 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.580
that's then another big challenge is to

to automatically understand that and
 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.820
to automatically understand that and
that's something that wasn't clear

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830
that's something that wasn't clear
 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.260
that's something that wasn't clear

language processing with computer
 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.110
language processing with computer
for decades and there's only been sort

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120
for decades and there's only been sort
 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.580
for decades and there's only been sort
of slow progress in that in general

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590
of slow progress in that in general
 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.350

turned out the problem we had to solve a
 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.120
turned out the problem we had to solve a

understand this our problem was we can

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470
understand this our problem was we can
 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.590
understand this our problem was we can
compute a certain set of things and then

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600
compute a certain set of things and then
 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.480
compute a certain set of things and then
were given this very short sort of

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490
were given this very short sort of
 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.730
were given this very short sort of
utterance that the human has fed us and

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740
utterance that the human has fed us and
 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.650
utterance that the human has fed us and
we have to ask the question can we

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660
we have to ask the question can we
 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.930
we have to ask the question can we
understand that utterance and map it

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940
understand that utterance and map it
 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.180
understand that utterance and map it
into the things that we can compute so

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190
into the things that we can compute so
 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.100
into the things that we can compute so
it's turned out somewhat to my surprise

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110
it's turned out somewhat to my surprise
 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.740
it's turned out somewhat to my surprise
actually that we've been able using a

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750
actually that we've been able using a
 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.360
actually that we've been able using a
bunch of ideas about sort of

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370
bunch of ideas about sort of
 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.880
bunch of ideas about sort of
computational linguistics and so on to

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890
computational linguistics and so on to
 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.100
computational linguistics and so on to
make really great progress in being able

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110
make really great progress in being able
 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.930
make really great progress in being able
to let one sort of type in things in

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940
to let one sort of type in things in
 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.000
to let one sort of type in things in
whatever form on first thinks of them

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010
whatever form on first thinks of them
 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.470
whatever form on first thinks of them
and having the computer understand them

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480
and having the computer understand them
 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.560
and having the computer understand them
and then finally one has to figure out

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570
and then finally one has to figure out
 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.940
and then finally one has to figure out
so they're all these things we can

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950
so they're all these things we can
 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.080
so they're all these things we can
compute we've understood the question

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090
compute we've understood the question
 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.450
compute we've understood the question
that's been asked there's all sorts of

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460
that's been asked there's all sorts of
 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.190
that's been asked there's all sorts of
things that we can give us the answer

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200
things that we can give us the answer
 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.320
things that we can give us the answer
which parts of the things that we might

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330
which parts of the things that we might
 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.550
which parts of the things that we might
give us the answer should we actually

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560
give us the answer should we actually
 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.680
give us the answer should we actually
present how do we sort of present the

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690
present how do we sort of present the
 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.470
present how do we sort of present the
right graphical tabular and so on

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480
right graphical tabular and so on
 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.260
right graphical tabular and so on
results to actually communicate in an

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270
results to actually communicate in an
 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.030
results to actually communicate in an
effective way with with humans who are

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040
effective way with with humans who are
 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.930
