- Welcome to a Conversation
With History, I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.310
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.980
Our guest today is Theda Skocpol,

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.420
who is the Victor S. Thomas
professor of government,

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.080
and sociology at Harvard University.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.760
And her two recent books are

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.830
Obama and America's Political Future

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.640
and The Tea Party And The Remaking

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.640
Of Republican Conservatism
written with Vanessa Williamson.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.700
Theda, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.980
- It's very nice to be here.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.050
- [Harry] Where were you born and raised?

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.650
- I was born in Detroit, Michigan.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.190
Grew up in an industrial
town south of Detroit

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.080
Wyandotte, Michigan, where my father

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.320
was a high school teacher
of business education,

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.020
my mother a homemaker.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.510
My grandparents on both sides
also grew up in Michigan,

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.690
Western Michigan, in Okemos.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.410
- And looking back, how do
you think your your family

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.160
and especially your parents,
influenced your thinking

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.133
about the world?

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.780
- Well, my father Alan Barron
loved American history,

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.690
so I'm sure that I got some of
my interest in America's past

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.003
and American politics and the civil war

00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:11.040
because he was a civil war buff from him.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.840
My mother was a homemaker and they both

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.080
stressed the value of education of course.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.640
- And was there a lot of
discussion about political events

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.560
and politics around the dinner table?

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.380
- You know, my dad was
the one who did that.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.110
I remember walking with
him to junior high one day

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.570
and he explained to me
Keynesian economics,

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.550
so he explained how it
works, so I learned early on

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.250
that a family budget and a national budget

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.400
are not the same thing.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.176
My mother not so much engaged in politics.

00:02:45.176 --> 00:02:50.176
- And any teachers or
events that affected you

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.380
when you, before you went to college

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.630
that pointed you in the
direction of an interest

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.630
in political sociology?

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.650
- Well, I certainly loved my teachers.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.210
I was an all A student,

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.750
which was not a very popular thing

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.253
for a girl in Michigan to be
at that time, a young girl.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.320
When I got to college I got involved

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.770
in the civil rights movement
and that had a big impact.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.930
I went to Mississippi with
a church based program

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.840
and that's where I met my
future husband Bill Skocpol.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.010
- And what did you major
in as an undergraduate

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.460
and then how did this political activism

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.160
impact your education?

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.270
- Well, I was a Merit Scholar
at Michigan State University,

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.500
which meant that I was invited very early

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.000
to be part of the Honors College there

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.770
and that was a good thing
because for one thing

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.720
it let me meet very smart fellow students

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.470
from all over the country
and it gave me freedom

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.200
to put my courses together as I wanted.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.640
I majored in sociology, but
partly because it was open

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.740
it would allow me to do lots of things.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.330
I studied French literature,
I studied anthropology,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.913
just whatever I wanted,

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.580
so I think that was a very
important that openness.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.560
And the other part of it
was that it was the time

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.840
of the Vietnam War and
the civil rights struggles

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.536
and I got involved in
protests and demonstrations

00:04:17.536 --> 00:04:20.520
and constructive activism
in all those areas.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.360
- And what did you learn from that

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.610
other than the issues themselves,

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.720
you know that the war was wrong

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.720
and that civil rights
needed to be changed?

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.290
- Well, I learned the
value of getting engaged

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.910
with other people.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.100
I think the the anti-war
movement went over the edge

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.330
and I did not go with it when
it went into violent protests.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.300
But the trip to Mississippi
was formative because we

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.230
was a Methodist sponsored student project

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.330
where Michigan State students
went to a black college,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.300
Russ College, and taught incoming freshmen

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.050
English and math skills, so I
learned kind of the marriage

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.963
of civic activism and
education I think from that.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.570
- What about the women's movement?

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.420
How did that affect you?

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.340
By the time I got to graduate school

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.120
that was an important factor

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.410
and I remember getting
together with other women

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.820
in the sociology department
at Harvard University

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.920
to ask why it was that there
were so many women students

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.330
over the years, but none
of them became professors.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.300
And so we definitely raised the issues

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.980
and I became one of the first women

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.280
appointed to the sociology
department at Harvard

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.820
after I got my PhD.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.550
- And that was controversial.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.030
I mean you were you were
a path breaker there.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.790
- Well, I was a path
breaker just being appointed

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.540
and then a few years later
when I was denied tenure

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.870
after winning all the top
prizes in my discipline,

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.100
I filed a grievance about
that, not a legal case,

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.810
but a grievance and
that eventually resulted

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.750
in my appointment to tenure at Harvard.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.250
That was certainly controversial,

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.790
but I would say that the side of me

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.203
that came out there
was sheer stubbornness.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.370
I knew that I had done
what needed to be done

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.240
and I was I just simply hung in there

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.840
and insisted on being treated equally.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.050
- Let's go back to your
graduate school education.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.350
So you you were in sociology
and who did you work under

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.480
and what was your dissertation on?

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.770
- I ended up working
with Barrington Moore,

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.610
who's one of the giants of comparative

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.963
historical political sociology.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.100
That was really a extraordinary experience

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.630
because he was a rigorous,
a demanding teacher

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.010
who asked you to write
papers that actually compared

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.720
big developments in different countries

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.060
across hundreds of years of history.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.320
I ended up doing a PhD dissertation

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.890
on the French, Russian,
and Chinese revolutions

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.450
partly under his inspiration,

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.410
but also at the urging of Daniel Bell

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.290
and Seymour Martin Lipset.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.040
These are all giants in
modern political sociology

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.470
- And that dissertation
was turned into a book

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:02.170
which became a major work in the field.

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.880
- Right, it was my first
book and it took a few years

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.260
after the PhD and it's
still regularly read

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.720
and sells quite a bit.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.140
- So this passion that you have,

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.030
which is evident in that book,

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.130
and I'm not questioning its objectivity,

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.840
but something is driving your focus

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.600
on processes of political
and social change.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.410
Talk a little about that.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.880
- Well, I believe that the social sciences

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.880
should ask questions about
real world developments

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.630
and try to answer them with a variety

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.100
of kinds of research techniques.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.460
So I'm not one of these people

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.760
who believes that you should just have

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.730
a data set in mind or
just learn one technique

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.340
of investigation and use that.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.820
I believe you should ask questions

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.030
about change in the real world.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.570
The first questions I
asked were about the roots

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.140
and consequences of revolutions

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.850
and my answers are quite objective

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.100
and sometimes they don't
satisfy political partisans

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.030
or even what I might wanna find.

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.810
So I don't believe in
ideological social science,

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.800
but I believe in big
question social science.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.810
- And that first book, which I looked at,

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:21.490
really it's eye-opening in the sense

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:26.490
it brings added perspectives
to engage the debate

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:28.760
which was already ongoing.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.480
- Right, I almost always
get involved in a question

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.440
because I think it's an important question

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.480
to answer about the world,

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.810
but also because I think
the previous answers

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.380
were not adequate.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.280
So in the case of the revolutions book

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.120
I just didn't believe
that existing perspectives

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:50.190
either ideological or
social science were adequate

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:54.020
and I of course ended up
finding out that revolutions

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.660
that were considered liberal or communist

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.540
all resulted in
strengthening state authority

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.750
and frustrating the desires
of the liberal democrats

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.470
or the socialist democrats

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.240
that had started the
revolutions in some ways.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.740
So that's one example,
but another would be

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.050
I got involved in the debate
about civic engagement

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:16.590
in America when I knew that
it was important to understand

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.990
what was happening to
voluntourism and voluntary groups,

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.350
but I didn't think my
dear friend and colleague

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.830
Bob Putnam's answers were quite adequate

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.750
so I had some other
hunches and a lot of times

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:31.080
I get my hunches out of reading
history, noticing patterns,

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.640
so I look at things big and over time,

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.290
but I also get down
into the nitty-grittiest

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:37.840
of empirical details.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:42.840
- So if a student out there
would be kind of interested

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:47.380
in this way of thinking and
this method of doing research

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.777
what is the best way for
them to train for that

00:09:50.777 --> 00:09:54.260
and to develop skills to
have this broader vision?

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.810
- Well, I tell students
for one thing you need

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.883
to be passionate about the
question you're answering.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.720
If you're just doing something out of duty

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.740
or just because it's the latest squiggle

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.800
in some obscure academic literature,

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.510
you're not really going
to be very motivated

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.160
and you're not gonna have an easy time

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.850
explaining to other people why
your research is significant.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.950
But beyond that, I encourage
methodological diversity.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:21.380
I mean, I think it's fine to
combine quantitative research

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.750
statistical analysis with
historical investigation

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.230
and in my latest work I actually went out

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:27.610
and talked with people face-to-face,

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:32.610
so I'm a big believer in
bringing to bear all the evidence

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.080
you need to answer an important question

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.900
about society, politics,
and how they're changing.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.750
- What are the qualities of character

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.060
that go with this kind of research

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:49.060
because you really
clearly have to question

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:53.030
the status quo of thinking
on a particular problem?

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.880
- Yeah, it helps to be
a little bit stubborn

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.850
and a little bit willing
to stick by your guns.

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:00.700
I mean I remember when
I was a graduate student

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.590
and I launched on the states
and social revolutions

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.190
PhD thesis, which was
really too big a project

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.260
for, you know, three revolutions
over hundreds of years.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.920
That's too big a project for a PhD thesis

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.640
and I had people in my
department saying it was

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.620
and you should drop it
and I stuck with it.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.610
Now, I had some professors
who encouraged me

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:24.310
to stick with it, so I
think that it is important

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:28.400
to have some support from your mentors.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.160
But on the other hand, I tell students

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.940
if you've got a sense that
you've got an important question

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.540
and a new way to go about answering it

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.070
don't easily give that up

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:43.220
because really each generation of scholars

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:46.030
needs to do something different

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.860
and bolder than the previous.

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:52.483
If you're just repeating what
your mentors did, it's boring.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:57.950
- Talk a little about creativity
in your work processes.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:02.950
I mean is it, we've identified
kind of the the challenging

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:06.080
or the questioning of conventional wisdom

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.510
then bringing all kinds of data together

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:11.200
using different methodologies,

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:16.200
is that how the wow
moment then comes to you?

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.370
- Well the wow moment
is always in realizing

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:21.510
that I have a new question to ask

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:25.760
in a new angle to get at
it and that comes from

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.500
being open to all kinds of things.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.110
I'll give you an example
from my second big project

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.300
which resulted in the book
Protecting Soldiers and Mothers.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.270
I had set out to write a
book about the New Deal

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.970
and the development of the
American welfare state.

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:43.180
That was what people thought
was the American welfare state

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.870
you know, the social security
and unemployment insurance

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.510
created in the New Deal.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.980
And I decided well, I better
go back and read a little bit

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.920
about what happened in the progressive era

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.710
so I have some background

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.790
and I was reading a book by
a man, Isaac Max Rubinow,

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:01.530
written in 1913 and he said...

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:03.160
he was comparing the United
States to other countries

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.700
and he said the United States
is actually spending more

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.990
on old-age pensions than
Germany and England.

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:12.263
I thought to myself hmm,
what could he mean here?

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:17.500
We all assumed we didn't start till 1935,

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.780
but he was a brilliant man.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.150
He was very empirical, so I looked into it

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:23.850
and he's the one who put me on to

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:26.220
the civil war pension system,

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.380
which grew out of 19th
century American politics

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.900
and actually provided
disability and old-age pensions,

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.430
far more generous and far earlier

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.210
than a lot of other countries.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:41.210
By following up on that
and taking the question

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:43.500
that came from that seriously,

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.660
I developed an absolutely
unique perspective

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:50.090
on the development of social
policy in the United States.

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:53.250
- And this gets into,

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:54.960
before we talk about the Tea Party book

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.580
and then the Obama book, this gets into

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:01.630
an interesting insight that it
emerges as I read your books,

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:06.240
which is the the reality and the truth

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.960
that lies in that reality

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.480
versus our ideas about what the reality is

00:14:12.493 --> 00:14:17.493
so that in fact America is
a very conservative place

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:23.130
where the the ideology of conservatism

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.170
is almost the default position.

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:29.370
But people are I think
you say they operate

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.200
as liberals in a way,

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.100
talk a little about that
because it's fascinating.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.420
- Well, you know, this I saw
in historical work I did,

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:41.120
but it's also known to
modern survey researchers.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.010
If you ask Americans and I
suspect this would be true

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:47.180
at almost any era, do
they believe in government

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.400
or the free market?

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.730
They'll say the free market.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:51.950
Do they believe in
government or individualism?

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.150
They'll say individual initiative.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.230
Those are genuine American values

00:14:57.095 --> 00:14:58.480
that I think almost all of us,

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.840
and I know I include myself in that, hold.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.500
But if you ask Americans about all kinds

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.890
of specific things government does

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:09.670
to boost opportunity or ensure security,

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:12.630
they support those by
equally huge margins.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.210
So that's the idea that Americans are

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:20.210
philosophical conservatives
who talk in those terms,

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:24.260
but are at the same time
quite pragmatic liberals

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.940
when it comes to what they
concretely want government

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.880
and the community to do
to help boost opportunity

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.990
and spread security for all.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:36.290
- So what that suggests is as a researcher

00:15:37.252 --> 00:15:42.252
your theory has to not only look at

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.210
the philosophical assumptions of the place

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:48.440
you're looking at, but also the reality.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.460
- Yeah, and also you have
to be open to ironies

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.020
and to contradictions and not get into

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.570
so much of social sciences
based on the assumption

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.490
that you can slap one
paradigm on something.

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:02.480
Well that's not what
political life is like at all

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:06.480
and all good things
don't go together either,

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.420
so if you have an evaluative perspective

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.570
you better be prepared to notice

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.630
that some of the things you think are good

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:16.303
also have some worrisome sides to them.

00:16:18.957 --> 00:16:22.137
- I'm curious, to work the way you work

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:29.440
it would seem that the
sense of the bigger picture

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:32.440
doesn't just come from
your own disciplines.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.670
It seems to be informed by history

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:37.700
and I guess the humanities
because that's a place

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:41.170
where you find the bigger
question some time.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.390
- Yes, I don't have very much patience

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:45.500
for purely philosophical discussions

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:49.170
or purely theoretical discussions,
but I always read history

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:51.360
and I have a sense of change over time

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.800
and that probably is
what makes me distinctive

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.470
as a sociologist and political scientist

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:58.760
that I've always been
interested in change over time

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.970
and suppressed possibilities
and comparing the past

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:05.300
to the present, comparing
different countries,

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.203
grappling with similar issues.

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:13.340
But I absolutely try to
keep the big picture in mind

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.530
at the same time that I'm
really trying to nail down

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:19.560
exactly what's happening
with organized groups

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:24.560
in particular, so I'm
not in the clouds at all,

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.770
quite empirical.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:31.770
- Let's use your new book The
Tea Party and I'll show that

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.740
to talk about your methodology,

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.880
the problem you were
addressing, and so on.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.480
So how did this book come about?

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.910
- Well, it was a surprise
book and that's another thing

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:44.420
I would always say to young scholars.

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.930
If something comes along
you're intensely curious about

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:50.323
don't say oh, I won't pursue that.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.330
When Obama was elected president,

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:57.460
I assembled a group of
younger and older sociologists

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.080
and political scientists
to track what happened

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.070
in the first two years
to look at what this

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.600
change oriented president
was trying to change

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.020
and what happened and
what kind of politics

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.930
came out of his attempts.

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:11.630
Well, you know, not long
into Obama's presidency

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.610
was pretty obvious that
something called the Tea Party

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:18.260
had emerged and what was it?

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.200
A lot of people were
spending a lot of time

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.360
trying to label it either ideologically,

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.233
or as a social movement, or
a party, or this or that.

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.560
I was curious and at the same
time my graduate student,

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:33.730
Vanessa Williamson, was
doing an empirical project

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:37.410
where she was looking for
social capital in the tea party

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:40.500
and got to know the Tea
Partiers in Massachusetts

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.990
and went and observed
some of their meetings

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:45.040
and at a certain point we
realized that the combination

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.310
of the kind of looking at local meetings,

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:49.940
talking to local activists,
and trying to understand

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.500
how this fit into the big
picture of American politics

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.650
in the 2009-2010 period
was a fascinating project

00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:58.963
and so we teamed up.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:04.740
- And the, what was new
about the methodology

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.773
you were using here?

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:11.030
- For me what was new was
the the step that we took

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:14.290
of trying to make sure
that we went and observed

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:16.840
local Tea Party meetings,
not just in New England,

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.620
but in Virginia and Arizona ultimately

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.270
and that we sat down for one-on-one

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:27.270
open-ended interviews with
grassroots Tea Party activists.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.760
Now, we had pulled together
all the national surveys

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.000
about what tea partiers were
like, what they thought,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.810
what other Americans thought of them.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:36.900
We had pulled together
electoral statistics.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.883
We'd looked at the media and
its coverage of the Tea Party,

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.850
all these kinds of things that you do

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:46.943
to get the big picture
of an emerging movement.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.940
We gathered information
on the Tea Party funders,

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.850
the group's funding Tea
Party public events,

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.410
in particular demonstrations,

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:58.510
but we knew we wanted to talk to people

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.890
because surveys will only take you so far.

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:03.040
I mean you can ask somebody
do you believe in government

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.810
or not and they'll say no,
but what do they mean by that?

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.860
- So how hard was it to
get people to talk to you.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:14.860
Here you are, a quote Harvard
professor close quotes--

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.603
- Well, I really am a
Harvard professor and--

00:20:17.603 --> 00:20:21.340
- No, but in their eyes
the quotes were for them.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:24.160
- Well, Harvard professor
and I fit the stereotypes

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.520
that Tea Partiers would have,
which is that I'm a liberal.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.260
Now, I'm a New Deal liberal as I put it,

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.670
but you don't have to click
very far on the internet

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:36.240
to find out that I'm a
publicly engaged analyst

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.230
as well as a objective scholar.

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:42.380
So, well that's quite a story actually

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.230
and it's another example of how

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:47.390
you have to be prepared
to go with opportunity.

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:50.313
Now Vanessa had already gotten
to know the New England,

00:20:51.849 --> 00:20:53.200
the greater Boston Tea Party

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.070
and apparently because
they're in Massachusetts

00:20:56.070 --> 00:21:00.360
I would say those Tea Party
people are open to researchers

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:05.030
and the leader actually let
Vanessa send out a questionnaire

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:08.120
an email questionnaire, so
we gotten evidence that way,

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.090
but we thought nobody's gonna believe us

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:12.000
if we just talking about Massachusetts.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.050
We weren't sure we would
because do tea partiers

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:18.340
think the same in Massachusetts
as they do elsewhere?

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:19.980
How to get to know Tea Partiers

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:20.970
in other parts of the country?

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:24.003
Well, you know, I started
thinking who do I know,

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.380
what relatives do we have?

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.480
We sent some cold emails to
different parts of the country

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.220
to see if people would
respond and tea partiers

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:35.830
are very suspicious of
university professors.

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:37.860
In fact, they don't approve of them.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:42.860
So finally I realized, Theda,
you know a tea partier.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:46.400
I had been making comments on the website,

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:50.160
the arena website at Politico
as a New Deal liberal

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:55.170
and every month or so some angry white guy

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:57.537
would write me an email.

00:21:57.537 --> 00:22:00.530
"You communist Harvard professors

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:02.520
who think you know everything

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.260
and can tell real Americans what to do..."

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.730
Well, I always answer them if
they don't threaten violence.

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:12.960
I answer, they don't expect
that, and so in one case

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.400
a man named Peter Stephens
in Gloucester, Virginia,

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.490
we had struck up an email correspondence

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:22.090
gone back and forth
arguing political issues

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.900
and sharing stories of our lives.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.250
I've suddenly realized I know Peter.

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.330
Peter's a member of the Peninsula Patriots

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:34.330
in Gloucester, Virginia,
maybe, so I wrote to him

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:38.460
and I said Peter, would,
you know I'm a scholar,

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.050
I'm not just arguing with
you now, I'm a scholar.

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:43.320
We're writing a book on the Tea Party.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:47.120
We already know that it helps
to talk to tea partiers.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.500
I, you know, pressed a button by saying

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.330
we've already talked to
them in Massachusetts,

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.590
would members of your group be willing

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:56.700
to let us come and attend a meeting,

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.920
sit down for confidential interviews.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.680
Well, Peter went off and asked the members

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.400
of the Peninsula Patriots
and they debated it.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.940
We got to see them
debating on their website

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.483
because it's a meetup website.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.520
Some would say no,

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.820
you can't trust liberal
Harvard professors,

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.260
another said well, we gotta
tape all the interviews

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.700
and I said well, fine if you want to.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:19.140
I don't have the money to
do that, but if you want to.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:22.140
And I told them the
questions we were gonna ask.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.360
Well, ultimately they agreed.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:28.680
They invited us down and
we had very productive

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.220
for more than a dozen interviews,

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:32.510
as well as attending the meeting.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:36.023
- So what did you learn about
the tea party, who are they?

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:41.690
- They're older white, always
conservative minded people.

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:44.090
People who have either voted Republican,

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:46.470
they vote Republican against Democrats,

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:48.330
but some of them are very skeptical

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:50.850
of the Republican Party itself,

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:52.573
so some are libertarians.

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:57.000
About half are also
Christian conservatives.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
They are deeply worried about the country

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:04.340
where it is now and where it's going.

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:08.333
- What surprised you most about them?

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:11.600
- Well, it was very moving to sit down

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.110
with the tea party people.

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:14.640
We ultimately did it in two places,

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.210
in Virginia and in Arizona too

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:21.190
and they were, the ones who
would agree to talk with us

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:26.190
were hospitable and really
just normal folks frankly,

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.763
middle-class people.

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:32.820
We know that tea partiers
are slightly more educated

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:35.740
and slightly more well-to-do
than typical Americans,

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.760
but that's mostly because they're older.

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.470
They're in their 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:44.200
Old people are the ones
who attend the meetings

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.220
in almost all places,

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.710
so I was surprised at their willingness

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:52.430
to be hospitable to some degree,

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:55.790
but I was also surprised
at what they really meant

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:58.383
by their anger about government.

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:03.610
After all, a lot of
people in their age group

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:07.050
are collecting social
security and medicare benefits

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:11.450
or veterans benefits,
military veterans benefits

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:14.210
and people who are perfectly
willing to acknowledge

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:17.710
that yes they were, and
that they had earned those,

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:19.880
just like all other Americans think that

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.880
about those benefits.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:25.330
So what part of government
are you angry about?

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:28.670
Well, it helped to to
ask that and to listen

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:33.110
because it turns out
they're angry about benefits

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:35.710
for illegal immigrants,
who they're convinced

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:37.980
are getting health care
and education benefits

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:39.700
at their expense.

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.190
They're angry about lower income people

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:46.220
who haven't earned it asking for welfare

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.720
and many of these people don't
realize welfare has changed.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.510
They don't, they haven't
absorbed that at all.

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:54.260
You have to work for welfare
now, you don't just get it

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.470
and they were upset about young people

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:00.640
and that was the biggest surprise

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.280
because so many of the
people we talked with

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.370
raised the example of
their own grandchildren

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:10.270
or grand nieces or nephews who they said

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:12.580
wanted something for nothing,

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:13.950
who were coming home to live

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:17.683
or asking for student loans
or maybe using food stamps.

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:24.260
We realized at a certain
point that these older people

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:26.800
didn't understand why these youngsters

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.970
were having a harder
time getting a foothold

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:30.860
in today's economy.

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:32.390
And of course, they often don't approve

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:33.870
of their moral views either.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:36.790
The fact that young people
tend to be more tolerant,

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:41.533
tend to be not against gay
marriage, tend to be for Obama,

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.450
so they were angry at younger people too

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:46.740
and that did surprise us.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.760
We wouldn't have learned that except for

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.210
the face-to-face interviews.

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:53.890
- And bottom line here, and
you emphasize in the book

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:58.890
it's really the other who
they don't, can't tolerate.

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:03.163
They feel didn't earn
what they're getting.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:07.200
- Remember these are older people who...

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:10.880
watched an African-american

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.940
be elected president of the United States,

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.810
which I frankly don't think most Americans

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:17.420
thought that was going to
happen, so they were surprised,

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.490
but they were negatively surprised.

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:21.090
I mean the most important thing about them

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:23.810
is that they're conservative,
so they were upset

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:26.700
that Democrats swept the 2008 elections

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.120
much the way that liberals
in Cambridge, Massachusetts

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:32.610
were upset when George
Bush and Republicans

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:36.420
were wall-to-wall in
Washington DC in 2000,

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.930
so that phenomenon political
scientists know well

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:43.580
of when one party wins
everything in Washington,

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.860
the activists on the other side get angry,

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:48.510
and fearful, and mobilize.

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:49.840
Not surprising in a way,

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:54.230
but here it has an edge
of generational fear

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:55.520
of a changing country.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.450
A country that's becoming browner,

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:01.870
a country whose young people don't feel

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:04.340
like they're behaving the same way you did

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:08.130
and that's what we
heard in the interviews.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:11.270
We heard fear as much as anger.

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:14.460
Now public events you see the angry signs,

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:17.400
when you sit down with people you realize

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.850
that as they will tell you
I'm afraid for the future

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:23.340
of my country, that's how they put it,

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.303
I want my country back.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:31.460
- You in a way, and I don't
wanna put words in your mouth,

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:37.100
but you are, you are taken
by the extent to which

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.940
the Tea Party is participatory
democracy at work.

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.280
These people organize their own meetings,

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:46.900
they were using the communication
tools of the Internet,

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.820
these were people who were
getting on the phones,

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.750
hosting events and so on.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:55.960
So on the one hand you are impressed

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.610
with participatory democracy at work,

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:00.680
with their understanding of the process,

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:01.970
we're gonna elect this guy

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:03.440
and then we're going to watch him,

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:08.060
but on the other hand you say
they're completely ignorant

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:13.893
or wrong about the ideas that
they link to those processes.

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:16.880
- Yeah, I'll make two points here.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:20.970
First, we concluded that the
Tea Party was not one thing,

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:23.440
so let's come back to
that because we see it

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.640
as a weaving together
of grassroots activism

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:29.380
which was quite genuine
with right-wing media

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.150
cheerleading as we put
it and a lot of attempts

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:35.110
by wealthy right-wing billionaires

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:37.750
to leverage this kind
of activism for purposes

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:40.220
they've been pursuing for a long time.

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.540
But the bottom-up part of the Tea Party,

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:46.430
the grassroots activism,
one of our questions was,

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:48.000
you know, are these people for real?

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.240
I mean where, we did a
web survey eventually

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.130
with two Harvard undergraduates
and we documented

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:56.850
the existence of 900 local tea parties

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:59.850
and we've got a map in the book
that shows where they were.

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:02.100
They're all over the United States,

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.840
so one of our big questions was who formed

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.640
these tea parties, how did they do it?

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.840
Did they just relabel previous groups

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.210
or were they new creations?

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:12.240
And for the most part new creations

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.150
and frankly that's very impressive

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:18.450
in early 21st century
America for any entity,

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:22.410
any movement to form almost
a thousand local groups

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:26.780
that meet monthly, sometimes
weekly, and depend mainly

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.560
on volunteer energy and
volunteer contributions.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.690
They're not getting checks
from the Koch brothers

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:35.930
at the local level, so we wanted
to know how that happened.

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:38.800
We learned a lot about it
and we were quite impressed.

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.950
At the same time, a lot of
the content of what was said

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:45.680
in meetings or that people
said to us in interviews

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.980
was factually incorrect.

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:51.300
Now listen to the way I'm saying that,

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.320
I'm not saying these are stupid people.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.140
In fact, they're not stupid people,

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.580
they're actually pretty astute.

00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:59.910
They learned about the
political process in a way

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:01.640
that I was bowled over by.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.520
I mean they would often
know what was coming up

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.770
at the local level at
their state legislature.

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:09.270
They called bills by their numbers,

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:11.110
only political scientists do that

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:13.970
and they knew who to contact.

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:16.210
They knew who to contact in a way

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:18.570
that even liberals in
Cambridge Massachusetts are

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:20.410
you know, they often
think politics consists

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:24.180
of the president giving a speech
and mentioning your issue.

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:27.790
These people much more savvy about,

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:30.670
they would learn the rules
of the Republican Party

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:34.770
and descend on a local meeting
and vote out the old boys

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:36.710
and vote in the new tea partiers.

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:40.230
They are good at the process of politics,

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:44.053
but they believe things
that were utterly amazing.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:48.350
- And what in your analysis,

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:51.310
what you and your co-author are showing

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:54.700
is there is a bottom up phenomena,

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:58.303
but a top down phenom, talk
about that that interface.

00:31:59.478 --> 00:32:01.770
- And that's where some of
the false beliefs come from

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:04.330
because for example, when
local tea partiers told us

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:06.710
at one point that the
government was preparing

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:10.780
to come into our homes and
takeover the thermostats

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:15.350
in all of our houses,
Vanessa and I are thinking

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:17.340
where did this one come from?

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:20.080
And so Vanessa went back
and watched Fox News.

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:23.840
Well there it was on the Fox Network.

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:27.350
The Fox Network has an older
white conservative viewership.

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:31.410
It is the primary source of news.

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:33.860
We ask all of our people
where do you get your news?

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:37.713
They all told, one guy smiled
and said where do you think?

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:43.580
And told us that it was Fox
and right-wing talk radio

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:46.300
at which these people listen
to six to eight hours a day

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:49.270
in many cases, especially the retirees.

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:53.390
Well, they're getting utterly
fantastic, conspiratorial,

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:57.250
and false beliefs from that
and that's been documented

00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:00.730
in survey research too,
so that's part of it.

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:03.830
And the other part of
it is that there are,

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:07.980
once the Tea Party broke
out as a series of popular,

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:09.880
first demonstrations and then organizing

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.960
these local tea parties,
some long-standing

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:17.630
ultra free-market advocacy
groups like FreedomWorks

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:21.550
and Americans for Prosperity,
groups that have been

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:25.260
that have big fancy
offices, well-paid staffs,

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.120
they've been pushing the
idea that there should be

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.130
no taxes on millionaires and billionaires,

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:31.650
that there should be no
regulation of government,

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:35.370
that we shouldn't, that
environmentalism is a hoax,

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:37.280
global warming is a hoax,

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.670
they've been pushing these
ideas for a long time.

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:42.630
But they either relabeled part
of themselves the tea party

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:46.240
or they started appearing before cameras

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:49.770
celebrating the grassroots
activists or sending buses

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:51.690
to take them to demonstrations.

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:54.960
So they were leveraging
this and leveraging it

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.610
for purposes that include by the way,

00:33:56.610 --> 00:34:00.300
privatizing the very social
security and medicare programs

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:04.083
that the tea partiers themselves rely on.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.240
So we explore that
irony of the convergence

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.590
of the top down, on the bottom up,

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:11.660
and one of the main techniques

00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:13.870
that the top-down groups use to influence

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:17.010
the local groups is to
send speakers around

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:21.690
that can be booked for
free by local groups.

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:25.413
- So there are two points
here that are important.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:31.480
One is you point out that
when this phenomena emerges

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.540
at the grassroots and things are hopping

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:38.150
all over the country,
rallies, people in costumes,

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:42.080
and so on, that the national media

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.440
did not know who to talk to

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:48.540
and that at this point
when the national media

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:51.990
becomes interested they
have to have spokesmen.

00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:55.730
So in addition to big
right-wing money coming in

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:59.340
to support these groups
with ideas and money,

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:04.170
additionally, suddenly, national
conservative organizations

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:07.180
said we will speak for
them and they're the ones

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:09.830
who go on the tube and comment about

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:11.610
what these people are really thinking.

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:13.240
- Right, and we document that that happens

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.910
increasingly over time.

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:18.990
At first as the local
activism is breaking out

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:21.140
it's mainly Fox News telling people

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.460
where they can go to hook
up with a local Tea Party

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:26.900
and putting a lot of
cameras on these folks.

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:29.920
Then by 2010 the mainstream media

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.320
becomes utterly taken with this.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:35.070
I mean after all, I mean a
bunch of older white people

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:38.300
carrying signs denouncing Obama as a Nazi

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:41.430
and a communist, I mean that's photogenic

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:43.570
and they were beginning
to influence elections

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:45.830
like the Scott Brown
election in Massachusetts

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:50.140
and the Marco Rubio finishing
off of Christ in Florida.

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:53.940
The mainstream media wanted pictures,

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:56.140
but by the time you get to late 2010

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.160
and especially after that big election

00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.840
where the Republicans win so big

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.870
with a lot of tea partiers
involved, they want spokesman

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:07.370
so guess who's there, Dick Armey,

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:09.900
the head of FreedomWorks, who has,

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:13.870
he's a former Republican
leader in Congress

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:16.190
and a longtime wealthy lobbyist

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.180
for right-wing business causes.

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:19.960
He appoints himself a revolutionary

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.840
and appears before the cameras

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.900
speaking for what the grassroots wants,

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:27.363
which turns out is what his
group has always been pushing.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:31.140
- Now the second point I
think we need to emphasize

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.000
is a point that you just made,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.040
which is there's a contradiction between

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.950
what the right big right wing money wants

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:40.600
and what these people actually believe.

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:42.950
They believe they've earned
their social security

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:46.309
and their medicare and
they don't want to take it,

00:36:46.309 --> 00:36:49.020
they don't want it turned
into a voucher system--

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:51.670
- No they don't, in fact,
there's been national surveys

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:56.520
and you know tea party
identifiers are just about

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:59.490
ten percentage points behind all Americans

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:02.130
in wanting to preserve
medicare social security.

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:04.110
They are maybe at the 70% level

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:05.810
rather than the 80% level.

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:07.543
That's not very significant.

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:12.287
I would say that is a big tension

00:37:12.287 --> 00:37:13.950
and one of the things we wondered

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:16.350
is whether it would lead to a split.

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:19.180
I would say it doesn't
partly because the grassroots

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:22.050
don't control the top, the
top doesn't directly control

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:25.490
the bottom, so what you
see politicians doing

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:27.670
and we should get to the Republicans here,

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:30.390
is trying to speak to the
primary concerns of both

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:32.150
and Mit Romney is a very good example.

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:34.810
I mean in the primaries he spoke to

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:38.620
what is the most visceral
widely shared grassroots concern

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:40.120
which is hatred of immigrants,

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:43.220
belief that many of them are undocumented

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:44.760
and that they shouldn't get amnesty,

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.700
they shouldn't get any benefits.

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:48.760
Remember, he went after
Rick Perry of Texas

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.780
said he was heartless,
Perry said Mitt Romney

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:55.890
was heartless for not wanting
to deny college access

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:57.710
to children of undocumenteds

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:00.470
and Romney went after him
and the tea party cheered

00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:03.100
that on at the grassroots
and then Romney satisfies

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:07.240
the right-wing billionaires
by signing on to the Ryan plan

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:10.340
to voucherize Medicare and Ryan was also

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:13.430
a leading supporter of
privatizing social security.

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:16.100
- And but they put in the stipulation

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.190
it wouldn't affect people who are 55

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:19.830
which would relate to
what you were saying.

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:21.830
- Right, I think that
that's very important.

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:23.800
I mean I noticed that when the media

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.239
started covering Paul Ryan,

00:38:25.239 --> 00:38:29.930
they didn't hone in on that crucial thing

00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:33.150
which is they try to say it'll
only affect people under 55.

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:34.440
That, by the way, is not true

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:37.490
because once you take away
Medicare and social security

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:39.700
from people under 55,
they're not gonna wanna

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:41.340
keep paying the payroll taxes

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.090
that sustain people
into their 80s and 90s.

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:46.860
So that the whole thing
would come apart very quickly

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:50.520
and, of course, Ryan and
his supporters know that,

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:55.520
but it's very carefully crafted
to allow the Tea Party base

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:59.980
to not get too riled up
about it by saying to them

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:04.140
well, we're gonna exempt
people 55 and older.

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:08.860
Most tea partiers, especially
activists, are older than 50

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:13.540
and many older than 55.

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:16.460
- Let's talk now about your Obama book.

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:19.213
Obama And America's Political Future.

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:25.300
You are attempting here to deal with

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:29.470
the disappointment that progressives felt

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:34.470
with what Obama accomplished
in his first term

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:39.770
and you do that by relying in part on

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:41.660
an institutional analysis,

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:44.040
saying it's very important to understand

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:45.760
what's going on in the media,

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:50.760
what's going on within
the Republican Party

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:54.070
some of which we've just described

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:56.980
because the Tea Party essentially moved

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.090
the Republican Party to the right,

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:04.090
but thirdly about what
the state is like now

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:07.240
and what progress looks like.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.910
- Yeah, I mean everybody was so taken

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:12.497
with the victory of Obama in 2008

00:40:12.497 --> 00:40:15.090
and of course, he arrived
with congressional majorities

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:16.950
in the House and the
Senate for the Democrats

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:20.150
and he started seeing
these depictions of him

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:23.630
as the leader of a second
new deal, a new new deal

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.190
and sort of an assumption
that because the air

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:29.140
was an economic downturn because he had

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:32.100
these big majorities and
because he had campaigned

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:35.550
saying he wanted to
create a bottom-up economy

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:37.730
rather than a top-down
and had talked about

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:39.150
changing benefits and taxes,

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:41.970
that he was going to be
able to revolutionize

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:45.010
American government the way Roosevelt did

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:48.410
in the New Deal and that
that would be combined

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:51.450
with a rising political
majority because after all

00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:54.070
he'd been supported by
young people, minorities,

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:58.430
the rising groups in
American electoral politics.

00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:01.220
Well, two years later we
discovered that actually

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:02.890
he had changed quite a bit

00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:05.130
and I'll get back to that in a minute,

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:07.030
but he wasn't getting
the political payoff,

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:10.010
so the motivation for the book

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:13.870
was to ask what happened here.

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:16.883
Did he really not change
things the way he had said?

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:21.570
Why was he not only enraging his opponents

00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:25.140
but disappointing many of
his original supporters?

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:28.240
And why didn't the political
payoffs that you might expect

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:31.130
go with the policy changes he did achieve

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:34.053
like health care reform?

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:39.970
- And the bottom line here,
you talk about the term

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.190
I think it's submerged state basically

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:48.600
which comes from another
analyst which is namely

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.060
well, let's step back a minute

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:52.880
because where you wanna start

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.120
is with a comparison with Roosevelt.

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:57.080
And you, what you're saying is

00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:00.740
Roosevelt's project was different,

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:02.670
although both projects are progressive

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:04.330
and it was in a different time

00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:06.010
where there were different institutions

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:08.520
and tell us a little about that.

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.030
- So I'm using the,

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:12.970
instead of talking about whether it was

00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:15.270
another new deal or not
in just descriptive terms

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:18.940
we, and this grew out of the
project that a bunch of us

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:20.890
did together as well as my own work,

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:24.410
looked at what it was like in the 30s

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:27.940
for a reform oriented Democrat to appear

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:31.520
with big majorities in the
middle of a economic crisis

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:34.000
and compare that to another time 2008

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:34.980
when the same thing happened

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:36.700
and the purpose of the comparison

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:41.210
was to clarify differences
as well as to see

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:42.650
what might be similar.

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:45.830
So we noticed several things

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:47.460
I mean the first and most important

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:49.530
is the economic crisis itself.

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:52.930
I mean Roosevelt comes to the New Deal

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:55.200
three years into the Great Depression,

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.173
25 percent unemployment,

00:42:58.010 --> 00:42:59.640
people from both political parties

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.550
begging him to do something

00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:04.510
and Congress passing the bills

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:07.150
before they even got
the written legislation

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:11.010
in the early period and
that's because the crisis

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:15.090
was so deep, so obvious,
that the need for action

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:16.920
was for at least a little while accepted

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.743
by everybody across the spectrum.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.090
Look at Obama, he
basically is holding hands

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:24.000
with Herbert Hoover.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.170
I mean he comes into office
just at the very beginning

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:29.240
of a financial meltdown
that's going to lead

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:32.650
to deep economic collapse
and unemployment,

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:35.100
high unemployment, but it hadn't yet,

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:37.730
so he gets involved in
trying to prevent it

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:40.200
from turning into a
second Great Depression

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.800
and that means he isn't
reaping the sort of

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:45.620
bipartisan support or
the popular understanding

00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:48.570
of the need for many of the things he did.

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:51.730
So that's one, and another
very different part

00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:54.920
is in context, hyper-partisan
by the time he arrives,

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:58.320
media that include a
right-wing media empire

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.340
that can get out a message instantly

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:02.050
while the rest of the media is fragmented

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:04.300
and he can't get his message across.

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:07.000
But you're pointing to the final thing,

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.750
which is it's a big difference
between putting in place

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:15.950
major reforms in government
for the first time,

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:17.180
people can understand what you're doing,

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:19.750
they may not support it,
but they understand it,

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:23.220
versus trying to change the direction

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:25.990
of an already massive federal government

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:29.120
that has its finger in
every sector of the economy

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.240
and that is providing benefits to some

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:33.200
and doing less for others.

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:37.160
And so we do a lot with that comparison,

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.280
I do a lot with that comparison.

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:41.960
- And if you take health
care, which you discussed,

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:46.960
that's really an example of a problem set

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.070
where you have vested interests

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:54.070
who can be very loud in in
opposing inner obstacles

00:44:55.150 --> 00:45:00.150
and on the one hand who
you've got to deal with,

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:04.690
make deals with, pay
off in order to achieve

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:06.300
that your progressive goals.

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:10.190
And all of this is done
behind closed doors

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.310
undercover in a way,

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:16.300
because that's what the system has become.

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:18.710
- Yeah, and you know health
care is a very good example,

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:20.270
college student loans too.

00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:23.090
In both cases you already
have the federal government

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:28.090
involved usually by providing
subsidies to private actors

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:29.690
to give things to people.

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:32.630
In the case of college
loans, banks were subsidized

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:34.830
to provide loans to college students.

00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:37.710
In the case of health
care, apart from Medicare

00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:40.290
and Medicaid, which are
government-run programs,

00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:41.680
a lot of the way the federal government

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.530
has been involved in
health care in the past

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:47.820
has been to subsidize
employers with tax breaks

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:50.170
to get them to provide insurance coverage.

00:45:50.170 --> 00:45:52.200
Well that had broken down,

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:57.070
so Obama did campaign saying
I'm gonna change these things,

00:45:57.070 --> 00:45:58.870
I'm gonna give less to the privileged

00:45:58.870 --> 00:46:00.380
and squeeze out the resources

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:03.170
in a fiscally constrained environment

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:07.210
to give more to ordinary
Americans more loans,

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:08.730
more grants to college students,

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:12.230
more healthcare to the
people who are uninsured,

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:13.303
millions of them,

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:17.810
40 million or so by the
time he came to office.

00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:20.950
But to do that, he had to design

00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:22.820
a very complex piece of legislation

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:26.860
that could get through Congress
that stepped on the toes

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:29.150
of many vested interests in both cases

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:31.130
who had the capacity to squawk,

00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:32.790
they knew what was happening.

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:36.280
Hospitals knew if they were
gonna get less in payments,

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.580
pharmaceutical companies knew if they were

00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:40.780
gonna be getting less for
their prescription drugs,

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:42.910
insurance companies, particular,

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:45.680
knew where this would challenge them,

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:48.280
but most of the people who
would eventually benefit

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.440
for example from health care, millions,

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:55.070
30 million Americans gonna get
secure health care coverage,

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:57.610
most Americans gonna get a better deal

00:46:57.610 --> 00:46:58.690
from the insurance companies.

00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:01.700
They didn't know what they
were eventually going to get,

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:05.510
so Obama ended up looking
like he was making

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:09.700
a lot of dirty inside deals,
the Cornhusker kickback

00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:11.880
to get Ben Nelson to vote for the thing

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:16.880
and deals with Mary Landrieu in Louisiana

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:20.120
and it looked partisan and
it looked like an inside deal

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.523
and it looked complicated.

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:24.810
The beneficiaries didn't know what it was

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:26.770
because so many of the changes were in

00:47:26.770 --> 00:47:30.350
these complex regulations and tax breaks

00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:33.460
and the opponents knew
exactly what was happening,

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:36.060
so that's part of the reason that you get

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:39.900
the first two years
resulting in a huge blow back

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:44.330
from opponents and disappointment
from many supporters

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:47.480
who don't realize the enormity

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:50.350
of the Obama administration's
accomplishments.

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:52.370
- And this gets at what we
were talking about earlier,

00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:54.860
the contradiction in the American system

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:57.750
where the ideology of
the country as a whole

00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:01.730
is in one place, but
the reality is another

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:06.671
and it's bringing that truth
to the American people.

00:48:06.671 --> 00:48:09.710
So they realize how they're benefiting

00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:11.440
and then become supporters,

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:14.480
but then you go on to
say interestingly enough

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:17.590
that in many ways or at least in some ways

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:19.650
Obama failed as a communicator.

00:48:19.650 --> 00:48:22.410
- I did, I mean we do talk about the way

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:25.820
in which the media environment
has made it difficult,

00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:29.190
but particularly for economic policy.

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:33.040
And remember, the big
thing on Americans minds

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:36.740
by the time this president
took office in January of 2009

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:40.090
was the plunging economy
and Republicans knew

00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:41.860
that they were going to
be able to run against him

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:44.940
and against Democrats in a down economy

00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:47.230
because the enormity of the crisis.

00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:49.660
Obama and the Democrats
sponsored the stimulus,

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.800
the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act,

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:55.100
but they didn't do a very
good job of explaining

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:58.980
what was in it, why it
was expected to work,

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:00.760
and that was an enormous failure.

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.250
And that's a contrast to FDR,

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:06.020
who even in the darkest
moments of the Great Depression

00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:08.360
was always explaining,
he was always explaining

00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:12.380
what he was trying to do
and who was opposed to it.

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:15.290
Obama was facing solid opposition

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:18.280
from a Republican
leadership that had decided

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:19.570
that it wasn't going to cooperate

00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:21.170
in any of these recovery efforts.

00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:24.370
because they wanted to defeat
this president for re-election

00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:26.880
and Obama kept trying
to reach out to them,

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:30.550
long beyond the time that was realistic,

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:34.250
but most of all he never
explained what was happening here.

00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:36.340
So I think a lot of ordinary Americans

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:40.120
who we're now learning in
2012 are willing to give him

00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:44.550
a lot of slack on this, are willing to say

00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:46.620
well, maybe it did partly work

00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.040
and maybe we should stick with him.

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:49.950
That's what's happening in this election.

00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:51.480
That could have happened earlier

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:54.300
if only he had explained and he didn't.

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:57.050
- Did it surprise you that
he couldn't communicate?

00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:58.730
- Yeah, I was surprised

00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:01.500
because he obviously can communicate.

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:03.710
The question is what happened to him?

00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:07.400
And I the only analysis I can
come up with is first of all,

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.840
he was overwhelmed with crises.

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:12.650
I don't think there have
been very many presidents

00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:14.990
who have arrived in Washington DC

00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:19.580
with more on their plate
because there's two wars,

00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:21.200
one of which he was trying to wrap up

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:25.920
without a signing ceremony on
the deck of a aircraft carrier

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.170
or anything like that,
Iraq and another of which

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:31.400
was fraught with peril, Afghanistan--

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:33.110
- He has a very different
relationship to war

00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:36.710
than Roosevelt did, the
war helped Roosevelt

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:37.600
to get out of the depression.

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.510
- Yeah, and he was trying to
wrap things up in these wars

00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:45.340
or at least intensify
Afghanistan in some ways

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:46.630
and defeat terrorism and another,

00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:50.600
so it was just a series of
crises he had to deal with

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:53.770
and then there's a economic
meltdown and he's a lawyer,

00:50:53.770 --> 00:50:56.160
he's a constitutional lawyer.

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:58.670
I think he thought he needed people

00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:02.260
who understood Wall
Street in order to both

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:04.840
recover the economy and
to change Wall Street

00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:09.750
and regulate it, and so he
brought in economic advisors

00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:12.350
who frankly did do quite a bit.

00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:16.250
I mean we can all criticize
Larry Summers all we want

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:18.910
and I have a complicated
personal relationship to him,

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:22.533
but he did, they did take steps.

00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:24.790
- Not enough.

00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:26.860
- But they didn't focus on employment.

00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:30.810
They focused more on stopping
the economic bleeding

00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:35.050
and the financial collapse
and I don't think that Obama

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:36.970
had people telling him first of all,

00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:40.660
that he should describe
the new investments

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:43.900
that were in the stimulus,
in new energy sources,

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:46.590
and job-creating infrastructure projects.

00:51:46.590 --> 00:51:50.160
He should have concretely
stressed those things to voters,

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:53.470
so they could understand and
he should have talked about

00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:56.420
why government spending
can help the private sector

00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:57.690
because you can't assume that,

00:51:57.690 --> 00:52:00.163
that stuff that my father
explained to me on the street

00:52:00.163 --> 00:52:03.150
in Wyandotte, Michigan when I was a child,

00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:06.860
Americans haven't heard any
of that now for 20 years,

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:10.280
so how would they know
that government spending

00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:13.250
can actually help economic recovery.

00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:14.690
And you had the other side saying

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:16.780
this is exactly the wrong thing to do.

00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:19.270
I actually think they know
it was the right thing to do,

00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:22.040
but they were gonna say it
was the wrong thing to do

00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.040
and Obama didn't counter that

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:25.710
and I think that was a failure.

00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:29.510
He himself has admitted
recently that it was a failure.

00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:33.463
- And he bought into the
immediate problem is the deficit.

00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:38.540
- Well, he into that a year
later and that is mind boggling.

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:40.840
I mean that's just the side of Obama

00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:43.073
that wants to reach out to the other side.

00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:45.980
- Now, which leads me to a point.

00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:50.340
I guess one would have to
conclude that running the country

00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:52.860
if you can do that these days is different

00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:55.010
than running the Harvard Law Review

00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:58.600
and it used to be said of Lyndon Johnson

00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:00.980
that he would say let us reason together,

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:05.570
but then he would squeeze
you in a delicate place

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:07.750
to get you to move.

00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:12.750
So stylistically, Obama has not evidenced

00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:16.450
that part of leadership.

00:53:16.450 --> 00:53:18.380
- Well, that's to some degree true.

00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:20.410
I mean I am not of the school of thought

00:53:20.410 --> 00:53:22.410
that we should be psychoanalyzing him,

00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:26.890
but you're right absolutely
that people's backgrounds

00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.280
do tell us something.

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:33.240
I mean it's both that
he came from academia

00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:36.940
and that he's of his generation
and that he understands

00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:40.870
that many Americans yearn
for a cooperative style

00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:43.830
of politics, so these are genuine things

00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:47.820
that a lot of people want
and Obama does try that.

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:49.670
He tries to bring people together

00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:51.840
and get them to lay out their ideas

00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:54.140
and then take some from every side.

00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:55.410
I don't think there's anything

00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:56.923
that's not admirable about that.

00:53:56.923 --> 00:53:59.110
I think in many ways it is admirable

00:53:59.110 --> 00:54:01.130
and so the health care reform for example,

00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:03.480
contains lots of Republican ideas

00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:06.097
and I know many progressives
and I consider myself

00:54:06.097 --> 00:54:08.810
and my citizen capacity of
progressives would condemn that.

00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:12.160
I think, you know, I'm not
sure we should condemn it.

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:15.100
I mean it was a formula for a broadly,

00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:17.789
after all it's Romney's health plan,

00:54:17.789 --> 00:54:22.010
so why not build something
that could get broad support?

00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:26.570
But I don't think Obama was
prepared for the cold blooded

00:54:26.570 --> 00:54:30.980
ruthlessness and the extremism
of the opposition he faced,

00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:32.980
which by the time the Tea
Party was in the field

00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:35.380
was also something that
Republicans were going to do

00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:39.300
for their own life because
they'd be often primaries

00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:41.760
if they didn't do it and I don't think

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:43.850
he reacted soon enough.

00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:48.380
He doubled down in that second
year on cooperative efforts

00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:50.160
and almost did in his presidency

00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:53.920
because they almost sent
the country into default.

00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:55.610
- You've taken in these two books,

00:54:55.610 --> 00:55:00.117
the temperature of the
right's grassroots movement

00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:06.280
and you've taken the temperature
of the Obama administration

00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:08.030
and the progressive disappointment.

00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:11.270
I don't want you to predict the future.

00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:13.400
I don't think that's
something you wanna do,

00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:15.210
but I'm curious, what do you think

00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:18.610
we should watch for in the coming election

00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:23.660
beyond the mistakes and
errors of Mitt Romney

00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:27.110
you know with regard
to the these big issues

00:55:27.110 --> 00:55:31.390
pointing to the country's
future after the election?

00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:33.860
- Well, what we should watch
for is a good way to put it,

00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:36.340
that's what historical
institutional analysis,

00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:38.403
which is what I do can tell you.

00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:41.570
Any social scientist who ever tells you

00:55:41.570 --> 00:55:44.540
that he or she can predict
the future is blowing smoke.

00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:47.320
I know the lot of them do,
but they're blowing smoke.

00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:51.120
What we can do is tell you
what factors are in play

00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:53.560
and what the alternative
possibilities are,

00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:55.570
so the analysis that I've done,

00:55:55.570 --> 00:55:57.430
which has been not just about Obama

00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:58.760
and the grassroots Tea Party,

00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:00.600
but about what's happened
to the Republican Party,

00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:02.940
which by the way, has moved to the right

00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:06.610
the furthest in quantitatively
recorded measurements

00:56:06.610 --> 00:56:09.340
in political science for 50 years.

00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:13.023
It's a breathtakingly
radical party at this point.

00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:16.960
That means that this election
is one of the most pivotal

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:20.410
in American history,
it's as simple as that.

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:24.710
Should this radicalized Republican Party

00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:27.050
succeed in taking the presidency

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:28.840
and both houses of Congress at once,

00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:31.770
they will dismantle 20th
century social policy

00:56:31.770 --> 00:56:35.350
within three months and
they know it's not popular,

00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:36.600
but they'll do it anyway.

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:43.460
And so if that happens
we're going to be seeing

00:56:45.050 --> 00:56:47.540
on the road to privatizing
social security and medicare,

00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:52.540
we're gonna see, two thirds
of the cuts in the Ryan budget

00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:56.270
are aimed at America's
already ungenerous programs

00:56:56.270 --> 00:57:00.380
for the poor, we're going
to see devastating suffering

00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:04.670
on top of the terrible
hit that lower-income

00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:06.370
and middle-income people
frankly have taken

00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:09.950
in this great recession,
we're gonna see disinvestment

00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:12.230
in education research.

00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:14.050
The federal government slated to be cut

00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:19.050
to 50% of its level at the
high point after World War Two.

00:57:19.410 --> 00:57:24.040
These are incredible
changes and many of them

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:25.700
will be carried through very fast

00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:29.310
with no worry about any
filibusters in the Senate.

00:57:29.310 --> 00:57:32.110
They'll just do it, so
that's one possibility.

00:57:32.110 --> 00:57:34.660
Now another possibility is
that Obama's re-elected.

00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:37.690
He has shown considerable fight by the way

00:57:37.690 --> 00:57:40.150
in the last year, so
lest we say that this man

00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:41.930
has no toughness in him.

00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:43.940
I actually think when
pushed against the wall

00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:45.680
by people he's reached his hand out to

00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:48.550
have slapped it away,
he's one of the toughest.

00:57:48.550 --> 00:57:51.300
The Obama campaign has been run ruthlessly

00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:55.150
because they're working
to re-elect a president

00:57:55.150 --> 00:57:57.893
in an economic slowdown and they know it.

00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:00.680
And they know the stakes,

00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:04.833
so they have not played
pussyfoot in this election.

00:58:05.970 --> 00:58:08.510
If he's re-elected he's
gonna have to deal with

00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:11.370
at least one house of Congress
that's under radicalized

00:58:11.370 --> 00:58:14.250
republican right-wing control

00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:16.220
and he's going to try
once again to come up with

00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:18.860
bargains on taxes and spending.

00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:22.800
He's going to be in a stronger
position for two reasons.

00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:25.100
One, he will have been re-elected,

00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:28.120
which is going to cause a
war in the republican party

00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:30.690
that I expect to last for
about six to eight years

00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:33.860
because they won't be able to believe it.

00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:36.690
And secondly, he'll be
in a stronger position

00:58:36.690 --> 00:58:40.300
because the tax cuts that
have taken such a huge bite

00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:42.480
out of federal government resources,

00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:46.910
the Bush tax cuts, are
going to expire by law.

00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:51.910
So deadlock means they go
away rather than deadlock

00:58:53.330 --> 00:58:56.940
meaning that conservatives
get what they want,

00:58:56.940 --> 00:59:01.500
so Obama will be able to
say here's what I'm prepared

00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:03.450
to bring back in the way of tax cuts.

00:59:03.450 --> 00:59:05.250
Here's what I'm willing to change

00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:07.480
in spending programs going forward,

00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:10.420
you have to give on tax
increases for the rich

00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:12.910
or they're going to happen anyway.

00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:14.660
That puts him in a better position.

00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:19.390
- Well on that note, we really appreciate

00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:22.096
your coming on our program
and sharing your insights--

00:59:22.096 --> 00:59:23.300
- Thanks for having me.

00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:26.580
- Both about the Republicans
and the Democrats.

00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:28.180
Thank you Professor.

00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:30.460
And thank you very much for joining us

00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:32.713
for this conversation with history.

00:59:34.145 --> 00:59:37.645
