00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We're very close to understanding how to solve our problem--

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
how to prevent buildings from getting struck by lightning.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's take a look. Here's our cloud overhead. And the bottom of that cloud is negatively charged.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
That induces some positive charge on the ground,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and this leads to some complicated pattern of electric field.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Okay, so we've got these buildings. We know that they're at risk of being struck by lightning.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
In fact, well, there's a lot of ways to explain what's going on with this lightning.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It's a very complicated subject.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But one thing that's going to happen is a little bit of charge

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
due to this negative charge will be induced on the roof.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And since the tip of this roof is a little closer, a little more charge will be induced there

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and a little less over here and that's going to modify the electric field.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It's going to make the electric field around here a bit stronger

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and quite a bit stronger here and even a little bit stronger over this building.

00:00:49.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now, can you tell me which of these three buildings is most likely to get struck by lightning?
