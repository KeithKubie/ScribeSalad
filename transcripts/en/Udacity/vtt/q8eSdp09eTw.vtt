00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.840
Prototype chains are a mechanism for making objects that resemble other objects.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.100
When you want two objects to have all the same properties,

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.190
either to save memory or to avoid code duplication,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.660
you might decide to copy every property over from one object to another.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.000
But as an alternative, JavaScript provides the option of prototype chains.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.810
This makes one object behave as if it has all

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.800
the properties of the other object,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.040
by delegating the field lookups from the first object to the second one.
