00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.620
JANE: Hi, everyone.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.930
So our project is
called Mini Worlds.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.490
So basically, we want
to view this video game

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.420
where you can build your world
with Kinect by just grabbing

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.120
things and build them
by dropping them.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.350
So the idea is you can go
into this 3-D environment

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.140
to design your own
home and your own room.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.930
So my name is Jane.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.010
So I'm from Course 3 and
I'm a graduate student.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.770
CATTLEYA: I am Cattleya, I am
Course 6 undergrad student,

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.130
class of 2019.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.730
So we address this
problem of when

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.950
we try to create our own world,
as Jane has already introduced.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.650
So we then come up with a
word game called Media World.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.910
And we will show
you our demo now.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.000
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.970
JANE: So Cattleya will
be controlling the game

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.850
and I will be doing here.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.434
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:02:04.027 --> 00:02:05.610
JANE: So I hope it's
not capturing me.

00:02:10.747 --> 00:02:12.700
PROFESSOR: You may
want to restart.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.122
JANE: Yeah, we will restart.

00:02:15.122 --> 00:02:17.512
PROFESSOR: There's going to
be technical difficulties.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.910
One of the [INAUDIBLE]
presentation [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.700
JANE: OK.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.490
So now we are trying to
locate ourself in our home.

00:02:31.382 --> 00:02:32.828
PROFESSOR: Move a little closer.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.657
JANE: Could it be it is
capturing other people?

00:02:42.657 --> 00:02:44.490
MARK VRABLIC: I mean
you can check for this.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.406
CATTLEYA: Yeah, maybe.

00:02:45.406 --> 00:02:46.990
I think so.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.990
It's [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.011
JANE: Yeah, I think
it's not tracking her.

00:02:51.011 --> 00:02:51.510
So--

00:02:56.527 --> 00:02:58.110
STUDENT: Do you have
the [INAUDIBLE]??

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.610
JANE: Yes.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.730
MARK VRABLIC: You
should pull that out.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.090
I don't know how [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:12.610
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:52.830
JANE: OK.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.480
So somehow, we just got indoor.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.020
Because we saw a house and we
just went through that door

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.000
to go into your room.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.430
And your getting all
of you to your yard.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.359
PROFESSOR: So how are
you switching rooms?

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.089
CATTLEYA: We changed the scene.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:24.199
We can disable it right now.

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:25.115
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:25.115 --> 00:04:26.323
CATTLEYA: To a wider problem.

00:04:31.474 --> 00:04:32.458
[INAUDIBLE]

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.580
JANE: So what we just did is
that we deleted that door.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.640
So cannot go indoor and now
you can travel more freely

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.915
in your yard, not
through just that door.

00:05:06.815 --> 00:05:11.280
CATTLEYA: We tried to
really show you the thing,

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.765
how to like--

00:05:12.765 --> 00:05:15.982
we can choose the material
and then choose the object

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:18.705
to paint into [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:28.605
Then you can [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.040
Oh, sorry.

00:05:37.515 --> 00:05:42.465
[INAUDIBLE] low
position if you delete.

00:05:42.465 --> 00:05:49.395
So that we-- here, you
will see [INAUDIBLE] oh.

00:05:49.395 --> 00:05:53.355
We can also rotate thing
around, I can show you.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.940
JANE: So the only
problem here is

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.150
it's a little bit hard
to control things.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.112
But we will get there.

00:06:17.112 --> 00:06:18.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:23.064 --> 00:06:27.640
CATTLEYA: Let me show you.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:33.270
Now, we will get rid of
all the stuff we have build

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.970
and we will try to build
from the scratch for you.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:50.046
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:06:50.046 --> 00:06:53.490
JANE: So we just
deleted the yard

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.880
and you want to
locate yourself again.

00:07:03.642 --> 00:07:07.600
No-- oh, yeah.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.500
Here.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.232
Good.

00:07:09.232 --> 00:07:13.168
CATTLEYA: Now, we have
to grab some object here.

00:07:13.168 --> 00:07:14.160
And then--

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.290
JANE: And you can
create that object.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.042
CATTLEYA: And then you can
create it by raising your hand.

00:07:21.042 --> 00:07:22.008
AUDIENCE: What?

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:22.974
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:32.880
You can delete it by
lower your hand down.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.425
Also, now I will try
to do the rotation.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.424
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:07:49.424 --> 00:07:52.292
[INAUDIBLE]

00:07:52.292 --> 00:07:54.444
JANE: I think that's fine.

00:07:54.444 --> 00:07:57.610
PROFESSOR: This is an
operation [INADUCIBLE]..

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:58.130
JANE: OK.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:58.671
CATTLEYA: OK.

00:07:58.671 --> 00:08:00.872
So now, you can create a bridge.

00:08:00.872 --> 00:08:06.078
And you can grab it and
rotate it around like this.

00:08:06.078 --> 00:08:08.054
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:13.982 --> 00:08:19.416
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:25.344
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:25.344 --> 00:08:28.300
CATTLEYA: Another thing that you
can control this, the camera.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:34.250
If you wanted to, maybe you
can do something like this or--

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.429
and so now like this.

00:08:39.221 --> 00:08:41.549
Also, if you want
to rotate a camera,

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:45.533
you can [INAUDIBLE]
move body like this.

00:08:45.533 --> 00:08:48.521
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:54.497 --> 00:08:56.489
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:03.666 --> 00:09:04.457
PROFESSOR: Awesome.

00:09:04.457 --> 00:09:06.947
Do we have any questions?

00:09:06.947 --> 00:09:08.441
AUDIENCE: How are
you so amazing?

00:09:08.441 --> 00:09:09.757
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:09.757 --> 00:09:10.590
CATTLEYA: Thank you.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:14.980
AUDIENCE: What were the--

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.696
what's the role did
you use to establish

00:09:17.696 --> 00:09:20.830
what kind of protocols?

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:27.132
Were there some kind
of preformatted roles

00:09:27.132 --> 00:09:31.111
that connect, or did you
all just do that scratch?

00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:31.610
JANE: Oh.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:36.890
So for the Kinect,
our TA have already

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.920
made the script that
allow us to keep track

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.640
of the coordinate
in 3D of our hands

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.040
and the other joints like hips.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.540
And what I do is that we--

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.740
I implement-- For example,
the zoom in and zoom out.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:58.370
I implement that if
your right hand is

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:02.660
behind your right shoulder
for a certain amount,

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.040
you will got zoom out.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.830
And if it--

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:11.000
I think it's the C
direction, C index.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.850
If it more than
your shoulder, it

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:17.947
will go to zoom in like that.

00:10:17.947 --> 00:10:20.155
PROFESSOR: So they build a
lot of their own intervals

00:10:20.155 --> 00:10:23.104
based on x and y
and z coordinates.

00:10:23.104 --> 00:10:25.423
So any gesture that
she was doing she

00:10:25.423 --> 00:10:28.725
actually programmed just
based on plain logical rules

00:10:28.725 --> 00:10:32.340
about where two
points in space are.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.378
MARK VRABLIC: So you
train it beforehand.

00:10:35.378 --> 00:10:38.045
And then I'm curious whether
if you had another Kinect,

00:10:38.045 --> 00:10:40.091
it'd be more
responsive if you had

00:10:40.091 --> 00:10:41.385
one in the front and the back.

00:10:41.385 --> 00:10:45.172
That really makes the sensors
twenty one mega sense.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:49.900
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:10:50.749 --> 00:10:52.874
MARK VRABLIC: That's going
to be hard to implement,

00:10:52.874 --> 00:10:54.665
but yes, theoretically,
it would be better.

00:10:54.665 --> 00:10:56.870
People do do it.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.276
It'd be a lot of math to
get the two to match up.

00:11:00.276 --> 00:11:02.838
Also, there are [INAUDIBLE]
camera who probably started

00:11:02.838 --> 00:11:03.252
to render at each other.

00:11:03.252 --> 00:11:03.752
Okay.

00:11:08.445 --> 00:11:09.070
JANE: Question?

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:11.950
AUDIENCE: Have you had Unity
experience before this class?

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:14.560
JANE: I have a little bit.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.780
But yes, but learn
from this class a lot.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.076
Yes.

00:11:20.076 --> 00:11:22.030
AUDIENCE: And what about Kinect?

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.640
JANE: No, it never happened.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.140
Yes.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.240
PROFESSOR: Any other questions?

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:30.740
All right.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:31.940
Awesome.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.790
[APPLAUSE]
