TONY PADILLA: A very very big number, a super super big number.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.560
In fact, it's just an off-the-scale big number, and that's TREE(3).

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.960
It absolutely puts Graham's Number to shame.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.140
I mean, really Graham's Number is effectively zero compared to TREE(3).

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.220
Let's explain where TREE(3) comes from.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.500
Well, It comes from a game of trees.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.000
There are three different types of seeds.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.720
We're gonna have a green seed...

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.080
Mathematicians wouldn't call these seeds,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.682
they'd call them nodes, but we'll call them seeds.

00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:30.960
Okay, and a black seed, and a red seed.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.500
And what we're gonna try and do is we're gonna try to build a forest.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.100
Okay, one tree at a time.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.160
The first tree can't have more than one seed.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.960
The second tree can't have more than two seeds.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.220
The third tree can't have more than three seeds and so on, okay?

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.540
And that's rule number one.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.480
The other rule is that if you build a tree,

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.280
if you find that an earlier tree could've been contained within that tree,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.160
the whole forest dies.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.520
Okay? So let's just sort of illustrate what we mean,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.840
so let's try and build a tree for example, so we might start off with,

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.780
you know, a green seed...

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.160
And then we branch up and we get a black seed...

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.960
And then maybe we have two branches...

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.680
And there, you know we can have another green seed maybe...

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.840
And we can sort of draw these trees, right?

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.520
We said that the first go, the first tree, shouldn't have more than one seed,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.428
the second tree shouldn't have more than two seeds, and so on.

00:01:21.428 --> 00:01:23.280
We also said if you build a tree,

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.187
then an earlier tree could've been contained within it, then the forest dies,

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:28.840
so what do we mean by contained?

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.300
Well the mathematical term that we're really talking about here is inf-embeddable.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.340
Don't worry about what inf-embeddable is,

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.060
let's just try to understand what we mean by one tree being contained in another tree.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.720
Okay, so let me show you.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.740
We've got a tree here already, so we could draw another tree.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.260
For example, we could draw...

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.660
this tree.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.720
And I think you'd be quite happy if you said that this tree was contained in this tree

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.893
because you can sort of see you've got that there,

00:01:52.893 --> 00:01:53.980
and you've got that there,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.899
and you've got that there, so that tree is kinda contained in that tree.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.860
There's something else that you have to- when you say a tree is contained in another,

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.880
there's an important property that they have to satisfy.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.240
And that's that they must preserve the nearest common ancestor, so what do I mean by that?

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.620
I mean this red seed,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.720
and this green seed,

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.300
their nearest common ancestor is this black seed.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.880
And that same's true here.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.660
This red seed, this green seed, their nearest common ancestor is this black seed.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.940
So indeed, this tree is contained in this tree.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.360
Okay, let's do another example.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.100
Is this tree contained in this tree?

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.200
At some level you might think that it is.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.740
Green, green, red.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.880
Green, green, red.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.520
So you might think that this tree is indeed contained in this tree.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.060
But it's not. And the reason it's not is because of the nearest common ancestor.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.940
This red and this green, their nearest common ancestor is a green.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.140
It's this green one here.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.400
This red and this green, their nearest common ancestor is this black.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.080
So this tree is not contained in this tree.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.900
I want to do one last example, just so we get this point properly understood.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.340
So let me draw my new tree...

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.920
Okay, so I've got two trees here, this one and this one.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.660
I want to ask: Is this one

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:02.900
contained in this one?

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.520
All right, now, it doesn't look obvious that it is, but actually, it is.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.480
You could take this guy,

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.680
you could take this guy,

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.920
and you could take this guy, okay?

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.754
That's your black-black-red,

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.900
black-black-red,

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.380
and also they preserve the ancestry rule.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.540
Because the nearest common ancestor of this black,

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.400
and this red is...

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.420
the black.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.980
BRADY: The nearest COMMON ancestor.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.580
TONY: Yes, the nearest COMMON ancestor.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.340
So even though they have other ancestors, the nearest common ancestor is this black guy, right?

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.300
And that's what's important.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.200
And this is shared by the other graph and so, we can say that this graph is contained in this one.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.560
Okay, those the rules, are we happy with the rules?

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.060
BRADY: I think so.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.680
TONY: First rule is: tree number one shouldn't have more than one seed,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.580
tree number two shouldn't have more than two seeds,

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.400
tree number three shouldn't have more than three seeds.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.520
We're going to make a forest of trees and the minute we write down a tree that contains an earlier tree,

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.500
forest dies.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.400
So let's first play the game with only one type of seed.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.736
Let's say it's the green seed.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.740
Well the first tree has to have one seed, at most, so I'm gonna just do it, right?

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:07.760
BRADY: Yup.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.780
TONY: Okay, that's it. Can I write down anything else?

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.560
There's no way I can- the next- I'm stopped, I have to stop now, right?

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.560
Clearly, if I could draw this tree for example...

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.000
Alright, but clearly this is contained in this. So this has to stop at one.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.060
That tells me that TREE(1) is one.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.040
Okay?

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.400
So this game stops at one.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.020
Now let's do it with two.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.200
I'm gonna use green and red, okay? Okay, so tree number one.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.880
Doesn't matter; it's gonna have to be out of the red or the green, doesn't make any difference.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.280
I'll choose the green.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.320
Okay, next one! What am I gonna do next?

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.720
Well, I definitely can't draw say, you know, two greens or something like that.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.860
I could do this. I could write down another red, just a red seed like that.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.680
But what could I draw next? Well, anything I draw next is gonna have to contain either the green seed

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.100
or the red seed, so it's going to contain- so, let me just draw an example down, so something like this.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.680
So whatever happens, you know, I'm gonna be able to contain one of these guys in this next one.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.140
This game is stopped at two.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.080
Could I have gone any further than two, though, is that the longest game I could have played?

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.900
It's not. There is a longer game you could have played. Let's play it.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.540
Okay, so I start off with

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.580
my green seed.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.400
Then,

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.700
if I've drawn two red seeds

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.560
Okay, that's fine. I think that- can I carry on? Yes. I can, I can draw a red seed.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.549
Because remember, the rule is:

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.200
you can't- if you draw down a tree that contains an EARLIER tree, that's not allowed.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.480
But this tree

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.940
doesn't contain either of these two, okay?

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.620
So I've actually managed to make this game last three trees. And actually I can't go any further.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.280
So that tells me that TREE(2)

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:56.980
is three.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.980
So what this tree thing is telling us is the length of the longest game that you could play this way.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.500
So now, Brady, have you got a bit of time on your hands?

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.120
Now we're gonna use three different types of seeds, three different colors: red, black, and green, okay?

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.200
Well, what's the longest game we could play?

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:21.020
Well, you could start off with a green. You could maybe do this red, if you wanted to,

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:22.600
you know...

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:28.340
Uhhh... What else could you do? You could do this guy, I suppose, something like this.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.300
I mean, there's all sorts you could start to write down... I mean you can go on and on and on, right?

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.700
What's the longest game you could play? The longest game you could play

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.940
is TREE(3). It's the answer. Now how big is that number?

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.220
Now one thing you might ask is: is it infinite?

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.420
It's not infinite. It's definitely finite. It's just really really really really really really really really really...

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.940
I can't express how really big it is. It's off the scale big.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:05.760
So, literally we go from 1, 3, off the scale. It's mad, it's just- literally just by increasing number of seeds by one,

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:11.900
we suddenly go absolutely off the scale in this number, the longest game that you could play.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:17.880
How big is it? We said, back in the day, that if you try to picture Graham's Number in your head,

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.220
right, it would make your head collapse to form a black hole.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.160
*Rumbling*

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.400
*Rumbling, faint whistling*

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.940
*Reverb effect* Well, because- there's a sort of maximum amount of what we call entropy

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.480
that can be stored in your head...

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:35.260
Well, with TREE(3), even if you had Graham's Number of people and you just said to them each,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.380
you know, you just picture an equal amount of TREE(3),

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.160
all of them would have their heads collapse into a black hole! *breaks into laughter*

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.120
It's mad. It's so big. There is a lower bound on it that involves Ackermann numbers.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.380
Ackermann numbers themselves are off the scale. This is just some rubbish lower bound on it.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.620
BRADY: So, but it's not- it's not- it's also not narrowed down, it's between two bounds.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.640
TONY: No. We don't have an upper bound on it. Well, we know it's not infinite,

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.740
but there's no known upper bound, but what there is known is a lower bound.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.380
It's bigger- well, it's certainly bigger than 3, for example. *breaks into laughter*

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:09.280
It's certainly bigger than 4, but it's also bigger than this very large number,

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:15.600
Uhhh... in particular, Ackermann's Number. It's actually Ackermann's number taken to an Ackermann amount

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:21.580
of iterations, it's just stupid. It's just- you can't even picture it.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.500
Okay, there's no physical process you can use to describe it.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:29.840
What is it good for? What is it useful for? What does any of this got to do with anything that's important?

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:36.440
BRADY: So if you'd like to find out what TREE(3) is good for, also to hear a bit more about how big it is,

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.140
and also how you can make even bigger numbers,

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:43.540
We've got about 10 minutes of extra footage from this interview with Tony.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:49.800
And I'm putting it on our second channel Numberphile2, which is where we put extra stuff like that.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.500
There'll be a link on the screen and in the video description.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:57.120
Have you subscribed to Numberphile2? If you like all that extra stuff, you probably should.
