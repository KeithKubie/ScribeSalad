00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.780
So now, we're ready for a quiz to see that

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.160
you understand the meaning of assignment. So the question is, what

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.550
is the value that the variable hours refers to after running

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.750
this code? And the code is below. First, we have an

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.960
assignment statement assigning the value 9 to the variable hours. Then,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.520
we have another assignment statement where the right side is hours

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.749
plus 1 and the left side is hours. And then we

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:26.447
have another assignment statement where the left side is hours, and

00:00:26.447 --> 00:00:33.364
the right side is hours times 2. So the possible answers, the value of hours is

00:00:33.364 --> 00:00:40.384
9, the value of hours is 10, the value of hours is 18, the value of

00:00:40.384 --> 00:00:46.927
hours is 20, the value of hours is 22, or it's an error. So try to

00:00:46.927 --> 00:00:49.324
figure out the answer yourself without evaluating this

00:00:49.324 --> 00:00:51.575
code in the interpreter. If you want to evaluate code

00:00:51.575 --> 00:00:54.460
in the interpreter, though, it's certainly a good idea to try that.
