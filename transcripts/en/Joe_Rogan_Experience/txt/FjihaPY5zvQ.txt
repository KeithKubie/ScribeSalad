Speaker 1:          00:00:02       It's just like that the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you, brought to you by a bunch of different things. All of them. Embarrassing when talking in front of a new guest. One of them is the flashlight. The flashlight is the number one sex toy for men and people. That's ridiculous. That's preposterous. Why would you want to be involved in something like that? Yeah. Cool man. Why not? Well, the issue is, you know that there's something pornographic about it cause it's like, you know, it's a visual vagina too. It's not just a masturbation device. I think some people have issue with the fact that it actually looks like a vagina. I think it would be less offensive. It was just a hole. But there's something, there's a pornographic element of it being a fake vagina that some people are uneasy with. A Brian ease back, bro.

Speaker 1:          00:00:47       Everybody is into pulling things open these days. What's that about? Stop that. Um, anyway, it's, it's a great tool for masturbation and you're going to masturbate, cut it out. Everybody does. Let's be real. This is way better than your hands. Many ways to masturbate. There's actual masturbation you can get real fun. Aw, you can get four on all these various various ways. Don't you feel like there's some people that get off on bragging and they can't wait to talk to you? They tell you all the awesome shit they've accomplished and like every time you're around them, you just like waiting for it and then they just get it off on you. Oh, it's like they just came when your tits. True. Yeah. Well, I think that we all have a desire to be understood and to be acknowledged and appreciated human things. So I feel like if we can try to be compassionate to that idea than we should have, give it, give it to people.

Speaker 1:          00:01:38       Like my friend always used to tell me, just just, just give it their all. Doing the best they can. We're all doing the best we can. Good way of looking at him. And that's a healthy way of looking at it. Just give it to them. Yeah. I wouldn't, don't, don't resist. Right. Yeah. They're not doing anything terrible. It's just silly. Yeah. Well, you know, Jason Silva dropping knowledge on you bitches. Anyway, we're still doing a commercial, unfortunately. Oh, I didn't realize that. That's how we do it, dude. We sneaking up on people. It's Ninja style. Uh, go to Joe rogan.net. Click on the link for the fleshlight and enter in the code name Rogan, and you will get 15% off. The number one sex toy for men were also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that's o n n I t. Makers of Alpha brain, the cognitive enhancing supplement or nootropic.

Speaker 1:          00:02:20       Are you aware of nootropics who we're trying that stuff? Um, well, you know, I'm a big Fan of David Pearson is he didn't his stick imperative where he's talking about genetically rewriting the human genome so that bliss becomes the norm of mental health. Know talking about using technology to augment consciousness, but do it, do it in a sort of, how freaky would that be? If we got to a point we could reengineer the mind so that you are in a state of ecstasy all day. Like you're on. I'll do. Why not? Steve Silberman, who wrote that article about Steve Jobs talked about performing a metacognitive hack of the human operating system. Whether you use like yoga or meditation, to use the mind to watch the mind and ultimately to upgrade the mind whether you do it, you know, our thoughts shape our spaces and our spaces return the favor like we build environments and turn go. We engage

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       in feedback loops with those environments and they changed the way we think. My iPhone changes the way I think my blackberry changes the way I think the Internet changes the way I think. Movies I watched changed the way I think to you or go out of your way to take like healthy foods in your body and all about brown rice supplements. I take the eyes follow Kurzweil's like pill. Yeah, I do. I do as well. Yeah. There's a certain dramatic thing about Kurzweil in that I wanted to talk about this after we're done with the documentary or done with the commercial, rather. His documentary was so fascinating. Transcendent man. Yeah, transcendent. So moving, but also so dramatic because you realize this guy's not getting any younger and he's on this weird quest to be there when it all goes down. You know, he wants to see it all go down, man, that guy.

Speaker 2:          00:03:46       So Do, I guess I do too. I think, you know, but the, the idea that you can hang on until this thing just completely fucking changes right in front of our face. Yeah. Well, you know, I think, but it's kind of intuitive because it's actually coming a lot faster than people think. And it has to do with one of the basic tenants of his ideas is the exponential growth curves of technology and what it calls the law of accelerating returns. I mean, the fact that you're the cell phone in your pocket today is a million times cheaper, a million times smaller, and a thousand times more powerful than a $60 million supercomputer was in the 1966 40 years ago saying that it's a billion fold increase, billion fold increase in price performance. That's not stopping. It's so crazy. So in the next 25 years, blood cell size devices, trillion times more powerful than that.

Speaker 2:          00:04:26       Interfacing with your biological neurons in real time. And that's not even getting into the spillover into biology, which is now becoming an information technology. Freeman Dyson who's a top, like one of the top physicists in the world says in the near future, new generation of artists will be writing genomes with the fluency that Blake and Byron and Shakespeare wrote versus, so it's this idea that the canvas of life itself is the new instrument for aesthetic design. Das On, you're blowing my mind here, playing jazz, playing jazz with biology. Like imagine how we poverished the world would have been if we hadn't invented the technology of oil painting and time for Van Gogh or the technology of the instrument in time for Beethoven and Mozart to unfurl through it. So imagine now that the canvas of life itself, what might we create with it? I mean we use the alphabet to engender alphabetic rapture with Shakespeare.

Speaker 2:          00:05:08       What are we going to make with life? That's, that's where we're heading. And if you go to Joe Rogan, done that and click on the link for on and.com and then to then Dakota Ne Rogan, you will get 10% off all of our nootropic product. And just, uh, just as a disclaimer, Jason Silva is not on this shit. He's on his own thing. He's on his own mixture. Uh, but uh, if you want to try alpha brain, it's an excellent one. I use it. I endorse it. I have a financial stake in it because I believe in it. It's awesome stuff. It's fucking the best shit ever. If you're hung over or if you're jet lagged, I love it. Jet Lag. Jet Lag is, you know, I hate jet lag. It's fucking brutal, man. You have a dry sponge of a brain. That's a terrible feeling. You know, until you can pop your head back in. It's really hard for me because I get jet lag and then I have to perform like you gotta to go on stage. Jetlagged your sense, try to shake that shit off. It's hard. But think about it. I mean, think about what your body is being subjected to

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       him. You're transcending. It's the inherent limitations of time, space and distance. When you're crossing the world in just a few hours, your body evolved in a universe in which that was not plausible and now it is. Can't be good for us. Well, it can't be good for you. It's just, it takes a little getting used to it. It's, it's startling I think to the system. I think it freaks your body to fuck. Exactly. So for me in the alphabet is one of the best things for a, as soon as I land I take it and it doesn't cure it. It helps. It sounds, and this is no limitless pill, folks, was just vitamins for your brain. New Google nootropics. If you're into it, go to [inaudible] Dot Com oh and n. N. I. T. We have a bunch of different shit. Shroom tech sport is a great supplement for working out shroom tech immune.

Speaker 1:          00:06:39       This is a immunity enhance supplement. All these things are explained online. We're going away out of our way. They try to make it as clear as possible. With all of these things are and what the ingredients are, if there's any risks. He was taking anything for anybody and as I always say, if you're, if you're interested in this but you think it's too expensive, I urge you to go online and look at our recipe and copy it. I don't give a fuck. Go buy the shit and bulk. Aubrey just had, I have a new scientific and an advisor. Yeah, I also did, I think you can go to your website and there's a thread now and sign up and go on the message board. There's a thread where there's a, we have a scientific advisor that's just hired just to answer questions about about anet stuff, so we're trying to do this as clean as possible and make it more clean.

Speaker 1:          00:07:25       Everything you order is a 30 day 100% money back to not, not 30 day, 30 pills supply 100% money back guarantee. If you don't even have to return it, just tell us he didn't like it and you get your money back. And we used to have it so that you could whatever order you ordered it, you get your money back. But dudes, we're selling it on Ebay. They hacked us and they hacked our silly system. So we had to change it to the first 30 pills. I ain't hating. You know, you gotta do what you've gotta do, you know? Um, so, uh, anyway, uh, just go check all that stuff out on a.com. O n n I t enter in code name Brogan. Get 10% off. All right, Brian, cue the music. This is going to be certain. Yeah, bank epic sense

Speaker 3:          00:08:05       [inaudible] then it becomes a totally different thing. [inaudible] I love it.

Speaker 1:          00:08:17       Dude. I love the environment you've created here. Brian. Is that a Ufo? You're fucking tripping me out. The idea of artists using genomes or jeans for for their canvas. Dat is one of the most amazing new ideas that I've heard that that that just, that statement really makes you like change the way you look at things like, oh yeah, really well especially when the guy that said that phrase is Freeman Dyson who's considered the world's most eminent physicists. I mean he's on par with Einstein and when I mean, but he obviously is also a poet because the way he says it in the future, a new generation of artists will be writing genomes with the fluency that Blake and Byron wrote verses. In fact, I just saw him speak at dealed the in Munich and he said that soon we'll have the entire biosphere in the palm of our hands. So imagine what that means. We might be like evolutions, secrets reputable, right? Absolutely. It's inevitable. If you look at the progress that's been made, it's not going to stop. What is great and man is that he is a bridge and not an end said Nietzsche. It's so amazing to be here right now while it's all going down. This is like the bottom of the funnel, so know where it happening so fucking ridiculously fast.

Speaker 4:          00:09:24       It is. It's the first time in history that we don't need time lapse photography to be able to witness it. You know, it's like a, you don't see a plant growing, but with time lapse you can actually see that the plant is alive and that it's growing and that if you could see human progress over just the last hundred years through time lapse, you would literally see that. It's like our thoughts spillover into the world. I mean, that's what human imagination is, right? Our ability to conjure up future possibilities, pick the most delightful one, pull the present forward to meet it. I mean the airplane, the jetliner, the Internet, it all started in somebody's mind or in a group of minds and then it kind of spilled over. Like we literally live in condensations of our imagination. Terence Mckenna used to say that, which sounds psychedelic except it's literally true,

Speaker 1:          00:10:00       right? I've always thought that it's such a strange thing that the imagination is this invisible, wistful thing that's inside your head that doesn't really exist. It's just your imagination. But from that comes everything that's solid. Everything. Everything that's been created has been thought up in the imagination and somehow or another, and it's, it's so weird that we sort of have this like flippant view of the imagination. I mean we, we, we value creativity for sure, but just the idea of what, imagining it's almost like we get to work, we value

Speaker 4:          00:10:30       creativity, but we don't give it the kind of status that it merits. Um, is it James Glick who wrote the information? It's a book that talks about how the fundamental building block of reality might actually be information. He talks about it from bit, so everything is information. And he wrote a fantastic article where he talks about how it turns out that our neuro are, are our ideas. Ideas are just as real as the neurons. Dane habits and ideas. It's like a new kingdom that rises above the biosphere and the Denisons of this kingdom. Our ideas, ideas have retained the properties of organisms. They have infectivity, they have spreading power. They leap from brain to brain. They compete for the limited resources of our attention. And here's the most interesting thing. Even though ideas are not made of nucleic acid, they have achieved more evolutionary change at a rate that it leaves the old gene panting far behind.

Speaker 4:          00:11:18       So ideas you know to say that ideas change the world or they transform reality is not a metaphor. Ideas do transform reality. In fact, it turns form reality better than biological evolution did and Terence Mckenna actually said that the moment that we invented language, biological evolution essentially stopped and evolution became a cultural epigenetic phenomenon because now we're taking matter of little organization. It goes through our mental filters and it pops out as iPhones and space shuttles. I mean this is all the human brain, the most complex thing in the universe that's producing the world that we inhabit and so on and so forth.

Speaker 1:          00:11:49       Timber Possible. It's impossible to wrap your head around. That's like the end it. It's like

Speaker 5:          00:11:54       trying to figure out where it's going to go from here. It's like what the fuck is going to happen? What is going to be the next breakthrough that makes the Internet look like you know, like like a lamp?

Speaker 4:          00:12:04       Well, virtual reality, right? Terence Mckenna also said where each increasingly moving into universities of our own construction, right? Paula Antonelli, uh, from the Moma in New York City, she talks about, she did an exhibit called design and the elastic mind. And recently they did an exhibit called talk to me about how we interface with our technological tools, which is very much the whole Marshall Mcluhan. Like first we build the tools and then they billed us and uh, she talks about existence maximum. She says that, you know, personal, personal iPods for example, allow us to create customized playlist. So essentially we can all impose soundtracks on our lives. So we're each living in different universes because we each are scoring our lives and instrumenting our lives in different ways. And reality therefore is further sort of a separated into individual subjective universes. So to say that we each live in our own reality is absolutely true. Instead of living in a sort of consensus trans where each increasingly moving into our own customized utopias, our own lucid dreams. And that's amazing.

Speaker 5:          00:12:58       Is that really possible? Is that really what's going on? Is it, all of our realities are imaginary things that we've created that are interacting with others.

Speaker 4:          00:13:06       Well, Robert Anton Wilson talks about your reality tunnels. I mean certainly there is an element of consensus reality where we sort of respect each other and acknowledge each other as other entities that we share space with. But um, but certainly like how I perceive moment to moment reality is a, is edited by my preconceptions, by my stereotypes, by the way. I was brought up by certain belief systems and so on and so forth. These things act as filters that skew how I perceive things and we're all stuck in our reality tunnels and people talk about illumination and shedding your reality tunnels to seeing sort of broader, more, you know, interesting, uh, varied realities and um, yeah, I definitely think that we're each in individual Rhea and realities.

Speaker 5:          00:13:47       Do you think that we're gaining some new, uh, cognitive functions and some, some new abilities to read each other and to have insight into each other because of technology?

Speaker 4:          00:14:00       Yeah, I mean, I think that the first information technology was language in the alphabet. You know what I mean? People always like criticize technologies. You know, when we invented writing, it's, it's been said that Socrates use to say that you should never write anything down because it was going to rock our brains. And this technology of writing was this terrible thing. And then it kind of becomes so embedded in who and what we are at. JC rocks it too,

Speaker 5:          00:14:22       Jay z and Socrates, cause Jay Z, I've always been amazed that he doesn't write a name of his raps down. That's, he's so brilliant. He just keeps them all in his head and it's, and, and w um, Everlast is the same way. It doesn't write anything down.

Speaker 4:          00:14:36       Yeah. Well, I mean, I mean whatever works for each person, but I think that what I'm,

Speaker 5:          00:14:40       yeah, they, they feel like they should, as a, as a, as an artist, the able to spew out all their best stuff,

Speaker 4:          00:14:46       but even, even language and thinking in the technology too, I mean, we're still depending on various components of the brain to do certain functions. So I think this, what do we call this skin bag bias? I mean this assumption that it's better if it's all coming from within us. I think our actual mines are actually part of a dance between our brains and our environments and our tools. I mean, I outsource part of our cognition to the iPhone. There's a whole, it's clear he called the extended mind thesis or the you literally, you create artful change in the world using the magic wand. No one has the iPhone. It stores part of your memory. It allows you to interface with reality and actually cause change in reality. Amber cases, a cyborg anthropologist, she says, our smartphones basically give us technologically mediated telepathy. SMS is basically sending your thoughts through time and space at the speed of light. By pressing a few buttons, you become telepathic. All you have to do is embrace the idea that that's a part of you. It's the extended phenotype that Richard Dawkins or talks about, right? It's you know, termites build termite colonies. Termite colonies are part of this termite species. You know what we produce is part of our extended phenotype. It's a part of us. It's not separate from us. I think that idea is,

Speaker 5:          00:15:54       so this is connecting us to us, this is really just connecting us to us, this Hanson who you are, because you are the connection between you and all the other positive organisms around you. And the more you can, the more you can keep that going exponentially that happy or in the better your life will be. Yes, this really is an enhancement. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:16:14       Emerged and evolved the same way biological functions and features emerge and evolve. You know, Kevin Kelly's treaties on this, what technology wants is a fantastic, and he talks about how technology has a direction that has tendencies and whatnot. And, and Ray Kurzweil of course, who's the, who's a friend and hero, I mean he says, he says, our ability to create virtual models, virtual reality in our heads combined simply with our modest looking thumbs, was sufficient to usher in literally a secondary force of evolution called technology. And it will continue at an accelerating pace until the entire universe is at our fingertips. And the thing is people say, wow, how poetic coming to fork will accept what he's saying is these exponential growth curves of technology and then impregnating computation into matter with nanotechnology or impregnating manmade evolution into synthetic biology or artificial life. These convergence of these exponentially growing technologies are literally, you know, it's like a steward brand says we are as gods and might as well get good at it. Like having invented the gods, we can turn into them. It's not to say like instead of praying for transcendence, let's engineer transcendence, let's engineer ourselves into blissful, you know, utopic

Speaker 5:          00:17:19       existence hopefully, or nuclear war. That's the other problem. The problem is a man is also wicked good at blowing shit up. You know, like it seems like at our highest levels of technology, the best shit we have is the most impressive shit because the shit that can just wipe things out. Like has there ever been anything more impressive than atomic power? Is there ever been anything more oppressive than the idea of you just a reset button for a whole city? That's insane.

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       Yeah. The idea that that became an option. Yeah. I mean one, one, one has to acknowledge that you know, technology extends who and what we are and you know, you can use the alphabet to compose experienced scientists or you can use the alphabet to compose hate speech. So something that extends your thought reach envisioned kind of like a scaffold and can be used in any direction, but it's up to the cultural. So that's what the cultural conversation is all about. And that's where the story of who and what we are and that's where culture plays a key role. How are we going to use these tools? The scientists all have almost an obligation to chase down every idea. Well that's what humans do. So for them it's like they have that justification. I'm sure they had it when they built the first atomic bomb that we must build it before the Germans.

Speaker 2:          00:18:30       Right? I mean it wasn't that what they, let's probably what they wanted to make sure that the Germans could have easily done it to us first and then we would have been fucked. And that was the idea. Sure. I mean, that's I guess where a change in consciousness is as important as the power of our tools, you know? Yeah. Easily more important. Right? That some more. It's like w we have to grow up first before we can use all this crazy shit we have. Yeah. And we're not necessarily completely grown up, but yeah, no, it's possible though, right? Well, we're on our way. There is a great, uh, Steven pinker did a Ted talk called the myth of violence and he says that contrary to the media environment, that, you know, if it bleeds, it leads. The reality is that the world is getting safer all the time and the chances of a man dying at the hands of another man are lower than they've ever been.

Speaker 2:          00:19:13       And he chronicles the decline in violence over the last hundred years. And it's like totally counterintuitive because it's totally not what you think and, but you know, this guy's like well researched and it's unbelievable. Or Hahn's robling who has a website called gapminder that actually shows you the progress across the world and all the people coming out of poverty and all these things that are happening that actually point to, you know, things getting infinitely better across a variety of indicators. And yet this is not what you hear on the news because it doesn't make the headlines. Because if it bleeds, it leads. And that's unfortunate. Well, I think it's just a numbers issue. I don't think we're supposed to have access to 300 million lies because if there's 300 million people and that's who we're including in our news and this happened here and that happened there, you're going to get a lot of fucked up shit.

Speaker 2:          00:19:56       Yeah, but per capita really not that much per capita. America's pretty Goddamn Save. Totally. It's, you know, even the world has never been safer. I mean, the world's never been safe for them to have this many people and to be this safe, like the pessimistic all day. But you've got to point towards there's some progress going on, some sort of social progress going on. Well, I think that the Ted Conference, that's why it's such a sort of wondrous force in nature because I think that they've brought back, uh, the academics and made them sexy and the intelligentsia is out there chronicling all the progress that has been made in technology and entertainment and design and also pointing to what's wrong but in a sort of smart, mature way. And that's a phenomenon like that like makes me happy. Like in an age of, you know, reality television. Like we also have, you know, the Ted Conference and the Ted talks.

Speaker 2:          00:20:45       Yeah. I think I was thinking about this today in my car. I was like, this is the only time ever where people really, uh, as a whole group, we're exposed to all sorts of alternative ideas without having to continue your education without, without being, you know, like I think for a lot of our parents when they got out of school and you know, and then they started working like, what do they do? They picked up the paper now and again. You know what I'm saying? Like what you heard, what Walter Cronkite told Ya on the evening news, like your access to what the fuck was really going on was ridiculously small. No, anything they do or lost there were thinking captain America was out there saving the world. They were like little children. Totally. The difference between that and what your children are going to have, the access they're going to have from birth, it's insane.

Speaker 2:          00:21:34       It's not even the same species. It's not the same reality informationally. It's like it's not even the same reality. Totally spot on. I don't what you're saying. I don't think we even realize how crazy it is because we're caught up in this cyclone and we just have accepted. That's why they call it a singularity and that's why such a great metaphor and you know it's not the only one. We had a singularity when we invented language. I mean life after language is impossible to imagine. I think to people on the, on the other side of the line like pre-language beings cannot imagine what life after all, it's only been a hundred thousand years. You had a brilliant thing. We were talking online, one of your videos where you were talking about Manhattan. Yeah. And how you were described. Please say that, uh, there's a new book by David Deutsch.

Speaker 2:          00:22:15       He's a quantum physicist and genius is called the beginning of infinity. And I read this New York Times Review of the book before I even found a book, but it was like, it was, the guy was saying it was his mesmerizing intellect. I'm just to give you an example of where his head is at. He says, if you consider the typology of Manhattan as it exists today, so the physical topography of that entire land mass is no longer shaped by the forces of geology. Literally geology has been trumped by the forces of mind manifested as economics, culture, uh, you know, human behavior. So we're literally artifacting landscapes now like mind over matter literalized. And what he's saying is that that might ultimately be the fate of the whole universe. And that gravitation and anti matter only govern the universe at its least interesting stages. But where we're moving in terms of the ability of mind to shape reality as in the physical topography of Manhattan and the world at large is that eventually that will be the face of the whole universe.

Speaker 2:          00:23:14       So sub straight independent minds impregnating intelligence into the COSMO's. We're talking like death star two we're talking, we're talking death cause like shit. I was going to say like a cosmic symphony during the crescendo stretching on forever like wow. Or the death star or the debt's never how bad ass the death star was. Can pull up a whole fucking planet. You better shut your mouth, bitch. They built a fake planet gone down. Shh. Come on man. That's an amazing accomplishment as well. If someone started building the death star, they would have to keep going. They would have to see if they could do it. Yeah, they can. You just can't fund that project. Folks don't don't from the desk to our project, noon is going to be that star. It's going to be Dick Cheney's head out in space. It's going to be a robotic. Dick Cheney had actually space is a very exciting frontier.

Speaker 2:          00:24:05       Now with the privatization of space, we're going to see you like radical innovation. I mean, you have this new generation of techno philanthropists. It has to be privatized, right? You have to let people try to come up with some crazy shit. Not only that, but the people that are behind it are people who have made billions in the information age, who have the resources of nation states and now individuals, visionaries, private individuals have the power that only government used to have. This is actually talked about. You should have a peanuts would scares people that anybody could just build some rockets and just launch them on people. You know? It's like that's where it starts from. I mean, the, the money behind all these space ideas. Yeah, let's go up and stay all that shit. It's military. They want to make sure that they have the ability to communicate, watch shit, dropped bombs.

Speaker 2:          00:24:47       Fuck you up, get you quicker. I mean that's, that's, that's what funds a lot of innovation when it comes to, I mean, yeah, at first a lot of innovation has come from military research, but it very quickly translate down to consumers. I mean the fact that because of the money involved, right? Isn't it, I mean the military contracts or junking it's because of the resources required. But I mean, when you consider the fact that gps on your smartphone today is largely free, credible, or that a person with a cell phone in Africa today has better communications technology than the US president did 25 years ago. And you know, a billion people buying smartphones for the first time, what they call the rising billion. They're coming online, joining the global conversations, a billion new minds coming on, coming online, you know, joining the global brand. I mean, it really is encouraging I think.

Speaker 2:          00:25:31       And uh, you know, you should have, you should talk to Peter Diamandis. He started the x Prize Foundation and cofounder, Singularity University with Kurzweil. He's got a new book all about how we can leverage emerging technologies to transform the world for the better. Like infinitely. So it's called the abundance. So how come we make 80 and t to keep a fucking phone going? How can we can't get that? How come we can't get a call to not drop? Yeah. Is that possible? That's ridiculous. Why is that still going on? You know what phone calls still drop from time to time. Wonky system. The incredible shift that we have now. Why at and t why we just can't keep up with the at and t Verizon doesn't fuck me. Like they all fuck up. They all use the same towers, don't you? Silly boy. They have two totally different signals.

Speaker 2:          00:26:18       Well, I'm not Verizon and at t and d but like if you look at what's going on with sprint right now and, and uh, Verizon I think it is, uh, they all should piggyback off each other's towers and then I would go with sprint to cause Verizon's awesome. And at t and t can suck it. Yeah. About that. I'm not a fan of both horizon in aids. He's definitely better if you want to be able to get online while you were on a call. Yeah. Because he can't do it. [inaudible] that is three gene technology. You realize how great the iPhone is. If you go to Canada, then you go to Canada. There cells on system is way better than ours. They don't drop calls up there. It's fucking awesome. Like Rogers visit, nobody wants juice. Yeah, I think so. It's great. I think that the iPhone is the modern magic wand.

Speaker 2:          00:26:59       I mean, when you consider the amount of magic, well, Arthur C. Clarke, sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. I mean, there comes a point when something, when an instrument of man is transcendent, that it literally change how he relates to the to reality. I think the iPhone is on that scale of, of innovation. I mean it really, or to show the iPhone to somebody 200 years ago, they would've thought that you are a god. Right? I mean that is a magical machine who, where are you when you're on a telephone call to the other side of the planet? I mean, they're hearing your voice or they're hearing a representation of your voice, except it's in real time and it responds to feedback instantly. Are you here? Are you there? He just embodied Eddie Griffin had the best bit ever. Yeah. I'm the guy who invented telephones. He goes, how high you got to be to be sitting around going, I want to talk to someone who isn't even here.

Speaker 2:          00:27:52       Totally, but see you just hit the nail in the head. Just how psychedelic it's modern information technology is, you know John Markoff wrote a book called what the dormouse said. It's a true history of silicon valley innovation in the 60s and it's all about how a Douglas Engelbart and the Xerox Parc and all these people that we're trying to augment human intelligence by any means necessary. The birth of the computing revolution and a and how they collided with the counterculture and the psychedelic movement of the 60s half of these engineers were all like tripping out and computers were all of a sudden reconfigured. It wasn't these big like government centralized machines, but no computers could be extensions of the human mind. And Timothy leary came out in the 80s and says, guess what? The computers, the LSD of the nineties. I mean, that's literally what it was because computers aren't what mind manifests.

Speaker 2:          00:28:36       Things like expanding your sphere of possibility, expanding your mind. I mean these are psychedelic slogans being applied to technology. And I think that that's spot on. I think you're right. Um, I think the interaction that you have with social networks, with Facebook and Twitter and message boards and stuff like that, you're the, it's, it accelerates your, your sphere of ideas. So incredibly, I think about, not just because of people like, uh, people sending you fascinating things, but other people's points of view and comments on them. Well, you know, you'll sometimes, this is one of the more interesting things. I'll watch a great video that I want to read the comments because you know, every now and then, you know, you go, wow, that guy just put it in at a unique perspective that I hadn't considered before. Totally. I mean, it allows, you know, spaces for innovation where ideas can have sex and it's like similar to genetic recombination in nature. So ideas having spaces and liquid networks. As Steven Johnson talks about, uh, spaces where they can complete each other, where they can intermingle, where they can and recombined. I mean, we're having the primordial soup of human culture creating a new replicator and these replicators achieving more change

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       than biological evolution ever did. And so that's where things get kind of crazy, what they call the new Oh, sphere is this new thing that rises above the biosphere or psyche where mind lives and, and guess what it mind is now transcending time, space and distance. We become posts, geographical beings were shared, passions can conjure self organization and teamwork and collaboration and cooperation and these open spaces without like entropy getting in the way without having to like get over there, the Labor that it takes to get over there to meet that person.

Speaker 1:          00:30:12       No. What was the idea that Mckenna had? That there's like some transcendent object at the end of time that's pulling us towards it. And as we get closer to it, we become more like it. Is that what it is? I think that that was his, his, his, his metaphor. Crazy way of looking at it.

Speaker 4:          00:30:29       Yeah. I mean, uh, the, the metaphor, everybody uses a different word, you know, Kurzweil coins at the singularity, which is a metaphor borrowed from physics to describe what happens when you go through a black hole, which is to say all the laws of physics collapsed. So you borrow that to describe this kind of event horizon that's just within our reach where it almost becomes impossible to define or describe. Because at that point we're going to be so deeply intertwined with these new tools that are going to change the way we think and perceive and, and are basically, and mechanic might have a different name for it, you know, uh, this guy used to call it the Omega point, you know, Pierre de Chardin is Jesuit priests talked about a move towards the Omega point. I mean, all the metaphors are there. And uh, I mean I definitely, I mean w w w already there, we thought we fly through the air and talk on the phone and surf the web and machines with wings on them over oceans.

Speaker 1:          00:31:17       Yeah, no shit. Where are we? Where are we? That the plane thing is amazing, that it's still the same thing. It's still getting the tube fly in the air. Like we haven't figured that, that hasn't really gotten any better. Well that someone that does economics, it's just the price of what it is. I mean, we've still, I mean, they've become much safer. I think the, the chances of having an accidents like 125 million, so it's, yeah, it's way safer. It's just still the same thing. It's still just crazy. It's the scope teleportation. When's that going to pop up? Because it seems like this plain things been going on for a while. Like really? That's it. That's as good as we can do it. I feel like there's some other shit, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:31:52       that'd be cool when we could transfer brains, like, like you have like a empty soul over on the other side. So you'd be like, all right, I'm just going to transfer my brain into an adult brain probably of human copy. Yeah. And that was Kurzweil's idea, right? The, to be able to copy yourself into a operating system. Well, I mean, yes. And that creates that fear. Just philosophical conundrum because it says if you scan your brand and you put it in a computer, then which is you, that one or this one. When he says that, that's not how actually how it's going to happen. What's going to happen is more and more of our biology is going to be replaced by non biological components, but it'll be millions of baby steps. So first you'll replace 5% then 10% and eventually after a bunch of gradual steps, you're all non biological, but you never felt any change. So that's how it's still you.

Speaker 1:          00:32:35       I know a dude who has an artificial knee and he was just telling me about his artificial knee and I was just thinking about yet

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       a knee replacement and I was thinking about it. I was like, wow, this is how it begins. He's just walking around. He's got a fake knee. Dude is walking around. Totally is bionic. I know we're already, we're already cyborgs. I mean, think about it. Our cars, our exoskeletons, so our, our airplanes, these are suits that we put on that transformed the way we interface with, I mean, we're already looks like a Mustang. Yeah. Really? Yeah. It really is it just you, that's why people want them to look cool. This is my cool suit total around it. And some people, you know, some people get a little freaked out and they're like, oh, but this is unnatural. But it's actually not because the same a biosphere that sprouted human beings and sprouted flowers sprouted the microchip. I mean Buckminster Fuller said, start with the universe. If you look at Earth as a planetary system, everything that comes out of it is natural.

Speaker 2:          00:33:24       That means that the micro chip, the iPhone is as natural as a tree. What's amazing because it's following the same kind of momentum. I think that began with the big bang and his self organizing properties that are just sprouting. All these innovation, evolution evolving don't involve ability, I think is the term that Kevin Kelly use that it's insane. It's insane. Right. And it is a good antidote to existential malaise, right? I mean, th th the continuum of the continuing fact of death, the death sentence that hovers over human beings makes life very, we're very silly in that fact that we will, people want to concentrate on that end and know it's coming. It's coming, it's coming and like way before it ever gets there. You fucking Shit your pants on it. You know? It's like, yeah, it's going to come, but you've got to enjoy this.

Speaker 2:          00:34:06       You got to learn how to enjoy this. The best way to be happy. The only way, the only way to truly be happy is to do what you want to do and enjoy this. Oh yeah. You, you, you can make plans for the future and you can discipline yourself and you could set goals. That's all well and good, but you better be enjoying this. Oh, you have to, otherwise you're being silly person. Yeah. Yeah. Well you got, you got to find what gets you off and, and try to make sure that whatever gets you off is also functionally productive. Yeah. So yeah, it doesn't put anything negative out there. Right. And I, you know, Carl Sagan coined the term wonder junkie. And I think that's like an awesome one to describe. Like, you know, the love of knowledge, a lust to for ideas and ideas, recognizing the erotic power of ideas and to think that ideas are not these abstract things, but they're actually a thing that can change the world.

Speaker 2:          00:34:52       Right? You guys have, we've talked about, and it seems like every day, well, my ideas are just, it's weeds, ideas. It's not even mine. I'm just borrowing them. Pulling them out of the sky comes through you, but not from you and belongs not to you. I'm an antenna for the mighty Shiva. Well, Timothy Leary said the brain is a transceiver. But you know what's brilliant about what you just said is because you are creating a podcast now where you are putting out a variety of interesting ideas that reach all sorts of different people and inspires all of these people. So you become a node because you reach millions of minds. You infect those minds with new ideas. Your ideas have virality, spreading power. Infectivity. So think about yourself as participating in the evolutionary process, spreading your scene as it were like that. I should have not been so mean to at. And. T. I'm sorry. I don't know how hard it is to run a network.

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       You guys were the first to have the iPhone. I appreciate you for that. I've been a loyal customer for years. It's not that bad. I was just just making comedy. Oh, I'm sorry. I do have a little ATNT guilt when you think about it that way. Put out some negative energy. I do like the fact that there was a reason I have the at and t phone so I can use the email and the internet

Speaker 4:          00:35:55       at the same you said more than you would think too. I do. I use that a lot. That is a feature I didn't think I would use, but I do. I'm sorry at t and. T I was just fucking with you. He was very interesting that you, that you, that you mentioned, um, that you mentioned marijuana, um, and something that helps you get ideas or are you a cop? Ha, no, we're talking about

Speaker 5:          00:36:14       stuff that's been published. Yo. I think, yeah, well I think anybody smokes marijuana. Ert eats marijuana, especially eats it. Anyone's going to tell you there's an enhancement there. You know, there's the idea of whether or not it's a performance enhancing drug. I say it is. I say it is, you know, I don't think you should be able to fight high. I think if a guy got into UFC high, he might have an advantage for real. I'm not kidding. A cognitive advantage. The real problem with it is that you could've gotten high a week ago and you, there's no way you are completely stone cold sober, but when you take a drug test, that drug tests will show that you test positive for marijuana so you're not under its positive effects whatsoever. It's just the fact that it stays in your, in your fat cells,

Speaker 4:          00:36:56       but that it's contained. It's continued illegality is, is a testament to sort of an intellectual stagnation in our society. I mean, even back in the day, Abraham Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln used to say, provision goes beyond the bounds of reason because it makes it a crime. And things that are not crying by legislating a man's appetite. You can't tell somebody what they can do in the privacy of their own home if they're not hurting anybody else, particularly when so many artists are talking about how it has helped them in so many ways. Norman mailer used to say it was divine for associations. Carl Sagan. Okay. My fricking hero used to rave about marijuana freaking when Carl Sig and he, he's so legit. You gotta say file. We can fucking hear Carl Sagan used to enjoy cannabis. You know, and there was actual article recently in a, in a psychiatry journal that, uh, they looked at marijuana and creativity by studying semantic priming.

Speaker 4:          00:37:42       And semantic priming means if you activate a word, it's immediate associations that get triggered in your head. So if I say bird, you think of when you think of flight, those are normal associations. And it turns out that people that claimed that marijuana made them more creative. It turns out that it induced semantic and I'm sorry, and induced a hyper priming effect in them. So what that means is they cast a wider associate of net. So when you said bird, they didn't just think of wings and flight, they thought of transcending one's limitations going beyond one's limit, soaring above it all. They just cast wider ways of connecting the ideas to other ideas and isn't that what creativity is all about? So for the first time we were able to physiologically quantify the claims made by so many artists and first for society to civil restrict that I think is just, it goes beyond the bounds of reason. It's not reasonable. I know

Speaker 5:          00:38:26       so many people that benefit from it and yet it's still illegal. It's completely logical. It's clear evidence that someone is suppressing behavior.

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       Someone is trying to move forward this, this, this same exact culture that they're enjoying right now. They don't, it's a cycle. It's, it's, it's a psychoactive capability thing as much as it is a thing about it as a commodity, you know, that's one of the things that people don't understand. Marijuana is illegal because of its status as a commodity as much as it is because of its psychoactive effects. Or there's a lot of pharmaceutical companies that do not want it to be legal because it's a, it would be a natural commodity that would cure a lot of ailments, that there are prescription drugs that are available for that people have patents on and they stand to lose millions and millions of dollars. And that's where all their lobbying power, their financial influence, that's all that stuff comes into play. And that's why it's illegal. It's completely preposterous. And that's very embarrassing.

Speaker 1:          00:39:27       It is embarrassing. It's very unfortunate. But I also think, well all of our advocacy advocacy, you know, people have never had more power to create grassroots movement. I mean the same fuel that is fueling, you know, the Arab spring. I think people can band together and demand change. I mean the same way we took down Sopa right? I mean people can get together and create this advocacy and have ultimately the same lobbying power as these corporations. I mean, that's something that the Internet is allowing for. So I think it's certainly moving in that direction, right? I hope so. It feels like it. It feels like people are actually paying attention to what people like the soap a thing. People are actually paying attention to, the reaction that people are having on the Internet and they're going, okay, let's, let's step back here and let's reassess things.

Speaker 1:          00:40:07       And I think ultimately it has to be the way that people decide on things. Yeah. We can't go through all these. Well, the hive mind is deciding. Yeah, well, yeah, it is the hive mind. I mean people go, people are going to hurt. How many really? How much is really, you don't think they're going to be able to fix the hacks and come on, man, there's always going to be a game like that, but it's still red or it'll be self correcting. But that doesn't mean that you'd leave it in the hands of these crazy fucking Diebold people or any of these, you know, you, you've seen those documentaries on, on, on how they were able to fix voting machines. We able to change the results of all, there's been a lot of controversy. I grew up in Venezuela where, uh, you know, we have a president that keeps supposedly getting reelected as he, as he imprisons his political opponents and appropriates, takes over private property.

Speaker 1:          00:40:51       And rumor has, it has been rigging the voting machines. So it's a problem. I uh, I uh, I know that story, that rumor all too well, you know, I don't know who used it. I don't know if it was used, but they do absolutely know for a fact that it's possible to change the votes. It's possible to change the number and the, the scary, those machines allowed a third party input so crazy. So it's just amazing. So they said they probably sold these to these crazy dudes that are running these fucking donkey countries. But then, you know, this strange countries in Afghanistan, you know, I mean look like, like those like warlord type dudes or live in those places. You know what, someone told me the best way they get information from those guys as they give them.

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       Like in Afghanistan they give the dude's Viagra. Wow. And then they give up information on the Taliban like that were so silly. Why at the end, at the end of all of our technology, just a by Agra to quick fix viagara for it's crazy reward warlord type dudes living in the mountains. Wow. It's crazy. It's ridiculous. Where do you think we're going to be in a hundred years, man? How are we going to be living in some sort of a f

Speaker 4:          00:42:05       saturated with intelligence? Oh, virtual reality I think is definitely coming. I think once we hack the nervous system, we won't have to interface with cyberspace through the square little devices. You know, it'll be like Neuromancer you know William Gibson says that cyberspace tapped into our sort of instinct that this, that disinformation world information is spatial and we want to cruise these digital realms and we want to be in, it's like the matrix except not a dystopia. Why does the matrix have to be a cautionary tale? Right. I like the idea of going into my own private universe or like the lucid dream and vanilla sky where the universe is sculpted and based on my preferences and moods and I render things into existence at a faster and faster rate. I mean, we already are living in a world that's shaped by the mind. It's just that the buffer time is shrinking.

Speaker 4:          00:42:50       As the tools get more powerful. Eventually the speed of thought will render things into existence at that sort of lightspeed, that's where we're headed. Jesus Christ. How far away is that? How far away is the speed of thought making material things? Well, out of the ether, you're once we can once Nano Delek trip. Oh, it is like a psychedelic psychedelic offers, a glimpse of the world that's created by mind. We were already living in a world made of language. I mean, everything we inhabit is, is an object, objectification of the imagination that Terence Mckenna is like Terence Mckenna. You know, people say, oh, he was just about advocating psychedelics. He was about much more than that. Terence Mckenna was a futurist, a poet, and a technologist in many way. Who understood that transformative power of, you know, even if he wasn't, it was cool to just listen to him talk. He's, he did was such a head of such a crazy way of phrasing. Right.

Speaker 5:          00:43:41       Thanks. And putting things together is a really interesting dude. Insane. You know, the first time I ever did DMT, I actually heard him talk in my DMT trip. It was the strangest fucking thing ever. Wow. It was so strange because I don't know if you've ever done anything, uh, you ever done anything like that? DMT?

Speaker 4:          00:44:00       No. I can't say that I have, although I've read a lot about it. I'm very curious. Just haven't found the set and setting in time.

Speaker 5:          00:44:08       Mckenna always just talk about heavy psychedelic trips. One of the things he said is, did not give into astonishment. That there's a voice inside the Dmt trip that tells you do not give into astonishment. And that's the first time I did it. I blasted through and you could literally hear it, but you don't hear it. You don't hear it, but it's sand. Do not give into astonishment. I was like, wow, this is

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       the craziest shit ever. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well that's uh, I just, it's like, yeah, I love the word astonishment because it's like, well, I mean it's like what he's teasing at is, is, is this idea of astonishment, wonder, awe. Like rapturous ought to be pulled from context to you. Tom Robbins, Tom Robins, the writer, he, he's a comedian as well maybe or something. But he wrote about this guy, Tom Robbins was writing about psychedelics and he said, the plant Jeanie's as this, the saint marijuana or psychedelics, the plant Jeanie's do not necessarily manufacture imagination or wonder men. It's not that they make you more imaginative, but what they do or what they can do is pull us out of context so dramatically that we ended up gawking and amazement that the ubiquitous everyday wanders we're culturally conditioned to ignore. But you don't need drugs to be pulled from context.

Speaker 2:          00:45:18       That's just one way that some people do it. You can do it by traveling. You can do and falling in love. You can do it by having the rug pulled from underneath your feet. Just be inspired. Yes. So we, you know, but then we have this other thing called hedonic adaptation, which is what trumps everything that's always around becomes invisible. And that's why we always need novelty because we don't appreciate what we have because we got used to it because the brain gets used to it. And so in order to, that's a terrible disease. He died. I got updation is the first cure with like bioengineering that we need to fix it. We need to fix that so that we can be perpetually open and in awe. You know what I'm saying? But, um, but really it's about finding ways to remove yourself from context, different perspectives, new thoughts, new spaces, new new ideas, right?

Speaker 2:          00:45:56       That is the hunger for it, the constant hunger for it. I have it because otherwise I go down into the darkness. Like if I'm not in awe, I start thinking about human beings. We're the only species that's aware of our mortality and this causes cognitive stress. What do we do with the fact that no matter how much we create, how many people we fall in love with? We're all just food for worms. In the end. So you're essentially like an awesome collector of ideas, kind of a friend of mine called intention, a lot of creative ideas of your own, but you have an awesome collection of these, these, these ideas and it's um, you know, do you have, do you feel like that's your calling to get that out there? You obviously have a very unique, and you know, and well studied perspective on things can be when you're talking about all these things and you're obviously very passionate about it.

Speaker 2:          00:46:40       Like what do you, what are you trying to do? You're trying to like get other people hip to this. Yeah, we'll agree to everybody to strap in and, and, and prepare yourself. Come along for the ride. Yeah. Well, yeah. Wow Man. You start saying shit like this. You know, a lot of the things you've said and these videos, you know, you're, you're putting these little seeds in the heads of people all over the world that may not necessarily have ever thought that idea before. That's a powerful thing then. Yeah. Well, one of my heroes is Timothy leary and I also really love Bucky fuller. And they used to call themselves performing philosophers, you know, inter galactic sized ideas and using the power of media communications to spread those ideas. People like Marshall Mcluhan that it as well. Yeah. And Canada as well. The candidate, it as well performing philosophers.

Speaker 2:          00:47:22       You know, leary said in the information age, you don't teach philosophy, you perform it. If Aristotle were alive today, he'd have a talk show or youtube channel or a podcast like the Joe Rogan podcast. I mean, you in a way are the modern day Aristotle sping forth ideas, inspiring people. But I'm saying proof of concept, people eat Animal Dixon on TV and I'm sponsored by a fake vagina. Well, no, but that's there, sir. Proof, proof of concept. Basically saying that, you know, we used to talk about ids in these forums, these Greek philosophers and Roman philosophers would talk about ideas and people would just ruminate about ideas. And that's, I mean, that's, you're providing a space for that. Yeah. That's kind of cool. And I'm trying to do that too. In the short videos that I launched, you know, we call them shots of Philosophical Espresso. Yeah, they're brilliant.

Speaker 2:          00:48:03       I loved them. Then you put, you put a bunch of them on Vimeo and the, it's just they're, they're so stunning and there the visuals are so in tune with what you're saying. Thanks. Really good. How, what's the best way for people to find these? What is the, Oh, just chasing Silva. Vimeo actually, yeah. If they just Google Jason Silva, Vimeo, my Vimeo page has all of the videos, which is fantastic and they can go so many. Do you have, oh, I think I had like 28 videos in there and have all different, have the, the, the shots of Philosophical Express. So then I have a series called the human condition where I look at like, oh, we're watching one. Okay Dude, just take a bong hit and watch his shit. Right. That's what I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen. That's what you needed to do. This is a w. Oh, there you are. There's the, do you do it from the beginning so people can hear this because this is such a trip. This is, you can't, can't start this while we're, here we go. Nice.

Speaker 3:          00:48:51       [inaudible].

Speaker 6:          00:48:58       I have pretty much an optimist. I reminded of Brits and Doyle's line from Darwin's pharmacy and he says, dreams or not lack reality, real patterns of information. When the imaginary foundation says that the role as you imaginations to conceive the bullies, delight futures, choose the most amazing, exciting and ecstatic possibility and then pull the present forward to meet it. That is when we do, we would bring our imaginings into existence, but I think that as technology, as ways to outsource our mental capacities to our tools, so much more, our ability to, I'll give you like the physical world has increased in an exponential fashion, so we've been able to shrink and the lag time between our imaginings and their instantiation, the real world. David Deutsch speaks in his new book, the beginning of Infinity. He says, if you look at the topography of the island of Manhattan today, that typography, typography in which the forces of economics and culture, human intent trumped the forces, geology, I mean the topography of Manhattan today is no longer shaped by mere geology. It's shaped by the human mind and my economics and my culture and subway. David Deutsch extrapolate is that ultimately that will be the effect of the whole unit. He says creditation and anti matter might only universe and its earliest at least interesting stages but eventually the whole thing will be subject to the intent of some street independent, infinitely more powerful minds and to conceive of that just makes me feel

Speaker 1:          00:50:38       static to shh. Are you fucking kidding me man? Are you fucking kidding me? That might be one of the best two minute videos on the web. How many minutes is that? I think less than two minutes is whatever that is. That might be one of the best videos on the web. That is a bong hit. Wonder. Well you know it's, I used to, awesome. The word that I always love to use is epiphany. I want to epiphany's people to give them a download to give them a micro psychedelic trip, but one that is scripted. So you don't want to be tripping in a scrambled with space with no context. You want a scripted transcendent experience and I think with these videos, what I was trying to do is take inspiration, take an epiphany, which is usually a lonely experience that happened, happen, happens in one's head, and what is the goal of every artist but to try to communicate is ecstatic vision through paint, through instrument, through voice.

Speaker 1:          00:51:31       What I'm trying to do is reverse engineer inspiration. Turn it into a visual form and transmute that putting you in my head during these glimpses of Nirvana that I'm literally having and I'm getting you off on off because that's how I get off on my own. On the odd that I have when I watch, when I make the videos will end. You enhanced it all with these amazing videos. The videos and images behind it were awesome, was a really perfectly edited. It was very compelling that, yeah, I worked with a magnificent editor. Her name is Maria. She's from an entity called not this body and it was wonderful collaboration. Fucking cool thing about the Internet, man. You could just do something like that. Boom, throw it up there. Pow. People download it. Instant, totally commercial people. No commercials, no nothing. He is. PSA is for inspiration.

Speaker 1:          00:52:18       It's, yeah, totally. Yeah. And then think about all the positive that that does. That's a real ripple effect, man. That's an amazing ripple effect. Absolutely. I mean that's the big get off for it. It's that people enjoy it. That's when you really realize at some point in time there's some bizarre connection which we in all the human beings on this planet, all of us together, there's some weird sort of a electrical, you know, some, some, some connection that we all share and if you disturb it, if you put shitty stuff out there, you're going to feel it back. You really are. Yeah. But when, once we understand that we control our environments totally. We all just be really fucking cool to each other. We can like amass a whole hive of people who get that concept. Re Rich Doyle wrote a book called Darwin's pharmacy. It's about sex plants and the evolution of the newest fear.

Speaker 1:          00:53:07       And he says that one of the things that psychedelics do for some people is they make us aware of the feedback loops between our creative and linguistic choices and our consciousness. In other words, we become aware of the power of the things that we do and the things that we surround ourselves with and the power that those things have to literally shape our experience of reality. Like the is seen different when it's set to music or when it's set to a certain kind of lighting or when you surround yourselves by certain kinds of people. I mean people think that inspiration or living an inspired life is this half half hazard thing that you can't plan for a transcendent moment. It's not true. You can curate your spaces the same way you curate your Facebook wall or your toilet. People you follow on Twitter to set the emergent conditions for serendipity to constantly be in a state where like, wow, I'm just meeting so many interesting people.

Speaker 1:          00:53:51       Well, because I've made the choice to surround myself in vortexes of interesting people. One of the ideas that Mckenna had when it came to psychedelics, especially too with mushrooms, was that what you are experiencing? And one of the reasons why it's so consciousness expanding is that what you're experiencing when you take it in the mushroom is the accumulation, not just a psychedelic experience, but the accumulation of the psychedelic experiences of all the human beings before you that have taken it. And that's one of the ideas why there's so much wisdom in the psychedelic experiments. That's like one of the, the humility has so much humility and a psychedelic experience and also so much of a, a perspective enhancer that you're, you know, you're getting your, you're taking in this connection, which is why, you know, I think you can pull information out of it or hear people talk in.

Speaker 1:          00:54:40       Sure. You know, it's one of the weird things about the psychedelic experience when he gives you information, when it talked, when you saw someone is actually communicated, holding you. Well, one of my favorites is Joseph, that you've read the hotel. It totally, no, no. Joseph Campbell, who's one of my heroes. Oh yeah. I love about the hero's journey, which is the ultimate Arkansas. And they spent illumination, he's done a lot of lectures about the psychedelic experience as very, very literally an experience of the hero's journey. I mean, consider, consider this steps, you know, cause the hero's journey obviously can be a geographical journey, right? Like go into the unknown, you know, step away from the ordinary, transcend obstacles, have an apotheosis and a rebirth and a realization about life, and then come back and make the return with that illumination. But see, isn't that what happens anytime somebody partakes in a psychological trip?

Speaker 1:          00:55:23       Well, while I was going to say is I think that's what happens when I'm watched your video, when I watched the video. I believe that's a psychedelic experience. Definitely. It is. It's your manifest the mind. Yeah. It's information coming through stunning visuals and it's very, uh, it's, it's, it's imprinted totally. You know, you get the impact of it. Totally. Totally. There was this really what it's, that's really what the, the pull of it all is, isn't it? I mean, what, what your, what you did and you accomplished in that, that sort of is what the pull of all of this stuff is, right. To get something that's really, really inspires performance inception. Yeah. To just poon. Yeah, just give them an explosion of new idea. 100 when you, when you hit people with that, when that goes out there and blows up on them, you're literally like pushing them off one path. Even if it's just for a few minutes until sure. Bullshit kicks in their fucking, you know, her husband calls them and you know, the kids are screaming, you know, but for at least a couple of minutes, man, you're pushing them. You're pushing them in the right way. Well, it's amazing to hear you say that. And there's, one of my favorite films is inception, which was absolutely magnificent. I didn't really like that movie. Well, you should read it. I love it. I liked them a little. No, no, no, no.

Speaker 4:          00:56:23       It was some parts where I was like, wait a minute. This is like a video game you need to see out and around shooting people. This is silly. It's like he's on slow mode. He's my child's mode. That's not even a real, you know what I'm saying? It was like an old movie. Check out the book, the inception in philosophy, but um, cause it talks about there's some layers in that film. But one of the ideas is that the entire film is actually a metaphor for filmmaking because think about what filmmaking is. You create a sh a dream. You bring the audience into that dream and hopefully they fill it with their subconscious, which is what we do every time we watch a film, we relate to the characters based on a set of experiences that we have had in the moods that were already in when we go into the theater and if the film is successfully performed, a performance of inception and it gives us catharsis, literally the film breaks through the screen and becomes real in the watcher.

Speaker 4:          00:57:04       And isn't that what happens when you have a psychedelic experience and it transforms you? Or when you have a geographical, you take a trip somewhere and it transforms you. Or you know, when you actually take a, or when you watch a movie and it transforms you, the Po, or you have a dream and the dream and gives you illumination in the transfer. The points, if you have catharsis in a dream or in a film or in a psychedelic trip or in the Euclidean meetspace, it's all real. It doesn't matter how you get it. That's why William Gibson says that the so called distinction between the real and virtual world is what we're going to laugh at in the future because there is no distinction when when you're watching a movie and you're immersed in the film and you're crying from the film, it happens to you.

Speaker 4:          00:57:35       It becomes real. So too, when you, somebody might, you know, be on a psychedelic and have a transcendent vision and people say, oh, that's just because he was on the drug. No, the vision was real while he had it. Dreams are real while you're in them. And if the vision can translate, you know when it wears off, when you leave the movie theater, then you know that you've found something valuable, genuine illumination. That's a fascinating idea, right? It is a fascinating, the idea and the idea that it's somehow or another going to be three D it's going to be all around us. Eventually cinema films and stuff. We're going to watch movies take place like all around us. You'll be in a world, a virtual world to being inside zookeeper. Jesus Christ. That's incredible.

Speaker 4:          00:58:16       That's kind of amazing. I mean, we, you know, we're the naked ape, you know, Terence Mckenna says that we, we ate psychedelics when we left this event as well. We left the jungles of African one into the Savannah's. Our diets change. We picked the magic mushrooms from the cow dung. We started tripping. He says it might've been a catalyst for language. And you know why? I think it's very compelling idea because we don't exactly know how language emerged, but he points to the fact that some psychedelics have a synesthetic effect. It's an aesthetic means that they blurs the different senses. So you see sounds are you hear sites and if you think about it, language is synesthetic. I use vocal patterns to transmit images to your brain. Wirelessly language was the first information technology that allowed me to transmit information through time and space outside of just DNA having sex with other DNA. And so the synesthetic power of information technology might have been triggered by the synesthetic effect of the magic mushroom. That's the stoned ape hypothesis and I think it's a brilliant theory for sure. Like that's a really interesting way of putting it that I haven't heard said that way, that it making

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       noises with the images that synesthetic yeah, that people don't realize this, you know languages synesthetic that's amazing. And that's what chimps haven't figured that shit out yet. And then the naked ape, what have you just start giving chimps mushrooms. Maybe we should do that. Who should do that? Man, man, we should have some just and everything in the road to be honest. Curing compound where we feed shrimp, but just to see what's up feed troops to chimps. That would be the most bad ass scientific experiment of all time and just a total planet of the apes type moving. Do you think, could you imagine if you did it for like three generations there until they started becoming people and they're like, stop, stop the experiment or there's some great, there's some great cartoons that are seen on the Internet, like illustrations showing the stoned ape hypothesis and you see like a bunch of monkeys like walking around, you know, whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:00:10       And then they like the mushroom and then they're like in their heads they start seeing like rockets flying to the moon satellites. It's cell phones and cities, buildings erected from the ground. I mean think of how psychedelic that sounds to you know, to early man like a city, New York, a jet engine next to like a caveman. Right? How do you make the leap from that to that? Well, you would think that that leap might be more easy if the ape is tripping, right? Yeah, we should totally see how that works. If they're willing to put monkeys and cages and try Mascara out on their shit. Really have, but you think they'd been given chips. There's definitely scientists in some lab that are fucking giving machines to manage. I don't know, but I don't know if you can advocate that because if the chimp can't give you his permission, so what if he has a bed?

Speaker 2:          01:00:56       It's true. So you leave the mushrooms. If what happens happens, hey, what the fuck? I just think it'd be a fascinating thing to watch. Could you imagine if they did it for like six, seven generations of chip started losing hair, standing up straight, started slowly turned into people. Then it became all this political pressure when they started looking like people closest one to a person yet and you'd see this chimp will get me the fuck out of here. They probably started talking. Well Hollywood prepares us. Yeah, they make a lot of cautionary tales about that. I mean the cyborgs or you know, until it wouldn't be amazing though. If it was just mushrooms, they probably would just go from like throwing poop to wiping their poop all over their own body castles. You guys have probably seen, I've probably seen 2001 a space odyssey. She might think that maybe the monolith when it first appears when the monkeys finally learn how to use tools, the monolith is just kind of a place holder.

Speaker 2:          01:01:42       It's this weird shaped figure. Maybe that it's a placeholder on purpose because it's a metaphor for the mystery. What happened when we went from like just being able to apes that use tools? Well maybe that's metaphor. Maybe that's the mushroom. The monolith is the magic mushroom that cuddle and catalyze the use of tool and at the moment that the ape picked up like a branch on the floor to use it to reach a fruit on a really high tree. He became one with his tools. We used our tools to extend the boundaries of who and what we are and then we went to the moon and then who knows what's next. It's while was a genius. She has a gene who meat like putting like meaning into scenes and having scenes

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       represent things that are actually taking place in the real world. There's a some crazy guy named Jay Wiener. I think his name is who actually sat down and documented all the connections to the moon landings and all that, all sorts of different things in inside the work of Kubrick's, the shining like to the little boy wearing an Apollo rocket sweater to the room number being like some number that has something to do with the launch time. And it was a really amazing thing. Kubrick had, he constructs a world or did rather he's gone, but he constructed a world that was not just like the surface, but there was hidden meaning to all these different things that were going on and he was like, he was way, way, way ahead of his time. He was just out there, man, that guy had some fucking wild ass movies, a clockwork orange. Are you kidding me? Yeah, yeah. I remember watching that movie going, God damn, this guy's going deep. Yeah. Well, can you be, that's why

Speaker 4:          01:03:19       filmmaking, I think is the most transcendent art form of our times because we're literally able to create virtual world that can transform our consciousness, like reprogram our brain. I mean, I think, I think cinema, I think a gifted director is like the closest thing we have to a deity in a secular world. I mean what they, what they create, what bursts forth in the cinema when your brain is tweaked to the film in the right way is to me the modern version of a religious experience, right?

Speaker 5:          01:03:53       Yeah. What's homeboy? The dude who did alien, what's that guy's name? Ridley Scott. Ridley Scott. Thank you. He's doing the new one. Be New. Oh my God. Look what do you hear that Ridley Scott is doing another alien movie? Yeah. Ego Cop Tams is going to be a wild two hours of my life. Exact sit down. I'm going to watch some crazy shit. Hopefully it hasn't. George Lucas said, no, he won't. He won't. Ridley Scott is not going to do, he's not going to do that. He's not going to do that. He wouldn't do that. That's what we used to say that George Lucas, they made charge are too, but he's listening. No one but Ridley Scott was capable of that first one. That first alien was a Mutha fucker. That was one of the greatest harm movies of all time, man. That thing was fucking terrifying. A thing that jumps on your fucking face, shoots a load down your throat. A monster emerges out of your chest with an explosion and then just fox up everything and no one can stop it. Which, which aliens

Speaker 4:          01:04:43       said the Milky Middle Guy where he gets ripped in half and on the milk came out. Hmm. You know what I'm talking about? Like here's like a robot and he got split open and all this like, like robot juice flew over it. I think maybe with aliens. Aliens. You don't know.

Speaker 5:          01:04:57       Oh No, I don't remember that man. I remember there was um, Sigourney weaver had like a crazy space suit on that she put the fight off the aliens. Remember that? Yeah. I remember there was some like crazy robotics. You pitch back off like she was going to fight this fucking super, you know, super sized beasts. Integrative, regular aliens were scary enough. Yeah. This was the crazy one. And she's kicking

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       a queen's ass. Not as good as alien one was. They went a little crazy right there. Got a little Hollywood, they try to outdo themselves more. Much like the new fear factor. It's like if you went back to the premise of the first alien, the first alien, it was, she was way scarier. That alien was fucking horrifying. You know, like you couldn't see it. He didn't know where it was. Then it would just jump out at San Jac people and the second aliens, they're killing them left and right. Like running down a hallway. The aliens are coming out and they're like, they're stupid now. You can just shoot him, you know, before they would, you know, they would sneak up behind you and they were intelligent and they were all you want. You want the film to always be high concept. I mean if you want to throw out some action in there to keep people entertained, but you only want it to be like high concept of if you're into the ideas, you can also like be entertaining.

Speaker 1:          01:05:56       Yeah, way like metaphysical science fiction, you know? The first one though was on, on that level. The first, the first one was just absolutely brilliant. It was a one of the greatest horror movies of all time. There you go. You know? But the second one, he got crazy. It was good. And the third action, no, I liked it. I, I'll, I'll watch all of them do it. I even watch aliens vs Predator. I'm a sucker. I'm stupid. I'm like a 14 year old boy, my taste in movies. But that was a terrifying movie. But you were right. That guy has created a world. He's like a god in the world. Yeah. He's like a god of this mini world. What comes to phase two? What's going to be the next immersive transformative entertainment technology? You know, someone was talking about James Cameron, they were talking about how demanding James Cameron was.

Speaker 1:          01:06:39       All James cameras like this fucking paints the wrong paint. I want it. This call I went to and you know, there was like, Oh God, he's so crazy. So demanding. I was like, that's the only way you get to be a James Cameron. You know? How the fuck do you make something like titanic? How do you make a movie that big? You better be a bad mother fucker. You better be running shit, dude. You can't. You can't half ass and Pussy foot, that fucking movie. You're going to have a movie about a giant metal ship that crashes into the ocean and it's gotta be a compelling movie as well. Well, who wouldn't want to direct a film? It could because essentially you're God. You control every variable as you want. Dude, we'll look at the titanic note. Did it didn't just think of ship to make that movie that was all digital. I mean that is, you're going to make that in three d they're releasing. It's getting, that's incredible. The idea of that kind of technology to recreate reality. That's when your idea of recreating a full reality. It doesn't seem so far off. Not at all.

Speaker 4:          01:07:35       We're already doing. We already do it, man. You know a plane reserve. I with a wireless iPhone, make a reservation a few days later, get them at crafted, flies you around the world to a place where no one knows your name and you have no memories. Holy Shit. Holy Shit. And indeed, you know, it's probably going to be like the next big jump is, uh, being able to go to a movie theater in control it, I think we've talked about it. Oh yeah, I know what I mean. Yes. Yeah. But what's crazy is that I think actors are on the way out. I mean, there's an only hope. There was a video that was posted on Vimeo the other day on Kotaku and uh, it's just kind of shows you what the next level of like x, Xbox, playstation with the CGI

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       looks like for that. It's, it's very close to being, look at this video real quick. It's really close to being just scary sketching like God. I mean it's, it's like look how you can see the pores. You can see like it's got a little cut and from my shaving, yeah, it's incredible. So this is an example of what the next x box type playstation console would we, and this is just fucking video games for your house. This isn't even look real. Yeah. It looks like Toby McGuire or something like that. Like someone's bullshitting us. Like someone, uh, made a fake video to pretend now I think, I think what it is, I think this is based on it. I did new texture technology that's going to be used in like upcoming platforms for games and the need to make the supermodel version of that. Okay. That looks a little wonky.

Speaker 2:          01:09:02       Just a touch. Just a touch. Yep. His eyelashes or lack thereof. But what's cool is that this is just one artist using the technology. Imagine when we start having like, like you know that really good artists play with it. There's painters that can paint a face that looks like a photograph. This is incredible. If you, what I was saying was that if you made this like with a video camera with your friends and pretended as the new technology, it would look similar to this. Yeah. Just have a little shake cam to it. I would totally look around. Yeah. If you look, so you captured the, the newest technology. This is what the government is doing now. They're creating fake news. Yeah. Oh, then that I think, yeah. The next paradigm will be like those film experience that adjusts the choose your own adventure film experience.

Speaker 2:          01:09:43       You know, based on your decisions. I immersive immersive virtual reality games. You know like that movie exit stens actually at a very interesting that it Cronenberg film. They could create a fake Rhea one transmitted fake reality and then a real one that, but then like hide behind. Yeah. And then go into it and have like a journey and have something that you have to do and have something you have to accomplish. You can be like the James Bond or the Indiana Jones, the narrative. Jesus. What if you die in there though? Maybe you wake up like crushed. Like you're just like, yeah, what if there's like glitches every now and then you'd die for real, right? Like dying in a train. You can't play games bitch DV Indiana Jones. Huh? Do you think dying in the dream like that we're not thinking of that can't be good for you, right? There has to be like every time you get your dye in your dream, it's like getting hit in the head really hard. Like a part of your brain thinks are dead or something like they don't like dying in my dreams. It's very weird and I'm always so relieved when I wake up. Thank you. Isn't it funny that a lot of people hate life? Like, God, I'm so miserable, but yet they happy when they don't die in their dreams.

Speaker 2:          01:10:43       You know, I didn't need to dreams go God, you fucking pussy. You know, it's interesting you talk about like not appreciating life or hating life. There's a great documentary. It's called flight from death, the quest for immortality. And it says that basically it cites the work of Ernest Becker who was, uh, if you saw Annie Hall, it's the book that Woody Allen Gives Annie Hall in the bookstore about the human creation. It's called the denial of death and a to 1974 Pulitzer Prize winning book. And it says basically that we're

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       essentially God's with anuses with our minds. We can ponder the infinite were seemingly capable of anything, yet we're housed in a heart pumping, breath, gasping, decaying body. So we are godly yet creaturely we can write poetry and build skyscrapers, but ultimately we're food for the worms and that is the problem of the human condition. Ultimately the ser, the source probably of our, the impetus to be so creative to tr to transcend this condition symbolically and artistically. But he says even even romantic love in a way, as a way of of dealing with the human condition. You turn your lover into a deity, she becomes your salvation. That's why all the pop song says she's like the wind. She's like the sun. She provides the salvation that God no longer provides in a secular society. Right. Cause we have, we have grown too sophisticated for religion but we still need to work on our existential problems.

Speaker 4:          01:12:05       So then we do it with our lovers or we do it with through creative acts and ultimately, you know, using science and technology to transcend the human condition might be the ultimate solution to the Becker dilemma. That's why I'm totally pro and Manhattan project to transcend death. Like all about it. Yeah. Do. Do you find that when you do the calculations as far as like, you know, human population growth of technology, do you find a point where, I mean, are you seeing where this is going to like wind up? Well, technology technology is a resource liberating mechanism. And people talk about scarcity, but scarcity is contextual. Something has only scarce until you figure out the technology that makes it into something abundant. And this is what Peter Diamandis, his new book talks about. So for example, our dependence on fossil fuels, we think that this feel way to fuel things.

Speaker 4:          01:12:49       Well, once we transcend that technology, we saw, I mean we get 10 times more power every day from the sun, you know, that we could ever use. Right? And we just have to figure out a way to capture that energy and people talking about overpopulation. But the reality is you can fit the entire world's population in the state of Texas. They're still be plenty of space. The probably, yeah, the whole world. Oh yeah. The problem is resources. Billion People in Texas, Brian, I think, imagine what the airport would look like. Well, what happens, it's an issue of resources, right? But if you have like nanotechnology or in vitro meat, tissue engineering grow all the meeting could ever even pita supports in vitro meat, you take that, you can take stem cells, stem cells from an and give it a brain cells from an animal meats. Sounds like it could be good stem cells from Macau and grow all the meat you could ever need with no nervous system.

Speaker 4:          01:13:31       So no animal is suffering. Never killed another cow. See formula away from the fleshlight people. Cause like I met you. What? I'm interested in that and some people talk about, you know, and or, or have you ever an Arrow, hydroponics, I have to talk about, have you heard of aeroponics growing fruits and vegetables in mist and these vertical farming towers with this special missed and you have, you don't have to worry about like, you know, the poison and the all the spraying and damaging the eco, the farming, the land of missed content's minerals and water. It's like hydroponics. But in ms grown in missed holy shit. Right? And people don't know about this stuff, but it's like absolutely insane. That's incredible. That's a beautiful idea. That's what I'm saying. Wow. Growing vegetables in mist

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       and vertical towers. You know, we could just like grow all the vegetables we could ever need in genetically engineered to have better like vitamins, you know? But you can't live Monsanto do that though. Let's not going to be Monsanto. Just like, just like computers used to be these big centralized grids and now everybody has an iPhone or just like a, you know, gps used to be this big government thing and now everybody has ups on the phone. These things will trickle down and empower individuals. Biotechnologies not going to be Monsanto. Biotechnology is going to be to the domestication of biotechnology. It's going to be personalized medicine, personalized software upgrade of your physiology. It's not going to be these big government thing. Be like a place where you go and you can become a new person. Sure. Know Autumn, I want to be a black chick just for like a year.

Speaker 2:          01:14:50       Yeah. So you're a doctor to become your lover, the lover, and become the black chick. How about like having sex with your partner and like merging your nervous system's together. I mean, we've been trying to merge into one another. If you fuck a tantric sex, oh, there you go. Come on mushrooms. You can make some shit happen, Molly. There you got that two song edible marijuana as well. There's something about that makes it very sensuous. Interesting. Mm hmm. The connection to hive. Yeah. That's when, when we can all jump into the human pool, right? Yeah. The human pool of thoughts and ideas. The human brain pool when all of us are, there's no cubicles, cubicles drop and we're all on the same thing together. That's going to be strange to come will become gods. It seems like it's inevitable, right? Oh, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. There's a, one of my favorite quotes by Alan Harrington, who wrote, he was part of the beat generation and he's staying out with all those guys.

Speaker 2:          01:15:44       He wrote a book called the immortalists. He said, we must never forget that we are cosmic revolutionaries, not stooges conscripted to advance a natural order that kills everyone. So we, it's romantic and defiant to say we will not go quietly into that good night rage, rage against the dying of the light. That's what we do. What was the first sentence? We must never forget. We are cosmic revolutionaries. Could you imagine if you just walked around a tee shirts at cosmic revolutionary? Hell yeah. People would be like, really, dude, what'd you do today? You jerked off. He watched the Carl Sagan video on youtube. Totally to a comic book store. Well, Carl Sagan, evolutionary hunter. Awesome. What a great fucking title. I think I'm going to have to change my, a message board handled cosmic revolutionary cosmic revolution. Yay. Hello. You just think that's beautiful. Yeah, dude, we are away for the cosmos to know itself.

Speaker 2:          01:16:32       Sagan said it himself and also we're the frontal lobes of the universe because so far we haven't found anything more complicated than the brain. There's very few things more douchey than calling yourself a revolutionary. Fair enough. It sounds like a myspace page. You know what? I'm [inaudible]. I gotta drop the hand away. You say we ain't call my, so that'd be very hypocritical. I've made fun of people for calling themselves mobile revolution. I'm like, someone's going to call you that man. Even if it's tongue in cheek, like with me, it's completely, you know, cosmic revolutionaries either. Then you've got to let somebody else call you unless you have lightening bolts in the background. Maybe like everybody got a tattoo that says cosmic revolutionary in lighting. We

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       were, but the thing is I think humanity is, we are cosmic revolutionaries and I also think we're nature's secret weapon, right? Actually the other one of the other videos I did is code or something it's called to understand is to perceive patterns and one of the things that it looks at is the recurring patterns that occur at different scales of reality from manmade systems to natural systems and back again, it's like these natural patterns that persist in nature and are now popping up in these big data visualizations of manmade systems. You know how cities are like capillaries, you know, alleys are like arteries. You know Jeffrey West and the Santa Fe institute talks about this stuff and what it shows you is that yes we are free agents participating in this project. Just progression of technology but it's also, it's inevitable itself. Organizing its evolution. Like we are just participating actively instead of passively in evolution. You can we play that one? I would love for sure. How does he get to it?

Speaker 2:          01:18:00       You think he has it right? Yeah. Yeah. You've got a cute this, it was the other one that we, yeah, I think this one right here.

Speaker 4:          01:18:10       Yeah. This one looking at the different, the galaxies in the neuron and the mushroom mycelium in London from the sky and the Internet. Visualize. I'll share the Shang nuts. Yeah. They all share the same Philip mental structure. How strangers though

Speaker 3:          01:18:22       [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          01:18:28       do all your things start with this? Yeah. Cause my friend, I am my very good friends. Patterns. And of course what this means is the true comprehension comes when the dots are revealed and you get some Johnson long view. When you see the big picture patterns, patterns, recurring patterns across different scales of reality. You know, Paul talks about the mycelial archetype and how to get information sharing systems that comprise the Internet look exactly like computer models of dark matter in the universe. Look exactly like the neuron brain. They all hear the same for twinkle Philip mental structure. It's the rise of network is big data advocates talk about how the systems are looking exactly like natural systems and what we can measure. The more we can visualize it, that we can visualize, the more expands our consciousness. My seniors were occurring. Patterns are scales of reality blows my mind.

Speaker 7:          01:19:13       And I think that technology increasingly is becoming an expander human consciousness. It extends our far reaching vision and revealing so much more. It's like, whereas once I was blind, now I can see Geoffrey West from the Santa Fe institute is telling us that cities are really like organisms. You know, alleys are like capillaries. How is it possible that a manmade artificial logical system is behaving like a natural system? The more efficient it becomes, the board started to look like nature. Really interesting, weird stuff. Um, you know, but, but it makes me optimistic. It's like what Steven Johnson says, look, if we can understand all this stuff, I mean, any, anything becomes possible. Right? It's the adjacent possible standing as a sort of shadow future. A map of all the ways the president can reinvent itself. It's beautiful stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:20:03       Crazy. Another one. That's another one that's [inaudible]. Awesome. That's great. It's weird. We could thought

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       that the human brain cell looks like the universe. Oh yeah. Like the galaxy. You liked the, yeah, the neurons. The Internet. The Internet too. It's terrifying. Yeah. Well, but it shows you that there's these patterns persist because they've, they've, they allow innovation to occur. Yeah. I mean, the city is the coral reef. When I say terrifying, I mean just winning in its magnitude. You know, it's all the idea that makes me feel mystical, that the fact that neurons and all of that, it's just really hard to wrap your head around exact call. Just one soup. But doesn't that all relieve you of any boredom? Yeah. Whoa. It definitely does. That's why I do it. I don't know how anybody could be bored with any of this stuff. It's mind boggling. It's to some people it's a little unsettling because they like to think that this is where I get my coffee in the morning.

Speaker 1:          01:20:51       Right. Marge, how are you March? Meanwhile, Marjane strapped to a fucking giant rock going a thousand miles an hour and a circle. You, Marge is hanging on in space and that the earth is not connected to anything. It's just floating out there floating and spinning, winning like a motherfucker spinning a thousand miles an hour around a giant nuclear explosion. That's right. A big constant nuclear explosion that will eventually die. Thank you. S bizarres fuck right. It's something, well, you know the, the, the red sox are doing well this year. Yeah. Well they'll find a way to fuck that up. Yes or no, and then they, they, they know how's the tomatoes and then, you know, go back home and take a shit and that's it. All right. Let me just wait for the inevitable while we spent. Yeah. Why do we like mundane things? What is the, the [inaudible] there's something comfortable in the prosaic because the world at large can be overwhelming to all of us.

Speaker 1:          01:21:48       I mean, those videos are overwhelming. A psychedelic trip is overwhelming. I mean a big city can be overwhelming. And I think that some people thrive in the spaces in which they are overwhelmed and some people prefer to cower away from it due to circumstances in their lives, culture, preconceptions, choices that they make. And ultimately I think that, I don't think we'd do well to judge anybody for how they choose to live. I think that what you do is you try to do what you can to share many different ideas and many points of views and they'll find Dell find the astonishment that they like best and partake hopefully in that one. You know, Makenna talked about, uh, technology and once, I'll never forget this thing they said he was talking about different areas in life where, um, uh, what he said that um, a a failed symbiotic is what a parasite is. And that every parasite seeks to be a symbiotic organism and seeks because we're all symbiotic. They want to keep eating. They don't want it. They don't want you to die cause then they die. I mean people have all sorts of funky living things living inside their body. We're all symbiotic. Yeah. And you know when, when he talked about technology, one of the things that I thought always was that, doesn't it seem like technology is some sort of a symbiotic, some sort of like a living organism?

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       It seems like. I have, like I always talk about how I have like dead skeletons of the old shit laying around. I found an old phone the other day. It's an old fucking dead thing, you know, like move past this. This is a fucking mastodon. I'm looking at, told me I'm looking at an old mac that's a dinosaur bone, you know? That's really what I mean. That's why I, that's why we call it the human technology co evolution. You know, I'm a fellow of an organization called hybrid realities institute that says we are already cyborgs and when comes, yeah. But do you believe in the Kurtzweil idea that they'll be some sort of a sentient intelligent life form? It will become centered and able to move around. It'd be able to think on its own and that will be a new life. So it really is a new life.

Speaker 2:          01:23:42       We're already a hybrid. Somebody puts on a pacemaker in their heart or they put in a chip in their brain to help them with their tremors from like, you know, one of the Dick Cheney neurologicals neuro know that I saw yesterday, there was this new pump that they put in a guy, he doesn't have a pulse and pulse that shits in the Bible son. We live inside of the constructs of our imagination. We live in the spaces, we use technology, we use electricity, we create phone card. So water that comes to our house through the pipes, you know, I mean we were already, we already are symbiotes in symbiosis. The differences, the symbiosis becoming more and more smooth, you know, the best technologies. It's not technology that gets out of the way, right? It just allows you to do the artful change that you want to make in the world without having to fuck with it too much.

Speaker 2:          01:24:22       And that's what happens as these guys, she acknowledges get smoother in the way that they get in meshed in our lives. The sort of hybridization just gets richer and deeper, but we're already, it's already happening. It's perfectly natural, so that's not, that's not a problem. It's not something to be scared of it all. It's something just to be refined and and the [inaudible] well we make choices right when we buy apple products were saying we let, we want things to have a sense of aesthetic. We want them to be beautiful. We want our symbiosis to be functionally rich but also aesthetically beautiful and that's important. There's a thought that's been going around a lot lately on the Internet. The Internet is Karma Free Iphones, you know I talked about it on this podcast and people are talking about it now, like the idea of making conflict mineral free, definitely possible and that's absolutely going to be possible.

Speaker 2:          01:25:08       And with nanotechnology we can engineer your own materials from scratch because we are manipulating things at the level of the atom. We can turn dog shit into Pearl to gap, call it the diamond age. That's where Shit's going to get a really weird cause. Everyone would have a 10 foot dick made out of gold. Oh yeah. Order order an information file. Print the toaster in your house and you're going to have no, what are we going to have to pay for electricity? Everything's going to be solar. No, everything's going to be abundant and infinite. How are we going to pay for things? Cause the monetary system, we post scarcity age there. No, you don't pay for it. No paying for things. Abundance and how they become a baller. He can be a baller. You know you can't make it rain if everything's free, you can ever cut the ball or out of society because then you're going to cut a lot of the funny out. Why? Because people love their status. If you can't restrict with ridiculous behavior, if you want to keep comedy, can we create virtual simulations that are indistinguishable from the real where you can be the baller, there'll be racist world. They'll be racist. Do it in a racist way.

Speaker 5:          01:26:04       You got to let you gotta let ball kids. You can't to judge. How many people would become ballers. There's a lot of white dudes go ball or style, right? Lot of white dudes get black guy tattoos. You know what I'm saying? Talk like a black guy. You can't, you can't factor that in the computer simulation. You got to let that happen. You know what I'm saying? Like he was having the white rapper do that. Uh, has uh, all the platinum teeth. Wait [inaudible] he's like one of the most famous white rapper dudes is, he's legit. He's like download all of our cars. No. Oh dammit. I can't remember the dude's name, Chris. My point's been shattered for, I can't remember his name. I points my shattered. My point is you couldn't be able to figure that guy out in the computer simulation gotta let that Guy Happen in the real world.

Speaker 5:          01:26:46       Yeah, definitely. That would be the real problem you got if we were strict. All, you know, people really do evolve. We're going to, it's like shit's not going to be, it's funny. She's really funny. I'm when I am right now. Like it's like a, when I'm William Randolph Hearst wanted to keep cannabis down. So because he as a commodity, what's really why he made it illegal. So he was an evil fuck and William Randolph first, it was just a bad motherfucker that read newspapers and he also had his own mills. So he was going to have to convert his mills over to Katie hemp because hemp paper was like, who do you get four times as much? You know, you at a, in a, um, uh, an acre and it replenishes itself every six months. You know, it's not like you have to wait 20 years to the fucking trees to grow back.

Speaker 5:          01:27:28       It's just like boom, it's there again and you can redo it again. And so as a commodity, this is going to cost him millions of dollars. So what he decided to do was just write stories about weed and put it in his newspaper. It's really an amazing thing that the guy pulled this off, that we're reefer madness and all that stuff. All that stuff came from him. You talking about Paul Wall? There are the Rapper Paula. Thank you Veronica Ricci. Thank you Veronica. Thank you very much. Thanks. She's on a ball, dude. What a good drill you've got. Um, yeah, because that guy, you can't predict that guy in a computer simulation. He's a great white rapper and he's totally like town with black people. He's got crazy platinum teeth. You know, you got to let that guy take place because otherwise you're not going to have the art. Kelly's of the world, right?

Speaker 5:          01:28:05       With evolution with our Kelly will not be there. And then come on man. If you ever watched that art Kelly real talk video, have you ever watched that? You've never seen that. You've never seen the most brilliant piece of human pop culture when you think that the world is evolving still. We're going to show you something right now and let's get this might throw a monkey wrench and all your theory. Sarah Thrupp, some r Kelly. Real talk. Brian, it's been so long. It'd be loud too. Let's find out and it's fun. Now finally, what happens? I'm feeling risky. I haven't slept. There's so many of them now. Like I, I checked checked recently. There's like 50 of them are Kelly is down with people listening to his shit online as a mine. People getting mad at me because of this whole thing where I said I'm a website. I ask people to not put links to pirated shit. I go, you know just don't get me in trouble. I'm not telling you what to do. Just don't put that shit on my website, you know? But people actually fair for you to say people act like you're telling me like you're fucking shuttering me man. They get so crazy when it comes to this and and their,

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       their need to justify streaming things talk to because I think it's a great song. You know what I'm saying? He knows a lot of profanity in it but profanity represents just how real shit gets when you arguing with the girl and Shit. You know what I'm saying? So I did it on youtube but I'm going to do this shit for y'all on Youtube. I don't want him, he drives to evolve any more than that. I want this guy to always exist, stole. He's jumping off here so we're going to be real man. I'm just going to be rid of him.

Speaker 3:          01:29:34       We just don't roll the film and we going to do it. I'm doing this for the fans that I know around the globe. They love. We'll talk to me.

Speaker 2:          01:29:43       This is what, this is our Kelly. They'll give me, who is he out there? You Sir? Watch this.

Speaker 3:          01:29:48       Is that a club with, let him see the full view girl. I'm not about to sit up here and argue with you about who's to blame a call. No. Only thing I'm traveling stablish the Jews not establish steps. This in the club with some mother [inaudible]. Did she say that?

Speaker 2:          01:30:22       Hold on guys there. Did she stay? There were other guys were other guys. Dan will tell me this. How the fuck

Speaker 3:          01:30:32       she knew I was with the mother when the whole plot right here is good writers. Good. I don't know why you fuck with them all jealous. No man having real tall. He's really tall. Some all bullshit. I'm just trying to have the town [inaudible] bullshit. We'll talk. Did Not just give you money to go get Joe. He's the greatest of all time. Damn money.

Speaker 2:          01:31:13       No one's more entertaining. Limber. R Kelly. I don't, I don't want us to ever not have an r Kelly. Well, you know what? That's what's great about the Internet is that if you have the urge to share, you can share. That guy's crazy. I need him. I need him to stay crazy. I want that. I want that guy. We didn't even see some of the best lines in it. That he's brilliant. Maybe he be sitting here. It might be a parody. Yeah. Even if it's not, I don't care. Whatever. He's fucking rocking in his way. Good for him. I love him. I'll be at r Kelly fan of the day. He dies. I hope you didn't really p on anybody though. Now he did. I have the video.

Speaker 2:          01:31:48       She's really young, right? Nevermind. I don't have that number bad. Call her back color. Yeah. Maybe we need to delay. We needed put a delay in us. I don't have it anymore. I hate it when it came out. And is she, she, she looked like she was younger. Like I don't know how young she was, but she look like old enough. Like she look, she was dressed up like a stripper and shit. You know. Wait a minute. What are you talking about? Nothing. I don't know what you're talking about. Say we need a delay. I know because of the art Kelly comment, right? No, because the other day when a w Jimmy fake phone number on the air, oh, people got phone calls, some part, some poor chick on Twitter. We hooked her up. She's going to come to the show tickets. That's hilarious. Took care of her.

Speaker 2:          01:32:28       I told her take care of her, her tab two and a fucking asshole. Yeah. So we removed it. Let me ask you, when did you become interested in all of the ideas of the singularity? I'm just curious, but ray Kurtzweil is absolutely, we should have ray here to talk. I would love to come with them. And Mckenna Mckenna was a huge, huge influence because he was just so compelling. His, uh, lecturers were so fascinating to me. And like I said, the first time I did DMT, I literally heard it, what was represented shirt, his shirt, his words. You know that nut too. I think, you know, there's been very few people that have put as much down as he did, you know, as far as like those recordings that you can get online. Like there's so many of them, man and they're so God damn interesting man.

Speaker 2:          01:33:11       He just had this really weird way of phrasing things and putting things together and brain was wired on just another level and he understood the power of language. He also had a lot about language, like we live in a world of language. He said, note how I use big words as one of the things that he said. I was like, Yo, why has he gotten in trouble? He's really fascinated and he calls language and ecstatic activity of signification. Yeah. Self defining reality was brought forth, intimated by language and brought forth into being by language please. But it is for sure. Totally is. I mean we live in a world of mind, right up world of psyche, dance are so on flights. So unfortunately Mckenna died and before you know, he could really see how crazy things are getting right now. Yeah. You know, it's such a shame.

Speaker 2:          01:33:55       That's what I say. We've got to fix the death problem men. Yeah. Cool. It robs us of all these luminous beings. So how many people do you think the earth can support? I mean if you were going to go into the stars stars for sure. Of course we are. That's the, that's the human. That's the next leap is didn't stand Ingrid said that got him in trouble. Well I'm [inaudible] cause he was taking it. Nasa I think I was doing no, he was doing really well in the campaign trail. They said who's going to go to the moon and people like pitch fix Detroit I think four. No, I do. I do think we didn't stay in the caves. We didn't stay with the limitations of biology. We won't stay on the planet. I mean I think I to be human is to transcend our boundaries.

Speaker 2:          01:34:34       Like, I think, think if it's possible with that natural, oh yeah. It's all figure out a way to Geo engineer's some other planet and ship people over there and we'll, we'll figure it out. I mean I, man, I ain't, I'm Brian, but how could you say that? It's impossible. When you look at we've, we've, we've been able to do here and just a short couple of hundred years for $200 or $300 you can buy an iPhone. Something that the richest person on the face of the planet 50 years ago couldn't buy with all his billions. I isn't that amazing. What a crazy invention. If everyone on the other side of the country like woopty other side of the country when we all lived on one side of the country with the earth go out of it's spent. Yes, the earth would sink. It would flip over it.

Speaker 2:          01:35:12       Somebody's actually been out that somebody actually asked when most of the world is water anyway. Like it's mostly empty space. The planet, right. Mostly empty space and more, more people are moving into cities anyway, so it's going to be just more and more just empty space. There was someone who actually asked that. There was like, I forget who it was. It was like a recent thing. It was a story really. Somebody acts. There was too many people on an island and he was worried if they had all that people on one side, whether the, I don't want to capsize. It was a real, a real person actually asked that question like, dude, you know what? We've got to get you. We gotta get you some tee shirts from the imaginary foundation. Okay. Do they exist in the line of the day because I'm visible. Here's a, here's a, here's one of my favorite teas.

Speaker 2:          01:35:54       Loser. Yeah. No, the imaginary foundation, they make apparel that celebrates the power of human imagination. If you can go to imaginary foundation, they're going, that is one of them. The one you're wearing right now. It's like they think it's actually with a bunch of cool colors on them and there's this like old guy underneath like holding it up like, Oh wow, that's pretty cool. I mean there's stuff is like the most gorgeous and inspired imagery that I've ever come across because it's cosmic, but it's also whimsical and psychedelic. So it's like singularity meets psychedelic rapture in image. Yeah. Just I love them, man. I want, I want, they'll say, I'll get them to send you a shirt. You guys. That'd be great. Sounds awesome man. Yeah. Um, how did you meet a Ray Kurzweil? I met him because um, you know, for five years I was hosting a television show for current, which is Al Gore's cable in the channel.

Speaker 2:          01:36:37       Right. So that's what I was doing. Heard that him and Keith Olbermann at Ben. That's the rumor I guess. Rawling yeah, squabbling squabble. Then I left the network last year, so I already knew about that. Yeah. A lot of politics of bullshit going down over there. They don't appreciate the talent. Did they not see these youtube clips? No, I just, I wanted to make content on a, on my own terms. And after four and a half years doing anything that he'd done, it got septation kicks in. So you just crave something different. But, um, adaptation. Yeah, we'll, let's just like, you'd need to be hedonistic. That's a strain he done got notation means that something that gave you pleasure stops being as stimulated as it once was. You adapt to the hedonic nature of it so that it's no longer hedonic. Oh, so you're, you're hedonism once you give into it and you always constantly tolerance.

Speaker 2:          01:37:21       Tolerance, like drugs. So you are a hedonistic, Chunky, well, I've always thought that. Don't you think like Alex, especially a gambling junkies, they seem to be, it seems to be a hedonistic drug of choice. You know that intelligence, we're hacking, we're hacking our fight or flight mode and we're hacking our own dopamine secretion. Why do people go to scary movies? You might ask to be scared. No, they go to scary movies because it says it's very Meta. You know, you're fine, but you also are tricking yourself into being scared. But because you know you're fine, then it's okay to be scared cause then it's exciting. Or like roller coasters or skydiving paying to feel like you're going to die, but knowing you're not going to dodge, you can only do that because we're very Meta and uh, but anyway, let me tell you how I met Ray Kurzweil.

Speaker 2:          01:38:01       One more point. The about the casinos. Like I think that when you put a casino in a one certain place too, I think you alter people's behavior when you let them know that it's like this one spot way over there and it's only, that's the only place you're allowed to gamble. They just go there and start gambling. You know, it's like they feel like once they got there, but if you allowed people to gamble everywhere they are, I doubt people would probably wouldn't be as exciting. I'll just, Marvin fruit is always kind of a, that is a really interesting, what'd you call it? The hedonistic what? Well, I was talking about he dynamic Adam Thomas Adaptation. What happens if you are anything that's always around becomes invisible. I gotta remember that phrase because that's a, that really is what it is. Yeah. It's a weird, I've always wondered what that's for.

Speaker 2:          01:38:38       I guess it's because we're always trying to push forward. I think it's our brain's way of saying that, you know, if tell late me, yeah, if you don't stimulate me, I will just make you a Zombie in return. What do you think the genetic reason for that is? You know, is it, is it to push Kenneth Energy forward to keep frozen, to bleed? There must be some reason to get you to continue to expand your sphere of possibilities. And what is more rewarding than when you do create something like, look, you might choose videos. I'm watching you watching these videos and you're, you know, you're, you're, you get a little charge out of yourself knowing that early, get off, get off. No, you, you created something. I mean, that's one of the best things that a person can feel isn't they create something and somebody likes it.

Speaker 2:          01:39:21       Yeah. You know, it's really what really a, it's a cultural equivalent of like sexual reproduction. This, you know, spreading the seed. And why, why it's so hard for men to be monogamous. Supposedly we'll, because we're wired to spread the seed to spread information, genetic information as as wide across as possible. But guess what? We've transcended at biological evolution with culture. So now the seed is with, you know what they call them, memes. Mimetic content and names are like organisms. They're like sperms. Their nuggets of information that are spreading and leaping from brain to brain. They're alive. So in a way we no longer need to spread our seed physiologically really anymore. We do it culturally do. I'm trying to, you know these nuggets I called them inspired nuggets of techno rapture. There's just little nuggets. They just, hopefully we'll do it. Those are the perfect way to do it because anybody could send anybody it's know even if your Internet connection socks right up really quick.

Speaker 2:          01:40:10       It's only two minutes long, right? It's, and it's, it's the right amount of commitment or probably just go whoa, but that doesn't, that require them to remember some shit that you saw 20 minutes earlier, you know, two minutes shots of philosophical expressive and then you put them on the Twitter. Right. I logged into, I registered for Twitter I think like two years ago. Oh yeah, yeah. At Jason underscore silver by the way. But um, I remember when I first started Twitter, I didn't understand it because I thought 140 characters are so limited, but it actually makes sense in an age of information when you're saturated and so much knowledge that it forces you to be concise so that you can alleviate the sort of bandwidth, bandwidth anxiety of being flooded with just so much information. People short keep it quick, Goddamn verbose. You know, people just ponder on as I do three hour podcasts, let me tell you.

Speaker 2:          01:40:56       But that's why we love them. Do that is part of what we love, but not in writing. Writing. It's annoying. Why I'm making me read so much. Well. Yeah. Well that's, I mean that it comes to like social interaction. That's why I made the videos shorts, because I don't feel entitled to 30 minutes of People's time necessarily because I know that there's a lot of media that is trying to suck their attention. No, I feel like he did this perfect. Yeah. Two minutes is a quick like, you know, it's, it's a donation and Twitter maybe, you know, maybe you could pop it up to like 200 words or 200 letters. That would be about it.

Speaker 8:          01:41:27       It doesn't work on podcasts. I, I used to, I do a podcast with Ari Shaffir caudle a one minute podcast and it's just like pretty much you just say hi and then you have to say goodbye. It doesn't work for a podcast. So he did it on as a podcast. Yeah. Did you really? Yeah. That's ridiculous. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:41:42       You can't, you couldn't even just reading Twitter off a podcast, you can't do that because then it just say negative shit to get your attention. Right. You know? We're just trying to be the loudest, I don't like negativity. It's very sad. So sad. It is, but is it natural? Is it important? Is it, is it necessary for us to appreciate the good? Do we have to experience this, this, the ruin and varies school of thought that says things only make sense due to their contrast. You can only appreciate pleasure if you know pain, but I don't know, I think we can evolve past that. I think we can you pleasure. Just because it's pleasurable and not need it's opposite. I'm not sure if we'll, we'll get there. Why not? I hope while we've gotten, you know, it's all been positive up to here even though our of horrific things have happened along the way.

Speaker 2:          01:42:24       You know, it's not like the Ganga is con days. We're doing a little bit better, much lesser mind, a few choice spots. Totally on the planet, you know, unless you're in right now in Syria, which is a really crazy, you've been watching this stuff in the news. Yeah. It's very, very upsetting. What's going on over there? It's crazy. Um, but um, I'm hopeful that the world is going to, well, we'll, we'll get home. We need to, you know, the world needs to respond to them. I'm hopeful we'll move in that direction. It's fascinating how we're watching these countries that have been controlling people through fear, through dictatorships, military dictatorships, and we're watching them fold, boom, boom, boom, just left and right. And everybody knows and they're all terrified. Yeah. You know, it's all, how long can you hold down? How long can you resist the movement and movement?

Speaker 2:          01:43:11       You know, that's gonna make you, you're not going to be a trillionaire anymore, Mr. Well, people, people, people will persist and they'll, there'll be successful. Actually Kurzweil is also known for predicting the, so when the Soviet Union would collapse, did he really accurately, wow. Yeah. Yeah. You figure it out. Well, because he was, he saw the exponential growth curves of information technology and he predicted that basically the free flow of information would eventually be too much for that insulated. Just put it in a computer program or say, oh no, he had predicted it. He, he, he has an uncanny ability to make predictions that come true. It's the reason that he's called the smartest man since Edison, by all these people. And when I met him was because I did a short on current TV called the immortalists. What's, what's, what's focused on just the maverick techno optimists who were trying to find a solution to the problem of death.

Speaker 2:          01:43:57       And I became friends with him and I felt like, wow, this is the most brilliant guy and I want to do everything I can to help push these ideas forward because these are the biggest ideas in the history of the world. And, uh, and then, uh, I became even friendlier with him because I also became very good friends with Barry Ptolemy who directed transcendent man, the film about Kurzweil. And, uh, and since then, fucking fell amazing. Transcendent man is, I've seen it several times. We'll do really inspirational. Yeah. It's a magnificent dock. And, uh, and if you, you would love Barry, the director, he's awesome and a shorter one. And there's a feeling of a labor of love because what we're doing is we're evangelizing some ideas that could transform the human condition and unfathomably rich ways. And you know, you have Kurzweil who's just like what he's lending us with these ideas and with his mind is just, there's nothing short of astonishing.

Speaker 2:          01:44:43       As I was saying earlier, such a dramatic thing to watch to his pursuit of this, you know, his pursuit of enlightening people as to the consequences and the radical possibilities that it's, it's such food for your brain. Yeah. You know, Kurt's while was one of the, you know, there's so many on the Internet. I mean it's, it's, it's a way, it's an amazing time to influence by people and to be able to repossess a blog entries like literally like a day after something happens. You know, someone interesting, we'll blog something and it just, it, I mean, what a strange time we have. Totally. It's, this is the strange, strange time in human history. We're swimming in it, we're swimming in it right now. During this time. The rate of change gets faster. Evolution is telescoping basically. So it took a billion years to get to a certain point.

Speaker 2:          01:45:30       And then the last hundred years we've created more change. So the rate of things change and gets faster and faster and faster until it's no longer even quantifiable until we kind of like merge with our technology. Ever get recruited to speak at one of those 2012 conferences. I'll do it. I just spoke at digital life design in Munich, which is like, it's a super kind of technology futurism invite only event. It was awesome. Like Yoko Ono spoke and wow. Sheryl Sandberg, the president of Facebook's about Yoko Ono spoke. Yeah, there's a lot of like, I dunno what she spoke about it Mr. Todd, but I'll show you. She used to fuck a famous guy. There you go. No, but that was actually my video was shown at the Economist magazine Ideas Festival. Oh Wow. So you can imagine when you have like a crowd of like the economist, then you're showing them these videos and then you know, the best part they got it, dude.

Speaker 2:          01:46:15       They didn't think that I was just like some crazy hippies spewing forth these ideas. Rhapsodic they totally get it. And I spoke at the singularity summit incidentally, which is the conference that's all about the technological singularity. And I spoke about the importance of art design and aesthetics to come make stick to sort of transmit with these ideas because people only respond to what moves them. You know, can only show them so many graphs before they fall asleep. But if you inspire them, if you epiphany's him, if you give somebody the goosebumps, they'll remember it and I showed the videos and sure enough, like people really seem to respond to them. So they're definitely, it's creating a kind of, I'm hopeful. I think I'm going to be speaking at Google in March actually as well. A friend and friend to setting that up. Let's Yoko Ono. Like I didn't meet her, she was speaking in the other atrium at the same time as me.

Speaker 2:          01:46:57       She was my competition. Does she speak and Larry inside of a bed? Like did they just like roll a bed up onto stage and she says [inaudible] Graham, John Lennon in there, whether it's just like young John Lennon and now today you'll call. No, it's just a fucking tricky. It's really, really darkly lit and they sing. Imagine, would you fuck Yoko Ono? No. She had an art exhibit that I went to when I lived in Boston. It was really bizarre. It was one of the strangest art exhibits ever. And one of the things she had was a block of wood with a bunch of nails in it. And uh, there was a hammer and a box of nails there and she encouraged people to pick up the nails and contribute to the art. Wow. And she said that that's how she wanted people to be enthusiastic about our art by letting them contribute.

Speaker 2:          01:47:42       And my joke was, take the nail, putting your forehead. I'd be a line around the block. I'm, no, no, nobody's probably going to hit the nail. But it'd be interesting to watch, you know, if there was just her standing there with the nail in her forehead and she left a hammer there. Most, most people are not going to kill you, but you never know, man. You never know, John. That would be an interesting art piece, you know, that'd be a pretty fucking crazy thing to do. Anybody please steal this idea. Yeah, and everybody else, please don't hit him in the head with a hammer that's fucked up. You know what's interesting about art? I always think the kind of art I'm interested in is that the art that is there to kind of move me in some way. You know, there was a great notion of, do you ever notice why beauty?

Speaker 2:          01:48:27       Sometimes it makes you sad like true beauty, like something really rapturously beautiful. Well I'm a man so that doesn't happen. I'll get sad. I'll cure like strip strip clubs like [inaudible]. No, I'm talking about sunset something sublime. That doesn't make me sad. I look at true beauty like a, like a magnificent gift to the universe. So that's, that's what I give it to. But you know why it sometimes makes me sad is because they say that Alan [inaudible] says that the reason it makes sense because the beauty, what beauty hints at is at times the exception. So it reminds us of a lot of the mediocrity that surrounds us. And then we're like sad because we see a glimpse of the ideal and mankind has been obsessed with the ideal ever since. You know, we started making the Greek statues of David back in the day and that's all well and good until you start getting gray hair on your balls and then you know, you start appreciating things cause you will as the end is near.

Speaker 2:          01:49:20       Oh so sad. Right? It's just life. No, I know. [inaudible] I appreciate, I do not get sad when I see beautiful things ever. Just entropy. I love [inaudible]. I love it. I love beautiful things too. But he gets out a little bit. Well I, they, beauty moves me. Do you ever have sore nipples when you see, if you see like once a month it gets sore and I'm just being completely ridiculous. I'm sorry, I'm just trying to be funny. Maybe. Maybe it's a Latin thing. Comedians sometimes. Do you dye your pubes show? No. Why? Why not? Ship them off? Yeah. They're only on the, on the sac. The SAC is the only the gravy ones in the bushes. All black. A jungle. Dark, sad. Okay. So it's scary. See, it's telling me in the box, I need to see your, the documentary fear spirit. You say that right there, man.

Speaker 2:          01:50:03       You need to pause. I'm talking about my boss. Like I need to see your 40 and shit right there. Sign. I didn't have to phrase that like that. That's like, that's like, that's almost in the same category as making somebody flinch. You're obviously not used to doing the stupid show like this. No, I'm kidding. This is amazing, man. Amazing having you on, man. You're blowing people's minds. Hey, you didn't pause enough. First thing that either Joe, what happened blowing, blowing or you're right. Very good point. Very good point. Um, anyway, you were saying something about your documentary, the spirit molecule. The dog wasn't mine. All I did was I was, I was like the rod sterling of it and you know, it's just all the stuff that they wanted. I was, it was an honor just to do it for him. It's a, my friend Mitch Schultz who did it was really, uh, a very illuminating

Speaker 5:          01:50:52       documentary called Dmt, the spirit molecule. A lot of like really interesting, intelligent and brilliant people who have had DMT experiences and the time that's available. I'm pretty sure it's on iTunes. I know it's online. You can find it. Google it by. It's really good. You'll love it. Very cool. Yeah, it's a fascinating, um, thing that there's some sort of a chemical that you, human, the human mind makes. It's the most intense psychedelic known demand. It's really weird. You know,

Speaker 2:          01:51:16       it makes you ask all these questions and why it evolved because there's a reason that

Speaker 5:          01:51:20       when you were talking earlier about the idea of engineering states of consciousness that we're going to be able to engineer a state of complete total bliss. Totally. You know, the idea that you're going to have a DMT button on the end of your fucking

Speaker 2:          01:51:31       key chain is pressing Du du, Du, Du, Du, Du, Du Phil. He is going into some fucking crazy spiral of going to be like with no boundaries. You imagine if we were, but that's all anyone's going to do. I'm just going to DMT trip all that. Yeah. Well, there was an article in wired recently about an Djs using nanoparticles in the future to get the audience like literally. Hi. Wow, that's incredible. Instead of using chemical technology, electronic technology. Oh, D people, man. Well, I don't think [inaudible] o d people.

Speaker 5:          01:52:04       The song was so good. It made someone to have a fucking heart attack. Jim [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          01:52:08       Well, yeah, but then what? That nobody would want to go. If that happens, people will go for the ecstatic.

Speaker 5:          01:52:13       Yeah. There's a few policies. You can't make it. She can't run up hill. That sounds, yeah, that sounds ridiculous, but the, the idea of nanoparticles. Yeah. Oh yeah. We'll like in your change the way you think and chicken as a whole row of people change the reality. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:52:30       Did you must get crazy managing. We're going down the rabbit hole for sure.

Speaker 5:          01:52:34       Which is this, what if this is the future? We all go into a gigantic airplane warehouse, right? Like an airplane hangar. They closed the doors, they hit the button, the nanoparticles come out and all of a sudden we're in Avatar.

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       Yeah. We're flying through space ships and shit. All of this is taking place. We're just standing there. We were in real life, real life. We're just standing there. Why wouldn't you? That's exactly what we engineers, your entire imagination creates an image that it is uploaded to your consciousness and everybody experiences it totally and that move around in it and like reality. You can change it. Yeah, you can change it and alter it. Exactly. Dude. We're all be world builders. You can use imagination inside that world because if you think about it, that's already the world that we live in. It just has taken longer to execute it because somebody thought of an airplane and then they imagined themselves flying on the airplane and then they built the airplane and then it worked and then they flew in. Today we all fly. It's just that because it took 40 50 60 70 years, it doesn't feel like we just created the world that we live in, but we didn't just create, we literally just created it.

Speaker 2:          01:53:38       I mean, that's the craziest part of all that. That's not a metaphor. That's not an exaggeration. We live inside of worlds that we have created and yet we're still a part of this gigantic thing, this planet, you know, we're still a part of this hive of organisms. How did we come about? How did we emerge so prominently? I mean, I know there's a lot of theories, but what do you subscribe to? The stoned ape theory? Do you have your own theory? No, I think, I mean, you know, it's difficult to prove right, but I definitely, I find it the most captivating account and makes sense to me based on every very captivating people don't know. Explain to people what the theory is. Yeah. Well, the stoned ape hypothesis basically tries to explain at one point sort of language emerged, you know, from a species that couldn't speak to a species that could change the operating system of the brain.

Speaker 2:          01:54:25       It's referred to as the first singularity and Terence Mckenna says that this occurred when early hominids left the jungle for the Savannah's and in the savannahs their diets change and they were ruffling around for whatever they could find to eat and the magic mushrooms that were growing in the cow dung or yeah, those were psychedelic. And so when they started taking them, they wouldn't have been able to make sense of the synesthetic experience that ensued because the magic mushrooms, because synesthesia among their, their hallucinatory qualities, which means a blurring of the census. And wasn't there something about it increasing the size of the human brain over a period of like he talks about and then food in the gut and brain size. Is that, how real is that? I believe so. I mean there's an account of it and food of the gods of how it literally changed the structure of the brain. But I think the most compelling kind of like visual is when he says psychedelics can be synesthetic and that means seeing sounds hearing site. We talked about this, right? And that's what language is. Language is psychedelic. Yeah, it is. I send images wirelessly into your head by making vocal sounds. I mean, I mean that's like, that's like I'm, I'm already a cell phone. I send thoughts to you telepathically into your head. I mean, so it's like where did that arise from? And so it's an theory. It's definitely

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       like, whoa dude. Like it's not really well accepted in the scientific community. No rock. And really it's a little too silly. I mean I brought it up to people and they've gotten that upset at me for it. Preposterous. It was the idea that it's a wonderful mythology though. It's beautiful. It's, if it was true, it'd be awesome. And the thing that really hits people about it as, even though you know it's probably at this point in time unprovable but hits people about it is the profundity, is that a word of the psychedelic experience? The first time you ever have a mushroom experience and you realize like, well you're dealing with is so profound and so powerful and so impactful. Who's to say that if you didn't eat this everyday wouldn't make your brain grow bigger? It really seems like it might not to mention that man has had a symbiotic relationship with these plants for its entire, for the, for our entire history.

Speaker 1:          01:56:29       I mean, you know Francis Crick who discovered the DML is said to have experimented with LSD. Like I said, well also said to have come up with the idea of the double helix while he was on Lsd. Okay. But that could have be horseshit because it was like after he was already dead and it was like one of those deathbed confessions, it could have been that his friends just really into acid does like, I'm just going to fuck up everybody by telling everybody to Francis Crick. He told me he was on acid when he died. Maybe it's not the drugs, it's what drugs could do to their thinking, which could have been triggered by other things as well. It's a counterintuitive nonlinear out of the box thinking, you know, seeing the world in new ways requires tweaking how you perceive the world will bomb. Big Part of what the brain is is it's a chemical reaction.

Speaker 1:          01:57:09       We know that when you were adding alcohol, adding anything to that chemical reaction, right? It changes the result and the data that comes in is perceived differently. Absolutely, and we know that we can tap into something. When you give somebody mushrooms or you get some, you tap into this incredible blissful experience and it's akin to a religious experience. When we understand the brain perfectly, we will be able to insert ourselves into superman. Like that movie limitless was actually very prescient because it actually didn't end with a dystopia warning, cautionary tale. It was like, no, he figured it out and he wins. Yeah, no kidding. Do you, do you think that any of this would have taken place, any of this experimentation, any of this would've without psychedelics if there were no psychedelics, is it possible that that an ape has become a human and the human has become almost immortal as well? Listen, here's what I think. I think that we need

Speaker 4:          01:58:01       to live inside of minds that can go from living in caves to flying through the air and jetliners. We need to be able to make leaps of thinking of that scale. But we have to do it in a compressed timeframe. It took 150,000 years to go from caveman to flying and jetliners. I'm the less it happened. So if you, if you do, if you look at deep time, it's only a blink and the evolutionary scale. It's less than a blink in less than a blink of a blink of a blink. We went from naked monkeys to jetliners and 1.5 billion minds during their mind work in a space that is in space called the Internet. A blink of a blink of a blink. So what's to say that the blink

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       is not going to be equal parts astonishing and equal parts sort of transformational dude. Fucking is. Yeah. You just nailed it. Yeah. God Damn. A blink of a blank. It's so hard to wrap your head on 150,000 years ago we were in caves. That's insane, dude. It's really almost impossible to wrap your head around how recent that is. Blink of a blink of a blink of a blink. So what the fuck happened? How did we just take off one like that? Triumph. It's amazing. Something happened because nothing else from back then is any different. Right. Everything else from 150,000 years ago is the same. Right. And where is it? Where is this leading fucking nuts might've such a blank canvas for us to paint. That's the hardest thing for us to wrap our heads around. Everything else from 150,000 years ago is the same. Everything is sad.

Speaker 1:          01:59:34       Orangutans have the same habits. We just shot away from the pack and started building shit. Slingshot can mown down. Elephants was shot away. We slingshot clear bombs. Slingshotting and bootstrapping complexity builds upon itself and it gets faster and faster and faster. Sexting Kim Kardashians show boom. 2012 it's amazing, dude. That's amazing. It's so freaking fucking exciting. Yeah, it is in you're allowed to curse or you should do is do like a lot of like citing dude, like it's so like, it's so, wow. Yeah. Like it's so, wow. It's so happening right now. You know, it's, it's, I think in the future when we look back on this day and age, you know, with is, you know, objectively as we can, we were caught in a technological tornado. Oh, you know, and it's tsunamis happening in a way that we adapt to it. You know, people are very adaptive.

Speaker 1:          02:00:31       Totally, totally. We're awesome at, at, you know, recognizing our environment has changed and adjusting. We're really good at that, but the fact that we're able to do it with something as mind blowing as the Internet is really incredible in the fact that, you know, at this point in time, you see societies all over the world trying to be more and more restrictive when it comes to the answer to that because they recognize this is their usurper but you surfer is not. Yeah, totally. Rick Santorum. No, it's the fucking Internet man. The Internet is going to take over to the stated. The nature is what gay people to get married. I mean, an organism wants to maintain the status quo if it has been a successful organism, and that is cultural context or certain businesses or corporations or business models that have worked for certain groups of people for a long time. It's in their interest to want to persist, but the reality is that we all need to become cheerleaders for evolution and that means embracing disruption. Yeah. That means also letting gay people get married. You fuckheads owe hundred cows in percent, like 100% like gay marriage should be 100% legalized everywhere. Marijuana should be 100% legalized everywhere this Rick Santorum do. That's one of the things he stands for. He doesn't want gay people to be able to get married. It's like, what do you fucking care? Well, that's, that's the caveman mentality.

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       No, he's scared people. What I wrote on my Twitter was that the only reason

Speaker 5:          02:01:44       why anybody would want gay people who are not married, either they're dumb or they're secretly worried that Dick's are delicious. I think that must be what it is. I think that's a lot. They're just worried that if there's a lot of gay guys around, I'm writing, you know, there'll be stuck in the deck. They just don't trust themselves. They're not that

Speaker 4:          02:01:58       sure that they're not yet hit upon and look at that. Look at a bunch of the behavior. Yes,

Speaker 5:          02:02:03       his bone structure of the way he carries himself. He can be tricked you get that guy's not an alpha running around telling people up.

Speaker 4:          02:02:10       Okay. I think the biggest, the biggest rule should be, you should not be able to impose your own moral rules on other people. It's like censoring books or censoring thought to each his own. As long as you're not physically hurting anybody else. If it offends you, I don't care. You're free to say whatever you want. I'm free to say whatever I want. We respect and tolerate each other. But you know, actually Bill Maher said to be tolerant of intolerance. That's the problem. That's why moral relativism doesn't work. That's why you can't just say, oh, and cultures in the Middle East where they're stoning women to death. Oh, that's just a different culture. We've got to respect it. No, you don't respect that cause that's being tolerant of intolerance,

Speaker 5:          02:02:45       right? Yeah. He's, it has a brilliant, Tim Harris has a brilliant talk about that. Yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's a strange thing, man. It's a strange thing where people will embrace this, this notion of fear and of, of, of someone different than them enough, you know, that somehow or another this is going to erode moral fiber and that your way of thinking is correct and what these people want to do that hurts you, not one iota. Right. You're going to somehow another prevent and do it righteously under the guise of some fucking book. Right. Like, you know, I wrote that in like a bunch of people were saying, you know, tweeted me back and like, you know, I'm a Christian and that's, come on man. Really stop. What do you give a fuck of some gay dude you, oh, because I'm a Christian, because you're Christian, you care about gay people getting married, let him do whatever the fuck they want.

Speaker 5:          02:03:26       It doesn't make your thing any different. You know, what does this divorce, not they should, you know, just divorce. I'll make your shit any weaker. It was when 60% of the people get divorced, doesn't it make marriage weaker? Does it make it look more ridiculous? You should be upset about that. It would be, should be upset about people who get married that don't really want to get married and fuck it up for the statistics of the people that are happily married. Because when you're happily married, people always tell you, you fucking search and then divorced book loop, Dude. You know what we should do is prevent people from getting married, not stop them from getting married. Okay, stop everybody from getting married. Gay people, straight people, everybody. Marriage should be illegal, period. It's not the gay folks. You know? If we're getting fucked, they should be able to get fucked too. That's my attitude. If we're caught in this ridiculous Mays, the gay folks should just jump right in as well and if you want to keep them out of the gate, it's just cause you're worried about they're marrying you. That's what it is.

Speaker 4:          02:04:20       Specially because at the roots, like, you know, even Christianity, it was all about like loving thy neighbor as you love thyself. I mean that should be like the only rule. And you know what that means is whatever your winks, your neighbor happy should make you happy. As long as he's not hurting anyone

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       else. Right? So, or I fucking you when you go to get your mail, that aint cool either. You know, it's like you're next to him in the mailbox and you're trying to get your mails and yes, God damn boy, you know that's not cool. Right? That's a little uncomfortable. And he's not really hurting anybody, but he is making you feel weird. Right? It shouldn't make you feel weird. But other than that, what do you give a fuck? It's just weird. And when I see that and break that breaks aren't tentorium guy. One state caucuses in three states, man, three of them. Colorado was one of them. Colorado, Missouri, I think Minnesota. Well, I think that, you know, a friend, my friend of mine says that evolution also thrives when there's resistance, because resistance forces evolution to figure out a way to transcend that limitation. So in a way that resistance, the people wanting to teach creationism, for example, now resistance, maybe it's just part of the system because it makes, it maintains the system to be more robust, to find ways to transcend that problem so that we don't get too comfortable ever.

Speaker 1:          02:05:32       Because there's always those sort of backwards way of thinking that could very quickly become cancers and stop the innovation that we can't let that happen. Yeah, it's, it's, it's very, it's a very tricky situation when, you know, and when you, I, the idea of being a Christian is a beautiful idea if you look at it in terms of what the, the, the real teachings of Jesus where, you know, he was a hippie. Yeah, absolutely. It was a kind, loving hippie who hung out with all types of awesome people. I mean, what a great moral example. Yeah. But we have to recognize when in 2012 we, we don't go on what people wrote down thousands of years ago. We'd go on what we know today and what we know today is that there are people that are just born gay. They just are. I've met him. You've met him.

Speaker 1:          02:06:13       There's no fucking denying. When I, there was a kid that lived up the street from me, um, about 10 years ago and he was five years old, five years old. I know this fucking kid was gay. He was five. He'd be playing in my yard and he was like super sweet to me and who would like to give me hugs and he would like to talk about like little dogs. And his mother wanted him to play football, but he didn't want to play football, you know, isn't in it. And His dad would come over, you know, real, real nice guy. He's gay now. Of course he's gay. He was gay then nobody tricked him into being gay. He didn't get recruited. He was born gay. Some people are born with red hair, some people are born with, you know, awesome eyelashes, [inaudible] human beings. We should all, like in Bryce who and what we are.

Speaker 1:          02:06:53       I mean our differences are what make us interesting. They should is wonderful. Like the real issue is some people are not gay and so they go, nobody could possibly like what I don't like, nobody could possibly really like that. That's DV and that's disgusting. And that's not freedom. That's like authoritarianism. Well it's a lack of education. It's a, it's a lack of evolution. It's a lack of information. It's, there's a lot of places in this world and you know, and, and thought pockets that are still backwards. There's still, there's still, but you think that's sort of a, an enlightened human values, like eventually Trump kind of this negative way of thinking. I mean if you think about like the, the, the modern kind of pop culture, like the mainstream films, the mainstream media would never, for example, like embrace creationism. I mean, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 1:          02:07:40       Like I feel like for the most part, well like I'm saying like you don't see like movies for example, coming out like defending creationism. Well I think someone could do it really well. I think if you had some master director, like some Kubrick type dude and a a great storyteller, they could figure out a way to craft something that would make you think that intelligent design might be very well the how the universe ones well it, but if you do it in as minutes do it. But if you do it as a poem like turns Malik's tree of life than, I mean that's a beautiful poem. But they're not like making a documentary looking at the evidence that creation. No, I meant like a 2001 type movie. Like a movie, like a piece of fiction thing is we're all craving transcendence in rapture. And the thing, what's most beautiful about this fleeting ephemeral sensation is that it's a mystery, right?

Speaker 1:          02:08:25       So it's better expressed as a mystery then to sort of anthropomorphize it and put in a man's face on it. And a beard, like fall in love with the mystery. That's, you know, a Carl Sagan. Why do you have this weird long though to believe that there's some secrets written somewhere and this is what the ancient, I think our yearning for the, our yearning for the sublime, we can't avoid it the same way. The Yearning of Arrows, right? Like it's just as embedded in us as the sex drive. Is it, or is it because we know like in our genes somewhere, another that we have gone through peaks and valleys of human behavior and human culture and that we have had periods of times where we lost information and did, you know, lose touch with our, our, the, the real, uh, tenants of society and of loving thy neighbor and all that stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:09:10       You know, this, this idea of these secret stories that we've forgotten. They, what they represent is, you know, cultures that had crashed in universal archetypes that Joseph Campbell talks about. And it's interesting because religion has become corrupted and institutionalized in many insects politics. But there's also a great theory that says that the origins of religion actually lie in the use of psychedelics. Sure. Even the concept of God seems like a vision straight out of the psychedelic experience. If you embrace it as the metaphor that it is, which is to say that something that transcends me, something is that something that feels that I'm part of something bigger than I am and what I would becomes indefinable you put a symbol on it and okay. You can call that God. Like that purple was probably born. The religious rituals were always, they, you know those in native American Cultures and native cultures that what use psychedelics and their religious ceremonies.

Speaker 1:          02:10:01       I mean, that was a part of it. Yeah. People would like to dismiss it, but I don't know anything more powerful than I've ever experienced in life other than like tornadoes and shit. You can't dismiss it. It's a fact that those things were used in religious ceremonies is the beginning of time. I would say an unbelievable powerful force, and just because it doesn't rip trees out of the roots and make fucking cows fly through the air [inaudible] yeah, that's my point. You know, I remember that movie altered states with William hurt member it. Yeah. Yeah. That was terrible. We'll try watching it now. That's unfortunately terrible. You think it's when you watch it and not,

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       it doesn't hold up at all. It was awful. I was shut him. I like the dialogue a lot though. Really? Yeah. Well he talks about the self, the individual mind that contained some mortality and I'll tell you, that was cool, but it was just so, it was, it was just so dated. It was really weird. It just didn't seem that good. Huh? I remember it being a monkey. It's not that good. Yeah, that's what I mean. I mean, this is like, who the fuck let you do this? Stop. Right. Why is he running around everything before that is awesome. His whole search for the transcendent than how he, he has a relationship with the girl and she says, even sex as a mystical experience for you. Yeah. She says that she feels like she's being harpooned by some raging monk and the act of receiving God's so death, sex and death as the connection to the divine in me.

Speaker 2:          02:11:09       It's all connected. The drugs, the sex, the transcendence. Me. I loved it when it first came out. Yeah, yeah. Watch it now. It's just, Whoa, this is fucking terrible. There's just something about, they've gotten so much better at making movies now. It's really amazing when you stop and think I'm up to, there's a piece of evolutionary evidence right there. We'll get culture culture from 1950 and culture from today. Watch. No father knows best or watching, no. You know, calling car seven or what was that fucking show they had? What was that show? Do you remember? It was like a car 69 where are you? Or something like that. Car 54 where, I mean that's, they had a show about a fucking guy driving around in a car who was a cop. Right? Yeah. It's ridiculous. You know? I remember they had Bj and the bear.

Speaker 2:          02:11:50       They had a show about a truck driver with a chimp, right? Yeah. They had to show, we've talked about before, if there with a president that was a champion, Ecog Mr. Smith or some where it was, yeah, we've talked about this before. He was, I must've been so great at the time traveling. It's crazy cause no one remembers this show at all. And I've tried to find out youtube and I can't find it. It's called mistress Samantha and he just chimpanzee as a president. He talked and he talked like Humphrey Bogart thing, hate bogey and everybody else was a person. The chimp was just running. Everyone just acted like that was normal. Well okay. Yeah. What is that about? I don't know. What do you think about people that say that the human being was actually created by a genetic intervention from extra terrestrials we'll at least.

Speaker 2:          02:12:31       That's interesting. Yeah. So 17 sexiest idea of all you can imagine the planet being seated with the primordial elements that would then like immersed, you know, you just set the emerging conditions for complex life to emerge for that is compelling because we are now doing that with artificial life and with synthetic life. I mean Craig Venter, when he created the first synthetic life form, you know the signature was written in the DNA like right of his name. So okay, so now you're creating life. You know it. We are doing intelligent design. Intelligent design is actually occurring now with synthetic biology. And so to think that some far more powerful civilization might have created the and seated and terraform the planet is, I mean, it's not outside of the realm of impossibilities. Certainly a compelling idea. It's certainly like what we're about to do. It's more interesting than, you know, God created the heavens and seven days it seems.

Speaker 2:          02:13:27       So unfortunately there's fucking asteroids and comets out there because if it wasn't for them, I'd like, we're definitely going to win this race. We're going to run this race with technology. We're going to pull through eventually we'll get our shit together. But that might not be the case. We might be like on the verge of getting it all together. No, no. But you know, Freeman Dyson doesn't have to quote him again, but he said that, uh, with synthetic biology and artificial life, we're eventually going to decode the genome of every living thing on the planet. And then we'll be able to actually have with nanotechnology, the entire biosphere and something that's, Eh, a few micro grams in weight. So the whole biosphere in the palm of our hands, and then we'll send those biospheres in the palm of our hands into space. As you talking about Adam and eve type shit, sending it into space.

Speaker 2:          02:14:06       The seat. Well this is what it is. It's an amazing, amazing, it all comes back. And then the metaphor sentence, if that's really what Adam and eve was all about, that's really what of that's the, that's the real creation. Holy Shit. That eventually the intelligent animal once you know, becoming sentient and aware of itself started on a fucking rape and killing rampage until for the created bombs and rap music than death metal and then, and then what? Yeah, and then what, how do we, how do we get out of this alive? What's your suggestion? Well, I think that that's where the cultural conversation that is happening, you know, I think what's really exciting is that the Internet allows minds to come together based on shared interests. And this will mean lol cats fans. And it will also mean, you know, the smartest signed, laughed many times.

Speaker 2:          02:14:57       Me Too. Lol Cat. That's what I'm saying. I'm saying, I have you, Evan, and hi. I love a good, and I know cat and I'm not criticizing it, but I'm saying the same thing that allows millions of people to come together over a shared delight allows also the smartest scientists and astronomers and physicists and philosophers and thinkers around the world collaborate, cross pollinate, you know all these minds working together. You know, it creates something that's greater than the sum of its individual parts, right? That's when something transcendent emerge as you put things together in a certain way and it leads to something that's greater, two plus two equaling five somehow. Until I'm confident that because of that, we will find innovative solutions that help us address all of humanity's grand challenges and that's, that's happening secularity you have to recognize each other as a super organism first, right?

Speaker 2:          02:15:41       We have to recognize each other as we're all one organ systems thinking. Yeah, that's the only way to do it. Separate yourself from the environment in which your body didn't. At some point in time, we're going to have to fix Somalia and we're going to have to fix, you know, 100% fewer copia. You look at the percent, he's fucked up places where people are starving to death and they're uneducated. They're totally unacceptable as a human entity, right? As a single organism. We have to accept that this is, we have to reengineer the situation somehow or another. And it sounds like eugenics. It sounds terrible, but that's not what I mean. I mean with education, love and food and you know, I mean, if we can put as much money into going to war, why can't these fucking piece companies come up with some lobbying money? But imagine if it was because think about a better is profitable for peace. If PR piece was more profitable than war. Good ideas. I've never had it better. Good ideas have never had it better than they do to. Absolutely agree on note. You know,

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       an idea for an airplane that was a good idea and an idea on how to build it was a good idea now. And so I think that, you know, maybe we can't articulate what those ideas are yet, but we certainly are creating the spaces in which those ideas are more likely to emerge than any other time in human history. And that is kind of a fact, I think. Yeah, I don't think anybody's as well as far as we know about human history, the only thing that fucks me up when I, I'm not willing to commit to that is the, the Egyptian period. There are some crazy shit going on in each of those motherfuckers wrong. They might, they might have been on this level, on a parallel level, there was completely different interesting construction of the hieroglyphs, the architects and architecture and engineering of fuck.

Speaker 1:          02:17:07       Well, you know, eventually they died. You know, the people that realize the highest heights, it's very difficult to maintain that tone for very long. I think there's a, you know, there's a certain revolutions per minute that you have to be hitting as a society. You have to be really completely in tuned to hit such high heights. And you know, you have to be in tune ethically, morally, but you're still a human being. So in, if that philosophy is not somehow or another genetically imprinted into the monkey in time with lack of discipline and people that aren't going to raising children, the ideas will be lost. Well, but now all the, all the world's ideas and all the world's information is now digital. The library of Alexandria. Yeah, we'll ever lose that library again. And the Internet is also distributed, right? It's not a centralized network.

Speaker 1:          02:17:50       I don't think you can knock down the ideas ever again that way unless an asteroid hits theory. Yeah, that's what I was just about to say. Yeah, I think we can, we can lose it all. We could totally start from scratch and we may have, you know, that's the big crush there. And you look at Egypt, they, how did they get that far ahead of everybody else? That's how nutty thing, man. I mean, it's almost like a joke, you know, it's almost like, you know, you think you understand history, Tut, ah, look at that. 2,300,000 stones cut into a perfect pyramid. Used to be smooth limestone with a golden cap all made back when there was no fucking wheel. Good luck. Good luck. Figured out. Well you know what the, I guess back then they weren't global. And so if that limited area was knocked out, then it affected the whole, now we're global.

Speaker 1:          02:18:33       So the only way that the whole thing could be knocked out is with an asteroid, not if you kill one pocket or another. But I think eventually using the someone real, we've got to go into space. That's why we gotta go into space. Yes, for sure. For sure. Isn't it amazing that someone at one point in time, what does it ever, it was, it was Egypt and culture. 2,500 BC. Someone got that far. Yeah. Isn't it amazing? It's totally amazing. Those struck people that don't, I mean I've never been to Egypt. I've watched a lot of documentaries. I did go to the, um, uh, to Cheech and Eatsa once, which was maybe not as impressive as Egypt because of the sheer size of some of the things. But still pretty fascinating that this was a, an ancient culture that existed over a thousand years ago and they made these amazing buildings and you're walking on the ground where they're, their civilization took place and you realize that these were like thinking philosophically, people that thought about deep things thousands of years ago, profound thoughts about space.

Speaker 1:          02:19:23       And I am a nurse and that completely fascinated by the completely fascinated by the Mayan culture and the idea that there's over a thousand Mayan temples just out there in the jungle that they haven't even discovered yet. You know, they, they find these fucking things and they just start digging into them and they're like, Holy Shit. But there'll be in Mexico City, there'll be like build an apartment, buildings and someone would go, stop. We just found the biggest temple in the history of the Mayan culture, you know, and they'll find some gigantic fucking things that are just underground or no, it's like you've got to wonder what the hell happened there? They had achieved this incredible height as far as their ability to construct these things at a stone. And then even before them, there's somebody called the old Mex. They don't even know who the fuck they were.

Speaker 1:          02:20:05       They don't even know what the language was. They have no idea. But they have these giant fat African heads of your, you know what it shows though, it shows the tendency towards complexity and the tendency towards development and progress that might have been thwarted by an existential threat or a war or whatever it is that happened. But the tendency is there. So it's this idea that like life moves towards complexity. Life is actually anti and tropic and wants to get more complex, more sublime, you know, knowledge, information wants to spread. Sentients wants to perpetuate itself. And so I think we're on the best. We're in the best ride of our, of, of, of history. I think we're, I mean, I think they, they got pretty far, but then they were thwarted. You're totally right. I just, I'm a retard. I have to figure out how it happened.

Speaker 1:          02:20:46       You know, I'm like, this is what it was. What, what happened was, you know, I, I can't even live in the moment when it comes to this. Yeah, I know. I'm still trying to pick apart the formula. How are we, we got to this point, but this point is the most fascinating point. If this point existed in the past, if we were running around like, you know, I don't think we got arms were, no, I definitely don't think so. But if we somehow or another we're running around like the Romans, I'm fucking horses and shit and yet nobody ever figured out how to make a phone and somebody found some projection thing and threw up a movie of how we live right now with cars and shit. Oh my God. People are standing in front of a fire going and do, what the fuck is this way, way crazier than anything they could ever imagine.

Speaker 1:          02:21:26       A time lapse videos of cities at night. Oh yeah. Because what you see, it's like one of your videos, there's that scene in the movie Tron, right? It says they tried to picture clusters of information as they flowed through the computer. What did they look like, or the circuits like freeways, chips, motorcycles. And when you look at a time lapse of a city at night, you do see it's just particles of light. It's just information being exchanged, you know, especially when it's time lapse. Then you're going to see the individual cars, but you just see the light, the buildings and the light. It's just information. You know? It was Dawkins who says, if you want to understand life, don't think of oozing gels and throbbing and throbbing liquids. Think about information technology. It's just information being exchanged all the time. That's all it is. If you're nursing information, if you're someone who's flying into La, I urge you to fly into La at night, right? Lions, a motherboard, dude's a motherboard. He can't believe how right. Wild it looks. How organized, how planned, how he never laid a runner, blade runner, right? You don't, we don't realize

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       how advanced we are as a society. I really don't feel you give the full perspective because of you flying to Los Angeles and he died and adaptation. Man, my friend Larry had a house up at the top of um, uh, the Hollywood hills and you would go into his backyard and it was like the craziest science fiction movie ever. Totally believe it was a real view ban all like Christmas lights all throughout the, you know, like the whole city in front of him. And it was amazing. It was a view that if I would wonder if I lived there, if I ever got anything done, cause I might just get out there every night and just stare like a fucking month. You would hope so. But probably after two weeks he wouldn't even notice it. I just don't way I would notice it if I smoke weed there.

Speaker 2:          02:23:02       Well that's out there, the joint. I'm going to look at that and go, God damn. There you go. You just hit the nail on the head. Yeah. That would be your way of getting rid of the hedonic adaptation and returning luster and wonder through your experience. Do people always say, why don't you talk about weeds so much? Man. It's kind of annoying, you know, got annoyed when you harp on weeds so much cause cause it's worth talking about now when people talk about yoga or people talk about how much they love their wine. Oh I love this. 1975 delicious red wine. People wait, let's move porridge. He can't in the wrong shit kid. I'll do it. You can use food to nourish your body. You can use food to become morbidly obese. So it's really, it's not the food's fault how you use it. Tired of this bullshit society not catching up.

Speaker 2:          02:23:45       Jason, how do we get through this? How do we get through this? Well, I mean I guess I'm just trying to make a contribution when you definitely do on that. I'm putting forth mimetic content to inspire people. I think we do that content. Never use that word because I love the word meaningful. I need to, yeah. And uh, I think that, um, I don't know. I mean, Timothy Leary, Timothy Leary, when he used to call himself like a standup philosopher performing philosopher, it was this idea of embracing pop culture and competing in the marketplace of ideas. So if you think that the marketplace of ideas could lead us astray, then contribute better ideas. I mean, I mean you're, you're doing it. You have 600,000 mines connected to your Twitter account. Yeah. That's, I mean, that's a wonderful opportunity. It's fun for you to have fun, but also, man, like you're, you can create waves of positive, positive change.

Speaker 2:          02:24:38       One of the things that's amazing is how nice people are on Twitter. To me, dude, it's so nice. I very rarely get Duisburg cable without a cable. You are tuned into 600,000 mines. Yeah. It's pretty amazing. Just thinks of amazing. Yeah, it's an amazing time. And how many of them were watching this? It was only like a couple thousand shit. The ultimately this would be on the iTunes. It'll probably be like somewhere around a half a million. Oh, that'll be fun. Yeah. Be Fun. Is All of our different points of distribution. We have it in unused treme. We put it on Vimeo. Vimeo is the poem. I mean, it was great. I loved it for video quality. Yeah. And, uh, and you know, we can put long ones on there. Awesome. No problems then we, cause Ustream hooks us up. We have available on Ustream. And so we have also in straight farm, it's just make it as easy as possible. I, I, this is my favorite thing to do. Oh, you're a podcast pioneer. I mean, you put it out there. People love, they love your style. And it's amazing because, um, you guys talk about so many different things, but um, you know, just as many people that have seen my videos and it'd be like, oh my God, dude, you got to do something at Ted. Like people watch the videos and they're like, oh my God, dude. Joe Rogan needs to see this. Like you, that's funny. This is a symptom of the Kim Kardashians era.

Speaker 2:          02:25:52       I'm, I'm right there. I'm part of the problem. Uh, I don't, I think, yeah, I think you're doing great. No, I'm just kidding, man. I'm a big fan. John. Devork. Uh, do you know who that guy is? John seed divorce? No. He's a technology guy. You know he is Brian, right? Oh yeah. I know who he is. He was, he told me that I have to get Adam Curry on the podcast because Adam Curry is the real pod father. He's the guy who really created, he's been doing it for awhile. He's the creator. The creator, right, isn't he? Didn't he help figuring out how to make podcasts? I don't know. I think they're ready to do hers. Yeah. I don't know why I'm saying this. I feel like I read that he had something to do with the actual coding of the first podcast. Might not. It might not be true either way.

Speaker 2:          02:26:29       He's like one of the originators, so I thought guys from techtv, right. John Dvorak is the [inaudible] technology called right now. He still works with twit and seen a bunch of his stuff. The podcast, the podcast allows the technology to actually get out of the way and what it does is it frees your mind. Yeah. That's why technology is psychedelic. Your mind is free to roam from 600,000 miles to their mind, to the friends, their friends' minds and their friends and minds and they're from it. You are freed by the podcast, by the tools. I mean, think about that. Think about it like how it expands the reach of each and every one of us and then it's up to what we say that will determine the size of the following and the influence what you say. Sure. Yeah, and whether you're not, you know, people want to hear the real communication, real talk.

Speaker 2:          02:27:14       We have tau. Don't you think I ain't got enough bullshit. People want to hear people really communicating and it's not enough of that going respond to authenticity. Yeah. They respond to authenticity and it's a, it's a beautiful venue for any comedian or anybody who's looking to express himself or someone like you or anybody that has an idea. It's, it's the most important thing is I just got to get this out there. I don't want to go through all these different channels to get this out there. I don't want to get it approved. What did he say tonight? Well, I'm going to say this, right. You know, I think totally, but you have to thread send it. All of those rules and limitations no longer apply and you know, eventually you'll have more impact in those like institutionalized forms of putting things out there or they won't exist anymore.

Speaker 2:          02:27:53       Then of course they're not going to exist anymore. That's, that's inevitable. Yeah. The form of government that we enjoy in the future, we'll have to be Internet based. There's, unless there's something else becomes cooler than the Internet. Nah, dude. It's going to be like the Libertarian Utopia is the seasteading institute that's building those man made islands where we can have like libertarian utopia is free of government control.
