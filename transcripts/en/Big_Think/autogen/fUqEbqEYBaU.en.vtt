course there are many other things we

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409
course there are many other things we
 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.260
course there are many other things we
can think about to try and enhance voter

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270
can think about to try and enhance voter
 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.660
can think about to try and enhance voter
participation rates especially to the

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670
participation rates especially to the
 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.919

an hourly wage job to go and stand in

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:40.249
an hourly wage job to go and stand in
 

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:42.969
an hourly wage job to go and stand in
line it could be the case that we might

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979
line it could be the case that we might
 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.760
line it could be the case that we might
seem more you know people vote on a

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770
seem more you know people vote on a
 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.410
seem more you know people vote on a
weekend instead of on a Tuesday in

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420
weekend instead of on a Tuesday in
 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.260

November we might actually subsidize

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270
November we might actually subsidize
 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.779
November we might actually subsidize
some of those you know workers on the

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789
some of those you know workers on the
 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:54.190
some of those you know workers on the
day of the election so that they don't

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200
day of the election so that they don't
 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.870
day of the election so that they don't
feel like they're losing income so some

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880
feel like they're losing income so some
 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.730
feel like they're losing income so some
of these initiatives are already

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740
of these initiatives are already
 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.099
of these initiatives are already
underway in other places across Europe

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.109
underway in other places across Europe
 

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:02.830
underway in other places across Europe
as an example I do think that we should

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840
as an example I do think that we should
 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.469
as an example I do think that we should
think about trying to enhance the

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479
think about trying to enhance the
 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.169
think about trying to enhance the
participation of voters made frankly

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179
participation of voters made frankly
 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.779

this idea of mandatory voting does fly

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789
this idea of mandatory voting does fly
 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.339
this idea of mandatory voting does fly
in the face of the First Amendment in

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349
in the face of the First Amendment in
 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.780
in the face of the First Amendment in
the United States which is the right to

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790
the United States which is the right to
 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.899
the United States which is the right to
choose but I do think that you know this

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909
choose but I do think that you know this
 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.160
choose but I do think that you know this
is actually harm

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170
is actually harm
 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.370
is actually harm
us especially if we add stealth are

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380
us especially if we add stealth are
 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.260
us especially if we add stealth are
essentially moving to an environment

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270
essentially moving to an environment
 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.090
essentially moving to an environment
where fewer and fewer people vote and

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100
where fewer and fewer people vote and
 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.880
where fewer and fewer people vote and
essentially then dictate if albeit

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890
essentially then dictate if albeit
 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.580
essentially then dictate if albeit
implicitly dictate public policies so I

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590
implicitly dictate public policies so I
 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.590
implicitly dictate public policies so I
do think we should be open to the

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600
do think we should be open to the
 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.000
do think we should be open to the
questions around mandatory voting but

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010
questions around mandatory voting but
 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.460
questions around mandatory voting but
nevertheless it is worth saying that I

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470
nevertheless it is worth saying that I
 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.990
nevertheless it is worth saying that I
think that that might be a hard pill to

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000
think that that might be a hard pill to
 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.240
think that that might be a hard pill to
swallow for Americans who do believe in

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250
swallow for Americans who do believe in
 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.920
swallow for Americans who do believe in
the First Amendment and one of the other

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930
the First Amendment and one of the other
 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.320
the First Amendment and one of the other
proposals for voters is this idea of

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330
proposals for voters is this idea of
 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.410
proposals for voters is this idea of
weighted voting and it has already been

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420
weighted voting and it has already been
 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.760
weighted voting and it has already been
misunderstood I my book has been

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.500
reviewed a number of times and it's
quite a pity that people are

quite a pity that people are
 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.030
quite a pity that people are
misconstruing and misunderstanding what

at weighted voting you could see the

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530
at weighted voting you could see the
 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.860
at weighted voting you could see the
idea of weighted voting perhaps getting

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870
idea of weighted voting perhaps getting
 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.469

very specific question that is on the
 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.210
very specific question that is on the
ballot and so for example you could

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220
ballot and so for example you could
 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.460
ballot and so for example you could
argue and some people have argued that

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470
argue and some people have argued that

simply don't know but maybe the people

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430
simply don't know but maybe the people

understanding a better understanding of
what the best use of that additional

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150
what the best use of that additional
 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.870
what the best use of that additional
dollar might be and so this idea that

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880
dollar might be and so this idea that
 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.150
dollar might be and so this idea that
their vote should count more is

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160
their vote should count more is
 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.620
their vote should count more is

hopefully we that ultimately what we

hopefully we that ultimately what we
 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.900
hopefully we that ultimately what we

for democratic processes to ensure we

having these types of proposals in place
 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.170
having these types of proposals in place
will address these particular goals in a

very specific way it may be worth just
 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.850
very specific way it may be worth just
