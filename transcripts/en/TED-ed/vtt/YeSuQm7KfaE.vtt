00:00:07.056 --> 00:00:10.144
It's midnight and all is still,

00:00:10.144 --> 00:00:14.834
except for the soft skittering 
of a gecko hunting a spider.

00:00:14.834 --> 00:00:16.792
Geckos seem to defy gravity,

00:00:16.792 --> 00:00:18.491
scaling vertical surfaces

00:00:18.491 --> 00:00:20.401
and walking upside down
without claws,

00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:24.156
adhesive glues or super-powered spiderwebs.

00:00:24.156 --> 00:00:27.014
Instead, they take advantage 
of a simple principle:

00:00:27.014 --> 00:00:30.756
that positive 
and negative charges attract.

00:00:30.756 --> 00:00:33.569
That attraction binds together 
compounds, like table salt,

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:36.620
which is made of positively
charged sodium ions

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.183
stuck to negatively charged chloride ions.

00:00:40.183 --> 00:00:42.434
But a gecko's feet aren't charged

00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:45.103
and neither are the surfaces 
they're walking on.

00:00:45.103 --> 00:00:47.355
So, what makes them stick?

00:00:47.355 --> 00:00:51.265
The answer lies in a clever combination
of intermolecular forces

00:00:51.265 --> 00:00:53.421
and stuctural engineering.

00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:58.015
All the elements in the periodic table
have a different affinity for electrons.

00:00:58.015 --> 00:01:02.765
Elements like oxygen and fluorine
really, really want electrons,

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:07.237
while elements like hydrogen and lithium
don't attract them as strongly.

00:01:07.237 --> 00:01:13.784
An atom's relative greed for electrons
is called its electronegativity.

00:01:13.784 --> 00:01:16.037
Electrons are moving around all the time

00:01:16.037 --> 00:01:19.960
and can easily relocate
to wherever they're wanted most.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.815
So when there are atoms with different
electronegativities in the same molecule,

00:01:23.815 --> 00:01:25.835
the molecules cloud of electrons

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:30.171
gets pulled towards 
the more electronegative atom.

00:01:30.171 --> 00:01:33.066
That creates a thin spot 
in the electron cloud

00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:36.309
where positive charge 
from the atomic nuclei shines through,

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:40.811
as well as a negatively charged 
lump of electrons somewhere else.

00:01:40.811 --> 00:01:43.245
So the molecule itself isn't charged,

00:01:43.245 --> 00:01:47.812
but it does have positively 
and negatively charged patches.

00:01:47.812 --> 00:01:51.675
These patchy charges can attract
neighboring molecules to each other.

00:01:51.675 --> 00:01:54.273
They'll line up so that 
the positive spots on one

00:01:54.273 --> 00:01:57.803
are next to the negative 
spots on the other.

00:01:57.803 --> 00:02:01.143
There doesn't even have to be a strongly
electronegative atom

00:02:01.143 --> 00:02:03.399
to create these attractive forces.

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.261
Electrons are always on the move,

00:02:05.261 --> 00:02:08.472
and sometimes they pile up 
temporarily in one spot.

00:02:08.472 --> 00:02:12.360
That flicker of charge is enough
to attract molecules to each other.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.804
Such interactions between 
uncharged molecules

00:02:14.804 --> 00:02:17.790
are called van der Waals forces.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.003
They're not as strong as the interactions
between charged particles,

00:02:21.003 --> 00:02:24.890
but if you have enough of them,
they can really add up.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.198
That's the gecko's secret.

00:02:27.198 --> 00:02:30.026
Gecko toes are padded 
with flexible ridges.

00:02:30.026 --> 00:02:33.308
Those ridges are covered 
in tiny hair-like structures,

00:02:33.308 --> 00:02:36.870
much thinner than human hair,
called setae.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.811
And each of the setae is covered 
in even tinier bristles called spatulae.

00:02:42.811 --> 00:02:47.434
Their tiny spatula-like shape is perfect
for what the gecko needs them to do:

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:50.589
stick and release on command.

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:53.645
When the gecko unfurls its flexible toes
onto the ceiling,

00:02:53.645 --> 00:02:59.197
the spatulae hit at the perfect angle
for the van der Waals force to engage.

00:02:59.197 --> 00:03:00.865
The spatulae flatten,

00:03:00.865 --> 00:03:03.435
creating lots of surface area 
for their positively

00:03:03.435 --> 00:03:08.389
and negatively charged patches to find
complimentary patches on the ceiling.

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:13.690
Each spatula only contributes a minuscule
amount of that van der Waals stickiness.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.613
But a gecko has about two billion of them,

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:20.334
creating enough combined force 
to support its weight.

00:03:20.334 --> 00:03:25.863
In fact, the whole gecko could dangle
from a single one of its toes.

00:03:25.863 --> 00:03:28.247
That super stickiness 
can be broken, though,

00:03:28.247 --> 00:03:31.236
by changing the angle just a little bit.

00:03:31.236 --> 00:03:33.831
So, the gecko can peel its foot back off,

00:03:33.831 --> 00:03:37.949
scurrying towards a meal
or away from a predator.

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:41.644
This strategy, using a forest 
of specially shaped bristles

00:03:41.644 --> 00:03:45.651
to maximize the van der Waals forces 
between ordinary molecules

00:03:45.651 --> 00:03:47.773
has inspired man-made materials

00:03:47.773 --> 00:03:51.992
designed to imitate 
the gecko's amazing adhesive ability.

00:03:51.992 --> 00:03:55.511
Artificial versions aren't as strong
as gecko toes quite yet,

00:03:55.511 --> 00:03:57.923
but they're good enough to allow 
a full-grown man

00:03:57.923 --> 00:04:01.943
to climb 25 feet up a glass wall.

00:04:01.943 --> 00:04:06.786
In fact, our gecko's prey is also using
van der Waals forces

00:04:06.786 --> 00:04:08.592
to stick to the ceiling.

00:04:08.592 --> 00:04:13.566
So, the gecko peels up its toes
and the chase is back on.
