00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:01.540
Hey look!

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.760
It's our friend Gregor Mendel,
the supermonk who discovered

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.500
the basic principles of genetics.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.000
Hopefully you remember all of this.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.690
Both parents contribute one
version of each of their genes

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.969
called an allele,
to their offspring.

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.599
And some of those alleles are
dominant, or always expressed,

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.880
while others are recessive and
only expressed when they're

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.619
not paired with a dominant one.

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.939
Oh, and here's our old friend
Chucky D, he lets me call him that.

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.070
All this information that Mendel
figured out would have been

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.199
really quite interesting to him,
because Darwin spent his whole life

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.359
defending his ideas of
Natural Selection

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.509
as the primary force for Evolution.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.440
But, Darwin had no idea how traits
were passed on to their offspring,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.570
even though these two guys were
living and working at the same time.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.270
Both Mendel and Darwin died not
knowing how their ideas

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.950
fit together.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.760
So today we're going to introduce
them, and their ideas,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.440
to one another, through the
science of population genetics,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.900
which demonstrates how genetics
and evolution influence each other.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.150
And I have good news!

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:01.150
It involves a lot of math!

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.510
Population genetics, on the
surface, is not a complicated idea.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.010
It's the study of how populations
of a species change genetically

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.680
over time, leading to
a species evolving.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.840
So let's start out by defining
what a population is.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.590
It's simply a group of individuals
of a species that can interbreed.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.980
And because we have a whole bunch
of fancy genetic testing gadgets,

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.040
and because, unlike Darwin, we
know a whole lot about heredity,

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.750
we can now study the genetic
change in populations over

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.740
just a couple generations.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.510
This is really exciting and really
fun because it's basically like

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.810
scientific instant gratification.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.140
I can observe evolution happening
within my lifetime, so cross that

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.200
off the old bucket list.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.860
Now part of population genetics,
or Pop-Gen, I know, we've got

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.909
fancy abbreviations for everything
now, involves the study of factors

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.120
that cause changes in what's
called allele frequency.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.930
Which is just how often certain
alleles turn up within

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.350
a population, and those changes
are at the heart of how

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.880
and why evolution happens.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.869
So, there are several factors that
change allele frequency

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:01.490
within a population.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.310
And just like Fast and Furious
Movies, there are five of them.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.720
And unlike Fast and Furious
movies, they're actually

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.529
very very important and are
the basic reason why all

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:12.260
complex life on earth exists.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.409
This main selective pressure is
simply natural selection itself,

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.359
Darwin's sweet little baby which
he spent a lot of his career

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:19.659
defending from haters.

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.700
Obviously, we know this,
Natural Selection makes

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.450
the alleles that make animals
the strongest, most virile,

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.400
and least-likely-to-die more
frequent in the population.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.189
Now, most selective pressures are
environmental ones, like food

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.419
supply or predators or parasites.
But at the population level one of

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:37.409
the most important evolutionary
forces is sexual selection,

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.489
and population genetics gives it
special attention, particularly

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.819
when it comes to what's called
nonrandom mating.

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.150
Which is a lifestyle that I
encourage in all of my students.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.010
Do not mate randomly.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.129
Sexual selection is the idea
that certain individuals will be

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.230
more attractive mates than others,
because of specific traits.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.099
This means they'll be chosen
to have more sex and therefore

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.829
have more offspring.

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.389
The Pop-Gen spin on things is that
sexual selection means mating

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:04.480
isn't random. There are specific
traits that are preferred,

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.349
even though they may not make the
animals technically more fit

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.769
for survival. So sexual selection
changes the genetic makeup

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.359
of a population, because the
alleles of the most successful

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.849
maters are going to show up more
often in the gene pool.

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:18.709
Maters gonna mate!

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.169
Another important factor here,
and another thing that Darwin

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.930
wished he understood,
is mutation.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.939
Sometimes when eggs and sperm are
formed through meiosis,

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.230
a mistake happens in the
copying process of DNA.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.069
"Bad" errors in the DNA could
result in the death or deformation

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.949
of the offspring, but not all
mutations are harmful.

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.730
Sometimes these "mistakes" can
create new alleles that benefit

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.230
the individual by making it
better at finding food,

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.459
avoiding predators or
finding a mate.

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.209
These "good" errors, and the
alleles they made, are then

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.199
passed to the next generation,
and into the population.

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.620
Fourth, we have genetic drift,
which is when an allele's

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.430
frequency changes due
to random chance.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.559
A chance that's greater if
the population is small,

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:00.040
and thus happens much more quickly
if a population gets knocked

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.120
way back by a tornado or something.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.049
Genetic Drift does not cause
individuals to be more fit,

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:05.949
just different.

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:08.839
Finally when it comes to allele
game-changers, you gotta respect

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:10.109
the gene flow.

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.370
Which is when new individuals
with different genes find their

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.010
way into a population and spread
their alleles all over the place.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.739
Immigration and emigration are
good examples of this,

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.729
and as with genetic drift its
effects are most easily seen

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:22.979
in small populations.

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.659
Again, our factors:

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:27.470
Natural Selection: Alleles
for fitter organisms

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.909
become more frequent.

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:31.990
Sexual Selection: Alleles for
more sexually attractive organisms

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.159
become more frequent.

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:36.949
Mutation: New alleles pop up
due to mistakes in DNA.

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.180
Genetic Drift: Changes in allele
frequency due to random chance.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.319
Gene Flow: Changes in allele
frequency due to mixing with new,

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:45.569
genetically different populations.

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.729
Now that you know all that,
in order to explain specifically

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.729
how these processes influence
populations, we're going to

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.610
have to completely
forget about them.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.710
This is what's called the
Hardy-Weinberg Principle.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.159
Godfrey Hardy and
Wilhelm Weinberg

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:03.370
were two scientists in 1908 who
independently, at the same time,

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.050
came up with the exact same
equation that describes how,

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.000
under the right circumstances,
Mendelian genetics works

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.110
at the scale of a whole population.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.050
But those "right circumstances"
assume that none of the factors

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.330
I just mentioned are at play.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.419
Hardy and Weinberg's simple
equation shows us the frequency

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.289
with which you could expect
to find different alleles

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.120
within a hypothetical population
that's not evolving.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.939
This weird hypothetical
state is called

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:29.210
the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium,

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.949
in which the frequency of alleles
in a population remains constant

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:33.569
from generation to generation.

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:37.400
And to make sure that happens,
NO FUNNY STUFF is allowed

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.099
to go on.

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:40.759
To wit, the Hardy-Weinberg
Equilibrium requires:

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:42.439
1. NO natural selection,

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:45.789
which means that no alleles are
more beneficial than any other,

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:48.259
so the better alleles will not
be selected within a population.

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:50.330
2. NO sexual selection,

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.349
which means mating within the

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:53.780
population must be
completely random

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.550
no individual can have a better
chance of getting it on than other.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.860
3. NO mutations,

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.050
because mutations modify
the gene pool.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.270
4. Hardy-Weinberg demands a
gigantic population size because

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.330
the smaller the population,
the more likely you are

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.330
to get genetic drift.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.030
5. Finally, NO gene flow,

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.530
that means nobody can bring over
their hot cousin from

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.110
the next island over, because that
would significantly mess

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.960
with the allele frequencies,

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.289
if you know what I mean.

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:18.590
So, clearly, no fun
and lots of rules.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.969
Hardy and Weinberg, they figured
this out at the exact same time,

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:24.770
so it can't be that complicated,
because it wasn't some kind of

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.590
stroke of Einsteinian inspiration,
they just figured out a thing that

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.710
was pretty simple. So the question
is, can we do the same thing

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:32.370
right now?

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.560
Can we figure it out on our own?

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.199
What we're looking for is the
relationship between the phenotype

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:39.699
and the actual frequency of the
genes in the population.

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:41.770
So how do we proceed from here?

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:42.870
Alas...earwax.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.539
The consistency of earwax
is a Mendelian trait.

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:49.800
Wet earwax is a big W because
it's dominant and dry ear wax

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.509
is recessive so it's a little w.
Now let's call the frequency

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:54.669
of the dominant, wet allele
of the population p

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:58.789
and the frequency of the
recessive, dry allele q.

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:01.490
Which if you've ever noticed,
q is kind of a backwards p.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.409
Since there are only two alleles
for this gene in the

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:06.270
entire population, p + q = 1.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:12.539
So if the frequency of p is 75%,
the only other thing

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:15.110
it could be is q,
so that's going to be 25%.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.830
Which is 1.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.110
So imagine we go to this
hypothetical, no-fun,

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.389
Hardy-Weinberg island and
there are 100 people.

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:23.909
We poke every single one of them
in the ear and 9 of them

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:25.620
have dry ear wax.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:32.620
So that's 9/100 or 9% or 0.09.
You know math?

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:33.949
But this is not q.

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:37.580
It's not the frequency of the
little w, it's the frequency

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.189
of the homozygous ww.

00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:44.199
So this is the expressed phenotype.
It's not the genotype.

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:47.449
We don't know that yet.
We know the frequency of ww.

00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:50.620
But you know there's got to be a
lot of other w alleles hanging

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.699
around in heterozygous pairs.

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:55.219
So how do we figure out where
those are, how many

00:07:55.219 --> 00:07:56.599
of those there are?

00:07:56.599 --> 00:07:59.779
Well, I have no idea.
I now, am stuck.

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:01.479
I do not know.
I am lost.

00:08:01.479 --> 00:08:04.319
When I'm stuck in situations like
this, what I do, is I go back

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:05.240
to what I DO know.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.229
And what I know is that the
frequency of Big W plus the

00:08:08.229 --> 00:08:11.460
frequency of little w = 1.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.029
But that's in the entire
population, and in each individual,

00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:17.819
we want to know their genotype,
so two different alleles.

00:08:17.819 --> 00:08:20.529
So what's happening is this is
happening twice in

00:08:20.529 --> 00:08:23.909
every individual, so what we
need to do, is square it.

00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:28.439
And when we square that equation,
if you remember algebra at all,

00:08:28.439 --> 00:08:30.120
you get:

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:37.120
p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.360
And that, my friends, is what
Hardy and Weinberg did,

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.750
and IT is the
Hardy-Weinberg equation!

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.660
So p squared is the odds
of it being a WW.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:51.180
This 2pq here is the heterozygotes,
and the q squared

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.870
is the homozygous recessive.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.520
Well good news! We know ww.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.100
We know the homozygous recessive
is 0.09, so we already

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.370
have that information.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:05.440
We know what q squared is,
it's 0.09, and in order to get

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.780
what q is we just take
the square root of that.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.330
That was a horrible square root symbol.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:15.060
Which is 0.30 or 30%. A 30%
frequency of the q allele

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.070
in the population.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.780
Then we just use the simplest
equation in the world to

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.580
figure out what p is.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.060
This minus 1.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.090
And that's 0.70.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.820
Now, using our Hardy-Weinberg
equation we can go beyond the

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.080
frequency of the alleles and
actually talk about the

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.520
frequency of the genotypes.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.750
So the frequency of the WW
homozygous dominant is p squared.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:39.420
We have p. So we just square this
and that equals 0.49.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.690
Or 49% of the population
is homozygous dominant.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.540
Now the math gets even easier
because we know p and q.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.370
So to figure out how many
heterozygotes there are,

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:52.580
we just do 2 times p
which is 0.70

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.760
times 0.30,
which is q,

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.460
which is 0.42.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.820
Which is math that
I did beforehand.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.560
No, I didn't just know that.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.210
So 9% of the population is
homozygous recessive, 49% is

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:05.360
homozygous dominant,

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.990
and 42% heterozygous,
displaying wet earwax,

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.080
but with that little w
in there as well.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:15.100
What's awesome about all of this
is we can see Mendel's ideas work

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.680
in a big population, and when
things aren't lining up with

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.690
this equation, then we know that
there are one of those

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:22.190
5 factors at work.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:23.550
Probably more than one.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.020
For example, a bunch hot surfers
moved to the island, and they

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.340
all happened to have dry earwax.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:34.340
And they start spreading their hot
surfer genes all over the place.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.000
Nonrandom mating: it always goes
out the window whenever the

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:37.960
hot surfers get involved.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.370
I don't know about you,
but this stuff's

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:40.340
pretty beautiful to me.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.060
So don't give me too hard of a
time in the comments,

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.720
where you can ask questions!

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.890
Or on Facebook or Twitter.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:49.640
Thank you for watching this
episode of Crash Course Biology.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:56.640
We will see you next time.
