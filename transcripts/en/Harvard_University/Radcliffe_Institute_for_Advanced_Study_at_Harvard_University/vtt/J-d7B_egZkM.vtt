00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.800
-Well, thank you, Judy, for
that very generous introduction.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.030
And thanks very much to
the Radcliffe Institute

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.900
for giving me the opportunity
to spend the year here.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.560
It's been just
rejuvenating to be

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.920
here amongst so many
diverse scholars and artists

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.820
and writers all pursuing their
projects with such energy.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.660
So today, I want to tell you
about my work here, which

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.620
is as Judy was saying,
a new direction for me,

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.460
applying polymer
physics and theory

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.870
to try to help in a larger
project, which is to develop

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.810
new polymers for solar power.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.260
The original title of my talk
was some very complicated

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.760
thing.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.330
And it should have been this.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.470
And there should be a
question mark at the end

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.250
here since this is prospective.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.590
These materials are
not, by any means,

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.600
commercial yet, as you'll see.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.830
Where I'm normally
located is Penn State.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.820
This is our iconic Old Main
viewed across Old Main Lawn.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.230
So the outline of
my talk, I'll begin

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.490
with a summary, an
introduction of current trends

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.800
in solar power,
present technology,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.550
how it's being
applied, and give you

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.640
a status report on where we
are in terms of solar power

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.900
being an important contributor
to power in the world.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.080
I'll then talk about how
solar cells work, briefly,

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.170
and I hope in an
understandable way,

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.540
in order to motivate
how one might develop

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.260
a new kind of material
different from what we use now

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.700
for making solar cells and
why we might want to do that.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.550
And then how we might do
it, how we would think

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.190
about designing those polymers.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.190
And I've used the word
polymers about six times.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.590
And Judy neatly introduced
them as long-chain molecules.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.370
And trust me, I'll tell you
with pictures what they are

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.180
and why they might be
useful for this purpose.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.660
And then I'll talk
about how theorist

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.080
can help in this project.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.120
I'm a theoretical
physicist, but not

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.050
the sort that you
think of when you think

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.400
of a theoretical physicist.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.310
I don't work on the early
universe or black holes

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.010
or supernovas or
superconductors or absolute zero

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.050
or quantum entanglement
or anything like that,

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.970
but just mundane properties
of solids and liquids

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.340
and where those properties come
from and how to design them in,

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.200
so how theorists can
help in this project.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.710
And then, at the very
end, I'll give an example

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.160
that illustrates a
style of our thinking,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.800
how a theorist might
work on this problem.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.450
So it tunnels from the
large to the particular.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.240
So arguably, the greatest
technological challenge

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.685
of the century is finding
replacements for fossil fuels.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.200
Fossil fuels have been an
incredible boon to humankind.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.170
They made the Industrial
Revolution possible.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.440
They are indispensable in modern
life and developed nations.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.420
And yet, it's time, and
in fact, really past time

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.900
to begin to bid them goodbye.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.630
And the reason for that
as you're all quite aware

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.230
is climate change,
global warming.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:50.110
And over the past two
centuries roughly,

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.170
since the start of the second
Industrial Revolution powered

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.290
by burning fossil
fuels, we've been

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.340
returning carbon
that was deposited

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.410
over hundreds of millions
of years in two centuries

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.480
into the atmosphere.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.710
And as a result, CO2
levels in the atmosphere

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:08.750
have steadily risen.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.420
And that has led to the
planet steadily warming.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.260
You can draw a line, more
or less, through this data,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.140
and particularly, post-war
with more and more growth

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.500
of fossil fuel
use, and this trend

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.000
is playing havoc with climate.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.180
And so that is the most pressing
reason, not the only reason,

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.360
for wanting to
replace fossil fuels.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.220
Now this isn't going to be easy.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.630
Fossil fuels, oil,
natural gas, and coal,

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.210
are uniquely convenient
sources of chemical energy.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.630
They are useful for
transportation fuels,

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.310
for powering power plants
to make electricity,

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.150
for doing chemistry, all
the petrochemicals industry

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.960
is based on this stuff,
for doing metallurgy,

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.520
for smelting metals from ores.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.120
And it won't be one
thing that replaces them.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.315
So here's a list, all of
which you've heard of,

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:19.270
of things which can
replace certain functions

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:25.515
of fossil fuels in
contemporary advanced nations.

00:05:25.515 --> 00:05:27.390
And these fuels will
continue to play a role,

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.240
I think, for a long, long time,
especially for petrochemicals

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.730
and for transportation
because they're just

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.390
so convenient for carrying
around a lot of power

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.990
in a small place.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.600
I mean, for flying
planes, for instance,

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.500
it's really hard
to imagine how you

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.870
could do that other
than with chemical fuel.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.750
You could make that
fuel with biofuels,

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.090
but you're going to need
those kinds of liquids

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.510
into the indefinite future.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.940
Here are many
sources each of which

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.620
can play a role in
replacing these, efficiency,

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.972
LED lighting and more
efficiently insulated homes

00:05:58.972 --> 00:06:01.430
and things, can be thought of
as a source of energy and one

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.530
that we really need to exploit.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.410
Geothermal, particularly
for heating.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:12.610
Every heat pump is a cheap way
of pumping heat from someplace

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:13.470
into your house.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.010
And the cheapest place to
get warmth in the winter

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.310
is actually deep in the
ground, not very deep, 10s

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.760
of feet in the ground.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.040
And that's something we should
be exploiting universally.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.280
Hydroelectric power is
clearly an attractive non

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.850
global warming form of
power, but this is not

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.600
something easily expanded
because we've basically

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.010
dammed all of the rivers
that makes sense to dam.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.810
And we've learned over decades
about the environmental

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.240
consequences of doing that.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.250
It's not something you're going
to see a lot of growth in.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.840
Nuclear power.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.110
This is going to be an
increasingly important source

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.320
of electricity as global warming
is more intensively addressed.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.340
Currently, in the US, something
like 20% of our electricity

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.710
comes from nuclear power,
just as a benchmark.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.460
And then solar and
wind, about which

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.330
there's been a great
deal of excitement

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.230
in the past five or 10 years,
but certainly in the past five

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.470
years.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:14.110
So this talk will focus
primarily on solar.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.020
But you should bear
in mind that it's

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:21.330
one component of a large
slate of replacements.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:26.910
So where are we in
this process now?

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:31.310
So if you look worldwide at the
amount of non global warming

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.980
energy and where
it comes from, you

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.920
find out that basically it comes
in more or less equal shares

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.690
from hydro and nuclear power.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.230
With solar and wind
just a tiny fraction.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.590
And all of this is
only 12% of the total.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.760
This is total energy
not total electricity.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.560
And that shows you the
scale of a challenge,

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:57.210
to grow this into something
that's big on this scale.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.330
OK.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.350
There are two different ways
of getting power from the sun.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:07.020
One way is to use
a bunch of mirrors

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:12.880
to focus sunlight onto a single
place, the top of this tower

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.220
here, that you
use to boil water,

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.540
make steam, drive a
turbine and a generator,

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.910
much as you would in any kind
of electric power generation

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:21.500
plant.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.760
And this is a good idea
in places where sunlight

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.730
is strong and continuous,
so the desert,

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:34.190
North Africa, the American
southwest, someplace like that.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:38.309
And this is photovoltaic or
what I'll call, solar electric,

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:41.020
it's a direct
conversion of sunlight

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:45.110
to electricity using those shiny
little blue panels that you

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:46.790
know.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:51.810
This is a large installation
recently open in the UK.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.020
So that's what I'm going
to be talking about

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.220
for the rest of
the talk, progress

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.320
in installing solar electric.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.720
To get an idea about the
progress that we've made,

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.600
it's useful to know
where electricity

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.040
is being consumed in the world.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.550
So this pie chart here gives
you the headline story.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.765
China, the US, the EU, and
Japan, account for about 3/4

00:09:17.765 --> 00:09:20.880
of the electricity
use in the world.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.590
And so it makes the most sense
to ask what those nations

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:29.980
and regions are doing in terms
of installing and developing

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.926
solar electric.

00:09:32.926 --> 00:09:34.550
And here's a bar
chart that shows that.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.230
What's the percentage of
electricity in those places

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:41.350
currently produced
by solar electric?

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:45.650
China and the US
are still needing

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:49.790
to make a lot of progress
around a percent each.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:54.920
The EU and Japan substantially
further along, around 5%.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.810
And Germany, if you were to
separate that out from the EU,

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.190
is still further
along with something

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.820
like 10% of
electricity from solar,

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.530
about equivalent to
nuclear power in Germany.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.440
And this-- not because the
sun shines all the time

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.500
in Germany but because
of serious political will

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.310
to do it.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:17.170
And also because the cost
of electricity in the EU

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:19.870
is something like 1.5
to 3 times as much

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:23.770
as it is, for
example, in the US.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:27.270
So this is where we are.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.350
It's important then
to ask how fast

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:34.320
the installation of current
solar technology is growing.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.660
This is a graph showing you
how much new capacity is

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.180
being installed each year.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.160
And you can see,
basically it's increasing

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.610
by 10, of whatever this
unit is, every year.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:48.830
The amount installed
is growing linearly.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.800
And so if you're trying to
make an estimate of how long it

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.685
would be before you were really
serious about solar electric,

00:10:56.685 --> 00:10:59.350
if we're at 2% now in the
world, how long would it

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.730
take to get to 20%?

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.950
One thing you could do would
be to extrapolate that,

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:07.670
say that the rate of
increase of inflation

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.420
was going to keep
going, and then

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.810
to figure out how long
it would take to install

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:14.730
enough to get to 30%-- 20%.

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:18.040
And the answer is
about 30 years.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:18.540
OK.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:25.680
So that's a way of measuring
the size of the challenge.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.210
When something's
growing that fast,

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:31.100
sometimes it makes sense
to plot it on a log scale.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:35.600
So for those of you who don't
speak log, this kind of a graph

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.630
is a special one in which
each increment this way

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.840
is a factor of 10.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.110
So that's just a funny
way of plotting things.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:46.990
And a line that's
straight on this plot

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:49.790
is what we call exponential
growth, like every 10

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:52.420
years it goes up by a factor
of 2 or a factor of 10

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.240
or whatever.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.700
And you can see
that roughly that's

00:11:54.700 --> 00:12:00.900
what's going on in terms of
the growth of solar electric.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:05.020
And so this is 2%
in the world now,

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.580
and how long would it take to
get 10 times bigger than that?

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.050
That's one of these increments.

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:12.940
And so I just draw a
little line through here,

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.710
and that's like a decade.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:19.770
So predictions are hard,
especially about the future,

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:21.410
as Yogi Berra said.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:25.050
But somewhere between
10 and 30 years

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:29.870
is maybe reasonable, unless
other things intervene,

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:32.180
where the world will have
installed a serious amount

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.270
of solar electric capacity.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.360
OK.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.950
So the current technology that's
being installed on rooftops

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.840
and farmers' fields
and so on, is

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.120
those blue, shiny blue
solar panels that you know,

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.040
is based on silicon,
the element silicon.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.130
And they're made in
great big plants.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:54.760
Silicon, basically
the same stuff

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.950
that computer chips
are made out of.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.450
And in fact, the material's
not that different

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.770
that what computer
chips are made out of.

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.840
But it's a pretty involved
process to make that stuff.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.670
It involves clean rooms
and bunny suits and robots.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.650
And then, eventually,
you get panels

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.730
that you can install some place.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:17.160
At the heart of it all is
the metal-- well, actually

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.740
semiconductor-- but anyway,
shiny, metally looking stuff,

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:24.990
silicon, which is very
carefully refined, very

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:26.690
carefully crystallized.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:29.570
You have the smelt it and
melt it and do all this stuff

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:31.300
and then slice it
into little disks

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.420
and assemble it
into these cells.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:37.390
And it's a quite
involved process.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:40.981
Nonetheless, prices have
been steadily falling.

00:13:40.981 --> 00:13:41.480
OK.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:45.580
And this is as a result of
just slow, steady engineering

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.400
improvements,
improvements of scale,

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.280
of building bigger
plants, of just learning

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.000
how to do it more
cheaply and better,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.400
the making of these cells.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:00.000
And the prices have
fallen to the point

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.149
that-- of course, it costs
more if you're a person

00:14:04.149 --> 00:14:05.940
to install this on your
roof than if you're

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.410
a utility installing
it at huge scale.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:10.870
But if you take these
prices and figure out

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:14.430
how long, in terms of the
cost of electricity, would

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:17.630
it take to pay back
the investment,

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.850
then the answer is, if you're
a residential customer,

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:21.340
it's like 20 years.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.380
This is without subsidy.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:26.140
This is at the price of $0.10
a kilowatt hour that we all

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.900
on average pay in the US.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.450
And 10 years if
you're a utility.

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.055
And that's, as I
say, without subsidy.

00:14:35.284 --> 00:14:36.950
I mean, that's not a
financial estimate,

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:38.720
but you see that you're
getting to the place

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.178
where these things
are cheap enough

00:14:40.178 --> 00:14:42.220
to really be competitive.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.410
And that's the origin of
the current excitement

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:50.230
in installing them on
a much larger scale.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.470
And so then the
politics of it matters.

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.840
And it matters whether you
do or don't have subsidies,

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.710
and whether utility companies do
or don't finagle the system so

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.580
that it's somehow less
advantageous than it

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.910
used to be to install them
on your roof and so on.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:05.170
These politics really
matter now because it's

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:09.060
at a place where the
installation is really--

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.220
can be competitive.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.070
And the situation
should improve.

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:14.380
And you can see that if the
price of electricity, as it

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:17.260
is in the UK, was one and
a half to three times more,

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.370
you see that this is
really quite attractive.

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:21.380
OK.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.180
So when you're talking
about growing something

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:28.060
another factor of 10, you might
wonder what other things might

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.380
intervene to make
that difficult.

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.910
And there's a variety of
things that might intervene.

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:36.090
A silly question
you might ask-- I

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:38.350
just bring this
up because I just

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:40.880
was trolling the internet
looking for all kinds of things

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.550
about this and there was
this, how much area would

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:47.940
it need on the world to power
the world in solar electricity

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.301
like 100%.

00:15:49.301 --> 00:15:49.800
OK.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.410
Well, it's a silly
question because the world

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:53.300
is a big place.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.790
I mean, really big compared
to the area of cities.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.390
So you can hardly even see it.

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:01.200
But that little square
in Nevada and this piece

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.000
here, they've picked the
parts which are really sunny.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.750
It's not a big
area in the world.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.907
This is not a problem.

00:16:08.907 --> 00:16:10.990
Of course that's not-- I
mean, if you installed it

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:13.950
that way, you'd have to ask,
what happens when the sun goes

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:16.192
down and how do I get the
electricity from Nevada

00:16:16.192 --> 00:16:17.400
to the places it needs to be.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.410
And obviously, there
are huge challenges

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:22.350
the more you rely only
on solar electric.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:25.160
And I'm not going to
say anymore about that.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.400
A different, slightly
more practical way

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.470
of asking this
question is how much

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:33.030
area of solar panels at the
current efficiency, the kind

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:36.900
that you go into Lowe's
or Home Depot and buy now,

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:40.070
how much area would you
need per person to supply

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.950
all the electricity in the US?

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:45.940
And so, of course, the natural
measure of area in the US

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.760
is a football field.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.280
So you want to know how
much of a football field

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.220
each person would need.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:17:00.220
And it's like that much, 40
square feet or something.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.720
And if you think about
that in terms of rooftops,

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.010
it means that if solar energy,
solar electric were really

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:08.772
going to be commonplace, every
neighborhood you went in you'd

00:17:08.772 --> 00:17:10.980
be looking on roofs and
you'd be seeing these things.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.970
That's the-- and
that's another measure

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:15.210
of the scale of the challenge.

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:18.359
They would have to be installed
in that commonplace of fashion

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:22.260
to be big contributors
to electric power.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.109
OK.

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:26.880
So that's the summary
of where we are

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.830
with the current technology.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:31.150
A different subject
that I now turn to

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.950
is what sort of possibly
displaces materials

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:38.980
are there that could be used in
place of the shiny blue stuff

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:40.830
that is currently used.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:43.690
And people have been
working like crazy on this.

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:47.730
We're not going to go through
every one of these curves.

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:49.750
Each one of these
lines represents

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:52.300
some kind of material.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.590
And all those little words
there are different labs

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:59.750
that have made records in how
efficient a cell they make.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:03.100
This graph is
efficiency versus year.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.440
So efficiency means how
much of the sunlight

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.990
shining on the cell gets
turned into useful electricity?

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:14.130
And out of this
forest of graphs I

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:15.680
want to make a
couple of remarks.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.190
First this middle part,
the blue ones, those

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:20.310
are the tried and true
materials, that's silicon.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.810
OK.

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:23.620
That's the stuff that's
currently being installed.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.990
And the current efficiency
of those things-- and you

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:28.912
can see this is not
going up very fast.

00:18:28.912 --> 00:18:30.870
People have been working
very patiently on this

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.380
for 40, 50 years.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.850
And it's hard.

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:38.090
It's around 20%.

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.760
So 20% of the sunlight
that shines on the thing

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.940
gets turned into electricity.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:46.040
These ones up here,
those purple ones,

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.210
are efficient but quite
expensive, and not likely

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:51.990
to be competitive with
this because of that ever.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:55.130
But they're great if you're
putting up a satellite

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:56.720
or if you're the
Defense Department

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.669
or if you're sending
off a deep space probe

00:18:58.669 --> 00:19:01.210
and you want to have something
that very efficiently collects

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:02.210
sunlight.

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:05.040
Because efficient
would mean smaller area

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.250
for the same amount
of electricity.

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:09.820
It's just that these
are really expensive.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:13.230
And then there's this little
innocuous little orange bunch

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:15.610
down here, which have
only really started

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:19.250
being looked at in the past
decade or so, new materials.

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:22.860
And these ones are
different from those

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.470
in a qualitative way.

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:26.960
These things are
all-- to your eye

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.230
they would look like metals.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:29.232
They're hard materials.

00:19:29.232 --> 00:19:29.940
They're crystals.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.620
They're brittle.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.850
To produce them
involves smelting

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:36.690
things in high temperatures
and stuff like that.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:38.420
These are chemicals.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:40.380
These are molecules.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.430
They're made by chemists
not by metallurgist.

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:45.990
They come from chemistry and
polymer chemistry and stuff

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:48.580
not from solid state physics.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.950
And so what I want
to transition now

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:53.860
to talk about is what
are these new materials,

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.550
why are they
potentially interesting,

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:59.610
and what advantages
might they possibly have?

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:00.320
OK.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.680
So these materials come-- the
polymer versions of them--

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.290
come from polymer chemistry.

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:05.790
OK.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.130
So I still haven't told
you what a polymer is,

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:09.800
but Judy already did that.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:13.045
And I promise next slide
that I'll tell you.

00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:14.420
Anyway, the point
is, they're not

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.480
made in these big factory
clean room things,

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.340
they're made in a continuous
way in chemical plants.

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:24.800
And they're made, well,
cheaply because polymers are

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.260
things like plastics and stuff.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.300
And those materials
are not expensive.

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.520
And so these processes
very efficiently

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.410
convert chemical raw
materials into polymers.

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:37.940
And the nice thing
about them is twofold.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.410
One, polymer chemists
have gotten really good

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:43.010
at designing different polymers
to have different properties

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.630
and do different stuff.

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:49.780
And two, they're very easily
processed into different things

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.460
that you want, like fibers
and films and stuff like that.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:56.140
And so the vision, or the
hallucination or something,

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.246
is that you could
make a polymer that

00:20:58.246 --> 00:21:00.870
would have the magical property
that when you shine light on it

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:02.220
electricity comes out.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.870
And then that you could
make it into solar cells

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:09.935
by extruding it and printing
on and things like that.

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:13.236
Of that practical end of
things, I will say no more.

00:21:13.236 --> 00:21:14.610
What I'm going to
focus on now is

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:17.660
what are these special
polymers and how on earth

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.250
could they do that?

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.080
So what's a polymer?

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.340
It's like Judy said,
a long chain molecule.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.050
So here is the very simplest
polymer, polyethylene.

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:30.310
It's a chain of carbons
with hydrogens hanging off.

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:31.650
This isn't a very long one.

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:34.260
Imagine one that was like
hundreds of carbons long.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.350
OK.

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:39.330
Sometimes we like to draw
those with little balls

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:44.820
and sticks to give more of an
idea about where the atoms are.

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.180
This one's straight.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.980
But a thing about
these molecules

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.620
is that they're flexible.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.980
Between these sticks you
can rotate them around.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:55.690
And so it can make a very
twisty shape as well as

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:56.540
a straight shape.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.400
And so it means that
just writing down

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:03.080
the sequence of the atoms, or
the monomers is the fancy word,

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.900
or beads, you might say,
the repeating units, beads,

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.280
like beads on a string, writing
down what beads they are

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:13.090
isn't the end of the story
for how the material behaves.

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:17.690
You need to know whether the
chains are maybe all lined up

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:20.140
like spaghetti immediately
out of the box,

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:24.940
or whether they are more
all tangled and twisted up

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:28.700
like spaghetti after you cook
it, or somehow in between.

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.280
And it matters hugely what
the properties of the material

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.930
are between one and the other.

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:38.598
So polymers you know.

00:22:38.598 --> 00:22:42.750
Every one of you speaks polymers
and uses them every day.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:46.190
Latex paint, the stuff
that-- not the color part

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:48.080
but everything else--
that makes the film

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.020
on the wall, that's a polymer.

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:53.500
Polycarbonate that
DVDs are made out of.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.860
Polyvinyl chloride,
PVC plastic wrap

00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:00.410
for food, polypropylene
for fibers and jackets,

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:03.490
PET that all Coke bottles
and things are made out of,

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:08.927
nylons, rubber tires, Kevlar
and bulletproof vests.

00:23:08.927 --> 00:23:10.510
There's two different
kinds of polymer

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:12.060
in diapers, the
kind that absorbs

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:15.120
and the kind that
holds it all in.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.750
And what makes
them all different

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:20.040
are the beads that
are strung together

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.730
by the polymer chemist.

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:23.660
They're all long
chain molecules.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.890
But they're chains
of different beads.

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:30.680
And it's a very long story about
where all these properties come

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.800
from and why these
fibers are soft

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.110
and why these polymers
and they're absorbent

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:37.510
and why these ones let just
the right amount of moisture

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:39.370
go through and all that stuff.

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:43.480
It depends on the
translation from these beads,

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.230
these chemical repeats,
so the material

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:48.930
properties of the whole stuff.

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:54.340
And that's the job of polymer
material science to figure out.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.330
OK.

00:23:56.330 --> 00:24:00.740
So to talk about how you
would design a polymer to do

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.250
the job of a solar
cell, you need

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:05.680
to say a little about
how solar cells work.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:06.570
OK.

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:11.080
So solar cells convert
sunlight to electricity.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:16.000
Sunlight comes in little
individual indivisible packets

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.420
called photons.

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:23.150
And so photons come in as
the sunlight is impinging

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:25.900
on the little blue stuff.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:29.880
And a little blue stuff is a
thin film of silicon material.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.800
And the sunlight gets absorbed--
the photons get absorbed.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.670
And each time a
photon gets absorbed,

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:36.924
it makes something
called an exciton.

00:24:36.924 --> 00:24:38.840
I'm going to explain
what that is in a minute.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.840
But right now, you
can think of it

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:46.180
as just a little close pair of
a positive and negative charge.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.660
And this film of
solar cell stuff

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.910
is actually two films together.

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:53.750
One film tends to pull
the electrons toward it.

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:56.450
And the other one tends
to pull the-- sorry,

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:57.820
the negative charges.

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:00.330
And the other one tends to
pull the positive charges.

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:02.820
So the exciton if it
wonders to this interface

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.700
can separate there.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.900
And if it separates,
then it would pile up

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.460
the negative charges on one
side and the positive charges.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.710
But remember, opposite
charges attract.

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:14.840
They'd like to get
back together again.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.380
So if you give them
a wire out the top

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.700
of the thing
through a light bulb

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.200
and down to the
bottom of the thing,

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.421
they can get back together again
by going around the other way.

00:25:24.421 --> 00:25:24.920
OK.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:29.520
And that's how the thing makes
electricity, roughly speaking.

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.860
Here's a close up
of the same thing.

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.950
The photon comes in,
makes this exciton--

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:36.080
about which I'll say
more in a minute--

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.740
somehow it separates into
charges which could gather it

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:43.345
up by electrodes, by conductors
on the top and bottom, special

00:25:43.345 --> 00:25:45.720
conductors that you can see
through because the light has

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.160
to get in.

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.430
And then you've gather
it up and use it

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:52.410
to do useful electrical work.

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:57.010
So I want to say more
about the electrons,

00:25:57.010 --> 00:26:00.200
the positive charges,
and the excitons.

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:04.010
So now we're getting into
the most technical part

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:07.840
of the discussion--
no equations though.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.974
Well actually there's
one-- keep your eye

00:26:09.974 --> 00:26:12.140
peeled for the equation
that comes late in the talk.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:14.830
There's one that slipped in.

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:17.490
So I want to give you a
little cartoon about what

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:19.570
it looks like inside silicon.

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.660
This is not a very accurate
cartoon but it's good enough.

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:25.210
So silicon is made of atoms.

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:28.069
Atoms have a nucleus, which
is positively charged.

00:26:28.069 --> 00:26:28.860
It's a heavy thing.

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.730
It's where all the mass of the
silicon comes from basically.

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:32.620
It's heavy.

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:35.800
It's very point like.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.490
And they're arranged
in a regular array,

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:40.210
sort of like a
stack of cannonballs

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:43.420
but not touching exactly.

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:48.280
So suppose we then assemble
a crystal of silicon

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.150
by first putting down
the nuclei, which

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:51.820
are all positively
charged, like I said.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.910
Then I'm going to
start adding electrons.

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:55.260
Electrons are just the opposite.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.385
They're negatively charged.

00:26:56.385 --> 00:26:57.100
They're light.

00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:00.570
And they're fluttery.

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.720
They don't stay in
one place very well.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.406
They sort of make a cloud.

00:27:04.406 --> 00:27:06.280
This is quantum mechanics
and I'm just trying

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.740
to give you a feel for it.

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.700
Anyway, the very
first electrons I

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:15.790
add see these positive charges
and hover tightly around them.

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:18.330
Those are very tightly bound
because they're close and very

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:19.300
strongly attracted.

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.030
And then I add some more.

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:23.530
I haven't yet added enough
to cancel all the charges.

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:25.200
Those ones are less well bound.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.410
You add some more,
less well bound.

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:31.570
The very last ones you add
are having a little trouble

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:33.460
finding a good
place to be and they

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:35.570
sit joining the
different atoms together.

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:38.750
And that makes bonds that
holds the silicon together.

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:41.170
And those are the most
weakly bound electrons

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:42.932
in the whole thing.

00:27:42.932 --> 00:27:44.640
And now it's neutral
because I added back

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.973
just the right amount of charge.

00:27:45.973 --> 00:27:47.810
And all the equal
and opposite charges

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:49.970
are more or less happy
in a chunk of material.

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:51.600
OK.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.720
And now, I add an
extra electron.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.810
Where did it come from?

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:58.600
I don't know, I just
put it in there.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.200
And it needs to
find a place to go.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.270
And so there's not
any very good places.

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:04.360
But there's the best
available place.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.730
And so it looks maybe like that.

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:08.750
There's other
equally good places.

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:11.020
And so with certain kinds
of materials, and silicon

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.250
is an example,
that extra electron

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:17.750
can pretty easily go from
one place to another.

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:19.490
And when it does,
that current flowing.

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:22.864
That's a negative
charge moving around.

00:28:22.864 --> 00:28:25.280
So you might wonder well how
does the positive charge move

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.330
around, and do these little red
nuclei have to move to do that?

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:30.830
And the answer is
no, they don't.

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:33.894
I can make a positive charge
by getting rid of an electron.

00:28:33.894 --> 00:28:34.560
Where did it go?

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.210
Don't ask me, you'll
find out in a minute.

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:41.060
But if it were missing,
that would be a hole.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.081
And with that thing in
there it was neutral.

00:28:44.081 --> 00:28:46.330
So when I take it out, there
must be a positive charge

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:46.996
there someplace.

00:28:46.996 --> 00:28:49.990
It's a little excess
right around in there.

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:51.850
But now I can move
that thing by moving

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:55.379
that electron into that
space and so on and so on.

00:28:55.379 --> 00:28:57.920
And you see that the hole can
move but none of the red things

00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:59.100
move.

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:00.830
The positive charge
can move too.

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:03.740
That's an electron
and a hole moving.

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:09.130
An exciton is a pair of
those near each other.

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:10.470
How did it get that way?

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:14.170
A photon came in and excited--
that's the fancy word--

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:14.740
the electron.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:18.490
It used to be there to
make it be in that state.

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:20.610
And it could go back.

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:23.710
And when it goes back, it
would give up the energy

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:25.201
that the light put in.

00:29:25.201 --> 00:29:26.700
And that will have
to come out again

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.900
either as light, which would
be called fluorescence,

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:31.270
or it could make the
crystal vibrate, or anyway,

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:33.230
that energy's
gotta go someplace.

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:36.820
So what we need to do for
the solar cell to work

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:39.700
is for this exciton thing
to make it to the junction

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.340
and separate before it dies.

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.010
And so it wanders
around in there.

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:46.650
And then it has a heart attack.

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:48.200
And you'd like the
heart attack not

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.900
to happen until it
gets to the interface.

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:53.550
Because if it
recombines, heart attack,

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:56.190
then that energy is wasted.

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:57.590
OK.

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:58.430
So excitons.

00:30:01.115 --> 00:30:03.910
Heart attack.

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:07.060
So this is crystalline
silicon or a cartoon of it.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:09.230
But we're pursuing a
somewhat different strategy

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:12.550
when we make solar cell
materials out of polymers.

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:16.501
And in a slightly hyperbolic
way, it's inspired by nature.

00:30:16.501 --> 00:30:17.000
OK.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.760
So plants have
chlorophyll in them.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.580
If there are biologists
here, I apologize for the sin

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:26.540
I'm about to commit in
describing what this does.

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:29.840
So chlorophyll absorbs sunlight
and produces, initially,

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:33.670
something very like an exciton,
a separated electron, a hole

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:36.090
pair, which it then
uses to do chemistry.

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:38.750
It doesn't make electricity,
it makes all the molecules

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:41.770
that plants make
out of water and CO2

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:45.710
and trace minerals in
the water and stuff.

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:50.210
And so what we want to do is
design the beads of the polymer

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:54.660
to be such that they too
can absorb sunlight locally,

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.200
that their chemical
locally-- it's

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.680
not light chlorophyll
exactly-- but somehow

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.810
or other that there's
an exciton that's

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:06.770
part of the structure
of this molecule.

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:08.930
And we can have two
different beads, one of which

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:12.530
maybe prefers the electrons
and one prefers the holes,

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:14.450
like we had the two
flavors of silicon that

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:15.350
make the junctions.

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:18.040
And we're going to do all
this with polymers now.

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.310
And so the chemical
structure of this

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:23.840
is how we make it so
that a photon coming in

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:28.090
is tuned to the energy required
to kick the most loosely

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:32.390
bound electron up to the next
most loosely downstate it can

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:36.200
be in, to kick that little bond
thing up to the little round

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:38.770
thing in the previous picture.

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:40.690
And that energy has
to be tuned right

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:44.550
to sunlight, which has a certain
spread of energies in it.

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:46.050
So the nice thing
about polymers is

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:48.008
we've got a lot of
different beads and chemists

00:31:48.008 --> 00:31:50.380
know how to make them, also,
that they're stuck together

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:51.120
in a line.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:54.770
So at least in one dimension,
there's a connection.

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:57.170
Because we need these charges
to move around and get out.

00:31:57.170 --> 00:32:02.670
And so it turns out that the
electron cloud along this chain

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:06.560
is nicely connected so that
charges can move around.

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.400
If you put a hole on that thing,
it can move back and forth.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.710
If you put an electron on
the thing, it can move.

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:15.370
So this is looking promising.

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:18.010
There's a bad problem though.

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:21.320
One thing that silicon is really
good at that hydrocarbons--

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:24.680
sorry, that the molecules we're
using to make this stuff out of

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:29.870
was not so good at is
making the exciton happy.

00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:31.220
And that's called screening.

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.370
So now I want to try
to describe screening.

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:37.980
And this will be my, I think,
my last technical slide.

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.720
So suppose you have
an isolated charge,

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.190
and I just plopped it in there.

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:43.890
And this is not a very
good place for it.

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:46.600
And a way of making this
a slightly better place

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:48.310
is if some of these
electrons around it,

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:51.540
which it repels, remember,
because like-charges repel,

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:54.080
would just get out of
the way a little bit.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.050
Did you see that?

00:32:56.050 --> 00:33:00.277
Let me back up and do it again.

00:33:00.277 --> 00:33:01.360
They moved out of the way.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.420
When they moved out
of the way, that

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:06.510
makes this region here a little
more positive in some sense.

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:10.100
So roughly speaking,
there's like a little pink

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:13.210
positive-ish place that
this extra charge now

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:15.640
like a little better.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:20.260
So there's a rather
strained metaphor here

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:22.480
having to do with
people on their own

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:26.410
in a bar, which are like
isolated unscreened charges

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:28.660
somewhat susceptible
to attraction

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:31.180
from opposite signed charges.

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:35.050
But if they're there with their
friends, they're screened.

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:36.990
They're happier in
their local environment

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:38.780
and less susceptible
to attraction

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:41.050
from distant charges.

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:41.690
OK.

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:43.880
So the thing is silicon
is really good at this.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.770
And the polymers, for
rather fundamental reasons,

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:49.310
are not quite as good at it.

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:52.720
And it means that the
excitons tend to die faster.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.360
And this is bad.

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.970
So this is a problem
that has to be

00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:59.040
solved in order for these
materials to be practical.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:01.260
And so a way of
solving it, if you

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:05.798
could do it-- so the thin
film of those bluish silicon

00:34:05.798 --> 00:34:07.839
solar cells is about as
thick as your fingernail.

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:14.239
And the excitons can wander
around in silicon that far

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:15.760
and find that junction.

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:20.310
But it turns out that you
need to make many, many more

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:23.130
junctions between the stuff that
likes the positive and negative

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:26.820
charges in the polymers to
get the exciton any chance

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:28.889
of finding the interface
before it dies.

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:31.750
And so you need a really,
really fine grading,

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:36.699
10,000 times finer than your
fingernail, to make this work.

00:34:36.699 --> 00:34:39.000
Otherwise, the excitons
will have their heart attack

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.929
before they ever get to
the junction to separate.

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:45.400
So how do you make really,
really fine stripes

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:48.250
or structures in some
material, way, way finer

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:49.550
than your fingernail?

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:52.260
And the answer is you
teach the molecules

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:55.639
to make it themselves.

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:59.270
So what on earth?

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:01.270
So polymers are
really hard to mix,

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:03.710
different species of polymers.

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:07.090
Because, well you know,
oil and water demix.

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:10.830
But oil and water are very
different in their chemistry.

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:13.592
So you might think, well,
it's easy to mix things,

00:35:13.592 --> 00:35:15.300
you just make them
similar to each other.

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:17.400
And indeed, if you want
to try to mix polymers

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.290
that's what you do.

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:20.730
But they're long.

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:23.490
And so if there's any little
difference between the two

00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:25.960
that makes a polymer
prefer it's own species,

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:29.270
it gets multiplied over the
whole length of the chain

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:32.860
to the point that the driving
force for a whole molecule

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.990
to separate is large.

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:38.010
And so it's really
hard to mix polymers.

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:42.190
But if you stick to
dissimilar polymers

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:44.560
together with an
unbreakable joint, you bond

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:48.040
them with the same kind of bond
that holds the beads together,

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.880
then they can't do that.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:52.130
And then what's left of them
is that they can locally

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:54.260
separate into
regions rich in one

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:56.160
and rich in the other species.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.280
And the length scale
of that separation

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.970
is set by the size of this
molecule, by the coils,

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:02.520
and they're small.

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:03.200
OK.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.290
So what you tend
to get are layers,

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:08.360
if the two halves of this thing
are symmetrical, equally long

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.454
and bulky and stuff like that.

00:36:10.454 --> 00:36:11.870
But actually polymer
chemists know

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:14.790
how to make other structures,
all kinds of fancy things,

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:16.430
cylinders of one
kind and the other,

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:18.430
and spheres of one kind
or the other, and so on.

00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:20.940
But the point is that the
length scale of these structures

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:23.560
is right around
what we need to have

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:27.220
enough junctions between the
two species for the exciton

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.320
to have a chance of getting
there before it dies.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.945
And this is just an
electron micrograph

00:36:30.945 --> 00:36:32.920
of a totally unrelated
material, but just

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:37.250
showing that these stripes occur
in a sample that hasn't been

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:40.290
specially prepared in any way,
you just put the polymer down

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:42.110
there and it organizes itself.

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:44.570
This is called self assembly.

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:45.450
OK.

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:50.960
So we didn't have a
big design problem.

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.250
We've got a certain
set of goals about what

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:54.690
we need the material to do.

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:57.250
We need the energy, the
exciton to match sunlight.

00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:59.670
We need the light to be
absorbed through the film.

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:02.190
We need the excitons to
make it to these junctions.

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:03.660
And we need the
charges to get out.

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:07.150
And that implies because
we have the story about how

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:10.110
the material is behaving,
intermediate properties

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:13.840
that we need to be true,
having to do with this self

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:14.800
assembled structure.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.610
I mean, we need the beads to
have the right exciton energy.

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:20.450
And that, you try to get right
by looking at the chemical

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:21.280
structure.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.920
And there's a chemist, for
example, here at Harvard,

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:27.830
who has been very
influential in pre-screening

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:31.050
a whole bunch of different
beads that you might construct

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:34.000
for whether their energies are
going to be right for sunlight

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.110
and also whether they'll
be right for attracting

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:37.670
positive and negative charges.

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:41.230
That's one part of problem
but not the whole problem.

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:43.790
You do this self assembly
trick, as I described.

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:46.280
And then what we've
talked about not very much

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:49.490
is the need to get the
charges out of the sample.

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:51.460
They need to be able to
move relatively freely.

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:54.220
I blithely said, well,
they can move down

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:55.270
the chains pretty well.

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:57.990
You might wonder about
between chains and other sort

00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:59.480
of things like that.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.720
So having this
intermediate picture

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:03.620
of what's going on
in the sample you see

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:07.050
helps to focus the
properties of the material

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:10.250
that you need to make this
work without trying to start

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:11.900
from the molecule's structure.

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:15.400
Because there's an
intermediate level of behavior.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.930
So this is a big
project which people

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:19.990
are in the middle of
trying a whole bunch

00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:22.840
of different chemicals.

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.880
The polymer chemists make them.

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.320
Experimenters make
measurements on them.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.120
Engineers make
films and test them

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.760
by shining lamps that
look like the sun

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:35.840
and making measurements of how
much electricity comes out.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.650
What am I doing?

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:40.130
Well, none of those things.

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:43.550
I have colleagues
that do those things.

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:46.370
So how can theory help in this?

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:51.030
Well, by making estimates
about whether it's ever

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:52.730
going to work.

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:54.620
By taking the pictures
that I've described

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:57.420
and making quantitative
estimates about, for example,

00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:00.650
the properties of the excitons
that you need to be true.

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:06.310
So for instance, I've described
this story where-- so here's

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:07.735
one of these little regions.

00:39:07.735 --> 00:39:09.910
And there's the nearest
junction right there.

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:10.810
And I'm an exciton.

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:13.040
And there's no driving
force for me to go there.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:15.430
So I'm just kind of
wandering around, thermally.

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:16.750
How fast does that happen?

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:18.190
Eventually, I have
a heart attack.

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:19.952
Did I make it to the interface?

00:39:19.952 --> 00:39:21.160
So I need to know two things.

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:23.380
I need to know how
fast does it wander?

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.830
And how long does it live?

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:29.510
And so the hope is
then to be able to make

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:33.880
estimates based on the
particular molecular structures

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.450
of those things to see are
we even in the ballpark?

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:39.900
And which molecules
might work better?

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:42.350
And how much does the
polymer structure,

00:39:42.350 --> 00:39:45.200
that straight spaghetti
versus curvy spaghetti,

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.350
have to do with any of this?

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:51.390
So I transition now
into the third or fourth

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:55.480
or anyway, n minus first
topic of the talk, which is

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.070
what does a theorist do anyway?

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:01.560
So the recipe for the
moving of these charges,

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:06.327
the theory for that is
Schrodinger's Equation,

00:40:06.327 --> 00:40:07.285
this quantum mechanics.

00:40:07.285 --> 00:40:09.930
Quantum mechanics is
the story of how-- well

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:13.260
a story of how all small
lightweight particles move,

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:15.410
but in this
particular case, it's

00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:17.840
the story of how
the electrons move.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:19.220
So here's Schrodinger.

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:24.520
He was an Austrian physicist
working in the 1920s.

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:27.620
Here's a bust of him at
the University of Vienna,

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:28.830
where he was situated.

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:35.410
It's simple to
write, but there's

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:38.300
a lot of stuff packed
into that H there.

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:40.380
Hard to solve.

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:42.050
The Austrians are
very proud of him.

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:44.090
This is of course before
the EU, but here he

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:46.880
is on the 1,000 shilling note.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:50.150
He's even on a stamp.

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:53.340
It's nice to see a physicists
get that kind of recognition.

00:40:56.050 --> 00:41:00.240
So the Schrodinger equation
is easy to write and hard

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.540
to solve.

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:05.030
For us these days,
it's something

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:06.870
you need computers to solve.

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:10.320
And that's not very helpful
to say, what do computers

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.610
do anyway to solve an
equation like that?

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:15.100
Well, the Schrodinger
equation, fundamentally

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:20.820
is an equation for how the
electron cloud evolves in time.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:23.320
So what computers are
really good at doing

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.230
is taking a number
and changing it

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:27.510
based on what other numbers
around it are doing.

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:30.920
And so this time
step is discrete.

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:33.780
And the numbers are discrete.

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:37.746
And so the cloud is
a continuous thing

00:41:37.746 --> 00:41:38.870
that's everywhere in space.

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:41.540
So what we do,
roughly speaking, is

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:44.920
to make an array of points on
which we represent the cloud.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.780
So at every point
here you'd say,

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:49.380
the cloud is this stronger
or that strong or the other.

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:52.320
And then the computer
updates the cloud

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:55.180
by saying, well, if the cloud
is this strong at this point

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:57.750
and the [INAUDIBLE] are
doing this, then the cloud

00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:59.640
changes in the following way.

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.760
So that's how you make
the program-- that's

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:06.510
how you make a computer be able
to do a calculation like this.

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:08.210
And people are
very good at this.

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:10.500
It's a really hard problem.

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:13.730
Because it doesn't scale very
well to come back to something

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:19.070
that Phil talked about in
his talk some months ago.

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:23.200
We can solve small quantum
problems pretty well using

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.280
modern methods,
but not big ones.

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.960
So suppose you're able to
solve some interesting quantum

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:32.790
mechanics problem with a
certain number of atoms

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:34.660
that fit into a box this size.

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:36.570
And then you decide,
that wasn't big enough.

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:38.420
I need a bigger
piece, a bigger sample

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:39.464
to answer some questions.

00:42:39.464 --> 00:42:40.630
So you make it twice as big.

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:42.670
Well, right away, that's
eight times as many atoms,

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:44.130
just because it's
three dimensions.

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:47.350
So there's eight cubes in there
when there was one of those.

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:49.640
And you might think,
oh, eight times

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:52.380
is long to run on the
computer, or eight times

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:53.820
as many computers, no problem.

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:55.740
Except it isn't that.

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:59.900
It's 8 times 8 times
8 times as many.

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:04.570
And that's 512 times as
much time or computers.

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:07.160
And that runs away really fast.

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:12.400
So the trouble is that polymer
materials are often disordered,

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.240
as we said.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:17.520
And although you might like
for your chains to be all

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:21.330
lined up in nice crystals, that
actually, they're kind of wormy

00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:24.280
looking in at least some
places and this is not really

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:27.050
under our control.

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:30.110
And worse than that
is that, remember

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:33.150
how the electron cloud was nice
and spread out over the chain,

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:35.674
but I do it straight.

00:43:35.674 --> 00:43:37.840
There's a little twists and
turns and stuff in here.

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:44.120
And if you twist this thing,
it breaks the connection.

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:47.810
For chemists, it screws
up the conjugation.

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:50.190
So how bad a problem is this?

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:51.760
How twisty are those things?

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:54.740
And how quickly does this break
when you twist it a little bit?

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.370
This is the question
you need to ask.

00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:58.180
And you need to ask
it a bunch of times

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:01.070
because you want to average over
what's going on in this region

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:04.340
to say how bad is it.

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:08.680
so the problem is that a
charge moving around in here

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:11.460
is going to see not a regular
chain where any place looks

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:13.490
the same as any other
place, but a chain

00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:16.220
where the landscape is
constantly changing.

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:20.072
So the analogy
for that is if you

00:44:20.072 --> 00:44:22.280
were going to take a wander
in this landscape, that'd

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.280
be pretty pleasant.

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:26.110
It's not very hilly.

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:28.920
You can go any which
way you want to go.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:32.110
A little more challenging
in that landscape.

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:35.210
Quite challenging to go
wandering around in this one.

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:40.150
And a death sentence to go
wandering around in that one.

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:43.170
So the degree of
disorder of the landscape

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:46.980
impedes the motion of you
and also of the charges

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:50.370
that we need to get
out of the sample.

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:55.730
So we want to do an averaging
over the different shapes

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:57.260
that the molecule might make.

00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:59.020
And so we just
need a whole bunch

00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:00.414
of snapshots of those shapes.

00:45:00.414 --> 00:45:02.580
And then we need to do the
quantum mechanics problem

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:05.650
over and over again somehow.

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:07.220
The shapes are
rather easy to get

00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:10.500
because Newton's equations
are pretty good for molecules

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.170
and they're a lot
cheaper to solve.

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:15.710
And so we can just make movies.

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:17.460
And the snapshots
from the movies

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:20.820
give us different ways that
the chains could be lined up.

00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:23.940
And then we have to do quantum
mechanics problem over and over

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:26.810
again on, unfortunately,
a rather big piece.

00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:34.460
That brings me to my very last
topic, which will be short.

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:35.200
Coarse graining.

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:39.660
So this is an example of a
recurrent trick in physics.

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:44.450
What do you do when
a problem's to hard?

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:47.460
Well, if you can't solve the
problem, make it simpler.

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:50.090
This is Polya's dictum,
George Polya, a mathematician,

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:55.030
who wrote this audaciously
titled book, How To Solve It.

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:57.910
Doesn't specify.

00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:58.800
It's a great book.

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:04.760
It's about the way to think
about solving math problems.

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:07.894
He didn't actually say
that, unfortunately.

00:46:07.894 --> 00:46:10.060
What it really says is if
you can't solve a problem,

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:14.170
then there exists an easier
problem you can solve, find it.

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:20.530
But Yogi Berra said, I really
didn't say everything I said.

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:23.300
So anyway, how you make
this problem simpler,

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:25.080
you lower your standards.

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:30.610
So instead of
trying to keep track

00:46:30.610 --> 00:46:32.940
of what the cloud
is doing everywhere

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:35.880
in space, around some
really fine grid,

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:38.120
let's just keep track of
whether the electron is

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:40.330
on this ring or that
ring or the other ring.

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:42.977
And then I greatly reduce
the number of numbers

00:46:42.977 --> 00:46:44.810
that the computer's
having to keep track of.

00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:47.050
And that makes the
problem a lot easier.

00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:50.070
And interestingly, the form
of its kind of the same.

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:53.110
Because here, what happens
is a little bit of the cloud

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:56.630
hops from one point to another
depending on nearby points.

00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:59.960
And here, a little bit of the
electron hops from one place

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.770
to another on the chain.

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:06.400
And so I just lower my standards
about what I need to know.

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:10.310
So down here, the hopping
probability, if you want,

00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:12.860
is a fundamental
property of electrons.

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:15.180
Up there, it's got something
to do with the chain

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:17.030
and you need to
know what this is.

00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:19.060
And the way you find
out those numbers that

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:21.380
describe this
coarse-grained theory is you

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:24.150
need to solve the same
problem two different ways.

00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:27.330
The fancy way and
the simple way.

00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:31.200
And so that's done by looking
at a small enough piece

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:35.290
that you can actually do the
real highfalutin Schrodinger

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:36.950
equation on it.

00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:40.099
And at the same time,
apply the simpler model

00:47:40.099 --> 00:47:41.390
to figure out what it would do.

00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:43.707
So here you see is a little
twisted piece of chain,

00:47:43.707 --> 00:47:45.540
just a very tiny piece
of a twist, remember,

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:48.810
it's twist we're worried
about breaking the chain.

00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:51.940
And it's got these
ends which are awful.

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.350
We want it to be
part of the chain.

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:58.470
So we introduce these magical
windows on either side here,

00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:00.220
a magic window where
if you go through,

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:02.480
you magically come
out over there.

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:04.710
So you're walking along
the chain, do, do, do, do,

00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:06.070
and then you come over here.

00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:09.880
And so it looks like
you're on a long chain.

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.760
Anybody recognize those?

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:12.260
No.

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:12.830
No.

00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:17.494
No fans of-- nobody
has heard of Portal?

00:48:17.494 --> 00:48:19.450
Ah, good.

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:22.890
So there's this
marvelous video game

00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:27.420
called Portal, which I
encourage you to waste

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:30.260
some days and weeks playing.

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:33.440
It's a first person
nonlethal shooter--

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:35.220
you're supplied this
magical gun which

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:38.590
shoots these two little rings
and makes these portals.

00:48:38.590 --> 00:48:40.300
And if you step
through that blue one,

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:42.910
you come out the orange one.

00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:46.330
So a man can do this.

00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:49.210
It's just periodic
boundary conditions.

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:52.380
So we solved the problem
in the two different ways.

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:53.990
We progressively
twist the chain.

00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:57.340
We see how this connection
is progressively breaking.

00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:00.110
We compare-- never mind about
the spaghetti of curves--

00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:02.050
the fact that these
lines lay on those lines

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:04.420
means things are working.

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:09.040
What comes out of it is how bad
that connection breaking is is

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.610
a function of how much I twist.

00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:13.570
And then you see if you use
that together with knowing

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:16.880
how twisty the chains
were, you are in a position

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:21.080
to diagnose how bad the
failure of these connections

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:25.800
is in the actual material, which
brings me to the present day.

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.610
That is, we've
developed these tools.

00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:29.770
We want to apply
them in various ways.

00:49:29.770 --> 00:49:32.830
And this is a flavor of
how these tools work.

00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:36.870
And so I'm exactly
three minutes over.

00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:40.120
So let me conclude
by just reminding you

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.690
of the main points
I wanted to make.

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:45.430
I mean, first of all,
solar electric power is not

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:48.590
the only thing to
replace hydrocarbons,

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:52.540
but certainly a key element of
a realistic approach to climate

00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:53.260
change.

00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:55.910
And it's a huge job,
but one that the world

00:49:55.910 --> 00:50:01.450
is very significantly engaged
in to install solar electric

00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:02.760
on a meaningful scale.

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:08.200
Polymer based materials,
those upstarts down there,

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:13.090
may offer an attractive
alternative, the silicon.

00:50:13.090 --> 00:50:15.870
And the attraction comes
from the advantages

00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:17.750
of polymer chemistry
in providing

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:19.670
a very versatile
slate of materials,

00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:22.050
and the ease of processing
them once you have them,

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:25.210
and tricks like
self-assembling and so forth.

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:28.520
And materials theory,
such as I practice,

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:31.800
can be a useful guide to
navigate the huge design

00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:33.900
space of all those
different molecules

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:35.610
and how you might built them.

00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:39.670
And with that, I'll stop
and take any questions.
