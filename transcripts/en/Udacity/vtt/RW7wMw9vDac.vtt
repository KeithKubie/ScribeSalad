00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.640
We've talked about loading data from flat files by way of CSV, but a lot of the

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.320
time, the data that data scientists work with

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.340
are stored in relational databases. A relational database is

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.180
similar to a collection of spreadsheets. In each

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.180
spreadsheet, there are columns and rows. A column specifies

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.660
a value and its type such as player ID

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.330
or team ID or record. Each row contains values

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.465
for each column such as 1 or 1 or

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:33.240
245-150. Or 1 and Yankees, things like that. In

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.450
the database world, we call each set of rows

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.960
and columns a table rather than a spreadsheet. And the

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.160
tables are usually related to each other in some

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.880
way. It's very important to be somewhat familiar with relational

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.170
databases. Since they're used in so many places and

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.550
also since we'll be storing some of the data required

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.140
for our class project in a small database. Let's take some time and talk

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.870
briefly about how one can store and

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.980
retrieve data from relational databases. In this

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.920
course, we won't discuss the design of

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.129
databases. Topics like normalization, indices, keys, things

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.270
like that. Some of these topics will be covered in Data Wrangling with Mongo DB.
