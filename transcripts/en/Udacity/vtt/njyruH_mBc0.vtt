00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.440
Now that we have a blank canvas, we can begin inserting SVG elements and

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.600
start drawing.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.320
In order for any SVG elements to render on a page,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.460
we first need to insert them into an SVG tag.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.270
Again, let's select the sidebar where the discussion used to be

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.770
with the selection.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.690
We can append whatever element we want, in this case an SVG element.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:29.340
And then with the returned SVG element stored here in an SVG variable,

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.430
we can then begin inserting shapes, points, lines, whatever we want.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.080
As you can see, looking at the DOM tree, we have inserted an SVG element.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.660
Hovering over it, Chrome tells us that it's 300 pixels by 150 pixels, but

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.900
nothing's actually displayed in the window.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.320
Part of that's because SVG elements by default don't have

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.320
any visual representation.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.520
We could change the color of its background.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.770
We could change other properties and attributes defined on it

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.590
if we would like to see the bounding box around the SVG.
