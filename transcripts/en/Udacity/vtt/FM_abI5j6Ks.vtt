00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.820
Congratulations, you've made your
first step towards a path in Android

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.160
programming.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.730
In this course, you will set up
Android Studio on your computer and

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.840
create the design layout for
an Android application using XML.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.040
As you dive into Android
app development,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.930
there may be times where
you reach your strain zone.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.480
I encourage you to reach out for
support on the forums.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.840
By the end of this course, you should
have a better idea of whether Android

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.510
app development is the right path for
you.
