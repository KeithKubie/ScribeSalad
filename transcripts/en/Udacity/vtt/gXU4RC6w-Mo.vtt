00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.170
&gt;&gt; David, that's a good point. One way of capturing the meaning of that story in

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.718
terms of these primitive actions is in, to use the move object primitive action.

00:02:45.718 --> 00:02:50.730
So, here about the object being moved and the mover of the object is the same,

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.580
I. So, I am moving myself one place to another place. And

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.290
the nearest point here is that these primitive actions will be able to capture

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.100
the meaning of some sentences in a very simple, logical, intuitive sense. And

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.714
for some other sentences, it might be a little bit more involved. So let us see

00:03:08.714 --> 00:03:13.050
how this primitive actions may actually help an AI agent make sense of stories.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.720
So here is the first thing we can do. Recall there were large number of stories,

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.470
each expressed by one sentence. Ashok ate a frog, Ashok devoured a frog and

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.320
so on. So now, ate, devoured, consumed, ingest, partook. We can think that

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.900
each one of them really is an instance of a primitive action called ingest.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.543
Here's the primitive action Ingest. So Ashok ingested a frog here,

00:03:34.543 --> 00:03:37.760
Ashok ingested a frog here, Ashok ingested a frog here.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.315
Well, superficially these particular sentences are different.

00:03:41.315 --> 00:03:45.570
In terms of their deep meaning, the deep meaning is pretty much the same. But

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.770
it's true of course that the world may have a slightly different interpretation

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.520
than dining. The [INAUDIBLE] might be something that I ravish with my hands for

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.040
example, and dining might involve fine dining with silverware. nevertheless,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.020
ingest captures the basic meaning of these sentences. What is the basic meaning?

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.947
The basic meaning again is that Ashok is an agent.

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:11.350
Frog is the object that is getting eaten, ingested. Initially the frog was

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.620
outside Ashok's body, and probably dead or alive. We don't know its state.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.149
After the ingestion has occurred, a devoured has occurred,

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:22.849
a consumed has occurred, the frog is inside Ashok's body, and it's dead. And

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:26.460
further, that Ashok probably is happy at the end of this particular ingestion.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.380
And where is all of that knowledge coming from? It's buried inside the frame for

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.800
ingest. So each of these primitive actions has a frame corresponding to it.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.750
And we have come across frame many times already in the class, so

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.482
by now you should know what it means. And the frame has a large number of slots

00:04:41.482 --> 00:04:45.617
like agent, co-agent, object, beneficiary and so on, and those slots deal with

00:04:45.617 --> 00:04:49.980
still a difficult situations and have default values already put in there. So

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.140
when a sentence comes like, Ashok ate a frog, then the verb ate here, pulls out

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.770
the primitive action ingest, and the frame for this primitive action and

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.790
the processing becomes top down, and they start thinking, where will Ashok go?

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.050
Where will frog go? Who is the agent? Who is the object? And so on.
