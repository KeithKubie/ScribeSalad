00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.556
 What is surprising about the United States of America is that he is actually a United Nations of a bunch of countries. 

00:00:03.797 --> 00:00:05.197
 At the beginning, there were only 13 countries. 

00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:07.221
 But as time progressed, the map gradually went west 

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:11.245
 To the 48 countries we joined together today, plus Alaska and Hawaii 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.069
 Hawaii and Alaska are not like other countries that are grouped together because 

00:00:15.093 --> 00:00:18.593
 It is located in the middle of the entire great waterway, while Alaska is only mad. 

00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:22.167
 Unlike other federal countries, you can say that you want to break up and break up. 

00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:23.991
 And can also permanently retain the national status of the country喔

00:00:24.215 --> 00:00:25.515
 Just telling you! Texas! 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.939
 And the way the federal government works is another story. 

00:00:27.963 --> 00:00:32.063
 But now, all you need to know is that the national law is 

00:00:32.087 --> 00:00:34.787
 A congress formed by representatives of small countries. 

00:00:34.811 --> 00:00:38.311
 Going back to the map, there are still some non-state borders that are inconspicuous on the map. 

00:00:38.335 --> 00:00:41.535
 The first to bear the brunt is Washington, DC, the capital of the first good 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.854
 And he was forgotten between Maryland and Virginia. 

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:49.773
 The SAR is a non-state city controlled by Congress. 

00:00:49.797 --> 00:00:54.797
 That is to say, all states have to look at the face of Washington, DC. 

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:56.821
 And it has no voting rights itself. 

00:00:56.845 --> 00:00:59.840
 Even in the SAR, there is actually no one living in it. 

00:00:59.864 --> 00:01:03.364
 But when more and more people live in the SAR than in other states, 

00:01:03.388 --> 00:01:05.388
 The situation may not be very good. 

00:01:05.412 --> 00:01:08.412
 There are other American Indian reservations on the map. 

00:01:08.436 --> 00:01:10.436
 In fact, quite a lot 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.060
 The heads of the states regard them as foreign territories to some extent. 

00:01:14.084 --> 00:01:17.784
 In other words, they will look like this. 

00:01:17.808 --> 00:01:21.408
 After all, the reserved area is separated from other states. 

00:01:21.432 --> 00:01:24.932
 The American Indian Reservation is a variety of markers. 

00:01:24.956 --> 00:01:26.556
 awkward... 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.880
 It’s another story here. 

00:01:28.904 --> 00:01:32.604
 Let’s not talk about the border topic. These squares are just the best. 

00:01:32.628 --> 00:01:36.128
 But the United States is actually not only these 

00:01:36.152 --> 00:01:38.952
 Saying that after the land was divided 

00:01:38.976 --> 00:01:42.276
 I learned how to be a big island owner from my mom. 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.300
 First debut: Puerto Rico - concept of top floor stamping (US non-established territories) 

00:01:45.324 --> 00:01:48.024
 In the name of the state, it is actually doing it on its own (to some extent) 

00:01:48.048 --> 00:01:52.048
 And the US Constitution is not completely covered. 

00:01:52.072 --> 00:01:55.872
 Looking at the island, there are 3.7 million people living in Puerto Rico today. 

00:01:55.896 --> 00:02:00.106
 That is to say, 91% of people live on the islands of the United States. 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.230
 Others live in the territory of the other 21 states. 

00:02:04.254 --> 00:02:08.854
 And Puerto Rico is considered a country by the United States, in addition to its name. 

00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:10.978
 It should be almost in the near future. 

00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:14.567
 Bring maybe the 51st star to the United States? 

00:02:14.591 --> 00:02:18.091
 But Puerto Rico is not the only top-floor capped territory (a non-established territories in the United States). 

00:02:18.115 --> 00:02:21.015
 This is Guam, earned after winning the West-American War. 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:24.039
 In addition to Puerto Rico, Northern Mariana Islands 

00:02:24.063 --> 00:02:26.063
 Earned from the Japanese during the Second World War 

00:02:26.087 --> 00:02:28.687
 Then the Virginia Islands were sold from the Danish mom. 

00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:31.711
 People living in these places are considered US citizens. 

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:34.835
 For the most part, these territories are like Washington, DC. 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.859
 Congress can overthrow these local governments and they don’t 

00:02:37.883 --> 00:02:40.583
 The reason for the representation is because they are not a "true. country" 

00:02:40.607 --> 00:02:42.607
 Otherwise, American 

00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:45.831
 In fact, these territories, like Washington, DC, are all elected to Congress. 

00:02:45.855 --> 00:02:47.655
 Go to all meetings 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:49.679
 But that is, I can’t be one of them. 

00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:53.303
 It can be said that the most embarrassing work is also the coolest. 

00:02:53.327 --> 00:02:55.327
 It’s just what kind of people are going to interpret it. 

00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:59.051
 In addition, since the election of the president is based on the state population 

00:02:59.075 --> 00:03:01.075
 Citizens in these territories are unable to vote 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.599
 Leading to a strange situation in the previous film 

00:03:04.623 --> 00:03:08.123
 Americans living in foreign countries can follow their previous 

00:03:08.147 --> 00:03:10.147
 The state in which the state resides has the power to elect the president 

00:03:10.171 --> 00:03:12.971
 The Americans living in the United States are only living on the top floor and stamped (the US non-established territories). 

00:03:12.995 --> 00:03:13.895
 Can't vote 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.419
 Except for non-consolidated territories 

00:03:16.443 --> 00:03:19.553
 There are also so-called: non-consolidated non-formed territories 

00:03:19.577 --> 00:03:21.377
 Honestly, there is not much 

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:23.201
 Like Howland Island, Nafsha Island 

00:03:23.225 --> 00:03:24.625
 Wake Island, Jarvis Island 

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:26.649
 Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Reef 

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:28.473
 Serra Nile shoal, Bajo Nuevo shoal 

00:03:28.497 --> 00:03:31.897
 Most of these islands are obtained through the "Bird Island Bill" 

00:03:31.921 --> 00:03:35.621
 When the United States wants a pile of small islands filled with guanines 

00:03:35.645 --> 00:03:39.445
 Truly do not lie, the United States is directly written, the law of the plaintiff declares 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:40.769
 All hers (my, I said) 

00:03:40.793 --> 00:03:44.388
 There is no establishment on this system, which means there is no local government on these islands. 

00:03:44.412 --> 00:03:46.812
 Because no one lives in these bird places. 

00:03:46.836 --> 00:03:49.536
 Some places are even just above the Haiping line. 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.860
 Again, there is another kind of strange (United States non-merged territory) 

00:03:52.884 --> 00:03:55.484
 One of them: Pamela Atoll 

00:03:55.508 --> 00:04:00.108
 After the United States and the crabs swallowed Hawaii 

00:04:00.132 --> 00:04:03.232
 And they have recently been used as natural reserves. 

00:04:03.256 --> 00:04:06.456
 However, non-merger means that the US Constitution applies to this. 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.930
 Who is it for? The problem with the Pamela Atoll is like if a tree falls in the forest. 

00:04:10.954 --> 00:04:14.354
 If there is no person in the constitution that can make the constitution applicable 

00:04:14.378 --> 00:04:16.178
 So is the constitution still applicable? 

00:04:16.202 --> 00:04:16.626
 Yes 

00:04:16.626 --> 00:04:20.026
 This means that if there is a foreigner born in a place where the bird does not lay eggs 

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.950
 And not dying from the ruthless nature 

00:04:21.974 --> 00:04:23.974
 Their children can become American citizens 

00:04:23.998 --> 00:04:25.998
 Currently, this category has not been established yet. 

00:04:26.022 --> 00:04:28.322
 And this will be a classification before becoming a state. 

00:04:28.346 --> 00:04:30.346
 When the constitution is fully applicable 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.870
 And finally occupied by Hawaii 

00:04:32.894 --> 00:04:36.094
 After we circled a large circle, we also missed a piece of land. 

00:04:36.118 --> 00:04:40.218
 American Samoa: 55,000 people 

00:04:40.242 --> 00:04:42.842
 Uniquely, American Samoans are not citizens 

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:44.866
 Instead, become a national of the United States 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.090
 They can live in the state but can't participate in the presidential election 

00:04:48.114 --> 00:04:51.614
 Unless they are like any foreigner through immigration procedures 

00:04:51.638 --> 00:04:55.738
 Even through any channel, they are different from citizens. 

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:59.262
 What is more amazing about American Samoans is that there seems to be nothing more than Congress. 

00:04:59.286 --> 00:05:03.386
 More dragging reasons to update the law 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.310
 American Samoa belongs to the category of anarchy, just like the case of the king of flies 

00:05:07.334 --> 00:05:09.334
 But it’s obviously not the same thing. 

00:05:09.358 --> 00:05:13.358
 So American Samoa with a formed government should move here. 

00:05:13.382 --> 00:05:16.482
 Then Puerto Rico, basically a state, needs to be here. 

00:05:16.506 --> 00:05:19.306
 Then the empty Pamela Atoll needs to be moved here. 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.930
 But don’t do these things for Congress. 

00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:23.654
 Have too much expectation 

00:05:23.678 --> 00:05:26.678
 Ok, just all of it is the territory of the United States. There is still the last here. 

00:05:26.702 --> 00:05:30.602
 One thing to come up with to talk about: Three small countries -- oh, Marshall Islands and 

00:05:30.626 --> 00:05:32.626
 Federated States of Micronesia 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.250
 The Federated States of Micronesia has a convenient domain name: .fm -- the first choice for podcasters everywhere 

00:05:37.274 --> 00:05:38.374
 Here, here: Click 喔

00:05:38.398 --> 00:05:40.398
 These small countries with United Nations seats 

00:05:40.422 --> 00:05:43.422
 They also have a relationship with the United States. 

00:05:43.446 --> 00:05:45.046
 Free contact contract 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.470
 This agreement is provided by the United States for financial assistance and military defense. 

00:05:49.494 --> 00:05:53.494
 To the agreement country, exchange the right to build a military base in the country 

00:05:53.518 --> 00:05:57.518
 In addition, citizens of the country of agreement can also live and work in the United States, and vice versa. 

00:05:57.542 --> 00:06:00.842
 Americans want to live abroad: you have three simple options. 

00:06:00.866 --> 00:06:04.466
 So, the above is the United States: 50 states, many reserved areas, a special zone, 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.890
 a large number of island territories, and three related small countries
