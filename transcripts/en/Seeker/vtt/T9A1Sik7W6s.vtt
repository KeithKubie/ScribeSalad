Facebook users no longer have to be either
male or female. And, no, I'm not talking about

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:12.070
Facebook for pets because Mark Zuckerberg's
adorable dog Beast already has his own profile, anyway.

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:19.580
Hi, I'm Cristen Conger of Stuff Mom Never
Told You in today for DNews.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.349
Facebook has added more than 50 new gender
designations because guess what? There's a

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:30.320
good chance that not all of its 159 MILLION
American users, who are the first to see these

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.340
gender updates, identify as either male or
female.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:41.120
For instance, according to UCLA's Williams'
Institute, around 0.3% of the U.S. adult population,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.930
or roughly 700,000 people, are transgender.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.580
So in addition to a variety of new trans*
options, including trans* man, trans* woman

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.160
and trans* person, Facebook now also offers
intersex, gender fluid, pangender and more.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.350
Now, for those now wondering just how many
genders exist, it's useful to understand the

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.920
differences between gender and biological
sex.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.920
Whereas, male/female sex is biologically determined
via chromosomes, hormones and DNA, masculine/feminine

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.140
gender is socially constructed, hence the
possibility for the more than 50 categories

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.850
Facebook has identified -- which could theoretically
be expanded even further.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.940
The site has also updated its pronoun settings,
allowing people to refer to themselves with

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.770
neutral pronouns, rather than just him or
her.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.450
But as always, users can still opt to keep
their gender designation private.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.659
These changes were implemented after the social
media site consulted with a number of LGBTQ

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.700
organizations and comes at a time when transgender
recognition is becoming a prominent human

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.620
rights issue.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.010
Google+, for instance, also allows its users
to select male, female or other, and a growing

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.690
number of countries including Australia, New
Zealand and Germany offer more than just male

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.010
or female designations on birth certificates
and citizenship documents.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.130
Although this might seem like an unnecessary
update, speaking to the Associated Press,

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.080
transgender Facebook software engineer Brielle
Harrison says "There's going to be a lot of

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.219
people for whom this is going to mean nothing,
but for the few it does impact, it means the

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:20.219
world."
