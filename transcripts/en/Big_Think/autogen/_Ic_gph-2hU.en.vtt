00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:07.519
Machine translation has a relatively short
history.&nbsp; It’s only been going for 50 years

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:14.580
or so and it has entered really quite a new
phase in the last 10, 15 years....I think

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:23.730
it’s an absolute miracle that linguists
and computer engineers and other very clever

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.759
people can now make and have for some time
been able to make machines simulate human

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:35.320
speech with these automatic answering things
on the telephone.&nbsp; I think it’s a miracle

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:42.260
that they have been able to make machines
decode human speech and produce written transcript

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.780
of it automatically.&nbsp; These incidentally
are two key features that are used and will

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.969
always be used in machines that simulate speech
translation.&nbsp; There are some devices on the

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:02.519
market already that do that and of course
the way they do it is by effectively transcribing

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:09.220
the speech in the source language into text
and putting that text through a translation

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.720
device, taking the text in the target language
and then sounding it out just like your telephone

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.800
answering device does.
So it’s not actually speech to speech.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.640
really tertiary speech.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s speech as
the product of a program that takes text as

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.790
input and that text is translated from something
that has transformed speech into text in the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.450
first place.&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, so it’s a structure
like that.&nbsp;

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.600
But the real thing is this.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is science
and then there is engineering.&nbsp;&nbsp;Translation

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.750
machines both written and spoken, but the
spoken is a purely derivative thing from the

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:58.890
written, are extremely clever and give us
a lot reasons for thought about what language

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.120
is and how we may understand language better,
but the way they work bears little resemblance,

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.820
in fact, no resemblance at all to the way
human beings both speak, use language and

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.000
translate between languages and that’s fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s
what engineering if for.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean the way

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.790
airplanes fly resembles not at all the way
birds fly.&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn’t have to.&nbsp;&nbsp;What

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:30.090
you want is the flight, but for that reason
my personal view is that machine translation

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.780
always requires the existence of human translators
to feed of and that is how it works.&nbsp;&nbsp;It

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.450
uses existing translations done by humans
and computes the most probable match from

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.450
the vast amount of paired texts that exist
on the web.&nbsp;

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:56.460
Secondly, machine translation both of speech
and of text will expand people’s general

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:03.460
expectation of the availability of communication
between languages and far from putting translators

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:11.710
out of a job it will support the extension
of translation as a major professional and

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:18.130
a central part of global civilization.&nbsp;&nbsp;So
the other question is what are the technical

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.410
blocks in the way of improving the quality
of machine translation?&nbsp;&nbsp;That I think you

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.960
really have to ask a computer scientist because
they are very technical and I'm not part of

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.550
the team trying to solve such things, but
the overall picture is this.&nbsp;&nbsp;The more machine

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.650
translation there is the more translation
will happen, the more people will expect to

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.569
be able to communicate with other folk and
the more they will realize that although machines

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:46.380
can clear the ground the actual translation
has to be done by somebody because language

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.850
is human behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s machine simulated,
but they’re not doing anything like what

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.430
a human translator is doing.&nbsp;
