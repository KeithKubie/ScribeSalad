- HEY, WHAT'S UP?
IT'S ME, ADAM D.

00:00:03.237 --> 00:00:05.239
WELCOME TO MY HOUSE PARTY.

00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:07.107
CLOMEDY CENTRAL GAVE ME
A BUNCH OF MONEY--

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:08.609
- WHOA, WHOA.
CUT. CUT.

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:10.110
DUDE, YOU'RE DOING, LIKE,
A REALLY WEIRD THING

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.445
WITH YOUR TONGUE,
AND YOU SAID, "CLOMEDY."

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:12.679
- WELL, I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.448
THAT THIS IS
A MORE SEXUAL SEASON.

00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:17.117
WE'RE DOWN HERE
IN THE "BIG EASY."

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:18.452
AND THEN, I SAID "CLOMEDY,"

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:20.721
BECAUSE IT'S, LIKE,
AN IMPROV THING.

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:22.856
- YEAH.
- YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT COMEDY,

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.091
SO--
- ALL RIGHT.

00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:25.993
- HEY, ADAM!
WELCOME TO NEW ORLEANS.

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:28.195
WE, UH, GOT YOU
A BAR-WARMING PRESENT.

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:30.664
- OH, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.
WHAT IS IT?

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:32.366
IS IT A FLAT-SCREEN TV?

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.168
- NO.
IT'S A KING CAKE,

00:00:34.168 --> 00:00:36.270
AND, UH, IT'S SUPER
FULL OF WEED.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.906
- SIT THAT DOWN HERE,
YOU FREAKIN' MONSTER.

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:41.308
- YOU TAKE A PIECE, AND ONE
OF THE PIECES HAS A BABY IN IT,

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:42.709
LIKE A PLASTIC BABY.

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.678
AND WHOEVER GETS THE BABY
IS KING FOR A DAY.

00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:47.247
- EW, I HATE BABIES.
I LOVE WEED, THOUGH.

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:50.017
- [laughs] RIGHT.
- BABIES--BABIES SUCK.

00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:53.520
[choking]

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.255
I BIT THE BABY!

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:58.825
- TAKE TWO OF THESE
EVERY FOUR HOURS,

00:00:58.825 --> 00:00:59.893
AND AVOID ALCOHOL.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.862
- YEP.
AVOID ALCOHOL.

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:03.197
GOT IT.

00:01:03.197 --> 00:01:06.900
EXCUSE ME, NOW.
GET--OKAY. THANK YOU!

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.236
AND, ACTION.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:12.139
HEY, WHAT'S UP?
IT'S ME, ADAM D.

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:14.241
WELCOME TO MY HOUSE PARTY.

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:17.978
SEE, LAST YEAR, CLOMEDY CENTRAL
GAVE ME SOME MONEY

00:01:17.978 --> 00:01:19.713
TO THROW
A STAND-UP COMEDY SHOW,

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:23.250
AND IT WENT SO WELL THAT THEY
ACTUALLY CUT MY BUDGET IN HALF.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.418
BUT, I TOOK OUT A LOAN

00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:27.888
AND BOUGHT A BAR IN NEW ORLEANS,

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:30.991
FREAKING LOUISIANA, BABY.

00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:34.161
CUT. OH, MY TOOTH.
IT HURTS SO BAD.

00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:37.231
I'M GONNA NEED--I'M GONNA POP
A FEW MORE OF THESE DOGGIES.

00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:38.699
JUST A COUPLE MORE, JUST--

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:41.368
HEY, WILL YOU GIVE SOME ABSINTHE
TO WASH IT DOWN?

00:01:41.368 --> 00:01:43.103
I CHIPPEDED IT REALLY BAD.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:46.106
OKAY.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.008
MM. I FEEL BETTER ALREADY.

00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:49.309
- AND, WE'RE SCREWED.

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:52.112
