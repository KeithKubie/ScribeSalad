00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.050
This is a good time to bring up a quiz for you. This question is asking you, why

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:12.800
did Mach take roughly 800 or more cycles than L3 microkernel for doing this

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.520
border crossing between user and kernel? Is it

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.920
because L3 uses faster processor? Is it because

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.750
Liedtke is smarter? Liedtke, as you know, is

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.490
the author of the L3 microkernel. Is it because

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.980
Mach's design priorities are different from L3

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.580
microkernels? Or is it because microkernels are

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.190
slow by definition? Those are the four

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.230
choices. You had to pick the right choice.
