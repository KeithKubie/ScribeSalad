coming back looking for jobs and the

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130
coming back looking for jobs and the
 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.460
coming back looking for jobs and the
question was Wow where are the jobs

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470
question was Wow where are the jobs
 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.190

ashes and Japan in ashes it was obvious

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350
ashes and Japan in ashes it was obvious

ashes and Japan in ashes it was obvious
that an export-led drive was not likely

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260
that an export-led drive was not likely
 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.180
that an export-led drive was not likely
to be successful and so the focus was on

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190
to be successful and so the focus was on
 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.570
to be successful and so the focus was on
promoting domestic consumption as a way

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580
promoting domestic consumption as a way
 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.080

providing jobs for the returning
demobilized service people and so every

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050
