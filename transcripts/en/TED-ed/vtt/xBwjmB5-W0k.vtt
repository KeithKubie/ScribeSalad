Ah, thankfully novelist was my number one,

00:00:08.194 --> 00:00:10.590
took a while though.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.267
Again, I worked for a couple decades nearly,

00:00:14.267 --> 00:00:16.604
and at some point it really wasn't my goal

00:00:16.604 --> 00:00:18.203
to become a novelist anymore.

00:00:18.203 --> 00:00:20.608
I loved my work at the time developing software

00:00:20.608 --> 00:00:22.965
and then I went back to it.

00:00:22.965 --> 00:00:25.292
So, I think the thing I'd say to people is

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:27.476
sometimes it's a very circuitous path.

00:00:27.476 --> 00:00:29.480
I mean, I wouldn't change it in hindsight

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.304
how it happened.

00:00:30.304 --> 00:00:32.818
I mean, I finally got to my dream profession,

00:00:32.818 --> 00:00:35.421
but the journey was enjoyable too,

00:00:35.421 --> 00:00:38.238
and that's what I would say.

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:40.632
It was definitely novelist,

00:00:40.632 --> 00:00:42.365
I think really only that.
