00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:16.815
You might remember
a pair of TED-Ed Lessons

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:18.864
written and performed by two educators,

00:00:18.888 --> 00:00:21.273
Brad Voytek and Tim Verstynen.

00:00:21.297 --> 00:00:23.059
These two scientists used a drooling,

00:00:23.083 --> 00:00:24.726
hag-faced, animated zombie

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.144
as a mechanism to model

00:00:26.168 --> 00:00:28.249
the symptoms and medical diagnosis process

00:00:28.273 --> 00:00:31.476
for various neurological conditions.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.922
For example, they spent time debating

00:00:32.946 --> 00:00:34.609
whether the zombie's stiff gait

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:36.687
was caused by basal ganglia damage,

00:00:36.711 --> 00:00:38.504
like that in Parkinson's patients,

00:00:38.528 --> 00:00:40.680
or by severe damage to the cerebellum,

00:00:40.704 --> 00:00:42.793
which can cause ataxia.

00:00:42.817 --> 00:00:45.103
In each Lesson, Brad and Tim
certainly showed us

00:00:45.127 --> 00:00:46.651
how the walking dead can help us

00:00:46.675 --> 00:00:48.085
understand neuroscience,

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:49.058
but how can the walking dead

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:51.164
help us understand animation?

00:00:51.188 --> 00:00:52.519
Or, more simply put,

00:00:52.543 --> 00:00:54.067
how did this one-eyed, decaying,

00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:57.456
and very much dead pile of pixels walk?

00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:01.807
Puppet animation
is a relatively quick solution

00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:05.766
to creating 2-D animation
of a hand-drawn character.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.428
Since the character does not need

00:01:06.452 --> 00:01:08.174
to be drawn over and over again,

00:01:08.198 --> 00:01:11.655
it can be animated by moving
each element individually.

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:12.679
Aside from their portrayal

00:01:12.703 --> 00:01:15.004
in a few great modern zombie flicks,

00:01:15.028 --> 00:01:17.189
these concocted carcasses
are generally known

00:01:17.213 --> 00:01:19.382
for limited, stiff movements.

00:01:19.406 --> 00:01:21.153
Their traditional stride is perfect

00:01:21.177 --> 00:01:23.506
for puppet-style animation.

00:01:27.473 --> 00:01:29.402
When designing a 2-D zombie puppet,

00:01:29.426 --> 00:01:31.164
or any other type of puppet,

00:01:31.188 --> 00:01:32.712
it is important to find a design

00:01:32.736 --> 00:01:35.990
that is both fun and functional
in a flat environment.

00:01:36.014 --> 00:01:38.943
For example, you might not
want to puppetize, say,

00:01:38.967 --> 00:01:40.759
Julie Andrews in the "Sound of Music"

00:01:40.783 --> 00:01:42.508
as she spins in circles.

00:01:42.532 --> 00:01:44.085
We used rotoscoping for her,

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.017
but that's another lesson.

00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:48.470
Always begin by sketching
and designing your puppet

00:01:48.494 --> 00:01:49.846
in a neutral pose

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.195
like this.

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.077
This will allow it to easily transition

00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:56.275
into and out of a variety
of extreme positions.

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:57.633
Once a character transitions

00:01:57.657 --> 00:01:58.803
from concept stetches

00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:00.104
to final design,

00:02:00.128 --> 00:02:01.986
the next step is to break up the pieces

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.781
in order to assemble a puppet,

00:02:03.805 --> 00:02:05.399
keeping in mind that each element

00:02:05.423 --> 00:02:07.614
needs to have an appropriate
amount of overlap

00:02:07.638 --> 00:02:10.936
so that the Zombie can bend at his joints.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.534
An understanding of anatomy
is an integral part

00:02:12.558 --> 00:02:15.301
of designing any 2-D
or 3-D animated character

00:02:15.325 --> 00:02:16.849
that needs to move realistically

00:02:16.873 --> 00:02:19.082
in the context of its environment.

00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:21.888
Regardless of the number
of dimensions your character has,

00:02:21.912 --> 00:02:23.484
you'll need to create a skeleton,

00:02:23.508 --> 00:02:26.074
which in animation terms
is known as a rig.

00:02:28.605 --> 00:02:30.147
Once the rig is finalized

00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:32.133
and the range of motion is determined,

00:02:32.157 --> 00:02:34.675
the next step is to choose anchor points.

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:37.121
Each piece of artwork has
its own anchor point,

00:02:37.145 --> 00:02:39.533
which essentially assigns
the limb a hinge,

00:02:39.557 --> 00:02:41.663
which in this case is a joint.

00:02:41.687 --> 00:02:43.612
Next, line the artwork up

00:02:43.636 --> 00:02:45.827
so that the anchor point
for the forearm-elbow

00:02:45.851 --> 00:02:47.945
sits on the upper arm's elbow area.

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:49.864
Once all the artwork is in place,

00:02:49.888 --> 00:02:51.412
you can use an expression script

00:02:51.436 --> 00:02:53.912
that creates links between the body parts.

00:02:53.936 --> 00:02:55.698
In this case, we used the expressions

00:02:55.722 --> 00:02:57.626
provided in After Effects.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.447
By parenting one layer to another,

00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:00.757
you could teach the forearm

00:03:00.781 --> 00:03:01.952
to follow the upper arm

00:03:01.976 --> 00:03:03.821
and the hand to follow the forearm.

00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:06.513
This is what's called forward kinematics.

00:03:06.537 --> 00:03:08.921
The alternative is inverse kinematics,

00:03:08.945 --> 00:03:11.830
in which a separate set
of scripts control the motions.

00:03:11.854 --> 00:03:13.747
In this case, a controller is attached

00:03:13.771 --> 00:03:15.777
to the anchor point of the hand.

00:03:15.801 --> 00:03:18.016
The animator then uses the controller

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.664
to position the hand.

00:03:19.688 --> 00:03:21.498
The scripts will then use an algorithm

00:03:21.522 --> 00:03:23.284
to make sure that the rest of the arm

00:03:23.308 --> 00:03:25.182
and body follows along.

00:03:29.035 --> 00:03:30.416
Once the character is rigged,

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.250
we can start animating.

00:03:32.274 --> 00:03:34.297
Often times, puppet animation is done

00:03:34.321 --> 00:03:35.963
as straight-ahead action,

00:03:35.987 --> 00:03:38.130
which means moving
a character frame-by-frame

00:03:38.154 --> 00:03:40.001
from beginning to end.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.121
Another approach
is pose-to-pose animation,

00:03:44.145 --> 00:03:46.709
which involves choosing
your key poses first,

00:03:46.733 --> 00:03:48.423
and then filling in the intervals,

00:03:48.447 --> 00:03:50.301
or in-betweens, later.

00:03:50.325 --> 00:03:51.992
Regardless of the method of motion,

00:03:52.016 --> 00:03:54.043
it's important to think of your 2-D puppet

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.466
as a piece of paper.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:56.562
It can move across a surface

00:03:56.586 --> 00:03:58.302
in a variety of poses,

00:03:58.326 --> 00:04:00.594
but it cannot move in perspective.

00:04:00.618 --> 00:04:02.571
If your character needs to turn its head,

00:04:02.595 --> 00:04:04.814
then you will need
to create additional art.

00:04:04.838 --> 00:04:06.861
We created three different zombie heads

00:04:06.885 --> 00:04:08.342
and six different hands

00:04:08.366 --> 00:04:10.319
to achieve different movements and angles

00:04:10.343 --> 00:04:12.692
that the neutral pose
couldn't accommodate.

00:04:13.463 --> 00:04:15.248
You can recreate almost everything

00:04:15.272 --> 00:04:16.330
you've seen in this Lesson

00:04:16.354 --> 00:04:18.617
with a pen, paper, and a camera.

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:21.425
The method is called cut-out animation,

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.477
and it was around well
before the age of software.

00:04:24.501 --> 00:04:26.844
To create a stumbling 2-D zombie,

00:04:26.868 --> 00:04:27.786
or a speeding narwhal,

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.317
or even an abstract character

00:04:29.341 --> 00:04:31.184
with some semblance of joints,

00:04:31.208 --> 00:04:31.977
simply print,

00:04:32.001 --> 00:04:32.351
cut,

00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:34.375
and fasten your character's limbs together

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.609
in a neutral pose.

00:04:35.633 --> 00:04:36.650
You can use fasteners,

00:04:36.674 --> 00:04:37.201
string,

00:04:37.225 --> 00:04:39.729
or even just place
and move them each time.

00:04:39.753 --> 00:04:41.230
All the same rules and theories

00:04:41.254 --> 00:04:42.540
that we use in the computer

00:04:42.564 --> 00:04:44.946
apply to cut-out animation,

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:45.239
except under the camera,

00:04:45.263 --> 00:04:47.609
the only way to animate is straight ahead.
