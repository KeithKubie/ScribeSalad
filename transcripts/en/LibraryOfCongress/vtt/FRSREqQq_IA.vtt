00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.160 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hello everyone, thanks for coming
to the Library of Congress today.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.390
My name is [laughter], my name
is a very amplified Rob Casper.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.370
Can you hear me in the back?

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.440
Okay, I'm Rob Casper,
I'm Head of the Poetry

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.520
and Literature Center here at the
Library of Congress and I want

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.670
to welcome you to our National
Poetry Month conversations

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.060
with African Poets
and Writers Program,

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.490
featuring Caine Prize
Winne Lidudumalingani.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.940
We're thrilled to have him here,
we're thrilled to have you here,

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.720
we're thrilled to celebrate
the Caine Prize.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.510
I want to give a special
thanks to Lizzy Attree,

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.640
the Director of Caine Prize
for helping make this possible.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.170
I could not be more delighted with
this series and with the partners

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.160
that we work with and I'm going
to introduce one of them right now

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.010
but before I do so, let me just
ask you to turn off your cellphones

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.900
and electronic devices,
anything you might have

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.780
that would interfere
with this event.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.870
Second, they'll be a
Q&amp;A session afterwards.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.470
Please note that this program is
being recorded and by participating

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.570
in the Q&amp;A session,
you give us permission

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.190
for future use of the recording.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.870
This series started really out
of a partnership with the African

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.980
and Middle Eastern division
and its Chief, Mary-Jane Deeb

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.120
and she's been an inspiration to
all of us that have gotten a chance

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.840
to work with her and I'm
delighted that we have continued it

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.720
and deepened our partnership and
she'll talk a little bit more

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.880 position:56%
about new partnerships going forward
but it's a tremendous series,

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.210
I'm very proud to have done it and
I'm very thankful to Mary-Jane Deeb

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.510
for helping make it possible so
please welcome Mary-Jane Deeb.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.040
[ Applause ]

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.220
&gt;&gt; Okay, well welcome, welcome to
the African Middle East Division,

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:22.500
I mean it's very exciting today to
start 2017, with our Conversations

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.680
With African Poets and Writers.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.840
And as Rob Casper said,
this is a series

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.980
that has become iconic
if I may say so.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:39.300
It is known across the globe,
people are very much aware

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.240
of the great speakers that we
have brought to the library.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.530
Let me say a few words, the Poetry

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.360
and Literature Center has been
a fantastic partner with us

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.340
and so has been two other
institutions, the African Society

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.110
of the National Summit on Africa
has been there from day one

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:16.120
and day one goes back to
a major event that we did

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.720
with the great poet Achebe,
writer and poet Achebe.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:28.790
We did this program almost a decade
ago and we had started it also

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.080
with another partner who
is coming back on board

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.000
and that is Howard University.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.120
Howard University had organized
a major symposium on Achebe

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.760
and we always thought Howard
University should be a partner

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.130
and low and behold, today I want to
announce that Professor Mbye Cham,

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.550
representing Howard University,
has agreed to be a partner

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.930
so now we have Library of
Congress two divisions,

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.460
Poetry and Literature Center
and African Middle East Division

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:16.680
and the African Society at Howard
University are cosponsoring our

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.180
series on, Conversations With
African Poets and Writers.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.040
The Poetry Center has been a
fantastic partner and has brought

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.830
in a number of award
winning writers.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.840
The African section, all
four of the specialists

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.340
in the African section have
been fantastic representatives

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.570 position:56%
of this division in bringing and
informing us about writers and poets

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.980
for our writing, not
only the established ones

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.500 position:56%
but the new ones like the one today.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.120
And now to introduce the Caine
Prize Winner Lidudumalingani,

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:11.730
we have the President
of the African Society

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:18.510
who will be doing the introduction
so here we have Patricia Baine.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.100
[ Applause ]

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.340
&gt;&gt; Good morning or good afternoon.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.140
So we're here, welcome
this afternoon.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.280
I'm proud to introduce
Lidudumalingani,

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.130
who won the 2016 Caine
Prize for African Writing,

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.310
described as Africa's
leading literary award

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.220 position:56%
for his short story entitled,
Memories we Lost, that was published

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.980
in The Incredible Journey,
Stories That Move You.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.720
Memories we Lost tells the
emotionally charged story of a girl

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.770
who acts as a protector
of her sister,

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.810
whose serious mental health
problems caused consternation

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.020
in South African village.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.250
Her situation deteriorates as he
care is entrusted to [inaudible],

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.120
a local man who employs
traditional techniques

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.620
to get rid of people's demons.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.660
Lidudumalingani is a writer, he's
a filmmaker, and a photographer

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.170
and I remember reading someplace

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.710
that he says that he
writes visually.

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.010
I guess he will explain to us what
that means, he thinks visually.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.150
I think the photography
overtakes all other aspects.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.620 position:56%
This is a very short synapsis of
the writer's bio which, by no means,

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.490
is a reflection of
the accomplishments

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.040
and the amazing things
that he has done.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:45.020
He was born in the Eastern
Cape Province of South Africa.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.020
He has published short
stories, nonfiction,

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.020
and criticisms in various
publications.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.400
His films have been screened at
a number of films and festivals.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.690
This is the part I like,
he is called the cool kid

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.300
of South African literature
currently [laughter]

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.010
so we welcome him to
the Conversations

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.930
With African Poets and Writers.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:16.300
I am now going to ask Laverne Page,
no, to start the conversation.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.600
All right, not [laughter].

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.250
I will ask Mr. Lidudumalingani
himself,

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.510
please clap for him, thank you.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:35.060
[ Applause ]

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.360
&gt;&gt; Greetings.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:42.240
Firstly, thank you everyone
for being here and thank you

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.190
for all the partners
for bringing me here.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:49.300
I've been in DC since Monday night.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.560
It's been interesting [laughter].

00:07:52.560 --> 00:08:02.090
I'm going to read from page 76, and
then I think I'm supposed to read

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:08.940
for plus/minus 10 minutes or
to stop maybe when I'm tired.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.830
&gt;&gt; We sat there and
watched the day go by.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.460
We didn't even attempt
to say a word.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.680
I realized then that she
and I needed no words.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.800
In the afternoon that
day, it began to rain.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.230
I dragged her out of the house.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.900
We jumped in the rain,
begging it to pour on us

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.950
so we could be tall,
big, strong and bold.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:43.020
In that moment, my sister returned.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.200
She smiled and laughed.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.400
That day we began to form
new childhood memories,

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:54.130
filling the void left by the
one that had been wiped out.

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:57.480
We lay on the ground,
stretched out our arms and legs,

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:02.960 position:56%
rain falling on our faces and felt
free but my mother had seen us laugh

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.540
and jump, and thought that this
thing was going to come again.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:09.730
The following day, the entire
village gathered outside

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:15.750
of our house for yet another
[inaudible] to cure my sister.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.440
She had been through
all these rituals

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.390
and [inaudible] and
nothing had changed.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:25.420 position:56%
Each time, [inaudible] promised that
she would be healed within days.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.330
There was once, at least
according to the elders,

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:32.120
a glimpse of the [inaudible]
healing, the [inaudible]

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:36.420 position:56%
that had been put in the [inaudible]
for the ancestors to take at night

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:41.890
in one of the many rituals were
not there by morning leading them

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:45.190
to believe that the
ancestors had healed her.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:50.150
It was not long after that,
that this thing again proving

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:53.050 position:56%
that the [inaudible] had simply been
stolen by thieves, that it returned.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:59.090
The day of the ritual I remember
how the clouds moved across the sky

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:03.520
in a hurry and how thick fog hung
onto the grass, the mountains,

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.120
the riverbanks and forest
as if to announce death.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.450
It hung so low that people
appeared to be floating

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.890
with their legs cut
off below their knees.

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:16.140
The women's chatter and songs
reached us long before the crowd

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.440
was visible.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.080
It appeared as if the
fog had swallowed them

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.570
and that the women would
never come into sight.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:24.770
All the same, they did.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:29.280
They [inaudible] and chanted
song as they approached our home.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:34.820
Men came in silence, arms folded
behind their back carrying sticks.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:38.580 position:56%
A few minutes after the women
arrived, smoke escaped the fireplace

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.340
into the sky, dancing
with the moving clouds

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.740 position:56%
as if the sky was their dance floor.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.100
The children ran around and kicked
soccer balls that had been made

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.430
by stuffing papers
into plastic bags.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:54.380
Everyone moved in a
chaotic choreography.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.460
That way went an [inaudible]
woman carrying a bucket of water

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.930
on her head, this way went
a child with a tablecloth,

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:04.660
that way went a dog with a
bone, this way went chickens,

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.350
that way stood women
gossiping about my sister.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:11.930
From our house, I could
see the crowds amplifying

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.220
as more people arrived.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.130
I looked at my sister and
found her face as it had been

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.400
in earlier months, emotionless.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.740
In the past few days she had given
me hope that she had returned.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.620
Now, tears rolled down our cheeks.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.620
I knew then that she still felt
something, that the last few days

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.800
of holding hands, laughing
and jumping

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.760
in the rain were not a dream.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:41.170
The fog began to clear and
everything came into focus,

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:42.800
the mountains, landscape, river,

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:47.440
and the other villages
were there, unmoved.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.840
An old man who had been smoking his
pipe behind the [inaudible] emptied

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.040
it and stuffed it in his pockets.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.670
The ritual began.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.440
Knives were drawn and the goat
was first stabbed in the stomach

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:03.840
to summon our ancestors from their
enclaves and then it was meat.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.340
After some time, an old aunt
came for us, calling for us

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.400
to come out of the house.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.810
We hugged tightly.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.890
My sister and I wiped
each other's tears.

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:17.230
It was only after we had heard her
footsteps approaching our house

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:21.440
that we walked out, holding hands,
fingers tightly intertwined.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:26.710 position:56%
The only way to have torn me away
from her would have to cut us apart.

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:30.470
The villagers shouted insult at
the thing as it remained unknown

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:35.420
to them, for what felt like an
entire lifetime, while my sister

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.650
and I sat at [inaudible]
our heads bowed.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.550
The elders kept referring
to this thing

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.420
as demons and the devil's work.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:48.990
None of them knew my
sister, none of them cared.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:53.860
The sun was up now, thick shadows
gathering around the house.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.310
Even though there was no wind,

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:58.760
the windmill by the fields
made a creaking sound.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:04.070
My mother was torn and defeated and
questioned why God gave this thing

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:07.580
to my sister and my father.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:12.070
Secrets stay buried for so long
but one day they rise to open

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.040
like seeds breaking
free from the earth.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.480
Nobody had ever mentioned
that my father had this thing,

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.250
that he had left one day on his
horse to see distant relatives

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:28.080
and had never come back, to only
be see in a way that [inaudible]

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.150
after their death in
dreams in hallucinations.

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:36.240
He had been seen in some village
at least twice, my mother told me.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.810
The person who had seen
him yelled and waved

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:41.100
but he never bothered to look.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.620
They were not sure
if it was my father

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.910
but they were convinced
that it had to be.

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:50.160
He was never buried, though
it is now 20 years later.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.980
There was nothing to bury.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.490
I have no memory of my father.

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:57.760
There was always hope that he
would return from somewhere.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.560
Nobody knew where, nobody
cared as long as he returned.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:07.260
The night of the ritual, my sister
and I slept lying the same way

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.940
and stared off in different
directions.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:13.680
I woke up and she was
holding me, squeezing me,

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.910
and she had sunk her teeth into
the pillow so she would not cry.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:21.790
She [inaudible] for a few minutes
and then fell asleep in my arms.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:26.140
In the morning, I went
to milk the goat.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:31.590
I saw two human shadows
hovering above the [inaudible].

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:36.090
At first, though it was unusual,
I thought nothing of it even

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:38.670
as they mumbled something
to each other.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:42.880
In the shadows that lived inside
the [inaudible], with the smell

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.570
of manure, I saw that it was my
mother and an uncle who had come

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:49.130
to stay with us for the ritual.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:51.830
It was as if their heads
were bound together into one,

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:55.400 position:56%
creating a giant head, a ghost even.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.930
I had meant to get out, but when
I heard them mention my sister,

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:01.590
I put the jug of milk
down and crouched,

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:04.970
leaning on the goat
so it did not move.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.910
My father [inaudible],
the man who had moved

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:11.960
in with my mother were making
plans to take my sister away.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:16.070
The medication and the ritual
did not work, my mother said.

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:19.860
The way she saw it, my sister
needed to see [inaudible].

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.970
This thing is going to
come back, she said.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:16:03.060
[ Applause ]

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:06.780
&gt;&gt; Okay thank you very
much, is your mic on?

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.970
&gt;&gt; One two, one two, yeah it is.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:16.400
&gt;&gt; So now you're going to
hear from the cool kid.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:20.300
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure where that
comes from [laughter].

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.670
It's definitely not true.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:26.920
&gt;&gt; Well, I was going to say
now you're going to hear

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:32.380
from the cool kid and the
grandmom [laughter], labels.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:40.910
Thank you so much for reading that
passage from Memories we Lost,

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:44.250
which focuses on mental illness.

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:51.520
At the end of the story, the story
ends, but at the end of the story

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:57.050
where do these children
go, that was my question.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:02.710
Children wandering around, the
one that's attempting to help,

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:08.740
and then the one that's ill,
where do they go especially

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:17.250
when you say 20 years later in your
story, so there's something there.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:24.350
&gt;&gt; I mean, the ending was
really motivated by two factors,

00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:26.990
one of them was the
deadline [laughter]

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:32.490
and the other was also this idea

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:37.170
that a story is never really
finished so what I really wanted

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:40.500
to do because it's
also a short story

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.990
and I'm usually not really
a short story writer,

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:50.030
I struggled with the story so the
idea was to then write an ending

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:54.990
that suggested that there was
a lot more going on and by

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:59.590
that I didn't really suggest that
it would come from me necessarily.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.490
I was hoping that people
would read the story

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:06.350
and they would perhaps take
the challenge to finish it.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:11.070
&gt;&gt; Okay, I should point
out that I'm asking this

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:14.310
because although I would
normally be interested,

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:19.990
also there's an investigation
right now currently in South Africa

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:24.510
into the treatment of
mentally ill patients.

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.910
They were removed, a large
number of them were removed

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:32.270
from their hospitals and they
were just sent elsewhere and many

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:36.760
of them, or most of them
died and so it's a political

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.960
and a social issue
and it's a tragedy.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.030
And so, since you're
writing about mental illness,

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:49.060
I'm wondering if this
is more material for you

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:54.390
for the stories that you write.

00:18:54.390 --> 00:19:02.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I mean, because I wrote the story
and I've spent about possibly close

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:05.990
to a year talking about mental
illness in South Africa and talking

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:11.200 position:56%
about the story specifically I mean,
when the news of that tragedy broke

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:17.810
out it was heartbreaking and
then there was a thing they do

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:22.130
in Parliament in South Africa where
the president addresses the nation

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:26.130
and one of the people from the
political parties, the opposition,

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:29.870
asked if they could give a
moment of silence to I think

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:33.940
at that time it was around
125 people that had died,

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:41.490 position:56%
and the Madam Speaker of
Parliament refused and she was like,

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:47.060
we are not here to mourn 125 dead
people, so it was heartbreaking

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:52.140
for me because at that
moment I really got to kind

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.820
of understand what it means

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:59.530
to have a family member whose got
mental illness and what it means

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:03.040
when they die that the
government doesn't care.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.780
So because of how emotional
that was for me,

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:10.240
I've never really seen it as,
to put it in a very crass way,

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.330
as an opportunity for material.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:16.870
It's just been really heartbreaking
that I haven't even though

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:22.150 position:56%
about do I write more about it or
do I make images or do I make forms?

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:25.390
I haven't really thought about it.

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:32.640
&gt;&gt; Well, let me ask you
about the Caine Prize.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:38.790 position:56%
I'm curious as to whether or not
it's made a great difference to you.

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:43.750
I'm wondering if its contributed
to your current projects

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.830
and the audiences that you reach.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:53.410
When exactly were you notified
that you had won the prize?

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.140
&gt;&gt; It really happens in the
right, you really don't know

00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:01.970
until the announcement
is made but I mean,

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:03.980
for me the exciting
thing was finding

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.600
out that I had been short listed

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:10.000
because Memories Lost was
a second story of fiction

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.620 position:56%
that I've ever written and more
than anything it was the idea for me

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:20.210
that I needed to write other things
except nonfiction and so I was,

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:22.290
I'll write a short story
and that's what I did.

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.690
So to have it nominated,

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:26.920
short listed for the Caine
Prize was amazing for me.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:31.910
I was really excited and I mean,
if you get short listed you go

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:37.870 position:56%
to London and you spend about a week
doing readings and talking to people

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:41.780
and it's very exciting until
the night of the announcement

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:49.160 position:56%
and then you start thinking about
who is going to win the Caine Prize.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:53.000
It was exciting to win and I've
really had an exciting year

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.030
and because, I mean I've never
really written any fiction before

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:02.330
this so it was exciting for
me to be immediately thrown

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:05.480
into a very wide reading community
which I've really appreciated

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:09.020
which I think for any writer
that's what's important,

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:12.100
that your writing is read widely
and that's what's happening

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.960
to my own writing and I'm
very grateful for that.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.210
&gt;&gt; For the Caine Prize, you
don't submit your own work,

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:21.280
someone else submits
the work, correct?

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:26.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah so the publisher submits
the work to the Caine Prize,

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:30.040
yes but you can ask your
publisher to submit.

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.070
[ Laughter ]

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:35.010
&gt;&gt; You can make a suggestion.

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:41.740
&gt;&gt; Okay, okay well, can you tell us
more about your current projects?

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.810
Since you're a writer, a filmmaker,

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:49.520
and photographer I'm just wondering
what you have been working on

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:54.840
and which of these genres
do you enjoy most and in

00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:00.420
which are you the most prolific
and if there's a certain subject

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:04.680
that you prefer so there are
a number of questions in one.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:08.790
&gt;&gt; I mean, the other amazing thing
that happened to me in 2016 was

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:13.790 position:56%
that I was given then Miles
Morland Scholarship, which allows me

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:15.960
to spend a year writing
my debut novel

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:21.060
so that's what I'm going
to be doing next month.

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:24.760
I'm trying to really
not do anything else.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:29.450
I mean, the one thing that I've
tried to, I've been working

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:35.110
on a full script for the past
four years and it's been really up

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:39.410
and down, a lot of suggestions from
people that I've sent it to so one

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:41.890
of the things that I've
tried to do is to finish

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:44.920
that full script before I
begin work on the novel.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.450
&gt;&gt; What's the subject?

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:47.790
&gt;&gt; Of the novel?

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:51.230
&gt;&gt; Of the film and
also of the novel.

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:53.640
&gt;&gt; I can talk about the film
but not really the novel.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:24:01.380
Well I mean, it's not even a novel
at this point, it's just really,

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:06.430
when I was in film school I went
to film school with a photographer

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:09.910
from South Africa called
[inaudible], who I think most

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:12.690
of you might be familiar
with her work.

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:19.990
If any of you have met her,
you would understand the power

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:23.450
that she has, so a lot of the
conversations that were going

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:26.550
around my class when I was
in film school were about,

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:33.390
because a lot of violence in
South Africa happens to lesbians.

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:37.300
There's a very terrible
thing called corrective rape

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:42.620
so that's what the film was
about but more than that,

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:47.730
the film was really looking at
a society that allows a society

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:51.250
where corrective rape happens so
that's what the film was about

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:53.630
and this is why it's been
really difficult to write

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:58.470
because for me it's not just
the subject but it's important

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:01.530
for everything about it
to kind of fit perfectly

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:07.900
into both my own politics but also
for the film to go against the sort

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:12.600
of very problematic descriptions
or problematic conversations

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:16.090
that have gone on around
corrective rape.

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:19.670
&gt;&gt; What does that mean,
corrective rape?

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:27.770 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I mean you know, the way to
describe it is that there's the idea

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:33.760
that if a bunch of men
decide to rape a lesbian,

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.020
gang rape a lesbian it's called
corrective rape because the idea is

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:43.670
that you cannot be a lesbian so we
will show you that you are a woman,

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:46.300
and this is why it's
called corrective rape

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:50.830
because in their mind it's the idea
that you will then become a woman

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:54.420
as they describe and see it.

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:59.020
&gt;&gt; Okay and you cannot
tell us about the novel

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:02.130
so I won't ask any more
questions about the novel.

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:03.830
What about short stories,

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:08.940
since you're doing so
well with that genre?

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:13.440
&gt;&gt; I don't know about doing well,
I wrote one short story [laughter].

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.930
&gt;&gt; But you won the Caine Prize.

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:21.580
&gt;&gt; There's one short
story that I'm working on.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:27.040
Again, I mean, my short stories
are only sort of like my writing,

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:31.390
and my film work, and my
photography is always really

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:36.090
in a way just me being very
receptive of the community

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.780
that I live in so the short
story which I'm currently working

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:43.490
on which I hope to
finish before the novel is

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:45.480
about shack fires in South Africa.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.400
In South Africa, there's places
called informal settlements

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:53.430
where people live in shacks so
these are houses made of zinc

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:57.470
and often what happens
is that because some

00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:02.470
of them don't have
electricity people use candles

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:09.550
and what happens often is there's
usually fires and people die.

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:13.850
I mean, I remember one in
2011, which happened right

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:18.750
on New Year's Eve when people
were going out to celebrate 2011,

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.250
people were dying in their houses

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:25.370
and about a month ago there
was another in Cape Town again,

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:30.620
which happened in an interesting
place where it's called,

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:34.810
I mean the place is called
[inaudible] and it's in Hout Bay.

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:41.440
I mean, it sits right next
to the very big mansions

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:47.140
of rich white people in Cape Town,
so I was really interested in sort

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:49.190
of like, that relationship
between people who live

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:53.160
in these very lavish houses
and people who live in shacks

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:58.130 position:56%
and who live in poverty and these
houses that they really try to build

00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:00.050
and get things together
without any money

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.930
and then it gets destroyed
overnight.

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:07.070
The short story I'm
writing is about one family

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:12.640
who loses it all during that fire.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.940
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.220
&gt;&gt; It's a very happy
story [laughter].

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:23.080
&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm just thinking about
the social issues that concern you

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:29.680
and it seems wide ranging and wow.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:37.440
With the films, I'm curious,

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:44.290
I know that there is a prolific
film industry in South Africa

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:50.700
so lots is happening with
literature, with film-making.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.490
Is there a difference,
since you live in Cape Town,

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:58.790
is there a difference between Cape
Town and Johannesburg in terms

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:01.800
of let's say literary activities?

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:10.280
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] is here, he can
maybe help me out [laughter].

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:20.370 position:56%
Look I think, I mean Cape Town is
interesting in a way because I mean,

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:24.290
there's a lot going on especially
with young Black creatives

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:29.090
and we try to get together and do
things but the larger community is

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:33.160
in Johannesburg and I mean, I've
toyed with the idea of going

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:37.010
to Johannesburg a lot
but it hasn't happened.

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:38.830
There's certainly differences

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:40.800
and I think Johannesburg
is far more receptive

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.820
of young Black creatives both
in filmmaking and literature

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.270
and Cape Town is less so.

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:50.660
Cape Town is still predominantly
very white oriented both

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:54.940
when it comes to spaces to exhibit
your work whether it's films

00:29:54.940 --> 00:30:00.390
or you want to read literature
so you have to really find sort

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:03.460
of the spaces that have
been curated for people

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.140
like you to go read your work.

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:10.430
And often, you find that's perhaps
the best way to read your work

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:14.980
to people that actually I
suppose to put it very bluntly,

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.890
won't be asking you very obvious
questions about what you're trying

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:23.260
to do, people understand
what you're trying to do.

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.620
&gt;&gt; And can you tell us something

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:27.410
about where you read your
work a little bit more,

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:35.460
those of us who may not
know that side of city life?

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.730
&gt;&gt; Generally, I'm just
at home the whole time.

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:43.090
I mean, I hear a bunch of people
reading their work and then I plan

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:45.810
to go but things happen
and then I don't go.

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:50.160
I just stay at home and read but
there's a place called Observatory,

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:56.000
some people can get around there,
there's different places there

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.200
to read your work but
there's also young people,

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.470
there's a thing called creative
nestling which gets people together

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:04.680
to read their work both in
Johannesburg and Cape Town.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:05.980
&gt;&gt; Creative?

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.280
&gt;&gt; Creative nestling.

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.580
&gt;&gt; Nestling.

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:12.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah so that happens as well in
Cape Town but also I have a circle

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:15.950
of friends that I can
send my work too.

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:18.570
I mean, I'm in touch with
those people on email

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:20.330
and if I finish a short
story I send it

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:22.160
and if they finish
anything they send it around

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.070
and we can all read
each other's work

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:28.940
which I think is hugely
important in Cape Town to do.

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:35.200
&gt;&gt; Well, there's a quote attributed
to you in one of your interviews,

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.910
"I think South African people
should read more South African

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:42.120
and African fiction before
reading anything else.

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:46.640
There seems to be a growing list of
new Black writers being published

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.220
at the moment and this
is encouraging."

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:55.100
I am wondering who you like
among these new writers,

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:57.710
can you say something about that?

00:31:57.710 --> 00:32:03.140
&gt;&gt; I mean, that quote was
specifically talking about a lot

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:05.970
of the times in South
Africa you meet people

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:10.150
and they will tell you there's
not good literature coming

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:13.180
from South Africa and this is why
I'm reading this or reading that

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.780
and I think that's completely
rubbish because I think

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:17.190
if you are really interested

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:19.440
in reading South African
literature you will find it

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:22.630
and you'll find some
really good literature.

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:26.090
Part of the young writers that I
really love reading is [inaudible]

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:30.690
who was short listed for
the Caine Prize with me.

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:38.270
[Inaudible] whose novel [inaudible]
is absolutely amazing [inaudible]

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:45.210
which is an insane novel so
there's a lot of people like that

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:48.120
who are writing at those levels
and I'm hugely excited I think,

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:50.710
to write at this particular
time because I feel

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:57.750
like there's a certain presence of
young Black writers and I'm excited

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:01.970 position:56%
to be in sort of that space as well.

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:04.480
&gt;&gt; And since we're here in the US,

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.740
who are your favorite
American writers?

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:09.530
&gt;&gt; I don't read any American
literature [laughter].

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:12.460
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's go to the
last question [laughter].

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:20.610
&gt;&gt; I mean it's impossible
to escape US literature.

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:25.410
You can try but, so I have
an interesting or I suppose,

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:30.060
I grew up in the villages and
a lot of things that I read

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:33.260
in the villages were
very English I mean,

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:36.660
Shakespeare was one
of the things we read.

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:42.320
So when I started reading, I
was already aware that I needed

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.270
to read Black authors so a
lot of authors that I love

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:48.790
from America would be the
Black authors of America,

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:52.740
the Toni Morrison's, Maya
Angelou, so those are the people,

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:55.760
and James Baldwin of course,
so those are the people

00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:01.900
that I really love reading
in America and also some

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:03.600
of the newer African-American
writers.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:09.250
I just call them African writers
so [inaudible] so those are the two

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:13.460
that I really like reading.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:17.730
&gt;&gt; Okay, my last question and
might be a little bit redundant

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:23.410
but it's one that we always ask,
what do you think is the future

00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:27.910
for African writers, both
diasporic and from the continent

00:34:27.910 --> 00:34:31.610
and what steps need to be
taken to bring more recognition

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:33.700
from the international community.

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:41.420
So prize wins such as the Caine
Prize of course but what steps need

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:43.900
to be taken to bring
more recognition

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:48.990
from the international community?

00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:52.490
&gt;&gt; I mean, it's a very
tricky question to answer

00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:56.960
because I think often there's a
disparity between the presence

00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:00.200
of African literature and sort
of like what is being published

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.650
and what people are reading.

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:06.110
I don't necessarily think
that we as African writers

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:08.510
or African publishers have
to do anything different.

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:13.160
I mean, people are publishing
books, people are publishing online

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.670
so for me the thing is if
you are really interested

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:19.260
in reading any African
writer you will find them

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:20.840
and there's a lot going on,

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.880
and if you are really
interested you will find them

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.180
because they exist everywhere.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.940
&gt;&gt; Okay, well thank you,
thank you very much.

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:34.160
I think we should open
the floor for questions.

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:43.340
&gt;&gt; Thank you, I really enjoyed
hearing part of your story

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:45.140
and I'll finish reading it.

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:51.160 position:56%
My question to you is you talk about
South Africa, how it's considered

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:54.660
to be possession that causes
mental illness and a lot

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:58.410
of other African cultures it seems
to be continent-wide there seems

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:01.400
to be a denial of mental illness

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:06.520
and therefore a reluctance
to treat it as such.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:09.880
Do you feel that writing
about it is going to,

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:12.800
you as an African writer writing
about mental illness existing

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:19.000
within the African community will
make it a little bit more accepted

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:26.810
and also lead people to look
at it as an illness rather

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:32.220
than a spiritual possession or
even worse, non-existent at all?

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:41.410
&gt;&gt; I mean, that's I suppose a very
difficult question to answer for me

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:45.440
because I mean, I wrote the story
because I was really concerned

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:48.050
about the conversations
that people were having

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:53.380
around mental illness more so in
my own community in the villages

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:58.320
so the idea was to really bring
that conversation right into sort

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:02.380
of people's everyday life and my
idea was that if I write the story,

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:04.820
people are going to read
it and perhaps we are going

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:07.420
to have this conversation and
I think that's where it begins,

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:11.730
it begins with openly having the
conversation and then we can begin

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:14.050
to kind of change how
society sees it.

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:17.390
The problem is that
no one talks about it.

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:19.640
I mean the story of the
government for example,

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:24.360 position:56%
that decision was made purely on the
idea that what are you going to do

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.800
with mentally ill people?

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:29.300
You can do whatever, because these
people were taken from the hospital

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:33.750
and they were given to [inaudible]
that have no experience at all.

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:37.070
I mean, the horrific stories is
that they were even picked up in,

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:41.360
they were thrown into vans and just
driven out to the villages so part

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.580
of my idea with the story was
to do the opposite of that,

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:47.670
was to get people to talk
about it and hopefully once

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:49.680
that conversation begins
we can let it begin to come

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.980
up with a number of solutions.

00:37:58.350 --> 00:37:59.650
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:06.350 position:56%
Your story is very inspiring and you
made me think of different things,

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:10.260
so what are other subjects
that are not talked

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:17.750 position:56%
about that should be talked about in
literature that you feel as a writer

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:20.890
that should be addressed
and are not being addressed?

00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:23.810
And I don't mean necessarily
only in South Africa,

00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:28.000
it could be in the United States,
it could be in any other part

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.480
of the world that you
feel should be addressed.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.250
&gt;&gt; Oh jeez, I mean I don't know.

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:41.750
I mean, I work on an I suppose
story to story basis and you know,

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:43.950
when I was writing about
mental illness it was something

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:47.950
that I was really thinking
about and when I wrote the film

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:49.580
that I'm continuing to write

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:52.580
because that's something I
was really concerned about,

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:56.020
so I'm not quite sure what else
I could write about in the future

00:38:56.020 --> 00:39:00.250
but I certainly know that
one of the interesting things

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:02.830
for me being a village
child is that when you come

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:05.760
to the city there's a
lot of cultural issues,

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:08.870
a lot of cultural indifference
that you sort of have

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:13.670
to reconcile your own beliefs and
kind of the way the city operates

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:17.640 position:56%
so a lot of my writing is
concerned with that, how do you come

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:21.320
to the city and how much of you
changes and how much of you remains

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:24.120
and what do you become, so
those are some of the things

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.920
that I want to write about.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.990
I think part of the one thing I
can tell you about that novel is

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:35.870
that it has a bit of that.

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:38.960
&gt;&gt; As an artist that practices
a lot of different art forms,

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:43.710
how do you make the decision to
put the story that you're thinking

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:46.010
about into writing, versus
film, versus photography?

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:54.680
&gt;&gt; I mean, I don't know
how I make that decision.

00:39:54.680 --> 00:40:00.040
I mean, part of it is really
just convenience right?

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:05.460 position:56%
I have no idea how I would visually
make anything out of mental illness.

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:10.110
I do not see myself taking my
camera and invading people's spaces

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:14.410
like that and making that film but
it felt more comfortable for me

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:17.120
to think about my own community
where I come from in the villages

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:20.700
and write that so a lot
of, I mean it comes to that

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:24.870
and sometimes I mean, I was
in Tanzania before I came here

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:29.290
and there's a big fishing
community in Tanzania

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:32.360
and I made some really
interesting images there

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:38.510 position:56%
but I didn't write anything about it
so it really depends on what works

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:41.280
at that time and so what
time is available to me

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:44.450
because at the time I was in
Tanzania, I was writing a story

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:48.170
so I didn't have the time to write
another but I could make the images

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:50.920
so it really works in that way.

00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:05.060
&gt;&gt; This isn't exactly a question,
I was just going to say that here

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:13.940
in America in Black families,

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:26.900
mentally illnesses are often
really ignored because they're seen

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:34.630
as being in your feelings or you
need to work harder or something

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:38.810
so I don't know, I believe
this may help shape,

00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:44.130
this may help like you said,
may help it be more talked

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:46.190 position:56%
about no like, yes, okay [laughter].

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:48.310
&gt;&gt; I mean, I completely get
you so even in South Africa,

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:51.110
there's a bit of that
especially with depression.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:55.260
Parents will just tell you go play
outside, listen to some music,

00:41:55.260 --> 00:42:01.290
or watch movies as if that helps
so definitely there's a lot more

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:08.490
and this is why I think I mean, the
story has been interesting for me

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:10.260
because a lot of the conversations
about it have been from the point

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:11.560
of the villages and their
traditional living there

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.380
but the truth of it is that even
in the city there's a huge problem.

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:14.940
&gt;&gt; You mentioned that you hadn't
written fiction before the short

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:16.240
story and so I was going

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.540
to ask what's the most important
thing you've learned in terms

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.840
of fiction versus non-fiction?

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:28.550
&gt;&gt; I mean I'm thinking
about it because even

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:31.610
in my non-fiction I make
things up so [laughter] I mean,

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:39.140
I think that the major
difference is really in facts.

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:42.250
There's a certain level
with non-fiction

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:48.390
that you really cannot write
that far away from the truth

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:53.380
but with fiction you
can totally do that.

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:58.830
For me it's all the same because
my poetry exists both in fiction

00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:03.070
and non-fiction, the real
difference is really in the facts.

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:15.810
&gt;&gt; A couple of questions, how would
you characterize the relationship

00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:19.330
between, or the attitude
of the younger generation

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:22.840
of South African writers to those

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:26.210
that you can maybe call
the older generation

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:30.820
who were writing during
the moment of apartheid?

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:37.690
I think your work on mental
illness, I mean, makes me think

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:39.870
about the work of Bessie
Head for example,

00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:42.790
who was engaged more consistently

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:48.140
than perhaps most other South
African writers this particular

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:57.270
issue so I really commend you for,
as a young writer really focusing

00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:59.320
on that particular issue there.

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:10.340
The second question I have is in
relation to how, when you write,

00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:17.210
how do you position yourself vis a
vis your own indigenous traditions

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:18.510
of narrative?

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:23.950
Do you consciously try to draw
from let's say the oral traditions

00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:29.650
to infuse your writing with South
African specificities as far

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:35.870
as style and technique
and so on and so forth?

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:40.920
&gt;&gt; I mean, I think I mentioned this
a little bit that my own encounter

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:44.560
with literature really started very
late in my life and I was already

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:50.890
by then aware of sort of the
presence of I suppose white writers

00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:53.790
and I wanted to read more
Black writers so I mean,

00:44:53.790 --> 00:45:01.140
Bessie had [inaudible] of course
and a lot of the drama writers

00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:06.450 position:56%
in South Africa were writing at
that time so I've read a lot of that

00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:10.430
and I really appreciate
it and I think for me,

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:14.750
in South Africa especially
there seems to have been a space

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:18.480
between the [inaudible] writers
and the writers now after absence

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:22.090
of the Black writer, that
they've been designated to sort

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:25.370
of write certain type of
narratives so I'm really excited

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:28.340
to be writing now in
a space where it feels

00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:30.960
like Black writers are
really just concerned

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:34.170
about writing their own story
and not explaining it to anyone

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:38.820
so it's exciting for me
to write at this time.

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:41.520
Not really to the second
question I mean,

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:47.480
one of my favorite writers is
[inaudible] and so my obsession

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:51.650
with writing has always been poetry
and not so much the oral tradition

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:54.990
but it's interesting now
that I think about it

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:58.200
because every time I go to
readings there's a sense

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:03.260
of the oral tradition as well that
exists in that space so I mean,

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:08.740
I'm not a great reader all
but thinking about the way

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:10.950
that we tell stories in
the villages helps a lot

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:13.540 position:56%
when it comes to the reading for me.

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:23.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hello, I read your story
yesterday and I was very fascinated.

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:26.910
I don't know whether it's
intentional but I think we all know

00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:31.820
that mental illness is a
harsh issue all over Africa,

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:37.390
we don't talk about it and
that this village was engaged,

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:38.810
I was impressed.

00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:42.680
I think you typically [inaudible]
to get involved in things.

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:44.980
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:56.890
&gt;&gt; I wanted to know what book
are you currently reading?

00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:59.450
That's it.

00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:07.050
&gt;&gt; I'm currently reading a book
that I picked up in Durban called,

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:12.820 position:56%
I can't remember the author but it's
called, Fifty Ways to Read a Poem

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:21.510
and it was a column that ran in
The Independent in England I think

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:26.400 position:56%
and so this person would take a
poem every week and they would write

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:30.860
about that poem and what that poem
is saying, how it's saying it,

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:34.750
the difference between the
narrative and the rhyme of the poem

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:38.810
and I specifically am
reading that because I wanted

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:45.680
to get ready for the novel.

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:49.620
&gt;&gt; Is this an online
source, The Independent,

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:50.920
that you're speaking of now?

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:54.130
&gt;&gt; It was published in The
Independent, which is a paper

00:47:54.130 --> 00:48:00.850
in the UK for, someone who
knows The Independent, I think-

really an amazing book.

&gt;&gt; Okay I'm just wondering if you
could tell us or make suggestions

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:28.490
on sources that we should
read, that we could read.

00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:33.800
You mentioned UK, South
Africa, sometimes it is easy

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:37.450
to get online sources more quickly

00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:43.630 position:56%

terrific collection of material here

at the Library of Congress
about South Africa as well

please so that we can remain-

&gt;&gt; I'm going to ask
people to help out,

00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:11.750
from the top of my head there's
an online platform called African

00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:16.580
in Dialogue from [inaudible], which
is run by a poet called [inaudible]

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:22.200
where she interviews people and
it's really exciting conversations.

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:28.200
There is [inaudible] in Cape
Town which is run by [inaudible],

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:37.190
there is in Nigeria a couple of
them, there's [inaudible] in Kenya,

there's [inaudible] in Kenya,
there's Warscapes, there's Kings
