Speaker 1:          00:03          It's time now to practice some very useful phrases. I'll say them first. You repeat, I will learn together. That's begin.

Speaker 2:          00:12          This is radio lab today. Translation.

Speaker 1:          00:14          It's time to begin.

Speaker 2:          00:16          We'll have eight experiments in translation. Transcreation

Speaker 1:          00:19          lesson number one. The best poem was by my mother. [inaudible] people would be my mom. No, you try it.

Speaker 2:          00:29          Hello. Hi there. Hi. Is that dog? Yes. Oh boy. So, uh, this episode was inspired by a guy named Doug Doug Hofstadter, professor of cognitive science, Indiana University Bloomington. Uh, you may know him as the guy who wrote Godel Escher Bach, which was a hugely influential book in certain circles, uh, published in I think 1979 but we actually got interested in him. Uh, thanks to our producer Lynn Levy because of an obsession of his, which predates that 16, I was 16, the year 1961. I was taking a French literature class on one day. I came across this poem, a tiny little poem that kind of sat right in the middle of the page, like a long thin sausage vertical. Ah, three syllables per line. So it was super skinny and 28 lines long and long and it was delightful. It was very cute and funny. I fell in love with a poem immediately and memorized that.

Speaker 2:          01:28          I still know it by heart. The poem is basically a Getwell card. It was written by this guy, Clemon morrow, who was a poet in the early 15 hundreds the court of a queen. And he wrote the poem for a, this Queen's daughter. She was seven or eight and she had gotten sick of flu or something and this poem was supposed to cheer her up and, and her thought was very sweet. Could you say it in French? Let's just hear it first. Yeah. Okay. It's called, uh, Yoon dumb. Was that in Malad to a sick demos El, so to speak, like young lady, a sick young lady, Mami [inaudible], Lucy [inaudible], [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] at the taboo. Shh. [inaudible] Emoji comfy too. You see, you do your Tomala cooler fat two pound a paradol on bone. Poor Joe to Diwan Asante Burn Armenian.

Speaker 2:          02:28          Oh my God. You must have gotten so many chicks when you were six, seven. That was really crazy. Exactly the opposite. I was, I was a wish. Okay, so he reads the poem, files it away deep in the corner of his mind. Fast forward about 20 years, he publishes his first book. He becomes very popular and the publisher decides to have it translate into a number of languages, including French. And that process, which took years, it put me into the frame of mind of thinking, what kinds of crazy things can happen when you crazy texts and all of a sudden one day that poem popped into his mind and I said, ah, there's a challenge. Let's try to do this. And when you say challenge, like what was it? What is it? What is the challenge? Okay, what I meant was to say, here's the thing. He says, you got this poem. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          03:21          if you just focus on the words, it's basically just this guy talking to a younger girl saying, hello my dear. I'm sorry you're sick. Being sick is like prison. I Claremont wish you to open your doors, get out into the world clean loaned of women. Get out of bed, eat some jam. If you too, so you don't look so pale, loose your plump shade pill dog, you know, it's sort of like get better. Here's to your good health due to the [inaudible], I mean young, but just saying those words in English misses the whole spirit of the poem, the tone, the lightheartedness. And, and this is key for Doug. It also ignores the poems form. It's wonderfully catchy little sausage shape on the page. The fact that the lines rhyme, you know, a, B, B, c, c, d, and uh, the first line [inaudible] is identical to the last line.

Speaker 2:          04:10          I mean, young sorta has the feel of a palindrome. It has the poet's name in the middle of the poem. [inaudible] oh, and I forgot, did I say three syllables per law? You didn't that, yeah, of course. Three syllables per line. I mean, that's crucial. And then also 28 lines long. So all of those things added up to a set of constraints you might say on me. So Doug sat down and got to work and uh, quickly became embroiled in the question of like, how do you translate this poem? You know, along the way he even began to make a little grids of possibilities for different lines of the poem. For example, who yawned at the top Bush like this line that basically says don't wallow in bed. I had a lot of possibilities and I'll just read you the uh, little diagonal display here. Instead of spurting blood in bed instead of burping in your bed, instead of bursting out in bed instead of lurking in Europe instead of hurtling out of instead of hurting there and instead of squirming and your instead of slurping slop and instead of burning up in bed instead of turning blue in bed on and on.

Speaker 2:          05:17          And I came up with, you want me to read my first translation please? My sweet dear. I sent you all the best. You're forced. Rest is like jail, so don't ale very long. Just get strong. Go outside, take a ride, do it quick. Stay not sick. Ban Your ache for my sake. Buttered bread while in bed. Makes a mess. So unless you would choose that bad news, I suggest that you'd best soon arise so your eyes will not glaze. Douglass. Praise health. Be Near my sweet dear. So whoa. So claymores now Douglas clean all became Douglas and I, I the word John Jam became bread though. Buttered to bread. Buttered bread. Buttered bread. Yes. Well I just figure jam and Jelly. They are words, but the words represent concepts and the concept have a kind of a halo around them. I mean when you talk about Jelly, you're implicitly talking about bread and things that you spread it on.

Speaker 2:          06:16          Oh, how interesting. People like just stick their fingers in Jelly. No bread needed. Okay. Okay, fair enough. Feeling like he hadn't quite nailed it. Doug sent the poem to one of the guys that translated his first book into French. Yeah. A guy named oddly enough, Bob French and Bob was and I said, hey Bob, can you do it? And uh, Bob said, wow, give it a try. Fairest friend letting me send my embrace. Quit this place. It's dark holes and dank walls in soft, still regain health dress and flea off with me. Clement, who calls for you, very different in tone and really quite marvelous. He got the a pale face in there. He got the gym claimant's name in the middle, but at the same time it didn't have the lightness. The tone is much more ancient, which you could argue, well it's an ancient poem, but Doug says, no, no, no, there's a big a problem that was 30 lines long.

Speaker 2:          07:15          So extra long and 28 was a sacrosanct number. That's just two lines though. No, no, no, no, no. Klemow Maho wrote a three syllable poem of 28 lines that rhymed wonderfully. And the essence of his poem was a form rather than a, uh, than a message that is, the message was get well, which is pretty simple. But Doug would argue no, it was the form. That's what made the thing funny and charming. And so the question for him was who could get the feel but nail the form? To make a long story short, he ended up sending the poem out to like 60 people, doctoral students, whom I, sweet. I entreat one regard, Otis hard dear recluse colleagues, friends chickadee. I decree a fine day. Even got his wife to do one dart away from your cage and engage in brave flight so you might flee the croup.

Speaker 2:          08:07          That was all bird themed. Hope you swoop into ham, apple jam and French bridge. You go running around from town to town saying, hey, I got a little poem. Anybody want to [inaudible] I am a person of binges. This began a binge. She might say in that binge ended up becoming a 700 page book filled with translations of this poem. Go ahead and read the last one. Now this is the bell, right? Right. No, this is not the best one. This is just that one and I'll stop it. Okay, here we go. Okay. Okay. This is also one of his, but like the 20th one he did POW petite Gal. So sweet hug from duck, some dumb bug dragged you down. Zap that fram feel the urge bugs to purge from the scourge. You'll emerge in a Trice sound advice from ham dunk slash. Clem. So smash flu come you who come you who lived at you sheets.

Pound there, hub got your mind set in the red. It's humorous, although not the best. He says, I do want to get to my mother's translation speakers. My mother's was somehow, I'm going to have to look it up here. Where it was. It was that this book is long and complicated than this one from his mom. He says came along years after he started. Sure it is, and he thinks that might be the winter high. Twits get well, hospitals, prison and prisons. Hell, get well. Flea yourself. Clements orders in a nutshell. Go pig out. Open wide your mouth. Keep those sweetmeats going south. Unless you're hail, you'll turn Pale loose. Ooh, la La. That wiggles your tail. God restore good health to you. My little flower.

Speaker 2:          10:03          Oh, that's cool. I noticed that she doesn't begin the poem and end the poem with the same line. She doesn't have 28 lines. She has maybe about 16 lines. Uh, she doesn't pay any attention to syllable counts. I did. My first reaction was, oh mom, no mom, come on, come on. I didn't pay any attention to the form and, and she said, I did what I wanted to do. This is my feeling, you know, that's what I did. And actually, you know, I have to say it has stood the test of time. It has some kind of pizazz that no other one ever had. But if she didn't respect the form, he didn't do the syllable. She didn't rhyme it the way it's supposed to rhyme. She didn't give you 28 line. She even like have that practically set a translation then or is that just a mom?

Speaker 2:          10:52          I left a hundred flowers bloom. As I got more and more deeply into this poem and my philosophy started to become Chairman Mao's statement, let 100 flowers bloom. In other words, you can look at it from so many angles and each new angle enriches it and makes it more fun. But you can't read a hundred versions of every poem that you want to read. Okay? Okay. I agree. You're right. It does make me question though. The rules of engagement in a way. There are no rules. There are no rules. It's all informal. Okay? But there's jam in one of the translations and ham in the other and they're like, they're factually different foods and substances somehow like the facts of the poem shouldn't be negotiable should they? What is, what do you mean by fact? I mean, the fact about the poem is that it was written by somebody in French.

Speaker 2:          11:44          It's not in French anymore. Now, here's what Jared I think was really wondering is, uh, the mission we thought was, what was he saying? Not what do we make of what he's saying? What are the flavors of what he's saying? What are the variants of what he's saying beyond that? Like, isn't the expectation that you as a translator are giving me him? Like, hey this, this man has lost to time and now suddenly I get to experience him, but if a hundred flowers are blooming, that somehow feels like I'm not getting him at all. Obviously you're getting to the question of what is translation and Ah, can it be done? My, my feeling is that even though these translations that we've heard are all very different, they all show something about Clayman Moho Doug's basic point is that like any person is kind of a universe, they're too big to comprehend in their entirety. And so any translation of say, a poem or whatever is only going to get you a tiny piece of that person. A tiny refraction. I mean, look, we have one photograph of Fredrick Chopin

Speaker 3:          12:52          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          12:52          one photograph, and in that picture he says, ah, he scowling. What did Fredrick Chopin really look like? What was his smile? You know, you look at a photograph of Chopin and you say, oh, this is what Chopin looked like. Well, no, Chopin looked like many things. Even the very day that that photograph was taken, he had thousands of different expressions on his face. But then what about a year earlier or 10 years earlier? I mean, knowing Chopin is a very complex thing. It's not one thing. It's a millions of different things that we're United by analogy

Speaker 3:          13:30          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          13:30          into something that we refer to as one thing.

Speaker 3:          13:43          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          13:43          we should say we looked into it and there are actually two pictures of Chopin, but he's kind of scowling and both are, you can't really tell him the second one to disintegrate. No smiles.

Speaker 3:          14:04          [inaudible] [inaudible]
