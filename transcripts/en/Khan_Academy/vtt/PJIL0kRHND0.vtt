00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.596
- [Voiceover] Let's say that
f of x is equal to two x

00:00:04.596 --> 00:00:07.853
minus three, and g of x,

00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:12.849
g of x is equal to 1/2 x

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.590
plus three.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.008
What I wanna do in this video is evaluate

00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:19.405
what f of g of x is,

00:00:20.975 --> 00:00:23.528
and then I wanna evaluate
what g of f of x is.

00:00:23.528 --> 00:00:26.797
So first, I wanna evaluate f of g of x,

00:00:27.522 --> 00:00:29.188
and then I'm gonna evaluate
the other way around.

00:00:29.188 --> 00:00:30.873
I'm gonna evaluate g of f of x.

00:00:30.873 --> 00:00:32.580
But let's evaluate f of g of x first.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.734
And I, like always, encourage
you to pause the video

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:36.868
and see if you can work through it.

00:00:36.868 --> 00:00:38.596
This is going to be equal to,

00:00:38.596 --> 00:00:41.309
f of g of x is going to be equal to,

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.499
wherever we see the x in
our definition for f of x,

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:47.994
the input now is g of x, so
we'd replace it with the g of x.

00:00:47.994 --> 00:00:50.714
It's gonna be two times g of x.

00:00:51.256 --> 00:00:54.981
Two times g of x minus three.

00:00:57.555 --> 00:01:00.521
And this is going to
be equal to two times,

00:01:00.521 --> 00:01:02.756
well, g of x is all of that business,

00:01:02.756 --> 00:01:07.415
two times 1/2 x plus three,

00:01:07.998 --> 00:01:10.137
and then we have the minus three.

00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:14.160
And now we can distribute this two,

00:01:14.804 --> 00:01:19.218
two times 1/2 x is just
going to be equal to x.

00:01:19.226 --> 00:01:21.724
Two times three is going to be six.

00:01:21.724 --> 00:01:25.422
So x plus six minus three.

00:01:27.882 --> 00:01:31.688
This is going to equal x plus three.

00:01:31.695 --> 00:01:34.255
X plus three, all right, interesting.

00:01:34.255 --> 00:01:36.064
That's f of g of x.

00:01:36.064 --> 00:01:39.396
Now let's think about what
g of f of x is going to be.

00:01:39.396 --> 00:01:42.183
So g of,

00:01:42.183 --> 00:01:44.572
our input, instead of being,
instead of calling our input x,

00:01:44.576 --> 00:01:46.737
we're gonna call our input f of x.

00:01:47.014 --> 00:01:51.707
So g of f of x is going to be equal to

00:01:54.728 --> 00:01:59.728
1/2 times our input, which
in this case is f of x.

00:02:00.357 --> 00:02:03.511
1/2 time f of x plus three.

00:02:05.477 --> 00:02:08.198
You can view the x up
here as the placeholder

00:02:08.198 --> 00:02:10.373
for whatever our input happens to be.

00:02:10.373 --> 00:02:12.770
And now our input is going to be f of x.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.224
And so, this is going to
be equal to 1/2 times,

00:02:16.224 --> 00:02:17.422
what is f of x?

00:02:17.422 --> 00:02:19.533
It is two x minus three.

00:02:20.177 --> 00:02:23.570
So, two times x minus three,

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.217
and we have a plus three.

00:02:26.536 --> 00:02:27.969
And now we can distribute the 1/2.

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:31.057
1/2 times two x is going to be x.

00:02:31.057 --> 00:02:36.057
1/2 times negative three is negative 3/2s.

00:02:36.705 --> 00:02:39.590
And then we have a plus three.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.907
So let's see, three is
the same thing as 6/2s.

00:02:41.907 --> 00:02:44.934
So 6/2s minus 3/2s is going to be 3/2s.

00:02:44.934 --> 00:02:49.517
So this is going to be
equal to x plus 3/2s.

00:02:49.517 --> 00:02:52.402
So notice, we definitely
got different things

00:02:52.402 --> 00:02:54.637
for f of g of x and g of f of x.

00:02:54.637 --> 00:02:56.242
And we also didn't do a round trip.

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:58.050
We didn't go back to x.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.854
So we know that these are
not inverses of each other.

00:03:00.854 --> 00:03:03.292
In fact, we just have to
do either this or that

00:03:03.292 --> 00:03:06.055
to know that they're not
inverses of each other.

00:03:06.055 --> 00:03:07.957
These are not inverses.

00:03:07.957 --> 00:03:09.765
So we write it this way.

00:03:09.765 --> 00:03:13.502
F of x does not equal

00:03:14.772 --> 00:03:17.360
the inverse of g of x.

00:03:20.117 --> 00:03:23.019
And g of x does not equal

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.646
the inverse of f of x.

00:03:28.505 --> 00:03:30.902
In order for them to be inverses,

00:03:30.902 --> 00:03:33.869
if you have an x value right over here,

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:37.694
and if you apply g to it,
if you input it into g,

00:03:38.155 --> 00:03:40.979
and then that takes you to g of x,

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:42.869
so that takes you to g
of x right over here,

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:44.189
so that's the function g,

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:46.221
and then you apply f to it,

00:03:46.221 --> 00:03:48.456
you would have to get
back to the same place.

00:03:48.456 --> 00:03:51.971
So g inverse would get us back

00:03:51.971 --> 00:03:53.901
to the same place.

00:03:53.901 --> 00:03:55.892
And clearly, we did not
get back to the same place.

00:03:55.892 --> 00:03:58.655
We didn't get back to x, we
got back to x plus three.

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:00.037
Same thing over here.

00:04:00.037 --> 00:04:02.001
We see that we did not get,

00:04:02.001 --> 00:04:04.199
we did not go get back to x,

00:04:04.843 --> 00:04:06.956
we got to x plus 3/2s.

00:04:06.956 --> 00:04:10.152
So they're definitely not
inverses of each other.
