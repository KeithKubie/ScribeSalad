00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 this capsule we will see a new 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.890
 parent learning algorithm 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.510
 necessarily passive the sentry box 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.240
 adaptive dynamic programming then 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.370
 previously we saw an algorithm 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.609
 learning by necessarily passive who 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.810
 is the direct estimate 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.400
 it's an approach that makes it similar 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.050
 at from service learning this is to 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.119
 to say that we will learn from 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:31.410
 fathers who are an entry his vow he 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.500
 is acquired visit s is then from his 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.809
 the target for each pass that goes 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.590
 to be the weighted sum of rewards to 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.250
 from s 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:45.270
 so when we estimate among others kelly 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.670
 the value for state 1 2 but we had 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.449
 a first father who said that if I 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.489
 starts at the state 1 2 youn and c where i have 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.230
 possibly arrive in value of 0.76 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.449
 there is another test that was the same 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.160
 but it's actually where we rather 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.070
 observed that from state 1,2 and 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.140
 possibly the sum of the rewards 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.600
 and that I observed up to a state 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.600
 terminal was 0.84 and finally 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.939
 I had another one where I still had 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.610
 once 0.76 who was my second 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.400
 test threat only if my learning 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.700
 father music corresponded to for a 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.950
 entry that state 1,2 to see in my 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.490
 historical death what are the states 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.680
 who when did I visit the state 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.960
 1 2 what is the sum of the rewards 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.170
 associated to a terminal then to 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.450
 just average everyone and 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.829
 all these values â€‹â€‹there so what's that 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.329
 it's a bit like a shape 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.710
 learning super user but so dense 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.180
 that if the targets were obtained at 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.399
 from tests so simulation by 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.860
 against direct destination will ignore the 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.409
 recursive relationship between values 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.799
 for different states for example the 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.920
 recursive relationship between the value at 1 1 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.750
 and the front bar 1 2 actually we have 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.050
 as definition value that baroness 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.280
 state is related to the value in 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.010
 others and you have premium 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.310
 and weighted according to actually the policy of 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.709
 do a tradition of svs premium if I 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:25.450
 here is the action then hesse 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:27.450
 according to my policy so for example in 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.850
 our essay 1 we saw earlier 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.980
 his did not say ended up on state 3 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.420
 If, on the other hand, 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.130
 thing was information by 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:41.800
 report to state 3 3 that was visited 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.290
 but in fact we could have inferred that 3 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.750
 2 real good anyway 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.340
 pretty fast since 3 2 and adjacent to 3 3 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.410
 and 6 years too much we observed a 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:57.550
 transition of possibly 3.3 a 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.989
 tradition in fact from 3.2 to 3 3 on 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.360
 should be able to use that for 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.120
 use the information so the tests 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:09.760
 where I visited 3 3 to influence my 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:11.470
 estimate of the value in 3 2 so if 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.580
 what the second approach we're going 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.280
 see for learning but 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.900
 passive reinforcement offered this 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.570
 approach it and call programming 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.940
 adaptive dynamics and go it's from 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.540
 take advantage of the recursive equations 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.660
 between the different values â€‹â€‹of v2 is 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.610
 so the approached by programming 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.470
 adaptive dynamics that I note their 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.250
 pda 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.070
 so that's the acronym I'm going to use 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.470
 so the close relative pda does not learn 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.459
 directly stop function actually 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.970
 what we're going to do is we're going 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.980
 learn a transition model to 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.630
 from the model stalking transition on 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.100
 will use our equations that 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.410
 define our recursive equations 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:58.060
 antivaleurs to infer what is the 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.489
 value of monclin involved by this 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.640
 transition model 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.959
 actually if I have an estimate of 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.239
 world and Belgian attraction can 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.680
 solve these equations here so that's 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.750
 among others, a problem that is solved 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.370
 when we do 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.980
 the algorithm of the iteration by 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.040
 political in each of the three 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.290
 deliberations and ordered on a 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.350
 given policy is my model of 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.350
 transition I have to calculate the value of 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.500
 this plan then we have a way if we 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.890
 gives tensile model to estimate the 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:36.040
 associated value and the idea is actually 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.360
 that in apprenticeship by pda in fact this 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.210
 what we will do is 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.350
 constantly refined our model but at 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.419
 any time 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.220
 our transition model is going to us 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.800
 to obtain an estimate of 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.120
 parents and to estimate our model of 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.160
 traction what are we going to do is 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.230
 use the frequencies of the transitions 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.640
 which are observed in the tests this to 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.200
 to say that our estimate of the 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.140
 probability that if I went you have 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.180
 and that I do the action given by my 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.490
 political that I make a transition 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.740
 to a new author's premium but I 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.900
 I'm going to estimate it as just the 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.520
 sum of frequencies including the number of 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.430
 time that I passed from the state is this l 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.080
 state of prime for each of my tests 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.720
 I'm going to sum up for all 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.070
 tests and finally I'm going normalized 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.400
 to have an instruction who are at 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.320
 1 in just the frequencies 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.310
 for each of the tests the number of times 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.660
 that I reached my state is this so the 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.660
 name is not that I visited the torres 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:35.130
 in in all my and it's finally 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.130
 doing we are mostly testing 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:43.270
 I give here the solo code that is available 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.320
 in the book rasouli norvig I'm not going 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.880
 go into all the details I want 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.710
 give an example that is going to be maybe 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.510
 a little more illustrative the for good 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.070
 understand the algorithm but the idea 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.530
 it's that our agent every time he 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.900
 there is a percept called here that 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.300
 basically corresponds to the state in 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:01.300
 which I come to transition s premium 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.400
 is also what is my signal from 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.410
 reinforcement that I got 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.540
 we also ask ourselves here that the agent a 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.150
 internal memory of what was the state 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.710
 before or where I was and what 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.080
 is the action I would have done in this 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:17.260
 state there so my algorithms and it's this 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.120
 who will do is that if I were to have 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.380
 a state so and it's not us it's up to 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.289
 to say that I'm not at the very beginning of a 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.930
 try i'm going 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:27.599
 clement the number of times I've been 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.460
 enough such rates and that I have done 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:30.990
 the action ok the previous action 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.050
 then I'm going to increment the number as well 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.270
 of times that for action to when I 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.800
 found myself at leicester sg transition 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.300
 to the state expresses if what I come 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.159
 observed a charcoal to observe that when 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.839
 I was in the state is what I did 

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:44.759
 the action at I arrived at the state 

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:46.849
 mind I'm going to increment the number of 

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:49.649
 once I observed this event there 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:51.719
 and from these conclusions but I 

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:54.270
 can now summarize my model of 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:56.999
 transition with my new accounts 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:07:00.180
 updated 2 the number of times I 

00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:03.569
 went from shouting to you 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:05.729
 left from htc knows it value 

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:08.520
 for which justin mapp reality of 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:09.449
 transition / standardization constant 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.680
 that the number of times that I have 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:13.919
 found the state is what I did 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.330
 reaction to this be from this model 

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:19.080
 I'm going to use the grid 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:21.959
 of policy evaluation with my 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.629
 currently estimated transition model 

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:27.289
 so this actually corresponds to 

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:31.289
 solve the system of equations 

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:33.559
 recursive for my function dallas and 

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:37.439
 and finally if I'm a state 

00:07:33.559 --> 00:07:39.419
 bep terminal I will reset the 

00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:41.219
 previous volumes the previous action to 

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:42.629
 null pointers then otherwise but I 

00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:44.669
 will remind me that now to do 

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:46.830
 since my state is my state of mind 

00:07:44.669 --> 00:07:49.469
 even then my action to it is the action that 

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:51.389
 was specified by my policy so 

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:53.909
 the action actually that my agent is going 

00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:56.639
 take it's going to be the action dictated by 

00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:57.330
 my policy worse that puts specific 

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:59.459
 because I'm learning 

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:04.139
 easy so someone you specify the 

00:07:59.459 --> 00:08:07.669
 political what are we going to do as an example 

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:11.369
 to clarify all that imagine 

00:08:07.669 --> 00:08:16.139
 the following environment at g3 and as0 s1 

00:08:11.369 --> 00:08:21.269
 s2 I have a reinforcement function of - 0 

00:08:16.139 --> 00:08:23.969
 point to 0 - 0 point 1 es1 es2 factors 

00:08:21.269 --> 00:08:27.029
 destiny of 0.5 which is determined way 

00:08:23.969 --> 00:08:33.269
 arbitration could have chosen I could have 

00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:34.700
 choose one in this case and g1 and in 

00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:35.990
 this case what is different 

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.030
 we notice that it's quite similar 

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.190
 for a previous example when we have 

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:41.570
 talked about terrasson by fleeing bullet to 

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.970
 his political father 

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:46.250
 in this case too it will actually last 

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:48.020
 to be a terminal state 

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.760
 if i reach s2 i do more than 

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.480
 transition to other states the test 

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.990
 will determine 

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.730
 and then the initial state is 1 0 and the 

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:58.790
 politics i'm on tahiti to 

00:08:55.730 --> 00:09:03.310
 louhans s 0 selection to 1 and s complete 

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:06.290
 action at 3 so here the action smells 

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:07.760
 of alphonse that's not going to interest me 

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:11.110
 my father's perspective of learning 

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:14.110
 same thing for action 

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:17.800
 I find the action on2 here in fact I 

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:19.510
 will never take it in s1 11.0 I 

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.950
 always take action is so I 

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:28.540
 always a part of 0.12 to stay at 

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:30.160
 0 and a 0.82 chance part and will be the 

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:32.339
 time noticed that we do the game you 

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.709
 gives what's the environment but 

00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:37.450
 in the perspective of my agent actually 

00:09:35.709 --> 00:09:39.310
 I know there I do not know these 

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:43.149
 qualities there all that does observe 

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:45.550
 that observe a certain tradition 

00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:49.019
 this transition there in fact she was 

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:49.019
 champion and according to his probabilities 

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:53.680
 so initially we will assume that they 

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.690
 have no connection between floors and 

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.700
 observed no transition so this is a 

00:09:55.690 --> 00:10:00.339
 as if from the point of view of the agent 

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:03.399
 all states were states 

00:10:00.339 --> 00:10:06.700
 terminals and that means that in fact 

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:09.430
 the value in s 0 it's going to be the 

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:12.160
 reward at 0 which is less 0.1 

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:17.649
 same thing for s1 ps2 it's going to be the 

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:19.540
 reward of 2 which is from the following of 

00:10:17.649 --> 00:10:22.000
 its magic not that their agent between 

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:25.390
 in the simulation and then from scratch 

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.529
 following the policy returns to s 0 and 

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:29.140
 then it means that for the moment 

00:10:26.529 --> 00:10:33.579
 since I observed what from 

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:36.420
 0h price reaches 0 and so from that 

00:10:33.579 --> 00:10:39.370
 in fact what it implies 

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:42.160
 what it implies is that according to my 

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:44.890
 agent the transition model is that 

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.810
 if I'm politics from scratch 

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:49.120
 the policy of att 1-0 and 2-1 

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:51.519
 the Latin part and other states and 2 0 

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:59.320
 so that gives me this new system 

00:10:51.519 --> 00:11:01.690
 of equations here it is I am disappointed 

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:04.480
 imagine that he is observing a new 

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:06.040
 transition this time 2 0 has a 

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.560
 lure now my model of 

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.860
 transition from scratch and set to 

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.920
 day 

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:13.720
 I once observed that I stayed 

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.730
 to 0 once I passed is this 

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.990
 so that means that according to my model 

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:20.470
 transition estimated 

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:22.360
 I have a quality of 0.5 to stay at 0 and 

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:24.160
 20.5 to stay ace 

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.700
 so my system of equations for the 

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.820
 values 

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:29.260
 the summer basically updated my 

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.780
 transition model was updated 

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:33.130
 only for the transition from 

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:37.540
 zero so that's just this equation 

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:38.770
 succeeded that you update I'm doing a 

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.690
 other action 

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:42.370
 according to my policy from 

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:44.440
 now I observe that part of 

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:46.480
 the addition I make a voltage as0 so 

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.920
 now for my equation for 

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.010
 the marine pageantry 

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:54.370
 I have a relationship between these rights are 

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:56.380
 there and the value to zero and my model of 

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:57.580
 transition for the moment cross that to 

00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.250
 from the rushes can only do 

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:02.470
 a transition from eze to go to 

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:05.890
 and I can not make a transition to 

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:08.560
 others and from scratch 

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:12.160
 now my try but my wife that 

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:14.740
 I went from 16 0 I went back to 

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.750
 s1 which makes that now I have observed 

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.740
 that twice in three I went from 

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:21.010
 zero to st 

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:22.480
 once on 3ds 0 I stayed at 0 

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:25.060
 so now as he is from 

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:27.640
 tradition tell me that the value zero that 

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:29.680
 their head moment necessarily bigger 

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:34.960
 second time factor holds the 

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:37.360
 bar eur10 two thirds the value s is 

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:39.520
 finally I arrive n 1 and finished at 

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:42.850
 from the rushes a grip as two 

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:45.370
 so that's what's observed in this 

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:46.690
 simulation there and so I was leaving from 

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:46.960
 transition that tells me that from rs 

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.180
 1 

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.430
 I have one enjoy a half finish 

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:54.250
 ace lasts half an hour 

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:56.530
 go back to 0 and that's reflected if in 

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:58.180
 my system of equations so after we 

00:12:56.530 --> 00:13:01.780
 does this test the poster one could 

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:05.680
 estimate values â€‹â€‹for this policy 

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:09.460
 there that I followed as0 ses-2 simply 

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:10.660
 by solving this system of equations and 

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:13.330
 that's how programming is 

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:16.060
 unique adaptive works to estimate 

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.620
 are worth them now in fact 

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.480
 that at any time I had a system 

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:23.320
 of equations that I could have tried to 

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:25.090
 solve hockey is so in fact even in 

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.970
 middle of one and dry to estimate 

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:29.980
 given values â€‹â€‹and so I have not 

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:32.160
 need to finish a test to get 

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:34.560
 an estimation 

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.690
 updated new estimate of my 

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:39.120
 values â€‹â€‹contrary to estimates 

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:41.069
 direct who she to update my 

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.690
 values â€‹â€‹if I do a new try it 

00:13:41.069 --> 00:13:44.250
 must I complete leave in full 

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:47.670
 so that's a property of the 

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:50.329
 adaptive dynamic conversion which 

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:53.850
 could happen though is that 

00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:57.660
 for if I do not have a constant anymore 

00:13:53.850 --> 00:14:02.250
 small as 1 simon system my estimate 

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:05.100
 of the transition distribution is not 

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:06.930
 very well estimated it could be that my 

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.670
 system be not reversed and that's 

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:10.860
 so one of the reasons we 

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:12.930
 may still be able to have 

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:16.620
 a second factor that is more 

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:18.240
 small that the association I wish 

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.529
 just to mention here but it's 

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.720
 not something that was playing 

00:14:19.529 --> 00:14:23.279
 many insisted so one of the ways of 

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.709
 solve this problem there in fact it's 

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:28.019
 basically to always have their 

00:14:25.709 --> 00:14:31.350
 little thomas small 1 

00:14:28.019 --> 00:14:33.389
 but know that we do if we have a 

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:35.009
 transition system that is such 

00:14:33.389 --> 00:14:36.839
 that there is always a probability to 

00:14:35.009 --> 00:14:40.670
 from any state of 

00:14:36.839 --> 00:14:42.689
 to surrender to a state 

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:44.970
 terminally in this case we would not have 

00:14:42.689 --> 00:14:46.759
 need to have a second factor 

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:50.009
 which is strictly smaller than 

00:14:46.759 --> 00:14:52.259
 but if at any given time we actually 

00:14:50.009 --> 00:14:54.120
 benefits and we do not have precisely 

00:14:52.259 --> 00:14:56.220
 enjoy not we to go from 

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:59.279
 any state to an end state 

00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:02.279
 according to the system estimated at a time 

00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:04.050
 given that it may be that a problem that 

00:15:02.279 --> 00:15:05.850
 conceive not able to reverse this 

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:08.339
 system of equations and so it's just 

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:11.930
 a slight difficulty when we can 

00:15:08.339 --> 00:15:11.930
 meet that I wish in Zionism 

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:19.880
 so we've already seen when we saw it 

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.899
 iteration grid by policy if I 

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:24.870
 transition model 

00:15:21.899 --> 00:15:27.899
 I can solve the system of equations 

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:29.759
 recursive between values â€‹â€‹in different 

00:15:27.899 --> 00:15:31.949
 states so I can do it a thousand and 

00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:34.980
 in this form the sib is equal to aix 

00:15:31.949 --> 00:15:38.089
 then simply inverted system nor 

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:40.380
 payment is reinstated xb to get 

00:15:38.089 --> 00:15:42.509
 my values â€‹â€‹that will match 

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.050
 excessive variable against this 

00:15:42.509 --> 00:15:45.320
 sinister 

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:50.240
 it's an expensive operation 

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:54.230
 she is up to both statesmen so 

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:55.190
 the cardinal tds at 3 and so that's 

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.870
 something that is very expensive if 

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:58.190
 we really have a lot of toasts that 

00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:02.960
 is often known in the 

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:04.310
 relatively complex problems so if 

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.930
 we had to reverse systems of equations 

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:08.990
 after each observation 

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:10.700
 it could be problematic a 

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:12.710
 approximation that can be done 

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:14.330
 similar to what we do down there 

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:18.080
 liutauras china actually used 

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:20.210
 an iterative method to estimate but 

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.040
 so that's what I can do 

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:26.030
 son is initialized my vector of 

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:28.790
 values â€‹â€‹life here at any values 

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:31.610
 for example I could the the estimated 

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:34.820
 the initial 0 and there I can interest 

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:35.420
 between updating from the right to the 

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:39.890
 left 

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:41.060
 my vector of life values â€‹â€‹with the term 

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:43.160
 of law in my system of equations 

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:45.530
 then to do this until I have 

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.090
 reached until values â€‹â€‹only 

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:51.860
 not change besides the changes are 

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:54.440
 smaller than a certain outcry so 

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:57.140
 in fact what we observe here is the 

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.970
 same algorithm as in the group 

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.890
 of iterations by values â€‹â€‹there it's 

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:03.710
 different is that here I do not have a max 

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:05.630
 on the shares because I have a 

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:07.459
 policy that I must follow so I 

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:08.660
 not to change the action I take in 

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:12.939
 different actions here I have a 

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:14.810
 policy then that I have to follow so 

00:17:12.939 --> 00:17:20.060
 so that's why we could use 

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:22.130
 this iterative method putting it site 

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:25.280
 now if I roll them if I 

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:26.120
 runs from a value of 0 to 

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.120
 are not necessarily more effective 

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:32.720
 than to pour the system of equations by 

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:34.610
 against if I have a good initial value 

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:37.130
 it may be that I was converging in 

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:40.040
 more rations and actually imaginons 

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:41.690
 I already have before 

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.549
 try again 

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:44.450
 a first estimate of vedes I 

00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:49.190
 could use it as a 

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:52.009
 initialization to get my ma 

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:55.129
 new estimate of the value for 

00:17:52.009 --> 00:17:57.409
 my dish so finally the tution too 

00:17:55.129 --> 00:17:59.059
 it's just observing a single transition 

00:17:57.409 --> 00:18:01.309
 to clean that interest premium know 

00:17:59.059 --> 00:18:03.019
 very little impact on my new 

00:18:01.309 --> 00:18:05.059
 estimating my transition model 

00:18:03.019 --> 00:18:08.179
 so very little impact on what should 

00:18:05.059 --> 00:18:11.240
 to be the new value for my dish and 

00:18:08.179 --> 00:18:14.690
 so an interactive approach more 

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:17.210
 the initialization of the mont tables of 

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:20.059
 value v from the estimated value 

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:22.039
 previously could converge very 

00:18:20.059 --> 00:18:23.480
 quickly so this is possibly a 

00:18:22.039 --> 00:18:28.759
 approach can be more effective 

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:30.529
 but in practice there are others 

00:18:28.759 --> 00:18:31.700
 explorations that exist that I 

00:18:30.529 --> 00:18:33.559
 mention very quickly here we 

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:35.899
 could just terminals and the 

00:18:33.559 --> 00:18:37.159
 number of iterations so tell me to 

00:18:35.899 --> 00:18:40.340
 Whenever I steaming my 

00:18:37.159 --> 00:18:41.509
 values â€‹â€‹my values â€‹â€‹for my plan to 

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:44.629
 from my transition model 

00:18:41.509 --> 00:18:46.970
 esteemed I simply want to donate without 

00:18:44.629 --> 00:18:48.590
 leave rations and I will not do more 

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:50.419
 so that at the beginning my values â€‹â€‹are 

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:52.070
 not very well estimate but if I 

00:18:50.419 --> 00:18:54.259
 repeat several times after each 

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:56.929
 observation then reducing but 

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:59.539
 previously estimated value as 

00:18:56.929 --> 00:19:01.820
 initialization after each observation 

00:18:59.539 --> 00:19:04.159
 it could possibly converge 

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:07.299
 to good estimates also exists 

00:19:04.159 --> 00:19:10.850
 sweeping procedures I refused to 

00:19:07.299 --> 00:19:13.120
 english plater sweeping where are we going 

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:16.669
 keep track of how much 

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:18.559
 but my value to different states to 

00:19:16.669 --> 00:19:21.529
 tendency to load one will prioritize 

00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:24.379
 to update some states that have 

00:19:21.529 --> 00:19:26.990
 big values â€‹â€‹of two modifications 

00:19:24.379 --> 00:19:28.789
 so of grace for the communes on 

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:30.980
 big changes in value for 

00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:32.659
 his states so I invite you to 

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:36.200
 consult the nails learn more 

00:19:32.659 --> 00:19:39.769
 on it but this type of modification 

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:42.769
 so has it an iterative method that a 

00:19:39.769 --> 00:19:46.610
 use the last estimated value 

00:19:42.769 --> 00:19:49.279
 is the kind of br i refused who 

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:50.809
 described here it's the kind of things 

00:19:49.279 --> 00:19:53.090
 what to do if we are able to 

00:19:50.809 --> 00:19:54.640
 solve problems or the space of 

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:56.080
 states is much bigger 

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.150
 so that's good stuff to know for 

00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:01.710
 apply in practice an algorithm of 

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:01.710
 adaptive dynamic programming 

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:07.060
 unlike direct destination the 

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.590
 close relative pda can learn 

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:10.090
 after each observation as I have 

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:11.590
 mentioned previously do not need 

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:16.780
 to wait for the end of an essay to 

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:19.240
 get an estimate of the values â€‹â€‹and 

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.890
 I would add that sometimes doing it is 

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:23.920
 possible that the reward function 

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:26.080
 not specified a priori so we get 

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:28.210
 pose is we knew what is the 

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:30.280
 rewards reward function for all 

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:31.450
 the possible states we used in 

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:33.280
 the definition of our system 

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:37.380
 of equations but it may be that it is 

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:42.010
 also something that is observed by 

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:43.840
 by our agenda the environment so 

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:45.940
 in this case also in fact what we're going 

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:48.370
 to do is we will also estimate 

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:50.320
 this reinforcement function there it's 

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:52.120
 to say that at the second initial flight i 0 and 

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.620
 would be a very simple estimate 

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:57.130
 as soon as we reach nonito 

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:58.570
 will we replace the zero with the 

00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:00.370
 reinforcement that is observed 

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:01.990
 we want to use that we will now 

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:03.220
 finally know for this state there 

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:04.210
 that sound reinforcement 

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:07.660
 it is the reinforcement that we will use 

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:09.130
 in our system of equations in 

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:11.380
 the agglo deserves that we saw previously 

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.030
 all that implies is that at 

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.770
 very early 

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:19.450
 if the state in which I find myself 

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:22.450
 currently expresses and new well I 

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:25.320
 actually going to take my chart that 

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:28.720
 contain the value of reinforcements 

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:30.760
 and thrown a chair at 0 and now I 

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.190
 will assign it to the air reinforcement 

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:35.140
 bonus so that is part of my father 

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:39.990
 his silos that is part of my 

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:39.990
 observation at the current moment
