[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.445 --> 00:00:03.695
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.630
RETO MEIER: Or you can post your
thoughts in the G+ event

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.150
or the YouTube comments.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.921
And producer Dan is going to
read those out for you, if you

00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:32.490
are too shy to join us live
on the telly box.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.570
While we give folks a chance to
get their thoughts together

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.390
and join us on the Hangouts,
I'm going to cover a few

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.670
points that have already been
raised by some of the

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.150
developer audience on
the Google+ page.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.350
Those of you who have joined us
on the Hangout, thank you

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.330
for joining us.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.750
We'll get Daniel in touch with
you via text on that, so that

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.630
we can queue you up
and get you ready

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.430
to share your thoughts.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.650
So

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.890
DAN: Sorry about that.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.240
I cut out the first 10 seconds
of your intro, the welcome,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.915
and if you're watching
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:06.540
and all that stuff.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.210
Sorry about that.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.640
RETO MEIER: That's all right.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.790
Not a problem.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.620
Just so everyone knows, this is
After the Table Flip, talk

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.600
radio style, chance for everyone
to tell me how right

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.720
I was, or how wrong I was.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.400
I somehow suspect we'll
get more of the

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.530
latter than the former.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.700
Just because, if you agree then
there's not a lot to say.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.570
So we're going to get some
folks on Hangout as well.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.770
I'm going to start off by
answering some of the

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.280
questions from people on
the G+ event and the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.520
YouTube live streams.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.700
So if you do have questions and
you prefer not to be on

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.820
video, do throw them in there.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.890
And producer Dan will respond
on your behalf.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.900
So on G+, developer Jacob
[? Nordfolk ?]

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.540
represented probably the most
common argument against what I

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.910
was presenting in today's
table flip.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.470
And that is, that there's a
lot of user pressure or

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.710
dissatisfaction.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.360
Because users, quote, "don't
know how to quit the program."

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.090
And I think I covered
the argument

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.740
against that pretty well.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.110
But let's be a little bit more
specific in two examples.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.240
So in Jacob's case, he's talking
about two internet

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.930
radio apps that he has built.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.730
And in his experience, users
have failed to find the Stop

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.280
button to stop the music.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.630
Now he's pointed out that in his
particular use case, he's

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.810
not allowed to make the Stop
button more prominent.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.290
And so this is a genuine
problem.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.530
So what I would say is, have a
look at the way that Google

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.460
music actually solves this.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.010
And so really it's about
making sure that Stop--

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.260
stopping the music, stopping
the resource consumption--

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.840
is really, really
easy to find.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.940
So Google music does this by
having the Stop controls along

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.850
the bottom of every activity,
whenever the app is running.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.770
Or if the app isn't running but
the music is playing, then

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.410
there's an ongoing notification,
which has rich

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.100
notifications.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.860
Which again allows you
to stop the music.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.560
And in addition to that, there's
also the lock screen,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.270
which you can then configure--
and which Google music does--

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.670
to allow you to stop
playback as well.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.290
And so the solution here,
particularly for music playing

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.950
apps, is that all of those
things I've just described are

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.950
totally available to any
third-party app.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.210
And so by doing things like
this, it makes it really,

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.920
really easy.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.510
Even if the Stop button doesn't
have to be half the

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.330
screen, it's just everywhere
they look there's a really

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.530
obvious place to find it.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.715
And that's going to be much more
reliable than having an

00:03:11.715 --> 00:03:13.570
Exit button, which a
lot of users aren't

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.030
going to find anyway.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.400
User demands for an Exit button
almost always correlate

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.890
to an app that has confusing
navigation, or hard to find

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.430
controls, or is a
resource hog.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.150
So adding an Exit button is
going to stop users from

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.930
asking you to add
an Exit button.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.370
But it's kind of like giving
an aspirin to a patient

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.120
complaining of chronic
abdominal pains.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.880
They will stop asking
for the painkillers.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.660
But that doesn't actually get
rid of their problem.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.280
So you're better off trying to
treat the underlying cause

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.850
rather than the symptom.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.170
And similarly, Daniel [? Drew ?]
asks, how would you

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.560
implement the browser featured
of ditching all cookies on

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.390
exit, if you don't have
an Exit button?

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.680
And that's actually a really
good question.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.390
In practice I think there's an
assumption that mobile devices

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.780
are inherently more personal
than computers.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.310
So privacy features like
the removal of

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.740
cookies when you exit--

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.450
which were really designed
around ensuring the

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.440
credentials used by different
users on the same computer--

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.780
don't leak, when your wife,
girlfriend, husband, whoever,

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.490
uses your computer.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.455
So those sorts of features
aren't quite as important for

00:04:14.455 --> 00:04:17.329
a phone, with the implicit
assumption is that there's

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.029
only going to be one
person using it.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.180
And in fact, it even almost goes
the other way, where the

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.710
pain associated with having to
put in your credentials or

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.840
into the same information
multiple times, is actually

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.890
significantly more annoying
on a phone

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:31.730
than it is on a computer.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.670
So there's even more reason to
hang on to some of this stuff.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.850
So that said, if you did want to
do something like that, the

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.440
suggestion I would have is
probably to have a menu

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.540
option, probably a settings
option to clear all cookies.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.230
Or better still, maybe a menu
item, which says something

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.100
like "close all windows and
clear all cookies." Or it just

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.370
says "close all windows and
clear all cookies" is one of

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.500
the option that you have.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.480
So that's answer to two
of those questions.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.830
What should we go
to next, Dan?

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.910
Have we got folks on the Hangout
which would like to

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.030
vent their spleen?

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.610
DAN: We don't have
anyone explicitly

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.140
asking for time on camera.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.500
But if any of you guys in the
Hangout right now want to

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.170
comment, we can definitely
put you air.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.650
So just let us now.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.760
RETO MEIER: I think we should
put people on the spot.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.560
If they're joining the Hangout,
we're going to assume

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.430
that they've got something
to say.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.130
So pick someone who looks like
they're enjoying themselves.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.370
The guy in the red shirt.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.450
Let's pop him online and
see what he's got to

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.410
share with us all.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.930
DAN: All right.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:36.120
The guy in the red shirt would
be Jay [? McGill. ?]

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.002
I'm not going to say
his whole name.

00:05:38.002 --> 00:05:39.240
RETO MEIER: He can introduce
himself.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.520
You want to pop him
up on the screen.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.580
And let him know.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.120
And unmute him.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.370
Because I suspect he's muted.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.540
DAN: All right.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.790
RETO MEIER: I think
he's still muted.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.420
DAN: Hey, how are you doing?

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.260
Can you hear us?

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.120
RETO MEIER: We can't hear him.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.290
Have you got

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:02.400
DAN: Here we go.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.530
RETO MEIER: Now we
can hear you.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.890
So what do you think?

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:05.860
Am I full of it?

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.991
Or am onto something?

00:06:07.991 --> 00:06:09.860
AUDIENCE: You're absolutely
right.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.340
And I was curious if there
are any other options?

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.080
I mean, are there people that
think that the Exit button

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.310
makes any sense?

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.042
RETO MEIER: There are.

00:06:20.042 --> 00:06:22.580
There are a surprisingly large
number people which disagree

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.170
with the basic premise.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.770
I think it's usually
around users.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.480
That seems to be the feedback I
get from most developers, is

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.050
that they're like, yeah,
we don't want to do it.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.985
But our users keep
asking for them.

00:06:31.985 --> 00:06:36.920
And so I think a big part of
it is trying to explain.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.340
And a lot of the time
what they're saying

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.280
is, well that's fine.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.490
But you need to explain to users
why they don't need an

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:42.710
Exit button.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.790
But what I've actually found is
that it's easier to explain

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.290
to developers how to build apps
that people aren't asking

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:48.930
for those Exit buttons.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.570
That kind of tends to be
the most common thing.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:51.870
They're like, I didn't
want to do it.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.190
But people kept asking for it,
so I had to build it in.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.950
So it's really about trying to
explain to devs how you can

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.440
build apps which don't have
people asking those questions.

00:07:03.534 --> 00:07:08.006
AUDIENCE: In the end, if the
client does ask for it--

00:07:08.006 --> 00:07:08.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.720
AUDIENCE: They're
paying for it.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.550
They get it.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.650
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.380
Of course, I guess that's the
other case which I haven't

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.710
really talked much about is,
what happens when you're

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.070
building an app for someone.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.950
And they say, we want
an Exit button.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.360
Well, you have to do what
the client says.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.530
But really it's about trying to
create an atmosphere where

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.540
people feel comfortable at least
telling their clients

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.290
that, this is an anti-pattern.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.290
This is not what Android users
are going to expect.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.660
And being able to say that
with some authority.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.210
And that's a big part of what
the design guidelines on

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.650
developeratandroid.com/design
are really about, is helping

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.980
to create sort of an expectation
of, this is what

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:48.870
Android apps are.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:52.100
So if you're asking for
something different, then it's

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.710
counter to what people
are expecting.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.290
I think there's a lot of
background which we have to

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.970
get past, of people being used
to old feature phone J2ME

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.630
apps, which have
an Exit button.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.320
Because they were sort
of single tasking.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.760
Or even iPhone, which uses a
slightly different model for

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.820
the way that they do things.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.250
And so a lot of it is education,
both the developers

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.900
and users, and clients,
which seem to

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.455
somehow fit in between.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.250
DAN: Anyone else
on the Hangout?

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.540
I'm going to put you guys on
the spot and just select

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:29.790
someone at random if
no one volunteers.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.150
AUDIENCE: I just want to jump
in real quick before I

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.309
have to head out.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:36.253
RETO MEIER: Hi Ryan.

00:08:36.253 --> 00:08:37.200
AUDIENCE How're you doing?

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.450
RETO MEIER: Good mate.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:43.320
DAN: All right, Ryan.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.080
Go ahead.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:44.760
You're live.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.020
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.750
So I just want to agree with
Reto with the whole activity

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.070
life cycle thing.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:55.680
A lot of people say that you
need that Exit button to exit

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.030
that app and get it
out of their mind.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.240
I guess a lot of people probably
just don't fully

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.740
understand that life cycle,
where it goes in the

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.640
background, stays in the
background for a little bit.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.100
You have to adjust for that
whole life cycle pattern of

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.160
going through on Pause, and then
on Stop, and making sure

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.340
you clear up the things that
you're appropriately doing

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.890
with your app in those
life cycles.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.350
RETO MEIER: Yeah, I think
the life cycle stuff--

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.100
it's kind of the most

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.580
fundamental thing about Android.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.320
Which makes it really different
to anything I've

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.100
ever done before.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.070
I was a Windows programmer
before Android.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.050
You're not really thinking in
those sorts of terms, of the

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:31.750
OS telling you what's happening
to your app.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.830
You capture some of those
things, like on-form leave,

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:35.420
and on-control focus
and stuff.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:39.030
But it's never to control
your resource usage.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.650
It's just to decide
whether your app

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:41.945
should be doing something.

00:09:41.945 --> 00:09:44.630
And I always think that's kind
of the big challenge.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.350
Once you really get the life
cycle stuff in your head,

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:49.150
everything else just
kind of makes

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:50.590
sense and kind of follows.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.405
Is that similar to
your experience?

00:09:53.405 --> 00:09:54.400
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.250
I definitely agree
in that aspect.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.600
A lot of people probably
just don't see that.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.130
Us being developers, you
know that life cycle.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.370
You know it's happening in
the background, what

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.380
is supposed to happen.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.380
Maybe the users just don't
see that, right?

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.290
In the foreground of, oh there's
a life cycle going on

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:13.550
and this is what needs
to happen.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.070
And so maybe they're
feeling like there

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:17.060
should be an Exit button.

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.140
When in reality, you really
don't need one.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.410
So you're definitely
not crazy.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:23.330
I see where you're
coming from.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:24.330
So I just wanted to
let you know that.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:24.920
RETO MEIER: Cool, thanks Ryan.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.520
I appreciate that.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:27.870
All right.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:28.220
Cool.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.250
Do we have any other questions
on either the Livestream or on

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.400
G+ or YouTube?

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.300
Oh someone's got his
hand up in the--

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:37.570
DAN: All right, yeah.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:38.160
Let's put him on.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.642
This is Dave.

00:10:39.642 --> 00:10:40.940
RETO MEIER: Hey Dave.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:41.577
DAN: Go ahead, Dave.

00:10:41.577 --> 00:10:42.391
You're live.

00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:45.410
AUDIENCE: Yeah I just want a
quick comment about what the

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:47.950
previous speaker said.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.140
I think it's going to take a
little while for people to get

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.350
used to that.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:54.230
I think we're so--

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:57.670
even a few years ago, or a
couple years ago maybe with

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.240
Vista or something like that--

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:03.280
we're so used to closing down
stuff and making sure RAM is

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.940
available and all that stuff.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:08.676
That we need to really get used
to knowing that if an app

00:11:08.676 --> 00:11:12.190
is done properly, sitting in the
background, not consuming

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:15.410
resources, not pinging the
server and so on and so forth.

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:18.280
I think that's really going to
take a couple of years before

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.760
people understand and are
aware of that, and are

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.020
comfortable just leaving apps
open just by hitting the Back

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.585
button and back to
the home screen.

00:11:25.585 --> 00:11:26.450
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.230
I think there's a big challenge
there for us as

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:29.180
developers as well.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.700
It's making sure that
users feel really

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:32.660
comfortable doing that.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.220
And this is the thing, if you
have a whole bunch of apps,

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.130
and then you go back to the home
screen and your device

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.400
starts running real slow, that's
a terrible experience.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.595
It's no wonder users are going
to be like, I just want to

00:11:42.595 --> 00:11:45.280
know how to exit all
of these apps.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.020
And so I think the framework
team here at Google have done

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.360
a lot of work in that direction,
to try and make the

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.620
blame more visible.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.090
So things like battery drain
and those sorts of things--

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.540
you can see which apps
are doing it.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.880
And so the blame goes to them,
rather than to the system.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.720
And if you're doing these
things right-- if you're

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.720
suspending all of your
listeners, turning off your

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.600
updates, not doing background
refreshes

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.730
or any of that stuff--

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:09.780
then your app will never get
blamed for anything.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.700
And no one's ever going to call
into question as to, how

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.510
can I get rid of this.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:15.370
Because it's just there.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.070
And it just works.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:17.410
But yeah.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.755
I think that's the challenge.

00:12:18.755 --> 00:12:21.060
You've got reach that critical
mass where most apps are doing

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:21.640
the right thing.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.030
And then users are going to be
like, why would I exit it?

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.645
That's just going to
slow stuff down.

00:12:27.645 --> 00:12:30.380
AUDIENCE: Mm hmm.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:31.800
DAN: Cool.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:39.070
So Ali, hey, I notice that you
have a question in the chat?

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:41.030
Do you want to ask Reto live?

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.280
You're on air.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.520
AUDIENCE: I just asked
what I could do--

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.460
I'm actually just starting to
start to develop and whatnot.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.630
So I want to know, are there
any resources that you can

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.670
actually provide, or that
Google provides, about

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:01.550
learning more about
the life cycle?

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:02.420
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.820
So I posted a link.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:07.360
So links to all of the stuff
that I showed in the intro

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.427
video there, on the YouTube
site, I'll post it into G+

00:13:10.427 --> 00:13:12.120
event as well.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.760
But to answer your question more
specifically, if you go

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.120
to
developer.android.com/training,

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:23.060
we have a bunch of intro level
classes to help explain the

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.500
basic building blocks
of Android.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.170
And I think the life cycle
stuff is Lesson One.

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:28.670
It's kind of that fundamental.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:31.280
So if you want to get a better
understanding of what it

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.010
means, how does it work,
what's the right way of

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.140
dealing with it, then definitely
check that out.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.194
And that should help
you get started.

00:13:37.194 --> 00:13:37.998
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:13:37.998 --> 00:13:39.150
RETO MEIER: No worries.

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.980
And good luck with everything.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.200
It should be a lot of fun.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.812
We look forward to seeing
what you come up with.

00:13:43.812 --> 00:13:44.616
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:45.600
DAN: All right guys.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.810
Who's up next?

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.620
Just go ahead, raise your hand,
and I'm on the Hangout,

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.580
and I'll put you guys live.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:51.150
Anyone?

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:51.342
All right.

00:13:51.342 --> 00:13:53.250
Here we go.

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:54.820
Sorry, I'm not quite sure how
to pronounce your name.

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.830
Why don't you go ahead and
introduce yourself.

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:57.560
RETO MEIER: Oh Yossi.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.030
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.550
from Google+.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:01.520
Nicely done, man.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.380
How you doing?

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.710
I think you muted yourself.

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:06.960
DAN: Yeah.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:10.970
Still nothing.

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:12.220
Why don't you go ahead
and check your mic.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:17.590
Still nothing.

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.060
RETO MEIER: We're not hearing
you unfortunately, Yossi.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:27.980
AUDIENCE: Can you hear me now?

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:28.690
RETO MEIER: We can
hear you now.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:30.830
Thank you.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:31.120
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.730
Sorry.

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.170
A couple of mics over
here, so I needed to

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:38.150
choose the correct one.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:40.070
First of all, hi Reto.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:44.445
I don't know if you remember
me from the Google I/O?

00:14:44.445 --> 00:14:44.920
RETO MEIER: Vaguely.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.770
I meet a lot of people at I/O.

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:49.060
AUDIENCE: I know.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:55.020
Basically what I wanted to refer
to was the Exit button.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:15:01.640
In our app, we use video-social
communication,

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.810
Chat and IM messaging
and so on.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:10.490
And basically we have users
wanting to exit the

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:15.350
application in fully, not just
doing a signout and leaving

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:19.810
the service running or
something like that.

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.880
Basically they want to exit
the application, so our

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.550
service will die at the
same point they want.

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:32.440
So I'm referring to it
as a bad pattern.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:38.780
Because that's more like a
single task device and not the

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.100
Android system.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:47.080
But basically, if we need to
implement such behavior, then

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:51.060
the Exit button should be a part
of the Android pattern.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:56.210
Although the Android system is
killing tasks by itself.

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:58.590
RETO MEIER: I think the
challenge in a situation like

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.390
that is similar to what you're
going to see things like

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:06.040
GoogleTalk or any ongoing
messaging thing where--

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.960
the user wants the ability to
basically say, disconnect from

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:09.360
your server.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.190
And stop consuming everything.

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:15.470
So in that case, the culmination
of hitting logout

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:18.950
or signout from the service,
and then listening for

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:20.920
on-pause should be enough.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.530
So that once they say
disconnect, that should be the

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:27.380
equivalent of hitting
Exit, basically.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.190
AUDIENCE: That's what
we implemented.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:31.020
We have both features.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.100
We have the feature
of signout.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:39.880
So we'll show the user the
home screen to log in via

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.300
Facebook or his username
and password.

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:47.850
And we also have the Exit button
that keeps the user

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:50.970
logged into the system, but
basically exits all the

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:54.190
applications and kills the
service and everything.

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:58.940
And then all messaging or
notifications comes via GCM or

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.992
T2DM to all the devices.

00:17:02.992 --> 00:17:03.930
RETO MEIER: So that's
interesting.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.470
That brings up a really
good point.

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.240
Kind of what I was alluding to
earlier-- like, if you hadn't

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.154
told me that, if I just opened
your app and saw Logout and

00:17:11.154 --> 00:17:14.829
Exit as two separate options, I
would have no idea what the

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:15.810
Exit button would do.

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:18.946
I certainly wouldn't expect that
if I hit Exit, that I'd

00:17:18.946 --> 00:17:20.450
still get messages from GCM.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:23.190
I would expect that if you hit
Exit, everything turns off.

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:25.720
So I log out, and I stop
getting messages.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.720
I think that's the challenge.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.520
If you introduce something like
Exit, which doesn't have

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.640
a clear semantic meaning, then
different users are going to

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.360
interpret it in different
ways.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.430
And so, logout totally
makes sense.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:38.910
Disconnect me from
your services.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.340
I don't want to get
any more messages.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:41.550
100% makes sense.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:42.700
Exit--

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:43.550
it doesn't.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:45.662
Basically what you're describing
what the Exit

00:17:45.662 --> 00:17:48.160
button does, it sounds to me
like what should happen when I

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.690
hit Back or Home from
within your app

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:53.500
AUDIENCE: That's what
I'm saying.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:59.210
But because we're doing cross
platform, so we want our users

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:04.140
to know that the device or
application handles the same

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.610
situations all over
the platforms.

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:09.930
So basically if you have an Exit
button on iPhone, or you

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.910
have an Exit button on Windows,
or on Windows phone

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:19.600
tablets and so on, or even on
Mac-- you press command Q, you

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:20.710
exit the app.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:25.580
And on Android, the ecosystem is
just, hit the Home button,

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:29.410
and let Android deal with all
the memory and all the tasks

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:33.370
ongoing, and so on.

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:41.560
So what is the best option to
handle the situation for us

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:48.690
and also give the user the same
atmosphere, or the same

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:53.750
experience, when moving
from device to device?

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:58.200
Because basically the user
connects from an iPod, an

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:05.180
iPhone, an iPad, a Nexus 7,
Nexus 10, Google TV--

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.020
you name the device,
we have it.

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:11.210
So basically we want the users
to know that [? UVU ?]

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.440
connects people all
over the world.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:19.420
No matter what, the same
experience, the same features

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:22.080
are available on all devices.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.860
So that's the main issue here.

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:26.440
RETO MEIER: OK.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.870
That's a good question.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:29.960
And it's actually an
interesting one.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.120
Because I hear this a lot from
developers who are building

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.820
these cross platform solutions,
where they want to

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:38.940
have something really consistent
across all the

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:39.930
different devices.

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:43.026
Now the thing is, there's sort
of two different ways that I

00:19:43.026 --> 00:19:43.700
would approach this.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:47.360
And the first is that it's
actually fairly unlikely that

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.820
you're going to have a
significant number of users

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:53.190
which have multiple different
devices from different

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:54.680
manufacturers.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.926
So you're not going to have a
lot of people which have an

00:19:57.926 --> 00:19:59.970
IPhone and an Android phone.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:02.090
There will be some--

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:05.210
and this leads me to my second
point, which is that people

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:07.826
expect their devices to
behave consistently.

00:20:07.826 --> 00:20:10.210
They don't necessarily expect
apps to work exactly the same

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:11.560
across different devices.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:15.450
So if I've got an iPad, then I
expect all of the apps to work

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:17.370
in a way that's consistent with
the way all of the other

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:18.390
iPad apps work.

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.455
And if I have Android,
then I expect them to

00:20:20.455 --> 00:20:21.460
all work with Android.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:26.330
So what you don't have is an
iPhone user expecting their

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:29.030
Android phone to work in the
same way as their iPhone.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.790
Because it's a different
device, right?

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:33.410
They don't have the
same expectations.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:36.310
If they did, they get really
confused when they started

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:39.850
using things like Mail and Maps
and Music and Twitter and

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:40.440
everything else.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.350
Because they just inherently
behave differently.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:43.960
And it's the same
with computers.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.030
You expect your computer to
work in a certain way.

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:51.260
Expect to have that command Q
to get out of an app in Mac.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:52.460
If you've got Windows,
you expect to

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.180
be able to hit Alt-F4.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:57.270
But what you're not
expecting is--

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:00.290
a good example is, if you're
building an app for both

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:04.230
Windows and Mac, you're not
going to build the command Q

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:06.330
shortcut into the Windows app.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.270
So that people who are
using it on Mac

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:09.520
understand how to quit.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.565
You're going to build in the
same user patterns that

00:21:12.565 --> 00:21:14.160
they're expecting for Windows.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.420
And it's the same
across mobile.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:19.200
Like, I wouldn't tell you to
build your iPhone apps so that

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.900
they work and look the same
as your Android apps.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:24.560
You want to have a consistent
experience between the

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.680
platform because that's
what they're doing

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.610
within a given context.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:32.010
So for your app in particular,
what you want to do, what your

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:34.990
users are going to expect is
that if you're signed in but

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:37.030
your app is not in the
foreground, then it shouldn't

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:38.880
be consuming any resources.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.710
And that's just going to
be their expectation.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:43.250
Some may look to find
an Exit button.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:44.840
But if you're not doing
anything, if you're not

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.380
consuming any resources, if the
phone's not going slower,

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.570
if you're not doing background
polling, you're not waking up

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:50.370
the phone--

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:51.980
you're just receiving
those updates using

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.470
Google Cloud Messaging.

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:55.030
Then they're going
to be happy.

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:56.660
They're not going to be looking
for something if

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.770
there's no reason
to look for it.

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.560
So that would be my big
piece of advice.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.460
Don't try to over simplify
across devices.

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:07.390
Because in my experience
that tends to be what

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:09.130
bosses, what CEOs do.

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:11.270
They look at all of your apps
across all the different

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:12.210
phones

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:14.565
AUDIENCE: That's
our issue here.

00:22:14.565 --> 00:22:20.090
The designers or product guys
basically want the same

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:22.370
features to be on all devices.

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:26.860
And my main concern or my main
issue as an Android developer

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:31.810
is to show them the Android
system is not the same as the

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:32.770
iOS system.

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:33.930
Or is not the same--

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:37.220
so you have the basic
conventions in Android, such

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:42.540
as the Home key or not showing
the exit option.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.540
I agree that you don't need
an Exit button on your

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:46.810
application.

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:52.410
But basically I want you to
say it so I can have up a

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:55.080
judge overruling
on the matter.

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:59.860
So I can show it to our
designers and let them know

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:04.230
that basically what they're
doing is not is

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:05.660
not native to Android.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:06.250
RETO MEIER: Sure.

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:08.560
And that's the sort of thing
we're trying to do a lot more

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:09.140
of these days.

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:10.710
I think the thing about Android,
particularly when we

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:13.290
got started is, it's open.

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:15.200
You can do anything.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.150
But now we're trying to get to
the point where it's like, you

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:18.640
can do anything.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.950
But we'd really like people to
do things in a consistent way

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:23.170
to make it easier for users.

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:25.140
And so we're trying to become
a little bit more aggressive

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.145
about telling people what
are the best practices.

00:23:28.145 --> 00:23:29.340
You don't have to follow them.

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.430
No-one's going to take your app
out of Google Play if you

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:32.680
do things differently.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.930
But at least something you can
show your design team and your

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.610
management team and say look,
this is the way that things

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:40.750
work on Android.

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:42.840
And if you want to do it
differently, you're going to

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:47.200
have to come up with something
very different.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.150
Oh, I see what's
happened here.

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:50.040
DAN: [? I think ?]
your keynote.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:50.430
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:56.750
So let me just jump over here
and I'll fix that problem.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:58.040
Wonderful.

00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:58.730
Boom.

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:03.090
Yeah, so it sounds like you're
on the same page as me.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:04.800
So it sounds like we're
in good shape.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:08.150
The challenge is explaining to
other people exactly why

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:08.710
that's the case.

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:11.190
And hopefully you can share with
them some of the stuff

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:12.120
that we talked about today.

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:16.190
And that may help change
their minds.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:17.340
Thanks for your time, Yossi.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.148
It's been a pleasure
talking to you.

00:24:19.148 --> 00:24:20.402
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:24:20.402 --> 00:24:21.340
DAN: I'm going to put Luke on.

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.195
Luke has a quick question
for you.

00:24:23.195 --> 00:24:23.841
RETO MEIER: Cool.

00:24:23.841 --> 00:24:24.165
Hey, Luke.

00:24:24.165 --> 00:24:25.630
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:28.850
I was just wondering about
something that I've seen

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:30.970
that's similar to what you're
talking about, but

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:31.790
not exactly the same.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:37.761
Where someone hits the Back
button from an application

00:24:37.761 --> 00:24:38.840
DAN: I love it.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:39.060
Hangouts.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:39.660
RETO MEIER: Hangouts.

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:41.590
Doing us a favor.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:42.780
DAN: One second, guys.

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.030
RETO MEIER: We'll
be right back.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.370
I love the technology
around here.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:50.800
It never screws us over.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.620
So, while we're waiting for
Luke to come back-- cool.

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:55.160
I think you're back.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:55.450
All right.

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:58.100
So we missed some of that
because our Hangout crashed.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.650
I'm going to go and assume that
sentence finished with,

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:02.090
you hit a Back button
that says, are you

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:04.130
sure you want to exit?

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:04.440
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.650
RETO MEIER: Right.

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:06.710
Yeah, I hate that too.

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:08.270
That makes me very,
very angry.

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:11.130
There are very few exceptions
to that rule.

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.420
So navigation is actually
a good one.

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:17.500
Where if I hit the Back button
on Google navigation, it says

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.540
do you want to end
all [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:21.710
Then you can either
say yes or no.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:22.570
And that's reasonable.

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:26.015
Because I think it still
backs out of the app.

00:25:26.015 --> 00:25:28.370
It just either does or doesn't
turn off the ongoing service.

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:30.920
And that's because, if I
accidentally hit Back while

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.380
I'm driving, I don't want to
then have to faff around with

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:36.130
Maps and Navigation to try
and get it back up.

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.640
So I like that, where it's
sort of a disruptive,

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.610
distracting behavior.

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:42.720
But it's just a normal
app, that's like--

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.980
it shouldn't be a difference,
right?

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.900
For most apps, if they don't
have an ongoing service,

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:47.920
hitting Back and then going,
oh whoops, and

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.590
then starting it again--

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:51.510
it should be the same as
starting it from scratch.

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:52.850
Or hitting Home and
going back.

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:56.540
So yeah, that's definitely an
anti-pattern that I really

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:59.266
hope dies a death.

00:25:59.266 --> 00:26:01.935
AUDIENCE: That's kind of
what I was expecting.

00:26:01.935 --> 00:26:02.380
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:05.260
Nothing too controversial
there.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:06.960
Thanks for bringing it up.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.395
We've got another hand wave.

00:26:08.395 --> 00:26:10.830
I think fourth from the left.

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:12.926
DAN: Is that you again, Dave?

00:26:12.926 --> 00:26:14.390
RETO MEIER: I think so.

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:16.055
I don't think that's it again.

00:26:16.055 --> 00:26:18.917
AUDIENCE: That was just
my son waving.

00:26:18.917 --> 00:26:19.771
RETO MEIER: Excellent.

00:26:19.771 --> 00:26:22.190
Say hi to your son.

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.150
DAN: Who's up next?

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:25.760
Unfortunately, since the Hangout
crashed, I lost some

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:26.540
of the comments.

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:29.560
So if you guys were interested
in joining in

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:30.790
live, just let me know.

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:31.770
Wave your hand.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:33.255
I'll put you guys on air.

00:26:33.255 --> 00:26:35.820
RETO MEIER: Do we have any
comments on G+ or on YouTube

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.950
which may require
some responding?

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:41.580
DAN: There are actually a
lot of great comments.

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.370
I'm actually having a hard
time picking a good one.

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:47.950
They all seem to be replying to
each other about this very

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:49.636
debatable topic.

00:26:49.636 --> 00:26:50.092
RETO MEIER: Oh, OK.

00:26:50.092 --> 00:26:50.550
Excellent.

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:53.220
DAN: So let me go ahead and look
through a couple of them

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.150
and pick a great one for you.

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:57.280
I did see one down here.

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.070
Let me scroll down.

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:00.210
RETO MEIER: So while Daniel's
looking that up, I just want

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:02.730
to as well point out to you guys
that I'm going to try and

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:04.500
do this semi-regularly.

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.870
So if there are particular
topics which make you want to

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:09.820
flip a table, let me know
on G+, Twitter,

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:10.580
wherever you like.

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:13.520
And I'll see if I can put
together some argument.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.918
Yes, Dave?

00:27:15.918 --> 00:27:17.520
AUDIENCE: I actually have
a quick question.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.480
Maybe we all have the
same question.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.020
Are you going to flip that
table before you leave?

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.160
RETO MEIER: I was thinking
about it.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.640
But my laptop is on it.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.230
So I'm going to choose
not to and maybe save

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:30.030
that up for next week.

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:32.580
I will also take suggestions on
different kinds of tables.

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:35.560
I know that there were some
people who were disappointed

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:39.290
that I used a table which had
a cylindrical bottom, rather

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:42.940
than a more traditional
four-legged table, which the

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.410
emoticon would seem
to require.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:47.340
But it's a learning
experience.

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:50.150
It's iterate and launch early
and iterate often.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:54.200
So that's what we're going to do
here at Table Flip as well.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.270
I'd really love to hear what
are some of the things that

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:58.460
drive you guys crazy.

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:02.010
As Justin was sort of
suggesting earlier--

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:05.520
a lot of the time, we as
developers all know how we

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.520
think apps should work.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.290
And we get overruled by
designers or PMs who perhaps

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:12.750
aren't as familiar with
Android as we are.

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:17.230
So if you're looking for a way
to be able to present a

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:19.120
justification, do let me know.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.503
And perhaps a six-minute
video will help.

00:28:21.503 --> 00:28:25.320
I don't know how much so, but
it's probably worth a try.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.090
Did you find a good question
or comment for

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:28.860
us to respond to?

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.850
DAN: I found a simple one which
is not too far beyond my

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:33.150
understanding.

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:36.490
It's about de-bouncing
the Back button.

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:39.080
For example, if you're heading
Back multiple times and

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:43.060
quickly try to escape an app,
which most users tend to do,

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:46.060
it'll take you back a lot
further than you intended to.

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:50.800
So what are your thoughts on
giving some feedback to users

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.320
when they're hitting Back in
a short amount of time?

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.630
RETO MEIER: So I think I'm going
to answer that question

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:58.680
by answering a slightly
different question, which is

00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.680
really about navigation.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:03.275
And I think that's another
vector into which people are

00:29:03.275 --> 00:29:05.550
like, I want an Exit button,
because otherwise I'm in a

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:08.620
browser or in an app that I
have to hit Exit like a

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.250
million times before I
get out of the app.

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:13.970
If that's happening, that tells
me that the navigation

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:16.060
of your app is probably
overly complex.

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:20.430
It shouldn't require 15, 20 Back
button hits to get back

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:22.300
to the home screen
of your app.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.420
So that's using the
[? app affordance ?]

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:27.830
or using a logo click to take
you back to the main screen of

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:30.530
your app, you really want to
be able to make it easy for

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:33.080
users to navigate, particularly
on phones and I

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.610
think still on tablets.

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:37.910
You really don't want to force
your users down a rabbit hole

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:39.220
of navigation.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:41.380
You want to keep it as
simple as possible.

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.190
So rather than figuring out how
do I deal with the fact

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:47.070
that a user may hit the Back
button seven times instead of

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:49.690
six times to get to the home
screen, think about how to

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:51.950
make it easier for a user to
get to the home screen to

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:52.690
begin with.

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:56.290
I think that's probably a better
way to invest your time

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:58.950
than figuring out how
to do de-bounce too

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:02.008
many Back button clicks.

00:30:02.008 --> 00:30:05.120
DAN: So we've got another good
comment from Paul W here.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:09.080
He says that users traditionally
have grown up

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.360
being taught what the Exit
button does throughout their

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.940
entire lives.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:17.140
And so you're on Windows
or you're on some

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.100
other operating system.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:23.040
And everyone kind of feels
familiar with the Exit button.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:27.760
And it's kind of part of
the foundation of how

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.780
we do things already.

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.560
RETO MEIER: Yes.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:34.060
DAN: So maybe he's sort of
disagreeing with you.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:34.215
RETO MEIER: I'll take that.

00:30:34.215 --> 00:30:36.370
I mean, I think that's what I
was kind of talking about

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:37.060
right at the beginning.

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.250
So you may have missed the We'll
have just the video of

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:39.970
the [? rant ?] posted.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:42.130
In fact, there's a link to it
in the G+ stream if you did

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:43.390
miss the very beginning.

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:44.360
But it's a good point right?

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.720
Like, old school, Exit
meant something.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.920
Like if you have a
single-tasking operating

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:51.420
system, you need to have an Exit
in order to be able to do

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:53.350
something else.

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:55.090
And so, yeah, users have
gotten used to it.

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:56.010
Particularly us.

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:58.220
Like, I'm guessing people
watching this have been using

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:02.040
computers since shortly after
exiting the womb.

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.510
And so those patterns really
getting ingrained with us.

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:06.790
But new users--

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:07.870
they're not thinking
of it that way.

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:11.230
Particularly phone users who
don't really think of their

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:13.890
phone as being a computer
that runs apps.

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:15.460
They just think of it
as a device that

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.120
lets them do stuff.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.190
I mean, I remember reading
a survey--

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:21.110
I think it was late last year
or early this year--

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:24.210
which asked people, do you use
the internet on your phone?

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:28.870
And most said, no, I don't use
the internet on my phone.

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:31.330
And the follow-up question
is like, well, do

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:32.790
you check your email?

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:34.180
Do you update Facebook?

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:34.750
Do you use Twitter?

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:36.270
And they're like, yeah,
definitely do

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:37.490
all of those things.

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:39.010
And it's like--

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:41.710
the internet, how
does it work?

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:43.450
That's what's making all
of these things work.

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:44.700
But people don't think
of it that way.

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:50.640
All of the implementation
details about how these apps

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.250
work-- the fact that there
are apps running in a

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:55.010
multi-tasking operating system
connecting to the internet

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:59.440
over ethernet or a cell network,
TCP/IP connection.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.130
They don't know any of that.

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:01.440
They don't care about
any of that.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.760
They just want to do something,
like order a taxi,

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.080
or check their email, or update

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.800
Twitter, or take a photo.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.310
And how it all works means
nothing to them.

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:12.460
And so in that context, Exit
doesn't make any sense.

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:14.560
Like, I just want to
update Twitter.

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.880
And then I want to
take a photo.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.970
I don't want to have to think
about exiting one app to start

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:19.250
up another.

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:20.780
So it's really about changing
those paradigms.

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:24.980
And getting people thinking
in a different way.

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:26.980
I mean, you can say anything
is old school.

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:31.310
Like, I remember when I was in
high school thinking, I can't

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.670
believe it.

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:33.960
This new computer I'm going
to buy doesn't have a 5

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.160
and 1/4 inch disk.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.490
That's ridiculous.

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:38.980
I mean I know I mainly use the
3 and 1/2 inch floppies now.

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.390
But the 5 and 1/4 is
never going away.

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:42.700
Yeah, it went away.

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:45.430
And then the 3 and 1/2 inch went
away not too long enough

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:46.130
afterwards.

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:49.810
And then hard drives started
to end up in the terabytes.

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:52.070
My point is that
things change.

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:54.770
And I think as developers,
we need to adapt to that.

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:56.830
And the trend is really to try
and make things easier and

00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:58.860
easier for users, so they don't
have to think about how

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:00.210
do I use a computer?

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:01.440
They just do stuff.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.990
And then the OS does
all the hard work.

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:07.280
It's the same when we started
switching to garbage collected

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.360
programming languages.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:10.640
Like a lot of folks back in the
day were like, oh that's

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.130
ridiculous.

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:13.090
You don't have to manage
your own memory.

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:13.680
But you know what?

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:14.510
It's easier.

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:15.470
It makes our job easier.

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:18.960
And it lets us focus on
features, rather than on the

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.140
bits and pieces that go into
making an app work.

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:23.895
I think we're just about
out of time.

00:33:23.895 --> 00:33:25.290
We've already gone
15 minutes later

00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:26.395
than I initially proposed.

00:33:26.395 --> 00:33:29.310
But we've had a lot of good
comments and conversations.

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:30.670
So I didn't want to
cut anyone off.

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:33.850
But is there anyone on the
Hangouts which would like to

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:38.331
throw in a few final thoughts,
comments, disagreements?

00:33:38.331 --> 00:33:40.160
Could you speak up?

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.020
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.812
RETO MEIER: Oh, you're
very welcome.

00:33:44.812 --> 00:33:48.470
AUDIENCE: I had a question.

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:50.080
And I was wondering
if you could do a

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.210
session on unit testing?

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:52.640
RETO MEIER: OK.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.370
Yeah, unit testing
is a good one.

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:56.890
I think testing is something
which we probably don't have

00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:59.330
as much information out there
for Android as we should do,

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:00.960
considering how important
it is.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:04.100
So yeah, we'll definitely feed
that back into the team.

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:07.830
And see if we can get an
Office Hours Hangout or

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:09.830
something around unit testing
best practices,

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:10.639
those sorts of things.

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:13.314
It's a great idea.

00:34:13.314 --> 00:34:14.139
DAN: Cool man.

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:15.600
I think that's it.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:15.980
RETO MEIER: All right.

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:19.130
Thank you very much everyone.

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:20.130
Let's see.

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:21.040
Yes, so that's it for today.

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.590
I'll be back next time for
another Android anti-pattern

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:25.280
that makes me want
flip a table.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.350
I don't know what it is yet.

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:28.840
So if you've got suggestions,
let me know.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.840
And I will throw the furniture
on your behalf.

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.590
Until then, my name
is Reto Meier.

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:36.010
We were ably assisted
by Daniel [? Fan. ?]

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:37.260
And thank you for watching.
