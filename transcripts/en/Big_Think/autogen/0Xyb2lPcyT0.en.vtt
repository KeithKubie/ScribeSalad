was it something I actually had married

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870
was it something I actually had married
 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.960
was it something I actually had married

it is said he told people that he had

uncle's potato field as a as a kid and
 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.549

he looked at the way the the furrows

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559
he looked at the way the the furrows
 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.380

went across the field and inferred that

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390
went across the field and inferred that
 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.540

could make neutrons do whatever he

he got it in his head that he could
influence neutrons and he created a

influence neutrons and he created a
 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.410
influence neutrons and he created a
device which he called a phaser and that

not able to do it I mean this in order

not able to do it I mean this in order
 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.249
not able to do it I mean this in order
to do that as far as we can tell right

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259
to do that as far as we can tell right
 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.870
to do that as far as we can tell right
now you need the gravity of a star which

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880
now you need the gravity of a star which
 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.920
now you need the gravity of a star which
we have at our nearby star the Sun and

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930
we have at our nearby star the Sun and
 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.319
we have at our nearby star the Sun and
people have speculated that you could

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329
people have speculated that you could
 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.630
people have speculated that you could
also contain fusion not speculated

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640
also contain fusion not speculated
 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.920

that's an exaggeration in a magnet in a

that makes the fusion reaction makes

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549
that makes the fusion reaction makes
 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.610
that makes the fusion reaction makes
enough power to to establish the

room temperature I'm very skeptical
 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.670

because I look at what happens in nature

as far as we know no however it is
