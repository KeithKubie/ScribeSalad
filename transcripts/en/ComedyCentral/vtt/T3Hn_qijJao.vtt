00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:02.461
- When you get drunk, it numbs
the

00:00:02.461 --> 00:00:05.088
part of you that would
normally laugh at yourself

00:00:05.088 --> 00:00:07.257
for doing something sexy.
- Yes, yes.

00:00:07.257 --> 00:00:08.759
- Cause when you're drunk and
you're like,

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:10.886
is this your scarf? (laughs)

00:00:10.886 --> 00:00:11.720
- Yes.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.554
- Sober I'd be like yes, this is
a very

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:14.723
nice scarf, my hands are
up here, hands are up here.

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:16.516
- I know you can be--
- Hello.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:19.019
- Like I'm Kate Beckinsale,
I pretend like I can be--

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.480
- I'm Pete Davidson. I don't
know.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.023
- (laughs) Exactly.

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.524
- Can I see your boobs?

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:26.944
(bass music)

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:30.030
- We need some sort of patch.
- Yeah.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.864
- For--

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:31.782
- Like a wine patch.

00:00:31.782 --> 00:00:33.492
- [Russell] Like a wine patch.

00:00:33.492 --> 00:00:34.826
- Called the Pinot Noir.

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:35.661
- [Russell] Very good.

00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:37.829
- Yeah, you just put it on
and your lips get purple.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:38.705
- I swear to god--

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:39.790
- And you go, I'll fuck you
right now.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.625
- But imagine some sort of patch

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:44.920
that gives you the sort
of lack of inhibition

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.006
that booze gives you, but
it isn't actually alcohol.

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:48.882
Whatever that is.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.926
- I think it's oxy.

00:00:50.926 --> 00:00:51.760
- Yeah.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.513
Cool, so I'm gonna be
fucking trying to get

00:00:54.513 --> 00:00:56.431
Nikki out of Union Square in a
year

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:59.101
when she's in all black
and has a dog on the train

00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:02.104
going, "I need a ticket home for
Buffalo."

00:01:02.104 --> 00:01:03.897
And you go you're on fucking
heroin.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:05.107
I know you're on heroin.

00:01:05.107 --> 00:01:06.275
- She's had sex twice.

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:07.859
- And I am fucking.

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:08.694
- I am fucking.

00:01:08.694 --> 00:01:10.654
- You know what you're doing
here when you're fucking

00:01:10.654 --> 00:01:11.488
the park.

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:14.992
You get comfortable fucking
outside.

00:01:14.992 --> 00:01:16.910
- Why don't you buy one
of those fuck machines?

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.870
- Like a sybian?

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.123
Oh jeez Andrew that's why you
go?

00:01:21.123 --> 00:01:22.666
- No but she's..
- Honestly.

00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.459
- The thing is me and Andrew,

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:26.086
we're trying to figure out
problems here,

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.171
so I would suggest
alongside the fuck machine,

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:31.550
why not a nice audio book
then you've got company.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.344
- Yes, but during the
fuck machine or after?

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:35.721
- Guys I'm just gonna say
- During!

00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:37.889
- Let's go in and make a
full fuck robot for Nikki,

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:39.516
let's weird science this.

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:41.727
- I can't wait until those
exist.

00:01:41.727 --> 00:01:42.561
- They do!

00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:44.396
- Give 'em a million
followers on Instagram.

00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:46.732
- Can I respond to your
fuck machine thing.

00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:48.483
Believe me I've thought about it

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:51.945
and believe me I
- It's too loud?

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.322
- First of all I have a small
apartment,

00:01:53.322 --> 00:01:55.032
what am I gonna roll out my fuck
machine,

00:01:55.032 --> 00:01:58.827
my maid is gonna like dust
around it.

00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:02.998
- You gotta thing of gas
and go hold on real quick

00:02:02.998 --> 00:02:06.168
Conseula I'm just gassing
up this thing real quick.

00:02:06.168 --> 00:02:08.086
(boom)

00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:11.381
- But that's where the
audiobook comes in handy.

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:12.257
- What do you mean?

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:14.259
- I mean some sort of, maybe
a Charles Dickens novel.

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:16.470
- It was the best of times
- So it doesn't feel so dirty

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.889
- No, I could just like watch
porn

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:20.807
and put on the fuck machine.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.893
- Well that's gonna give the
game away.

00:02:22.893 --> 00:02:25.437
- When I'm a rich lady in a big
house,

00:02:25.437 --> 00:02:26.855
I'll have a room with a fuck
ma...

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:29.316
Like I will 100% buy a fuck
machine.

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:30.317
- Can you have a bunch of locks
on it,

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:31.735
where you go you guys wanna see
the room?

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:33.570
(laughter)

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.489
You open the door, you go
that's a big fuck machine.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.366
You go I know.

00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:39.826
- Can I tell you what I do,

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:43.080
I have come up with a way
to have, to get fucked

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.166
without a fuck machine right on
your own.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:48.001
- This is what Edison did.

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.879
- So there are certain toys,
there's one,

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.964
there's toys that like
move on their own right

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:56.009
like they have like a bend
in them and it goes like

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.094
or it swirls.

00:02:58.804 --> 00:03:01.348
- It looks like it's a small
world after all at Disneyland,

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:02.891
like the way they move.
- Yes.

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:07.062
- Where it's like (musical
noise)

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.609
- There's ones that like do
a come heather motion okay

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.488
so a lot of times I'll but I
don't even wanna hold it there

00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:17.864
because I'm just like, then I
have to be

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:19.741
in this like weird crunch
position.

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:24.246
So I plugged my heel with
it and then lay it back.

00:03:24.246 --> 00:03:25.414
- Dildo hack.

00:03:25.414 --> 00:03:28.291
- Then it's working and
you're not doing anything,

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:30.085
and you're just getting the...

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:32.546
- It's like a life hack but for
sex toys.

00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:33.422
- It really is.

00:03:33.422 --> 00:03:35.340
- But does it not hurt,
that looks like you're

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.675
gonna get a cramp of some form.

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:38.385
- And I put a dimmer switch on
my Hitachi

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:40.429
which I'm sitting on, I
just put that on my butt,

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:42.681
I sit on that and I have
a dimmer switch with that

00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:45.100
so I'm doing minimal work.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.310
- There is a Japanese
scientist that is so upset

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.603
you don't know about his
product.

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:50.188
(laughter)

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:52.732
I have a whole fuck machine
you do not need to put

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.734
your heel on your pussy.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.698
And then it just comes to the
room like (mechanical noise),

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:01.825
dude I'd worry if I was a
woman and I fucked a machine

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:03.034
it would just kill me.

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:04.077
- [Nikki] Oh yes.

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:05.912
- That's the thing, gen
when you sort of worry

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:07.372
that you do it too wildly and it
would

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:09.249
make a citizens arrest and the
robot

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.543
would just take you in to the
street.

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:14.629
- And just lifts you up by
your face like (screams)

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.965
- Safe word
- There's one in the UK

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:19.176
they're developing sex robots in
the UK.

00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:20.802
One in five British people
said they would have sex

00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:21.928
with a robot.

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:22.762
- Yeah I would.

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:24.347
- I would fuck a robot in a
second.

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.224
- John Connor, I ain't fucking
no robot.

00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:27.058
- I'm kind of with you.

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:28.518
- Are you afraid of it?

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:30.562
- No it's Wallace and Gromit
- You like it too much.

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:32.564
- Have you not seen Wallace
and Gromit the wrong trousers.

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:33.398
- No.

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:35.192
- Yeah so basically
there's like a cartoon,

00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:37.444
there's this sort of robot I
would worry

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:39.404
that the robot would just
take you out in the street.

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:40.238
- Exactly.

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:42.449
- But the interesting thing
is they're developing one.

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.326
- Yeah but it doesn't have
legs it's just a pussy.

00:04:44.326 --> 00:04:45.160
- No no it's.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.161
- Would the pussy pick you up?

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:48.163
- No no no, it's an actual sex
robot.

00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:49.456
- Like a woman.

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:50.373
- A woman or a man.

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:51.833
- I don't need appendages.

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:53.919
- But they've developed
it with a Scottish accent.

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:54.753
- Really?

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:56.254
- [Russell] Yeah out of
all the accents to choose.

00:04:56.254 --> 00:05:00.175
- That is fucking hilarious,
fuck harder, go harder,

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:01.718
fuck me harder.

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:03.220
- Of all the accents you could
choose.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.264
- Like a man's Scottish accent
is maybe a little bit sexy

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:07.891
but never a woman.
- On a woman robot.

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:10.477
- Whack it in my cracker, whoa.

00:05:11.937 --> 00:05:13.772
- With hairy forearms.

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:16.983
- Fucking cock is great.

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:20.904
- Every tool though is a robot
in some way and use robotics.

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:21.821
- Use a remote control.

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:24.324
- You're doing the same line of
thinking

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:26.618
that men do at bars when
they're just trying to hook up,

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:28.954
you go what is a robot, robots.

00:05:28.954 --> 00:05:31.414
- What is sex, what is yeah.

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:33.708
- I'm gonna fuck a machine so
what.

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:36.503
It's just I'm worried
that it'll just turn.

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:39.589
- Well Dan did you struggle
with having sex sober

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.508
after you got sober.

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:42.842
- Oh no you definitely
don't cum right away

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:44.135
when that happens.

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:45.178
- Oh yeah yeah.

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:46.680
- It definitely happens you quit
drinking

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.431
you're like sex, I'm done.

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:49.599
- Yep
- Yeah

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:50.559
- And you're like oh my god.

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:51.685
- But I mean getting
to the place where you

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:53.603
can be comfortable enough to
have sex, I feel like guys

00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:56.064
don't struggle as much.
- I started going to coffee.

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:58.108
You know what's worse to try to
have sex,

00:05:58.108 --> 00:05:59.734
is to drink a bunch of caffeine.

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:01.152
- Yeah I mean that's the same.

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:03.405
- And then you're just
like do you wanna fuck.

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:04.239
- I know.

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:06.241
- I found it so much creepier
when my drunks friends

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:09.369
would get sober and drink
Red Bull to stay up,

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.079
to like wait around 2.30.

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:12.205
- No I can't do that.

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.249
- That's fucking creepy,
do you know what I mean

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:17.877
like you're just waiting for
just like a wounded deer.

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:19.546
- I've like hung out with girls
that have gotten too drunk

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:21.590
and I'm like we're not gonna...

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.051
- No that's yeah I'm sure
now you see it so clearly.

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:28.179
- But you're like stop and
they're like I wanna have fun.

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:29.556
- Ugh it's so gross.

00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:32.809
- Oh sweet oh sweet thing no you
don't.

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:35.186
- I know it's hard to put up
with.

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:36.813
- I'm sexy now.

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:38.982
- You go, I used to feel
that, I know exactly

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:41.276
what you're feeling
right now but it's not.

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:42.485
- I Would make you so
many promises right now

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:43.320
if I was hammered.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.696
- Oh my god.

00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:47.198
- Be a lot of you know we're
gonna go away together.

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:48.366
- Yep
- And now I'm like

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:49.826
you probably need to go home.

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:52.662
- Well I just talked about the
first time that I was tested

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:57.042
as a sober person, like my
favorite thing to do drunk

00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:58.126
I was talking about Andrew like

00:06:58.126 --> 00:07:01.588
some of my best memories
are like when I drink

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:03.632
and had fun and going to
Lollapalooza,

00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:06.593
and getting wasted was my
favorite yearly thing to do.

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:07.427
- Yeah.

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:10.055
- And the first time I
went sober was with you.

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:11.348
- Guess who was still drinking.

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:13.433
- And you were still drinking,
yeah.

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:18.355
Yeah that was such a test, in
that I never went back again.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.691
Like you can't do musical
festivals, do you do ...

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:22.609
- Without drunk Dan?

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:24.110
- [Nikki] Are there certain
things that you can't do anymore

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.445
- That's a good point
though, a musical festival

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:26.529
is a tough one.

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:28.156
- It is.
- Yeah.

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:30.742
- I went to Coachella to
the first time two years ago

00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:33.703
and that blew my mind, and
I wasn't drinking there.

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:35.622
- Really, so you were
just there stone sober.

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:38.458
- I'd never been to an American
musical festival before,

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:40.919
just compared to like
Glastonbury in England,

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:43.463
the same but completely
different.

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.799
Like the show, it was
incredible like everyone

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:48.301
was just, as soon as the band
started everyone turned around

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:51.096
and were kind of filming
it with themselves in it.

00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:54.766
So the performers were
performing to nobody.

00:07:54.766 --> 00:07:56.685
- [Dan] I really thought
this was about to be like

00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:58.645
American fans give it up for the
bands.

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:01.272
- I know, I was so impressed
at the beginning of it

00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:03.024
I was like is he not gonna shit
on us?

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:05.985
- No no but comedy
audiences here are amazing.

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:06.986
- [Nikki] Oh really?

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:08.988
- Compared to the UK yeah.

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:11.408
- I'm doing fringe this year
I'm like fuck am I in trouble.

00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:12.325
- Are you, are you doing
Edinburgh?

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:13.159
- [Dan] Yeah yeah.

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:15.161
- Oh it'll be grand man,
it's lovely, where abouts?

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:18.164
- I'm at the Dairy and the
Underbelly.

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:19.874
- Oh lovely stuff yeah it's
great.

00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:21.459
- I'm worried that you said
that 'cause you're like

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:22.711
they're not good like you know.

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:25.255
- Why are they different,
why are UK crowds.

00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:26.297
- Well my thing is I don't
think,

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:28.633
'cause American's don't
have much holidays,

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:30.135
you have two weeks holiday

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:32.512
so I think when you go
out it has to matter.

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:34.305
Whereas in the UK, we have five
weeks off

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:35.765
so yeah.

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:37.726
- Oh so your vacation time
you're like...

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:40.478
- I think you put so much
energy into an evening out

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:43.148
because you have to work
so hard in this country,

00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:45.984
that you are gonna make sure
it's good.

00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:46.818
- [Nikki] So you get.

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:49.237
- I know at least one person
listening

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:52.115
that when you say that you hear
god damn right we work hard.

00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:53.366
- No but absolutely.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:56.619
- Like where it gets
fucking, god damn right,

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.163
80 hours a week.

00:08:58.163 --> 00:08:59.289
- It's hammer and irons.

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:01.291
- But musical festival it just
blew my

00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:02.333
and there was in Coachella,

00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:04.043
there were certain areas
where you were allowed to take

00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:05.962
booze but others you weren't.

00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:06.796
- Yeah.

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:07.630
- So weird.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:11.718
- We basically are still
children like we're.

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:13.386
- But at a musical festival
that's like

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:15.096
if you go to like Glastonbury.

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:17.390
I'm remember driving like I was
backstage,

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.767
I was doing a gig there
and I'm kind of driving

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:20.268
a car through.

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:21.853
- A little steering wheel
- There's like thousands

00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:22.979
I'm like driving through.

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:26.357
And there's the guy,
this guy was shit faced

00:09:26.357 --> 00:09:29.235
probably about 50 at the time
and I turned to my girlfriend

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.904
and was like that's my uncle.

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:32.489
Like in the middle of all these
people

00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:34.657
there's this old guy
that was just bollocksed,

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:36.409
and that's what the UK gigs are
like,

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:39.496
just music gigs people just
wasted.

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:42.040
There's always one bloke that
will wake up

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.751
in Glastonbury after the
festival counting eggs

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:47.545
in some factory, he's been
stolen by some Christian's

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:49.339
in some weird commune.

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:50.256
- [Dan] And just shipped off.

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:51.800
- Mate it's proper wild.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.011
So it was amazing to see
everybody here's your beer area.

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:58.598
- Very organized,
everyone's dressed so cute.

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:01.601
- Oh my little daisy flower
crown.

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:03.520
- Yep, yep, have you
been to Coachella before?

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.563
- Never will and never will
- I don't think I'll ever go

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:07.857
either, burning man I
might I feel like that.

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:10.652
- Bono roo twice got it.

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:11.569
- Yeah Bonnaroo.

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:12.403
- Jazz fest.

00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:13.655
- Glastonbury's worth going to
though,

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:16.533
if you wanna sort of see a side
of England

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:18.201
that you probably
haven't seen in the films

00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:19.536
that come out over here.

00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:21.371
Go there and you'll see a wild
side.

00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:23.206
- Just getting fuck, you
guys just get hammered.

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:24.040
- [Russell] Yeah it's great.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.875
- Drinking is more I feel like
in the UK

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:27.585
drinking is a lot more.

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.921
- It's like the fucking purge at
weekends.

00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:30.755
- [Dan] Really.

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:32.924
- Like (horn) we have two days
to live.

00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:35.885
- Don't you like drinking, I
don't know you get off earlier.

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:37.762
- Are we just very
unhappy people, just get.

00:10:37.762 --> 00:10:40.682
- Cloudy all the time, you
guys are just fucking hammered.

00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:41.808
- Pale and disgusting.

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:43.852
- Dan do you miss drinking,
ever.

00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:44.811
- Sometimes.

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:45.645
- Like when?

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:47.147
- I had a moment about two weeks
ago

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:49.190
where I could feel the
back of my jaw fucking

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.109
starting to water 'cause I was
like

00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:52.861
I just want a shot of whisky and
a beer.

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:53.695
- Really?

00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:54.654
- And then immediately was like,

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:55.572
that's why I shouldn't have it.

00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:56.573
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:56.573 --> 00:11:00.785
- So is that just because
you will just go so wild.

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:03.788
- Walk by like a really Irish
dive bar.

00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:06.040
- And is it but you think
you won't just have one,

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:06.875
you'll just have.

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:08.543
- Fucking 12 buddy.
- There's no one.

00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:09.627
- I ain't coming back for one,

00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:11.921
what do you think I'm just gonna
stop.

00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:14.966
- But it's really because
my friend Al is an alcoholic

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:17.802
he is exactly, it always
fascinates me

00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:20.013
that you just can't have that.

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:21.306
- I always was blown away,

00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:23.683
I'm more upset with people
that can have a drink

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:26.644
and walk away, I think
you're the fucking weirdos.

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:27.687
- Yeah okay.

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:29.105
- I stay there 'till the very
end.

00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:30.398
- I know.
- What happened to commitment?

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:31.232
- I used to.

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:32.191
- What happened to
seeing something through?

00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:34.193
- I used to say to my friends,
I'd be like

00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:36.154
let's get blackout time

00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:38.531
I'd wanna blackout
- Oh my god I would do this,

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:40.033
We're gonna get hammered.

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:42.452
- That's what I miss,
Dan that is what I miss

00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:46.164
is like we're gonna drink,
we're gonna ah, excitement.

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:49.417
- Yannis Parpis upset me
so much because one time

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:50.793
he put half a beer down and he
goes,

00:11:50.793 --> 00:11:54.589
I'm gonna walk out of here,
I don't want that half a beer

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:56.049
and I go I'm gonna drink that
beer

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:57.550
and he goes that's why
I put it right there,

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.509
he goes that's who you are.

00:11:58.509 --> 00:11:59.552
- Yep, you're like
- You're gonna drink half

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:01.346
my beer and I was like fucking I
am.

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:03.890
- I am that girl too yep yep.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.017
(crosstalk)

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:08.978
It ain't a fucking
handshake and how you doing.

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:10.980
- Well you are going to
Scotland for a month.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:11.940
- I've already know.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:12.857
- It's gonna be tough.

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:15.026
- I know that, every single
person I know

00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:17.904
that knows I'm going over
there is they're like alright

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:18.821
be cool.

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:20.031
I mean I've already asked my
publicist,

00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:21.824
I was like I need weed
just give me whatever,

00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:23.701
I smoke weed.

00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:24.911
- I'll get you a sex robot if
you want.

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:27.705
- Yes, I can't wait to
have my penis crushed.

00:12:27.705 --> 00:12:29.749
- Do you ever feel.

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:32.335
- You see the sex robot
drinking, it's the only way I
can

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:34.253
- I'll go are you drunk,
she's like I have to,

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:35.922
this is how I warm up.

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:38.716
I go alright well you
seem a little hammered.

00:12:38.716 --> 00:12:40.176
(laughter)

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:43.513
This is how, this what
lubricates my robotic vagina

00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:44.639
is Guinness.

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:46.474
- (laughs) Guinness.

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:48.810
- Yeah I'm nervous man,
I'm really nervous.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.771
- Well with weed, I struggle
with that

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:53.773
and I talk about it a lot
on the show is that you know

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:57.986
I love weed and it doesn't
ruin my life the way alcohol

00:12:57.986 --> 00:12:59.862
did and I can still function,

00:12:59.862 --> 00:13:02.699
highly function literally on
weed.

00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:05.827
Do you feel the same, do you
ever feel guilty about it,

00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:08.246
do you ever feel like hey
I'm gonna stop doing this.

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:09.789
- It's so weird because that
rubbing your hands together

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:11.666
when you're getting hammered
thing

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:13.501
I'm like when I'm done
with this radio show

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:17.046
I'm going home and getting
fucking ripped.

00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:19.882
I'm smoking a joint, I'm
gonna watch that documentary

00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:22.677
about Elizabeth and yeah.

00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:25.638
I get high the way I you know
drink.

00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:28.766
- Yes, very very high.

00:13:28.766 --> 00:13:30.935
- I get very high and I love it.

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:32.687
- And I love it too, I have the
same,

00:13:32.687 --> 00:13:36.024
Andrew's seen my when
I get done with shows

00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:39.527
and I'm like I get to
have a joint, and it's.

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:40.945
- I smoke before shows
- In between shows,

00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:41.779
before shows.

00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:43.448
Oh see we used to talk
about this and you're like

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:46.868
you know what I do, I do it like
a treat,

00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:51.247
you do the whole like I
do it only after shows,

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:53.207
I do it when I get home, I eat
my salad.

00:13:53.207 --> 00:13:55.626
(laughter)

00:13:55.626 --> 00:13:57.920
Dan doesn't smoke weed before
his sets,

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.923
I gotta be more like Dan,
thank you for admitting

00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:01.841
that you do now.

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:05.803
- Oh my god what it is, is
it's like a it's to the point

00:14:05.803 --> 00:14:08.806
where you know getting high I
think,

00:14:08.806 --> 00:14:11.017
I talk about getting high the
same way

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:12.310
I used to talk about quitting
drinking,

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.270
where I'd be like I don't drink
whiskey,

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.354
I only have beer.

00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:19.776
Yeah and that's what it
is I'm like only Indica.

00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:22.195
- Do you really only do Indica?

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:23.279
- No, I smoke everything.

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:24.989
- No like it's.

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:26.032
- You give me fucking dirt weed

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:27.366
and I'd be like you gonna roll
this up.

00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:29.994
- Yep you can Yannis you with
half of a.

00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:32.205
- You leave a roach,
I'll fucking smoke it.

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:35.249
- But when you did the gravity
bong hit and you ended up.

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:36.084
- Do you know what a gravity
bong hit,

00:14:36.084 --> 00:14:36.918
do you know what a gravity bong
is?

00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:38.044
- I don't know what you're
talking about

00:14:38.044 --> 00:14:39.337
I'll be honest with you, I erm.

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:42.298
- 'Cause weed is not, is
weed not big in the UK

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:43.758
as much as it is here?

00:14:43.758 --> 00:14:46.135
- Not as a sort of teenage thing
no,

00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:49.347
you sort of you just drink
from like 14 in the UK.

00:14:49.347 --> 00:14:50.556
- And that's what I mean.

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:53.101
- Where as you guys start off
weed then.

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:54.102
- Yeah that's true.

00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:55.478
- [Russell] We're already in
pubs I think.

00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:57.146
- Yeah so you guys are
'cause you can go to a pub

00:14:57.146 --> 00:14:58.648
and just have a pint.

00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:01.651
- Yeah there's always one
place where some dodgy guy

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:03.736
will let you in and
everyone kind of goes in.

00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:05.613
- And here in America they
really are like

00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:08.574
no child should ever drink
alcohol.

00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:10.743
- But you need ID, you
don't need ID to get

00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:13.704
into pubs in the UK but
you sort of still do here.

00:15:13.704 --> 00:15:14.539
- [Nikki] Yes.

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:17.125
- I smoked pot with my
mom in Portland last year

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:18.501
for a TV show that we did.

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:19.335
- How was it?

00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:21.254
- It was great fun, yeah my
mom had never done it before.

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:22.630
- Really?
- Wow.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:23.464
- My mom.

00:15:23.464 --> 00:15:24.298
- [Russell] Go on.

00:15:24.298 --> 00:15:25.925
- No I was gonna say
my mom used to get high

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.051
in the 60s and 70s.

00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:27.885
- Oh really.

00:15:27.885 --> 00:15:29.679
- And then it got legal
in Colorado, she was like.

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:31.639
- It's a different thing now.

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:32.890
- I'm gonna smoke weed with you

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.600
and we smoked weed and it's
not fun watching your mom

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.394
not be able to handle her shit.

00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:37.979
- Oh no!

00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:40.773
- That's not fun watching
your mom being like.

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:41.732
- Oh my god.

00:15:41.732 --> 00:15:45.945
- We were this girls, this
girl that ran this shop

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:48.072
we kind went back to her
place and we kind of did

00:15:48.072 --> 00:15:49.615
various versions of it.

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:51.284
And she had this lovely little
Chihuahua

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:52.827
and by the end of the session

00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:54.662
you could tell that my mom was
eyeing up

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:55.997
that dog to eat.

00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:58.082
Like genuinely we were
kind of going I said

00:15:58.082 --> 00:15:59.208
would you have eaten that dog.

00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:00.710
She was like yeah I would have
definitely,

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.044
I'd have put it on a George
Foreman grill

00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:03.254
and eaten it in a bun.

00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:04.755
- With the form in there.

00:16:04.755 --> 00:16:06.883
- Yeah, we're imaging how
we were gonna cook it.

00:16:06.883 --> 00:16:09.468
- What a fuck and the
Chihuahua's just sitting

00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:10.928
in the room going who the fuck
are you.

00:16:10.928 --> 00:16:14.891
- Well the dog seemed to
be like these guys are new.

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:16.225
- So watching your mom get high.

00:16:16.225 --> 00:16:18.895
- It is interesting
seeing your parents get

00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:21.147
like my parents get, when I see
them high

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:23.566
I love my mom high, she's a
delight

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:25.484
and she likes filming things.

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:26.611
That's her new thing when she
gets high,

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:30.698
she will just start
filming us and cabentry

00:16:30.698 --> 00:16:31.741
and like around the house.

00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:33.367
She just wants to document
the house 'cause I think

00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:34.911
we're gonna sell it soon.

00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:37.413
And I go dad what is she doing
and he goes that's your mom

00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:39.040
new thing 'cause my mom
always has a new thing

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.416
when she gets fucked up that
she'll like.

00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:43.169
For many years she was calling
us all,

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:46.422
or she would fire us if we got
mad,

00:16:46.422 --> 00:16:48.507
she'd be like you're
fired and we'd be like

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:50.343
mom fired me three times last
night.

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:51.302
- I love that.

00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:53.512
My mom says hello to me all
the time when she get hello

00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:54.597
hello, hello.

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:57.767
(crosstalk)

00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:00.394
- My mom would get wine teeth

00:17:00.394 --> 00:17:03.189
and they'd get like purple
you know she would just cry

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:05.524
about things that don't exist
anymore.

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:06.359
- [Andrew] Like what?

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.861
- She's like Osco Drug closed,

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:12.198
I used to buy your birthday
cards there.

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:13.616
And you're like crying,
are we really crying

00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:16.077
'cause the fucking drug store
closed.

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:19.455
- My mom did I reckon a 40
minute long improvised song

00:17:19.455 --> 00:17:22.917
when she was drunk, two
Christmas ago.

00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:23.751
- [Dan] Yeah!

00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:25.253
- Taking my nan shopping.

00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:26.545
- And she just.

00:17:26.545 --> 00:17:28.589
- There was this great moment
where about 10 minutes in

00:17:28.589 --> 00:17:31.342
my dad turned to my brother
went go get the camera.

00:17:31.342 --> 00:17:32.468
- Yeah!

00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:33.344
- Like that to record it.

00:17:33.344 --> 00:17:35.221
- Did you know you had another
half hour.

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:38.307
- Was she liking grabbing her
ear like getting into it like.

00:17:38.307 --> 00:17:39.684
- Well lot's of my cousins play
in bands

00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:40.935
so they were just sort
of just playing along

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:42.645
and mom just grabbed it I'll
give you one

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:45.064
and it was this awful and
yet beautiful freestyle.

00:17:45.064 --> 00:17:46.691
♪ We're down the aisle ♪

00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:49.819
♪ What does she want, today
she might want chicken ♪

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:51.529
♪ Or she might not cause ♪

00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:52.947
and it just went on.

00:17:52.947 --> 00:17:55.574
- So that when she looks at
the guy playing the bass like

00:17:55.574 --> 00:17:57.785
- It was and it kind of
they weirdly go in to it.

00:17:57.785 --> 00:18:00.997
- That's so funny she goes a
little more.

00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:03.541
(laughing)

00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.876
and she's like yeah yeah how
they all bring it together

00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:09.422
and she's like (terrible
singing)

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:11.424
(laughter)

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:13.259
that's fucking awesome.

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:15.052
- And she kept threatening to
stop,

00:18:15.052 --> 00:18:17.680
do you know what I mean and
then she'd find another aisle.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.890
What's this, it's bread, it's
bread.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:21.350
- Oh that's a great setting for
a song,

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.893
you can just have a lot of
adventures.

00:18:22.893 --> 00:18:25.271
- Exactly but what was funny
about it in a real OCD way

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:27.398
she did every, she did like the

00:18:27.398 --> 00:18:28.774
- She hit the bull candies.

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:29.984
- Then she did the milk exactly.

00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:31.277
- She took a sample.

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:32.778
- If I'm playing in the band I
go

00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:35.656

00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:36.991
(laughter)

00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:39.452
The bridge and the dairy song.

00:18:40.411 --> 00:18:42.121
- I'll just get the pack of gum.

00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:43.456
- [Nikki] Yeah yeah yeah.

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:45.708
- Put it back, put it back.

00:18:46.917 --> 00:18:49.920

where were like nectar
cards and all the kind of

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:58.346
so she did like a sort
of freestyle rap about.

00:18:58.346 --> 00:18:59.221
- Oh yeah yeah.

00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:04.060
- Oh that would be great if
she started busting out bars.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.228
- It was absolutely wonderful.

00:19:06.228 --> 00:19:07.772
- Oh man hammered moms.

00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:10.024
- I know hammered moms,
I mean we run the game

00:19:10.024 --> 00:19:13.110
and my mom has catchphrases.
- Oh really.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.489
- Yeah, she fires us and then
for a while it was bi-atches

00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:18.240
she called everyone bi-atches.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.034
She just learned that word,
loved it

00:19:20.034 --> 00:19:21.285
and now she's filming people.

00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:22.411
- Cool beans.

00:19:22.411 --> 00:19:23.496
- Cool beans.

00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:26.665
- She'd get hammered and
she'd be like cool beans.

00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:27.625
And you go don't fucking.

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:28.667
- [Nikki] Oh god.

00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:31.670
- You know what we should do
is, we should do a competition

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:32.505
where
- A talent show.

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:35.966
- No where you're driving,

00:19:35.966 --> 00:19:37.718
you have to drive to a city

00:19:37.718 --> 00:19:40.137
and they get your mom hammered.

00:19:40.137 --> 00:19:43.265
She gets in the car and you
have to drive her there.

00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:44.100
- Oh my god.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:47.019
- Could you make it, your mom's
hammered.

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:49.730
- That is such a good
show I would watch that.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:52.149
- Shut the fuck up mom, shut the
fuck up.

00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:54.110
- I've done that I mean I
traveled all across America

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.944
with my mom.

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:55.778
- Really?

00:19:55.778 --> 00:19:56.612
- Oh for a show?

00:19:56.612 --> 00:19:58.781
- Yeah for a TV show and
then Thailand and India.

00:19:58.781 --> 00:19:59.615
- [Nikki] Wow.

00:19:59.615 --> 00:20:02.284
- I was in a traffic jam
with my mom whilst sober

00:20:02.284 --> 00:20:05.037
and I'm famous in the UK
so this guy kind of got out

00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:07.164
we were in traffic, knocked on
the window

00:20:07.164 --> 00:20:09.542
and just went excuse
me can I have a photo,

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:10.668
which is fairly strange.

00:20:10.668 --> 00:20:13.963
And my mom went help he's
kidnapping me.

00:20:15.297 --> 00:20:16.632
- Oh your mom's hilarious.

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:18.551
- So I said afterwards
why did you do that.

00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:20.761
- She said 'cause I'm 60
and I don't give a fuck.

00:20:20.761 --> 00:20:21.595
- I love your mom.

00:20:21.595 --> 00:20:23.722
- And that was her sober so
drunk, phew.

00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:26.308
- Your mom is fun,
rapping 40 minute songs.

00:20:26.308 --> 00:20:28.519
- This is it mate, that's why
I took her around the world.

00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:29.812
- Oh that makes sense and now
you have

00:20:29.812 --> 00:20:34.066
like I also use my
parents a lot in my show

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:35.234
and when I had a show on Comedy
Central

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:37.111
and also like my mom calls into
this show.

00:20:37.111 --> 00:20:37.945
- Oh really.

00:20:37.945 --> 00:20:39.738
- I just realized like
when she passes away

00:20:39.738 --> 00:20:42.575
at some point like I'm gonna
have all this great footage

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:43.993
and people are like why do
you take a blow job class

00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:45.453
with your mom and I'm
like 'cause it's funny

00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:48.122
and I'm gonna look back on it
and.

00:20:48.122 --> 00:20:50.082
- And dad wanted us both there.

00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:51.667
(laughter)

00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:54.253
- This was dad's idea,
he wrote this scene mom.

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:56.881
- But do you have to, do you
think about that as well.

00:20:56.881 --> 00:20:59.967
Like when your mom's
funeral is, god forbid

00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:01.760
it's in many many years,
it's gonna be like

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.846
we won't have those
traditional kind of like

00:21:03.846 --> 00:21:05.014
oh yeah I remember her like,

00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:07.391
I'll remember her in a
cacao ceremony in Thailand.

00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:08.225
- [Nikki] Yes.

00:21:08.225 --> 00:21:09.518
- Do you know what I mean
you have all these weird

00:21:09.518 --> 00:21:10.603
kind of strange moments.

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:11.437
- [Nikki] Yes.

00:21:11.437 --> 00:21:12.938
- I just remember playing
solitaire in a room in the dark

00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:14.064
that's all I got.

00:21:14.064 --> 00:21:16.859
- But the reason why, it
was for Comedy Central.

00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:19.111
- I'll remember some things
like that too don't worry.

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:21.489
- I remember videoing that,
that was a beautiful moment.

00:21:21.489 --> 00:21:23.616
I'll never forget that but
when she's eating a hot dog

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:25.826
with no bun with too much
ketchup in her hands,

00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:27.786
I'll always remember that.

00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:29.163
- Oh man if my mom weren't
listening,

00:21:29.163 --> 00:21:31.165
I would join in on this.

00:21:32.875 --> 00:21:34.043
These descriptions.

00:21:34.043 --> 00:21:35.711
- So your mom's listening
now, that's pretty cool.

00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:36.962
- I assume she might.

00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:37.796
- You're fired.

00:21:37.796 --> 00:21:39.548
- She sometimes listens
when they're hanging out.

00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:41.800
- You start bringing her phrases
out,

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.636
what's up bi-atches.
- Nikki you're fired.

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:44.720
- I really like fired
I think that's great.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.765
- You know what Nik, you
know what Nik, screw you

00:21:47.765 --> 00:21:49.558
that's what she would say.

00:21:49.558 --> 00:21:50.559
Screw you.

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:53.270
- Ashley Heseltine and
Rayna Greenberg were on

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:55.314
the show yesterday show with
Andrew,

00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:57.399
there's picture that I posted on
my story

00:21:57.399 --> 00:21:59.276
and I cut Andrew out
because the three girl

00:21:59.276 --> 00:22:00.778
I just wanted to celebrate
women.

00:22:00.778 --> 00:22:01.612
- Yep.

00:22:01.612 --> 00:22:02.530
- And then not you.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:03.989
And so then I posted another
picture

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:04.990
where it was just you.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:08.285
- And at first I felt
like it was like a dig

00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:10.329
but then I was like oh
no it's kind of nice

00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:11.330
like you showed me again.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:12.873
Like when you cut me
off but then put me in.

00:22:12.873 --> 00:22:13.707
- Yeah.

00:22:13.707 --> 00:22:14.708
- But at first I took it as a
dig.

00:22:14.708 --> 00:22:15.834
- No I didn't want it to be a
dig.

00:22:15.834 --> 00:22:18.254
- I'm gonna white her out and so
then I,

00:22:18.254 --> 00:22:19.672
made you a penis.

00:22:22.591 --> 00:22:23.425
- Okay.

00:22:23.425 --> 00:22:24.718
- I posted it for a second and
then I go

00:22:24.718 --> 00:22:26.136
wait that's just mean spirited.

00:22:26.136 --> 00:22:28.889
- Yeah you just drew me as
a big and it looks like,

00:22:28.889 --> 00:22:31.934
that looks like it
doesn't look like a penis

00:22:31.934 --> 00:22:33.519
you didn't even do it the right
color,

00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:35.437
it's just a white blob.

00:22:36.438 --> 00:22:38.023
Yeah it looks like I'm.

00:22:38.023 --> 00:22:39.316
- But I felt like that
was probably a little rude

00:22:39.316 --> 00:22:41.485
so I deleted it right away.

00:22:41.485 --> 00:22:43.445
- Well I'm glad you
showed it to me right now.

00:22:43.445 --> 00:22:45.864
(rock music)

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:49.368
- Oh my god

00:22:50.619 --> 00:22:52.454
I know what I wanna do.

00:22:52.454 --> 00:22:54.540
Can I get a pen and paper
I just wanna challenge

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.834
Andrew to draw something.

00:22:56.834 --> 00:22:58.627
You know that guy from Brazil
that I was telling you about

00:22:58.627 --> 00:22:59.461
so the other night,

00:22:59.461 --> 00:23:01.255
he was talking about how
like oh he's gonna move

00:23:01.255 --> 00:23:03.007
to New York because the flight
to Brazil

00:23:03.007 --> 00:23:05.593
is so much shorter than it is
from LA.

00:23:05.593 --> 00:23:07.136
And I was like oh I guess that
checks out

00:23:07.136 --> 00:23:09.597
and he's like yeah like
they're an hour ahead right now

00:23:09.597 --> 00:23:12.474
and I was like what do you
mean they're an hour ahead.

00:23:12.474 --> 00:23:13.475
- Who's an hour ahead?

00:23:13.475 --> 00:23:14.310
- Brazil.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:15.144
- From where?

00:23:15.144 --> 00:23:15.978
- New York.

00:23:15.978 --> 00:23:16.812
- Okay.

00:23:16.812 --> 00:23:18.564
- And I was like that does not
match up

00:23:18.564 --> 00:23:20.274
with where I think Brazil is.

00:23:20.274 --> 00:23:23.611
And then I realized my
perception of where

00:23:23.611 --> 00:23:27.114
South America is is so
wrong, can I ask you

00:23:27.114 --> 00:23:28.365
I just wanna see if I'm as,

00:23:28.365 --> 00:23:30.200
'cause I mean this was
embarrassing in front of someone

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.454
from South America to see where
I thought South America was

00:23:33.454 --> 00:23:37.166
in comparison to North America
was.

00:23:37.166 --> 00:23:39.793
I'm gonna draw, you draw.

00:23:39.793 --> 00:23:41.962
- From Florida I think I
might have a better sense

00:23:41.962 --> 00:23:43.505
because you're from St. Louis.

00:23:43.505 --> 00:23:44.340
- Yeah.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.258
Like I don't know Missouri,
Kansas,

00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:47.843
I couldn't tell you those
places.

00:23:47.843 --> 00:23:49.803
- Well that would be a fun
one to make you draw then.

00:23:49.803 --> 00:23:50.929
- So what do you want me to draw
here?

00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:52.598
- Erm North America and South
America,

00:23:52.598 --> 00:23:53.932
and they can be blobs
I'm not gonna like check

00:23:53.932 --> 00:23:57.853
if you know and don't even
put Canada, who cares.

00:23:57.853 --> 00:24:00.522
- Yeah, no-one does, this is
like a ...

00:24:00.522 --> 00:24:01.774
Like all of it.

00:24:02.941 --> 00:24:07.863
- Someone wrote to me being
like I heard you threw some sh.

00:24:10.491 --> 00:24:13.744
Oh wait a second I mean
maybe we're not gonna get

00:24:13.744 --> 00:24:14.578
out of this.

00:24:14.578 --> 00:24:16.664
- It's not to scale.

00:24:16.664 --> 00:24:18.707
- That's not, that's not to
nothing,

00:24:18.707 --> 00:24:20.459
you don't need to draw like
islands

00:24:20.459 --> 00:24:22.753
and the Gulf stream, deltas.

00:24:25.297 --> 00:24:26.131
- And then.

00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:27.132
- He put in the Bahamas.

00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:27.966
- No.

00:24:27.966 --> 00:24:29.593
- Okay.

00:24:29.593 --> 00:24:30.427
What is that?

00:24:30.427 --> 00:24:32.054
- Mexico.

00:24:32.054 --> 00:24:32.888
- Okay.

00:24:32.888 --> 00:24:34.431
- I think that's right I don't
know.

00:24:34.431 --> 00:24:36.100
- Is that Florida right there?

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.852
- And then I would say
somewhere,

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:44.066
I know there's Chile is
over here and then Brazil

00:24:44.066 --> 00:24:45.401
is around here.

00:24:45.401 --> 00:24:46.360
- It doesn't matter I
just wanted the shapes

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.404
of South America and North
America.

00:24:48.404 --> 00:24:49.238
- Well shit.

00:24:49.238 --> 00:24:52.741
- Just start over, okay this
looks like a crude drawing

00:24:52.741 --> 00:24:53.826
of a suspect.

00:24:55.119 --> 00:24:57.579
First of all, he thinks that's
Florida.

00:24:57.579 --> 00:24:59.331
- No no that's California.

00:24:59.331 --> 00:25:02.334
- That's Florida and then this
was

00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:03.961
supposed to be Mexico.
- That's Mexico.

00:25:03.961 --> 00:25:05.087
- So Mexico starts at

00:25:05.087 --> 00:25:08.590
and he said before he drew this,

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.218
he said I might know
this a little bit better

00:25:11.218 --> 00:25:12.845
because I'm from Florida.

00:25:12.845 --> 00:25:16.765
He connected Florida and Mexico
you guys.

00:25:16.765 --> 00:25:18.892
- You gotta close the border.
- Do you know how wrong that's

00:25:18.892 --> 00:25:20.728
- Of Florida

00:25:20.728 --> 00:25:23.522
- You wanna build that wall
well actually that wall

00:25:23.522 --> 00:25:27.276
the border doesn't even exist
that you wanna build up.

00:25:27.276 --> 00:25:28.944
Hold on we have to just see, I'm
sorry

00:25:28.944 --> 00:25:31.029
the podcast has gotta wait for a
second

00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:32.823
'cause I need to make you draw
this okay,

00:25:32.823 --> 00:25:37.369
so draw just the crude
shapes, blobs of South America

00:25:37.369 --> 00:25:39.538
and just I wanna see their
location to each other.

00:25:39.538 --> 00:25:43.125
- Okay, that's America
and then I would say

00:25:45.127 --> 00:25:47.963
that somewhere around here
and then South America

00:25:47.963 --> 00:25:50.048
kinda like that and then.

00:25:55.304 --> 00:25:56.472
- Okay.

00:25:56.472 --> 00:25:58.390
- And then there's like Chile
and here's.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:00.684
- I don't need, that's
not even close to where

00:26:00.684 --> 00:26:03.187
Chile or Brazil are, Chile's
on this side by the way.

00:26:03.187 --> 00:26:04.480
- No Chile's on the right.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.148
- Is Chile on the right or left?

00:26:06.148 --> 00:26:07.232
- [Man] Left.

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:09.610
- Chile's on this side dude.

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:10.486
- I was cold.

00:26:10.486 --> 00:26:13.489
- Okay okay this is way
worse than I thought

00:26:13.489 --> 00:26:15.741
it was gonna be and I
am so excited about it

00:26:15.741 --> 00:26:16.575
'cause I thought he was gonna.

00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:18.869
- Well Mexico's in between
and there's central America.

00:26:18.869 --> 00:26:22.247
- I'm gonna blow you pull
up, pull up a world map,

00:26:22.247 --> 00:26:23.582
I'm gonna blow your mind right
now.

00:26:23.582 --> 00:26:25.000
First of all I thought this as
well,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.253
this was what my drawing looked
like.

00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:31.590
- Okay first of all, we live in
America.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.468
- This is what my drawing
looked like the other night,

00:26:34.468 --> 00:26:35.302
that's where I was like.

00:26:35.302 --> 00:26:36.136
- Okay.

00:26:36.136 --> 00:26:38.305
- Right okay, mine's further
away.

00:26:38.305 --> 00:26:39.473
- Similar right.

00:26:39.473 --> 00:26:40.307
- Okay.

00:26:40.307 --> 00:26:41.558
- Okay, look at the map
of where South America is

00:26:41.558 --> 00:26:43.602
compared to the United States.

00:26:43.602 --> 00:26:44.895
- Should I do a globe?

00:26:44.895 --> 00:26:47.147
- No just pull up Google
Maps and then zoom out.

00:26:47.147 --> 00:26:47.981
- Oh.

00:26:47.981 --> 00:26:50.901
- He's loading transit maps
for San Atonio for some reason

00:26:50.901 --> 00:26:52.319
- You never know.

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:55.197
- Keep zooming, keep going.

00:26:55.197 --> 00:26:56.114
- Oh god.

00:26:56.114 --> 00:26:59.201
- Isn't it worse than you
thought dude.

00:26:59.201 --> 00:27:01.995
- Okay wait a second, oh right,

00:27:01.995 --> 00:27:05.707
no-one knows it's to the
right, no-one knew that.

00:27:05.707 --> 00:27:07.793
- So this is where it is.

00:27:07.793 --> 00:27:09.628
- Okay we've both thought.

00:27:09.628 --> 00:27:13.257
- I never knew that, I
thought that if you go down

00:27:13.257 --> 00:27:16.051
from LA you would hit
South America immediately.

00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:19.596
I didn't know by the way,
you don't hit anything.

00:27:19.596 --> 00:27:21.890
If you go south from New York
- Yes.

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:22.724
You hit nothing.

00:27:22.724 --> 00:27:23.559
- Nothing.

00:27:23.559 --> 00:27:25.519
- North America is completely to
the left.

00:27:25.519 --> 00:27:28.272
- So why is it not south east
America.

00:27:28.272 --> 00:27:31.108
- I don't know I feel like
we need to get this message

00:27:31.108 --> 00:27:32.776
out there because clearly
people don't know.

00:27:32.776 --> 00:27:35.696
I really thought it was right
under us.

00:27:35.696 --> 00:27:39.992
- Is there north, was
America at north and south

00:27:39.992 --> 00:27:42.828
called at the same time
or was one found before.

00:27:42.828 --> 00:27:44.955
- They named them both at he
same time.

00:27:44.955 --> 00:27:46.874
- I don't know, was there a
North America.

00:27:46.874 --> 00:27:50.085
- One was named after Amerigo
Vespucci.

00:27:50.085 --> 00:27:50.919
- Okay.

00:27:50.919 --> 00:27:55.173
- Who was a explorer.
- A designer for Gucci yeah.

00:27:55.173 --> 00:27:57.092
We have to start to buy gas.
- In front of his house.

00:27:57.092 --> 00:28:00.721
- We can't get into all
this, we know all of this,

00:28:00.721 --> 00:28:05.142
we know all, like we have
discussed this for hours about
the

00:28:05.142 --> 00:28:07.227
- It is always kind of
annoying when two dumb people

00:28:07.227 --> 00:28:09.396
are like, or I'm dumb.

00:28:09.396 --> 00:28:12.232
- No I'm really dumb with that
geography.

00:28:12.232 --> 00:28:14.735
- And we go and Google exists.

00:28:15.777 --> 00:28:17.946
Back in the day you'd be
like whoa you gotta go

00:28:17.946 --> 00:28:20.866
to the library or whatever,
you gotta phone a friend.

00:28:20.866 --> 00:28:23.911
But now it's like shut
up, stop sounding stupid

00:28:23.911 --> 00:28:26.246
and Google it but then again
it's like

00:28:26.246 --> 00:28:28.790
I have no idea what America came
first

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.500
and maybe we shouldn't
call it South America

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.669
because it is south of America.

00:28:32.669 --> 00:28:35.172
- But maybe we're north of South
America,

00:28:35.172 --> 00:28:37.466
so we should be North South
America,

00:28:37.466 --> 00:28:38.800
do you know what I mean
like it should start

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.136
with South America, like you
know.

00:28:41.136 --> 00:28:43.221
- Well yeah I'm just saying
like,

00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:45.891
why are we just calling it South
America,

00:28:45.891 --> 00:28:49.645
are we calling it like,
shouldn't it be it's own thing.

00:28:49.645 --> 00:28:50.604
- I get what you're saying.

00:28:50.604 --> 00:28:52.731
- Like there's Australia,
there's Africa

00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:54.983
so it should be North America.

00:28:54.983 --> 00:28:57.569
- Why do we even look at the,
why do we look at a world map

00:28:57.569 --> 00:29:00.322
from the vantage point that we
all do

00:29:00.322 --> 00:29:02.866
where it's like this and
Asia's over here, Africa.

00:29:02.866 --> 00:29:04.409
Like why couldn't it be upside
down

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:06.328
because who's to say how
to look at the world,

00:29:06.328 --> 00:29:08.872
what's right side up and what's
not.

00:29:08.872 --> 00:29:11.083
We're really smart and we
can talk about this all day

00:29:11.083 --> 00:29:12.167
but we gotta get to.

00:29:12.167 --> 00:29:15.212
- I think it's plate tectonics
actually.

00:29:15.212 --> 00:29:17.547
- There is something, that is a
thing.

00:29:17.547 --> 00:29:20.509
- There's a, I don't
think the Earth is flat,

00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:22.052
I'll give it that.

00:29:22.052 --> 00:29:25.055
- Yeah no shit.
- I don't know why.

00:29:25.055 --> 00:29:27.557
- You don't know why the Earth
isn't flat.

00:29:27.557 --> 00:29:30.477
- I don't know something
about if you fly a plane

00:29:30.477 --> 00:29:32.145
you gotta go around.

00:29:33.689 --> 00:29:36.066
- Oh that's funny you gotta go
like down,

00:29:36.066 --> 00:29:38.026
you gotta make it turn at one
point.

00:29:38.026 --> 00:29:38.860
- Yeah you probably.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:39.695
- Or you just.

00:29:39.695 --> 00:29:40.570
- Or you would just keep going.

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:41.488
- Into space.

00:29:41.488 --> 00:29:42.322
- Yeah.

00:29:42.322 --> 00:29:43.365
- Alright, we learn something.

00:29:43.365 --> 00:29:47.077
- Yeah if you're on like
a mountain, mapping.

00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:53.333
- That was fun, let's
start the podcast ready.

00:29:53.333 --> 00:29:54.167
Are you ready?

00:29:54.167 --> 00:29:55.002
- I'm ready.

00:29:55.002 --> 00:29:58.755
- Alright, hey guys welcome
to You Up the podcast.

00:29:58.755 --> 00:30:01.258
