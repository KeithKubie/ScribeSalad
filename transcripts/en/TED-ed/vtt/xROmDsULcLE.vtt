00:00:06.538 --> 00:00:08.128
Baked or fried,

00:00:08.128 --> 00:00:09.601
boiled or roasted,

00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:11.581
as chips or fries.

00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:15.198
At some point in your life,
you've probably eaten a potato.

00:00:15.198 --> 00:00:16.660
Delicious, for sure,

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.967
but the fact is potatoes have played a
much more significant role in our history

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:26.365
than just that of the dietary staple
we have come to know and love today.

00:00:26.365 --> 00:00:27.806
Without the potato,

00:00:27.806 --> 00:00:31.379
our modern civilization 
might not exist at all.

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:35.141
8,000 years ago in South America,
high atop the Andes,

00:00:35.141 --> 00:00:38.755
ancient Peruvians were the first
to cultivate the potato.

00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:41.464
Containing high levels of proteins
and carbohydrates,

00:00:41.464 --> 00:00:44.640
as well as essential fats, vitamins
and minerals,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.363
potatoes were the perfect food source
to fuel a large Incan working class

00:00:49.363 --> 00:00:52.060
as they built and farmed 
their terraced fields,

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.698
mined the Rocky Mountains,

00:00:53.698 --> 00:00:58.492
and created the sophisticated civilization
of the great Incan Empire.

00:00:58.492 --> 00:01:01.211
But considering how vital they were
to the Incan people,

00:01:01.211 --> 00:01:03.623
when Spanish sailors 
returning from the Andes

00:01:03.623 --> 00:01:05.940
first brought potatoes to Europe,

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.096
the spuds were duds.

00:01:08.096 --> 00:01:09.860
Europeans simply didn't want to eat

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.229
what they considered dull and tasteless
oddities from a strange new land,

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.279
too closely related to the deadly
nightshade plant belladonna for comfort.

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:20.853
So instead of consuming them,

00:01:20.853 --> 00:01:24.901
they used potatoes 
as decorative garden plants.

00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:28.234
More than 200 years would pass
before the potato caught on

00:01:28.234 --> 00:01:30.910
as a major food source throughout Europe,

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:31.829
though even then,

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.855
it was predominantly eaten 
by the lower classes.

00:01:34.855 --> 00:01:37.192
However, beginning around 1750,

00:01:37.192 --> 00:01:38.896
and thanks at least in part

00:01:38.896 --> 00:01:42.913
to the wide availability
of inexpensive and nutritious potatoes,

00:01:42.913 --> 00:01:45.675
European peasants 
with greater food security

00:01:45.675 --> 00:01:47.218
no longer found themselves

00:01:47.218 --> 00:01:51.712
at the mercy of the regularly 
occurring grain famines of the time,

00:01:51.712 --> 00:01:54.255
and so their populations steadily grew.

00:01:54.255 --> 00:01:57.366
As a result, the British, Dutch
and German Empires

00:01:57.366 --> 00:02:02.340
rose on the backs of the growing groups
of farmers, laborers, and soldiers,

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.422
thus lifting the West to its place
of world dominion.

00:02:06.422 --> 00:02:10.282
However, not all European countries
sprouted empires.

00:02:10.282 --> 00:02:12.423
After the Irish adopted the potato,

00:02:12.423 --> 00:02:14.807
their population dramatically increased,

00:02:14.807 --> 00:02:19.174
as did their dependence on the tuber
as a major food staple.

00:02:19.174 --> 00:02:21.268
But then disaster struck.

00:02:21.268 --> 00:02:23.797
From 1845 to 1852,

00:02:23.797 --> 00:02:28.782
potato blight disease ravaged 
the majority of Ireland's potato crop,

00:02:28.782 --> 00:02:31.225
leading to the Irish Potato Famine,

00:02:31.225 --> 00:02:34.308
one of the deadliest famines
in world history.

00:02:34.308 --> 00:02:37.422
Over a million Irish citizens 
starved to death,

00:02:37.422 --> 00:02:41.273
and 2 million more 
left their homes behind.

00:02:41.273 --> 00:02:44.035
But of course, this wasn't the end
for the potato.

00:02:44.035 --> 00:02:45.801
The crop eventually recovered,

00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:49.106
and Europe's population,
especially the working classes,

00:02:49.106 --> 00:02:51.314
continued to increase.

00:02:51.314 --> 00:02:53.601
Aided by the influx of Irish migrants,

00:02:53.601 --> 00:02:58.223
Europe now had a large, sustainable,
and well-fed population

00:02:58.223 --> 00:03:01.242
who were capable of manning
the emerging factories

00:03:01.242 --> 00:03:06.185
that would bring about our modern world
via the Industrial Revolution.

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:09.819
So it's almost impossible to imagine
a world without the potato.

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.388
Would the Industrial Revolution 
ever have happened?

00:03:12.388 --> 00:03:15.121
Would World War II have been lost
by the Allies

00:03:15.121 --> 00:03:19.004
without this easy-to-grow crop
that fed the Allied troops?

00:03:19.004 --> 00:03:20.709
Would it even have started?

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.371
When you think about it like this,

00:03:22.371 --> 00:03:27.387
many major milestones in world history
can all be at least partially attributed

00:03:27.387 --> 00:03:31.042
to the simple spud 
from the Peruvian hilltops.
