would have lengthened leverage with that
length especially with triangles because

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030
length especially with triangles because
 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.570
length especially with triangles because
long-legged guys they can like sometimes

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580
long-legged guys they can like sometimes
 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.370
long-legged guys they can like sometimes
a guy like me with short legs like I'll

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380
a guy like me with short legs like I'll
 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.710
a guy like me with short legs like I'll
get my legs crossed yeah and I have to

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720
get my legs crossed yeah and I have to
 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.900
get my legs crossed yeah and I have to
adjust a lot to be able to cinch up by

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.910
adjust a lot to be able to cinch up by
 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.790
adjust a lot to be able to cinch up by
triangle whereas you might be able to

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800
triangle whereas you might be able to
 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.540
triangle whereas you might be able to
just close the

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550
just close the
 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.760
just close the
right there so you have like more

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:42.770
right there so you have like more
 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.040
right there so you have like more
opportunities for triangles because the

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050
opportunities for triangles because the
 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.960
opportunities for triangles because the
length of your limbs have you would you

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:46.970
length of your limbs have you would you
 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.330
length of your limbs have you would you
have ever been at a point in your in

so that's just how went for a long time

00:07:37.059 --> 00:07:37.069
so that's just how went for a long time
 

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:39.399
so that's just how went for a long time
when you are you know unless you're some

exciting though fucking excited yeah
 

00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:08.890
exciting though fucking excited yeah
because I was thinking like I knew that

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:08.900
because I was thinking like I knew that
 

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.809
because I was thinking like I knew that
he was a real legitimate martial artist

00:08:10.809 --> 00:08:10.819
he was a real legitimate martial artist
 

00:08:10.819 --> 00:08:12.850
he was a real legitimate martial artist
like he throws kicks and punches and it

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:12.860
like he throws kicks and punches and it
 

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.680
like he throws kicks and punches and it
looks really good like he really does

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:14.690

know his shit but I also know he never
 

00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:19.240
know his shit but I also know he never
fought and there's a big difference

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:19.250
fought and there's a big difference
 

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.580
fought and there's a big difference
between throwing kicks and I know and I

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:21.590
between throwing kicks and I know and I
 

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.890
between throwing kicks and I know and I
haven't fought in a long time but I

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:23.900
haven't fought in a long time but I
 

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.959
haven't fought in a long time but I
probably fought a hundred times yeah so

00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:25.969
probably fought a hundred times yeah so
 

00:08:25.969 --> 00:08:29.050
probably fought a hundred times yeah so
i I've been I've felt that nerves I know

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:29.060
i I've been I've felt that nerves I know
 

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.870
i I've been I've felt that nerves I know
what that's like it'll be crazy as fuck

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:31.880
what that's like it'll be crazy as fuck
 

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.490
what that's like it'll be crazy as fuck
to do it again that's what I was

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:33.500
to do it again that's what I was
 

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.690
to do it again that's what I was
thinking I mean it'll probably scare the

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:34.700
thinking I mean it'll probably scare the
 

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.000
thinking I mean it'll probably scare the
shit out of me but I think I know what

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.010
shit out of me but I think I know what
 

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.430
shit out of me but I think I know what
to do I think I know how to like get in

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440
to do I think I know how to like get in
 

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.899
to do I think I know how to like get in
there and start fainting and start

00:08:40.899 --> 00:08:40.909
there and start fainting and start
 

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:42.819
there and start fainting and start
giving some movement see how he reacts

00:08:42.819 --> 00:08:42.829
giving some movement see how he reacts
 

00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:44.710
giving some movement see how he reacts
and then the worst case scenario is like

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720
and then the worst case scenario is like
 

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.329
and then the worst case scenario is like
I'm like in a scramble I'm gonna

00:08:46.329 --> 00:08:46.339
I'm like in a scramble I'm gonna
 

00:08:46.339 --> 00:08:48.530
I'm like in a scramble I'm gonna
strangle this guy like this

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:48.540
strangle this guy like this
 

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.420
strangle this guy like this
this comes to a scramble yeah because

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:50.430
this comes to a scramble yeah because
 

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.750
this comes to a scramble yeah because
the average person really doesn't know

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760
the average person really doesn't know
 

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.690
the average person really doesn't know
how helpless they are until a jiu-jitsu

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:56.700
how helpless they are until a jiu-jitsu
 

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.210
how helpless they are until a jiu-jitsu
blackbelt grabs ahold of you and then

00:08:59.210 --> 00:08:59.220
blackbelt grabs ahold of you and then
 

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.420
blackbelt grabs ahold of you and then
you just go oh shit like I'm helpless

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:02.430
you just go oh shit like I'm helpless
 

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.450
you just go oh shit like I'm helpless
because in a fight you really think like

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:05.460
because in a fight you really think like
 

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.040
because in a fight you really think like
you might be able to punch a guy like

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:07.050
you might be able to punch a guy like
 

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.720
you might be able to punch a guy like
maybe if he's friend me and he's

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:08.730
maybe if he's friend me and he's
 

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:09.710
maybe if he's friend me and he's
swinging at me and I'm swinging at him

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:09.720
swinging at me and I'm swinging at him
 

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.480
swinging at me and I'm swinging at him
maybe I hit him first you really think

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:11.490
maybe I hit him first you really think
 

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:14.690
maybe I hit him first you really think
that but there's no swinging if it's a

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:14.700
that but there's no swinging if it's a
 

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.270
that but there's no swinging if it's a
jiu-jitsu fight if you guys get into

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:17.280
jiu-jitsu fight if you guys get into
 

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.950
jiu-jitsu fight if you guys get into
some sort of a tussle and that guy grabs
