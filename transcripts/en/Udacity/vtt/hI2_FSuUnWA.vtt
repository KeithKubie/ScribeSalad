00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.260
Computational Biology is an emerging field that's going to be big.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.880
&gt;&gt; Now just like computer science and coding is becoming really important

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.350
for all different professions nowadays. It's

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.670
even more needed in biology and genetics.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.710
&gt;&gt; I mean it takes a lot of computation and

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.050
analysis to sequence a whole genome. And, and the processing power

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.990
it takes is immense. Not to mention other changes in the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.730
medical field, like digitizing of patient medical records, and a lot

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.410
of other things.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.960
&gt;&gt; Now, if any of you out there are

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.530
interested in computer science coding and biology. There's a

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.660
whole field waiting for you. There's a lot of

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.830
companies out there that are looking for good computational biologists.
