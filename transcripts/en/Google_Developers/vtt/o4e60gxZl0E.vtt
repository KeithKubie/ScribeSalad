00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
&gt;&gt; SCOTT: ...Integration between GeoStudio
and Google Apps. We thought, "Well, what if

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.960
the applications themselves could talk with
you?" And that's what we built. Here you can

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.230
see that we'll get a notification from our
build system. And our build systems let us

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.359
know that the build that we're interested
in has failed. Now, I can click through from

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:26.140
this failure message and see the build itself,
and find out why it failed and who's responsible.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.880
We can see here that it was Dan who broke
the build, and he got his own instant message,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.070
and I'm sure he's already working hard to
fix it. Here we go. So on the left-hand side

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.230
you can see-- instantly linked through to
all the applications in Google Apps, as well

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.910
as Studio. We can see the recent Google Docs,
such as the design specification we attached

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:52.440
recently. We can see our upcoming calendar,
and without leaving studio, we can create

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.750
an event. So we need to create that meeting
with Dan at 9:00 p.m.? Well, I guess 9:00

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.290
tomorrow morning, and, uh, we can quickly
add that, and make sure it doesn't conflict

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.560
with our other important meetings we have
coming up. Without leaving studio, we can

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.870
see our upcoming Gmail events, and see--Gmail
messages, and see if there's anything we need

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.240
to respond to. We can see the code views that
are assigned to us. I think Dan has assigned

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.439
me a code view to work on. The builds that
have failed, such as the one we've just seen.

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:25.399
And we can see our favorite Wiki pages, as
well as recent JIRA issues. Now, the thing

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.179
that's most important for me is the final
tab, which gives you a single view across

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:35.231
all the applications of the things that are
relevant to me and my team. So we've shown

00:01:35.231 --> 00:01:40.399
you gadgets in Studio and inside Gmail. We've
shown you the power of Google Docs. We've

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.729
shown you Google Talk and the fingertip access
to all the applications. And that's just some

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:52.679
of the integrations that we've built, and
best of all, it's available today. In fact,

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:58.630
it's in use already. In fact, it's being used
by 40 developers in a bus traveling 60 miles

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:06.380
an hour, from San Francisco to South by Southwest.
Along the way they're committing code using

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.470
the system, and they're using Google Apps
and the Studio integration, and they'll be

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.900
launching three startups when they arrive
at South by Southwest. So we think, you know,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.450
this combination of products is fantastic
for startups and software development companies

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:27.819
alike, and we look forward to you using it.
Thank you, Dave. [pause]

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:35.620
&gt;&gt; DAVE: Thank you, Scott. So you saw how
by using a variety of different extension

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.620
points, Atlassian was able to connect the
entire surface area of their software development

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.099
suite with the entire surface area of Google's
communication and collaboration suite, so

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.799
that all the employees of our joint customers,
whether they spend most of their time on one

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.400
side of the fence in the land of email, or
on the other side of the fence in the land

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.140
of code, have full access to all the information
they need, when they need it. The next demo

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.189
I'd like to show you, I'm gonna invite up
Amit from Manymoon, who's gonna show you how

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:09.079
by using the Google Apps Marketplace, and
the extension with--the integration with Google

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.220
Apps was how a startup was able to build many
more features for their customers much more

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.920
quickly than they would have been able to
otherwise. Amit.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.990
&gt;&gt; AMIT: Great. Thanks, David. Hello, I'm
Amit Kulkarni with Manymoon, and, uh, Manymoon

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.760
is a social productivity application that
helps teams get work done online. And what

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.109
I'd like to show you today is how we used
OpenID, Google Calendar, Contacts, and the

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.730
Docs APIs that quickly develop features that
our customers were asking for, while converting

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.219
a lot of our free users to paid users. And
what we're really excited about today is the

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:46.719
new Google Apps Marketplace, because it dramatically
simplifies how users can access the Manymoon

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:52.629
Google Apps integration. So let's dive right
into the demo. So this is a typical Google

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.000
Apps user. Her name is Kate. And she's received
an urgent email from her manager, Jim, saying

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.629
that they have to move to a new office at
the end of the month. And he wants the status

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.319
by the end of the day. Kate turns to Manymoon
to make this happen. So she'll get started

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.749
by accessing Manymoon from within the Google
universal navigation. And with just one click,

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:13.220
she's brought right into the application.
So there's no need for her to register or

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.180
sign up again. She's got a variety of features
available to her, but she's already got a

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.680
workspace available called New Office Move
that she'll access. And first things first,

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.740
she'll create a task that says, "Select which
office to move to." And we've integrated with

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.000
the Google Contacts and Provisioning APIs,
so it's really easy for her to assign these

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.500
tasks. She'll just put in someone's name,
and Manymoon will auto-complete-- Find the

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.770
person, and auto-complete it for her. And
that's it. Now, luckily, Kate's been keeping

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.770
track of a list of offices and a Google Spreadsheet
that she would like to attach to this task.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.669
So she'll go to "Attach, List Google Docs,"
and using the Google Doc List API will bring

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.120
up a list of her Google Docs and uploaded
files, so you see a spreadsheet here, List

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.180
of Office Spaces, and that's it. She's added
it to the task. She'll give this task a due

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.230
date. And say we want to get this done by
the end of the week. And that's how easy it

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.340
is for her to create a task and automatically
share that Google Spreadsheet with Jim, using

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.360
the Google Docs APIs. Now, most projects have
multiple people, so she'll want to invite

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.120
someone to help out, so she'll go to the members
section, and she'll add someone. So, in this

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.400
case, she'll add myself, Amit, to help out
with the office move. And that's it. But here's

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.530
the really cool part. Now that I'm a member
of this project, I automatically have access

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.910
to that Google Spreadsheet she just attached
a second ago. Because Manymoon uses the Google

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.919
Docs sharing APIs. So as a project member,
I no longer have to go around asking for permission

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.889
to access data that's relevant to me. Manymoon
and Google Apps take care of all of that.

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:43.270
So after releasing these initial integrations,
we knew customers really liked these capabilities,

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:49.180
because our baseline of daily visits increased
by 300%, which we were ecstatic about, obviously.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.020
Okay, so Kate's assigned a task to her manager,
she's invited someone to help with the office

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.650
move. Now she wants to give this a deadline,
and give everyone a graphical calendar view

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.199
to keep them focused. Now, typically, building
a full-blown calendar capability might take

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:05.319
months. We were able to do it in just a couple
of weeks using Google Calendar. Let me show

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:10.690
you how. So she'll go to Edit, and she'll
give this office move a deadline of the end

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:16.460
of the month, just like her manager asked,
and that's it. She'll now go down to the calendar

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:23.150
section, which is in actuality a Google Calendar
that we've embedded and integrated right within

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.690
Manymoon. So that task that you just created
with a due date is here. That deadline that

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.860
she created is right here as well. And this
calendar has all the features that our customers

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.129
need, so we as a development team can focus
on building team workflow software, instead

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:39.750
of worrying about building features of our
own calendar software, like reminders and

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.819
so on. And because we share the same information
with Google Apps, her manager, who had originally

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:48.310
asked for the status by the end of the day,
he lives and dies in his Google Calendar,

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.740
which I'll show you here, and I'll refresh
it. He can see the same information instantaneously,

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.300
without ever going to a third-party application.
So I've shown you just a little bit of what

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.039
Manymoon can do, and how integrating with
Google Apps helped us very quickly meet market

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:07.039
requirements. And, you know, customers love
this integration. We've got thousands of businesses

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:12.110
using Manymoon for everything from event-planning
to software-development, to hiring and recruiting.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.889
And, as you see, the Google Apps marketplace
dramatically simplifies how users like Kate

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:21.419
can access Manymoon, and then also utilize
their existing Google Apps within Manymoon.

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:26.280
Thanks, and I'll turn it back over to David.
[pause]

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:33.520
&gt;&gt; DAVID: Thank you, Amit. What you saw again,
take a startup. Wants to build an awful lot

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.860
of features for her customers, wants to build
them in a hurry with a small team. Let's stand

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:42.759
on the shoulders of giants. Let's take advantage
of Google Apps, and use the integration points

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:47.240
and the Marketplace to accelerate their ability,
force multiplier, and their ability to build

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.949
a great product in a hurry, and expand the
power of Google Apps with more features for

00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:58.409
more users. Before I bring up our last demo,
want to talk about one extension point. Remember

00:07:58.409 --> 00:08:02.610
I said we have a list of opportunities for
integration, and the list is going to be growing?

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:08.830
Well, everything you've seen so far tonight
is going to be live, available for installation

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:13.669
and purchase later this evening. What we're
about to show you is one sneak peek of one

00:08:13.669 --> 00:08:17.990
of the new integration points that's coming.
It's not available yet, but it's available

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:21.840
to you as developers to start trying out,
start thinking about and building into your

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.729
apps, and say, "Hey, what would I do with
this?" This is the ability to get one step

00:08:26.729 --> 00:08:32.500
deeper into the flow of your user's life inside
Google Apps. If any of you are Gmail users,

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.370
you've probably noticed that recently when
someone sends you an email that just contains

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:41.800
in the text of the email a link to a YouTube
video, something in Gmail somehow noticed

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.360
that there was something of interest there,
matched on that link to the YouTube video,

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.230
and inserted into your inbox, right in line
in the email, a little preview widget, little

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:54.200
gadget that said, "Hey, here's something that
might be of use to you right now, because

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.440
I matched on something that I was told to
look for in the email." Well, we took the

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:04.030
machinery that our internal teams had used
to build that triggering into their application

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:08.590
integration with Gmail, and we're making it
available to you as developers to include

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:14.269
into your apps. So what this means is that
your application can say, "I'm interested

00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:19.240
in a particular field, in a particular email.
Whenever an email arrives that, for example,

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:25.899
contains the name of--in the from field is
from one of the people in my customer database,

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:30.160
I want to match on that, have my application
get called, so I have the opportunity to show

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.209
my users the information they need, give them
an opportunity to take action on that information,

00:09:35.209 --> 00:09:40.500
right in place." Sort of point-of-action information
right there in their inbox. That contextual

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.820
gadget capability is what our last demo tonight,
Appirio, is going to show us. I'd like to

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.890
invite up Ryan from Appirio, who is going
to show you how using some of the points of

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:55.110
integration that you've seen before, and the
new, contextual gadget capability, was able

00:09:55.110 --> 00:10:00.499
to build a very tight integration between
Appirio's product and Google Apps. Ryan.

00:10:00.499 --> 00:10:01.111
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Great.
