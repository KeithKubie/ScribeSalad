00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:02.840
oh

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.620
That is so cool. What's up guys welcome back for another beautiful day of experimenting in this video

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.090
We're going to revisit a failed experiment from before and turn it into a success now

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.129
I've noticed  in my last couple of videos the comments have been blowing up with people asking [me] to put liquid nitrogen in a vacuum

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.570
chamber. You probably remember

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.820
We did this in a previous video

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.560
And we didn't have any success [at] all no matter how long we round the vacuum pump or how hard we tried

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.180
We just could not get the nitrogen to freeze but today is going to be different because today I

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.078
Guarantee success. Now I have to admit that the first time we tried [putting] liquid nitrogen into a vacuum chamber

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.610
I really thought it was going to freeze

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.169
I didn't see any reason why it wouldn't because there's plenty of videos online of people getting it to work all the way from

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:48.090
Science laboratories to vacuum Chamber channels to cody's lab so when we experienced such catastrophic failure. I was very discouraged and wondered

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.039
Why so here's what I did I reached out to my friend cody from cody's lab to see what suggestions he had and he said

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.199
The problem was this thing right here

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.719
Look how big this cookie jar is look

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.659
How much volume it takes up and look at the size of our vacuum pump this container with this pump?

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.959
Just doesn't work. The theory is that our little vacuum pump

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.720
Just can't pump fast enough to keep up with the size of this jar

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.229
So the solution really is as simple as grabbing a smaller jar

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.540
so a big shout out to my friend cody from cody's lab for the suggestion on using a smaller jar because today we're gonna to

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.540
Put that to the test and it's going to work

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.610
So here we are guys

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.839
I just took a styrofoam cup filled up with liquid nitrogen and got myself one of these little wine glasses

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.450
[I'm] going with the wine glass because got a nice large base

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.339
And should help keep the nitrogen insulated and high up off the ground now before we jump into trying to make this work

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.810
I want to quickly address some of the comments

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.970
I saw the last time we attempted making this work some people thought the reason it wasn't working is because we actually need to [add]

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:44.670
pressure

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.000
rather than reduce it that [would] actually have the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.860
Opposite effect than you think it would and I'll tell you about it in just a minute, but first let's get to pouring our nitrogen

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.809
So the nitrogen is in our cup, and I think just to cool down this container

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.910
I'm going to add a splash of nitrogen to the jar itself

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.239
We don't want to freeze the glass we just want to cool down the atmosphere inside

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.070
[it] stuff. That's just going to help the atmosphere and the cookie jar cool down a little bit so it's not quite as warm

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.039
So our glass [is] cooled down you can see it's about halfway full

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.300
We'll just top [it] up a little bit more and we're going [to] set that down inside

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.110
And you can see [I] got lucky because the top of this glass is just barely understood level of our proto [potti] there which means

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.220
We can stick this thing on top now right now. What's happening is the nitrogen is boiling?

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.119
It's actually turning into a gas and it's creating pressure, and if I were to hold this thing on hard enough

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.450
It would actually create a gas that wants to escape too much pressure and the container would explode if I open this valve here

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.949
You can actually feel the nitrogen vapor pushing out and building pressure

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.709
Because that gas is expanding so rapidly we need a vacuum pump you that can suck it in faster than its expanding but in this

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.090
Case where I've got a smaller vacuum pump?

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.799
We should be able to achieve the same effect by using a smaller container at least that's the theory all right

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.059
So we've got our valve set this one is open so it can draw a vacuum and this one is closed to prevent any air

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.769
from getting in so now all we have to do is fire up the vacuum pump let it suck out all the nitrogen vapor and

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.769
Then give it about a minute to react

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.140
All right here. We go game on

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.908
You see it starts pulling the vacuum right away. We're already about

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:34.189
Almost 15 inches of Mercury and the nitrogen actually starts accelerating in the way that it boils it actually boils more rapidly

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:36.079
What's happening?

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:42.229
Now is all the energetic molecules in there are being released and pulled out [of] the nitrogen and what that's doing is making the nitrogen

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:49.069
Itself actually colder and if we pull out enough of those vibrating molecules it should get to the point where it [actually] freezes

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:55.009
21 inches of Mercury, and I'm thinking we should start seeing something happen in

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:03.138
The next few seconds there look at that the nitrogen has gone completely quiet, and the top layer [just] froze

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.079
Yeah, yes that is often so right there about 22 inches of Mercury is where we start seeing the frozen [nitrogen]?

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:17.869
That's really cool guys about 22 inches of Mercury

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.509
And we saw the top layer start to freeze and then kind of exploded and then refroze and exploded and refroze again

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:25.220
You'll notice the whole thing didn't freeze

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.999
It was just the top layer and everything underneath. It was still liquid, but if we let it run long enough

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.470
[we] can actually extract enough heat energy to turn the whole [thing] into nitrogen snow

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.069
So right now. We're about 20 almost 22 inches of Mercury

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:43.158
And we should see you can see the the liquids gone completely calm. [it's] stopped boiling

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.598
and now if you watch very carefully

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.429
You see the whole top layer crystallized. [oh], that is so cool

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.619
It's got this amazing cycle of freezing and then it explodes then freezes and explodes again

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.859
But that's not even the cool part. We are just getting started

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.679
So I've had this thing running for about three minutes now

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.989
You can see the top layer of the nitrogen is completely frozen

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.889
But everything underneath it is still liquid now if we keep letting this run long enough

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:21.119
We should be able to get the entire solution to freeze into a glass full of nitrogen snow

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.459
And that is my goal for this project today

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.229
You want to kind of want to do is switch glasses and keeping it freeze that quicker?

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.399
Next [turn] the top for a second okay watch this it looks grateful

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.310
That's pretty, huh?

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.430
Alright. [this] is where the magic happens. [it's] gonna look really cool

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.570
You feel that's just boiling like crazy the nitrogen is going nuts. Oh

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.829
Here we go. It [was] start and see it freeze cool. That looks really cool

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:52.619
You can actually see the layer of ice floating on the top there

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.510
And you can see it still bubbling up from underneath because digging down now and extracting any

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.639
Energetic Molecules and allowing them to escape and as it starts doing that [we'll] see that layer of ice

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.819
begin to thicken and start freezing from the top down

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.359
we're getting pretty close to the bottom there and

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.289
What I'm noticing is the ice freezes

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.930
It actually moves upward as well because I think you know somehow I wouldn't say it's adding air to the mixture

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:32.269
But the way, it's freezing the crystal structure is expanding so you can actually see it's rising up

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.840
Hmm

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.910
That is really cool. So guys we did it

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.409
We actually froze our liquid nitrogen completely solid it's at the point now where?

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:46.670
there's no more liquid the whole glass is completely full of nitrogen snow and

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.470
Nothing is moving any longer

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.600
I have to wipe down the sides of the glass because the chamber is cold enough that the moisture in the air is condensing to

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.330
It making it difficult to see in but I think it's very apparent from this angle

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:02.930
We have just frozen liquid nitrogen what you're looking at here is solid nitrogen. Which is very very cool now watch

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.269
What happens if I close this valve and turn off the pump?

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:10.430
You can see it maintains a vacuum pressure if I wipe this down so you can get a better look

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:16.009
You can see it still stays in its snowy state as long as there's a little bit of pressure

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.129
But you got to remember the nitrogen is still warming up and as it warms up

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.749
It's going to release gas which increases the pressure which is going to make this thing [liquify] over time

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.970
Yeah, you can already see it's starting to warm up

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:31.220
The liquid is starting to boil at the bottom again, and this was with nothing happening the vacuum pumps, not running

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.339
I'm not letting any air in this is just [it's] sitting by itself

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:41.030
So right now. We're literally melting nitrogen ice cubes [a] little bit easier than the [last] time we tried it. [oh]

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.330
Yeah there goes

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:51.159
Still looks a little bit slushy over here. I'm going to get that back into a nice form

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.850
So I've just closed the valve and I've turned off the vacuum pump now over time it will warm up

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:05.170
It will begin to melt but watch how dramatic the change is if we open the [valve] and let all the air rush back in

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.850
holy heck

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.260
Wow

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.379
Okay, so I'm going to let the air in a little bit, too quickly

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:19.749
they created a vortex and all the nitrogen went spewing but you can see it turned from ice to liquid in a fraction of a

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:24.820
Second let's try that again, but this time let's let the air in a little bit slower, so we can actually watch the nitrogen melt

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.280
Okay, set this guy off here we go

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.580
as absolutely beautiful

00:08:57.279 --> 00:09:03.299
look how cold that God that was amazing guys like when we let the pressure and you could actually see [the] ice melting and

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:08.819
The slower we did it the slower we could get it to melt and now we're left with is this super cold

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:15.810
Liquid nitrogen and this stuff is really special because it's actually colder than regular liquid nitrogen for example. We take this cup here

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.709
We pour in Regular Liquid nitrogen

00:09:17.709 --> 00:09:22.949
You can see it jumps up to a roaring boil even after it cools the glass down it boils dramatically

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:27.749
But the stuff we [just] pulled out of the vacuum chamber is completely quiet. It's completely still [not] moving at all

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:32.669
That's because this liquid is actually colder than the boiling point of nitrogen how cool is that [so] [here]?

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.420
We are guys we have successfully created

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.279
Solid [nitrogen] right in the comfort of our own home and we learned a few things as we did

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:42.390
We started this experiment a couple months ago, and we tried putting liquid nitrogen in a vacuum chamber

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:47.759
[but] unfortunately we couldn't get it to freeze but in the comments section of that video some of you inspired me to either use a

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.789
Larger vacuum pump or a smaller container so in this experiment

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.159
We went to a smaller container, and we found that it worked

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.680
Not only did we get the surface of the nitrogen to freeze?

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:02.339
But we froze the entire cup we discovered nitrogen goes through some interesting changes as it freezes as well once it freezes it seems to

00:10:02.339 --> 00:10:06.869
Explode back into a liquid and then refreeze once again, but after repeating this cycle a few times

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.909
We saw that all the liquid did eventually freeze?

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:15.059
We learned that this happens because as you reduce the pressure around the nitrogen itself all the molecules with the most energy are free to

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:19.229
Leave and of course by allowing the warmer Molecules to escape only the colder ones are left behind

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.709
causing the liquid to freeze

00:10:20.709 --> 00:10:26.159
We also saw [that] if we stop drawing a vacuum for a long [enough] period [Of] time the nitrogen would warm back up create pressure

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:31.140
And melt back into a liquid the same thing was true if we [opened] the valve and let the Air come back into the container

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:36.479
The nitrogen ice melted pretty much at the same rate. We let the pressure back in and one final observation

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:42.329
We made with the liquid nitrogen that comes out of the vacuum [chamber] is actually colder than liquid nitrogen on its own because it's [actually]

00:10:42.329 --> 00:10:46.769
Cooled down well below its boiling point and of course. I want to give a big shout-out to our friend Erin Greenham

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:49.889
Who is one of hundreds of people asking for this experiment, Erin?

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.319
You can go check your youtube inbox because I'm sending a twenty five bucks

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:58.020
So there you have it guys now you know how to freeze liquid nitrogen using common materials and things we made around

00:10:58.839 --> 00:11:03.719
Thanks for joining [for] this experiment. Thank you so much for your requests. I'll be looking for you [in] the next video. [talk] you that

00:11:04.989 --> 00:11:08.639
What is the good pull absolutely nothing?

00:11:10.299 --> 00:11:12.299
whoa
