kind of tell a short story about what
 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.760
kind of tell a short story about what
we've been doing in terms of teaching

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770
we've been doing in terms of teaching
 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.580
we've been doing in terms of teaching
and learning using video at Berkeley

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590
and learning using video at Berkeley
 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.290
and learning using video at Berkeley
specifically from the perspective of our

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300
specifically from the perspective of our
 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.509
specifically from the perspective of our
organization and kind of the

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519
organization and kind of the
 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.880
organization and kind of the
organizations that fed into it and then

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890
organizations that fed into it and then
 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.620
organizations that fed into it and then
I'm going to kind of list out some of

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630
I'm going to kind of list out some of
 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.359
I'm going to kind of list out some of
the tensions we've been experiencing I

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369
the tensions we've been experiencing I
 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.189
the tensions we've been experiencing I
hope that we would have time to discuss

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199
hope that we would have time to discuss
 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.990
hope that we would have time to discuss
them but I think probably that's going

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000
them but I think probably that's going
 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.630
them but I think probably that's going
to have to happen offline so the story

the first thread is the instructional
 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.190
the first thread is the instructional
technology thread throughout the 90s and

technology thread throughout the 90s and
 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.389
technology thread throughout the 90s and
kind of into this decade we had an

kind of into this decade we had an
 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.639
kind of into this decade we had an
instructional technology program

providing training and consulting so we

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230
providing training and consulting so we
 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.400
providing training and consulting so we
didn't have big production services we

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410
didn't have big production services we
 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.779
didn't have big production services we
didn't really even have small production

early 90s web based as we got to the
 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.569
early 90s web based as we got to the
later 90s and of course you know one

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579
later 90s and of course you know one
 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.890
later 90s and of course you know one
thing that we were able to do was

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900
thing that we were able to do was
 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.980
thing that we were able to do was
provide greater access to video for the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990
provide greater access to video for the
 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.690
provide greater access to video for the
students in ways that they couldn't have

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700
students in ways that they couldn't have
 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.210
students in ways that they couldn't have
access before we were able to introduce

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220
access before we were able to introduce
 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.730

some degree of interaction to make it a

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740
some degree of interaction to make it a
 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.710
some degree of interaction to make it a
little bit more interactive and there

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720
little bit more interactive and there
 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.020
little bit more interactive and there
was some small examples of student

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030
was some small examples of student
 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.250
was some small examples of student
created media which

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260

you know where I think a lot of the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190
you know where I think a lot of the
 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.510
you know where I think a lot of the
power lies but those were minimal I

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520
power lies but those were minimal I
 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.700
power lies but those were minimal I
think the challenges we were facing at

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710
think the challenges we were facing at
 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.740
think the challenges we were facing at
the time and actually still face are the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750
the time and actually still face are the
 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.750
the time and actually still face are the
technology costs and by that I mean not

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760
technology costs and by that I mean not
 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.910
technology costs and by that I mean not
only I mean in the early 90s a

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920
only I mean in the early 90s a
 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.000
only I mean in the early 90s a
digitizing board was you know a thousand

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010
digitizing board was you know a thousand
 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.100
digitizing board was you know a thousand
dollars or more but also the time in

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110
dollars or more but also the time in
 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.690
dollars or more but also the time in
terms of how much time it was going to

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700
terms of how much time it was going to
 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.090

take a instructor to invest in this

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100
take a instructor to invest in this
 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.670
take a instructor to invest in this
stuff to learn it to remember it you

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680
stuff to learn it to remember it you

know when they didn't come back to it

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970
know when they didn't come back to it
 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.270
know when they didn't come back to it
for a few months as well as I already

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280
for a few months as well as I already
 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.400
for a few months as well as I already
mentioned we didn't have the capability

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410
mentioned we didn't have the capability
 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.110
mentioned we didn't have the capability
the resources to provide services to

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120
the resources to provide services to
 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.700
the resources to provide services to
really help them create the media so we

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710
really help them create the media so we
 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.580
really help them create the media so we
were spending in a sense more more of

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590
were spending in a sense more more of
 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.260
were spending in a sense more more of
our effort on technology than we were on

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270
our effort on technology than we were on
 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.900
our effort on technology than we were on
pedagogy and the other big challenge was

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910
pedagogy and the other big challenge was
 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.780
pedagogy and the other big challenge was
a lack of scalability so a lot of these

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790
a lack of scalability so a lot of these
 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.160

these kind of two different threads were

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550
these kind of two different threads were
 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.960
these kind of two different threads were
now you know different still different

even closer together between 2003 and

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800
even closer together between 2003 and
 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.779
even closer together between 2003 and
2005 when we adopted Sakai as an open

environment and at the same time we add

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770
environment and at the same time we add
 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.390
environment and at the same time we add
significant development resources

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400
significant development resources
 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.110

because we were going to start building

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120
because we were going to start building
 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.200
because we were going to start building
tools for Sakai and in addition we

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210
tools for Sakai and in addition we
 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.080
tools for Sakai and in addition we
brought in an interaction designer who

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090
brought in an interaction designer who
 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.670
brought in an interaction designer who
kind of introduced the user centered

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680
kind of introduced the user centered
 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.649
kind of introduced the user centered
design process to our organization and

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:57.659
design process to our organization and
 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:59.270
design process to our organization and
so now we're at a point where we were

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280
so now we're at a point where we were
 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.460
so now we're at a point where we were
saying ok so can we build a Sakai tool

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470
saying ok so can we build a Sakai tool
 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.140
saying ok so can we build a Sakai tool
that will enable video to be used to

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150
that will enable video to be used to
 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.860
that will enable video to be used to
improve teaching and learning I'm a few

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870
improve teaching and learning I'm a few
 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.450
improve teaching and learning I'm a few
words about user centered design and

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460
words about user centered design and
 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.649
words about user centered design and
it's you know hard thing to talk about

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:09.659
it's you know hard thing to talk about
 

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:12.800
it's you know hard thing to talk about
in a few years few words wait a few

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810
in a few years few words wait a few
 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.719
in a few years few words wait a few
years so basically the focus is on the

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:17.729
years so basically the focus is on the
 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:19.969
years so basically the focus is on the
user's fully understanding the users and

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979
user's fully understanding the users and
 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.559
user's fully understanding the users and
what their goals are and what they need

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:21.569
what their goals are and what they need
 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:24.770
what their goals are and what they need
to do before you even get to design and

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780
to do before you even get to design and
 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.629
to do before you even get to design and
I'll say a few words about some of those

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639
I'll say a few words about some of those
 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:29.899
I'll say a few words about some of those
specific processes that we followed but

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:29.909
specific processes that we followed but
 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:31.490
specific processes that we followed but
a big part of understanding the user is

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500
a big part of understanding the user is
 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.050
a big part of understanding the user is
understanding their pain points so we

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060
understanding their pain points so we
 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.029
understanding their pain points so we
did some initial research Oh be helped

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039
did some initial research Oh be helped
 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:37.100
did some initial research Oh be helped
me at the time with this way when

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110
me at the time with this way when
 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.249

talking instructors we did surveys and

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:40.259
talking instructors we did surveys and
 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:42.409
talking instructors we did surveys and
so this is a very high level what you

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419
so this is a very high level what you
 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:44.119
so this is a very high level what you
know what were the pain points well for

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:44.129
know what were the pain points well for
 

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:45.619
know what were the pain points well for
the instructors who were not the ones

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:45.629
the instructors who were not the ones
 

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:47.930
the instructors who were not the ones
involved in webcast program their pain

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940

instructors still had some concerns

00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:56.969
instructors still had some concerns
 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:58.820

the only thing that we saw repeated in
 

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:03.939
the only thing that we saw repeated in
terms of their problems for students

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:03.949

when we looked at what these pain points

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:26.190
when we looked at what these pain points
 

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.309
when we looked at what these pain points
were we said you know we can't in terms

00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319

of building a tool we can't address the

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:30.569
of building a tool we can't address the
 

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:33.769
of building a tool we can't address the
instructor pain points terribly well and

00:07:33.769 --> 00:07:33.779
instructor pain points terribly well and
 

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:35.480
instructor pain points terribly well and
in terms of the student pain points

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:35.490
in terms of the student pain points
 

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.730
in terms of the student pain points
there were things that we could do in

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.740
there were things that we could do in
 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.490
there were things that we could do in
the organization has moved to doing a

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:40.500
the organization has moved to doing a
 

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.839
the organization has moved to doing a
better job making sure the students

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:41.849
better job making sure the students
 

00:07:41.849 --> 00:07:43.939
better job making sure the students
could see what they wanted to see but we

00:07:43.939 --> 00:07:43.949
could see what they wanted to see but we
 

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:46.490
could see what they wanted to see but we
were going to focus on this aspect of

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:46.500
were going to focus on this aspect of
 

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.750
were going to focus on this aspect of
difficulty finding specific content

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:48.760
difficulty finding specific content
 

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.610
difficulty finding specific content
so from there we created our problem

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:50.620
so from there we created our problem
 

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.010
so from there we created our problem
statement which was a very valuable

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:53.020
statement which was a very valuable
 

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.440
statement which was a very valuable
thing to do especially in terms of

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:55.450
thing to do especially in terms of
 

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.600
thing to do especially in terms of
getting stakeholder buy-in sponsor

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:57.610

the same page and basically what we said

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:03.160
the same page and basically what we said
 

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.910
the same page and basically what we said
was that you know nothing mind-boggling

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:05.920
was that you know nothing mind-boggling
 

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.200
was that you know nothing mind-boggling
but you know we have this problem where

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:07.210
but you know we have this problem where
 

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.080
but you know we have this problem where
we have students who want to who want to

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:10.090
we have students who want to who want to
 

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.510

had a conceptual framework design which
is really kind of a high-level sketchy

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:51.280
is really kind of a high-level sketchy

her needs we're going to be meeting the
 

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.580
her needs we're going to be meeting the
needs of others so it's not going to

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:26.590
needs of others so it's not going to
 

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.320
needs of others so it's not going to
spend too much time with her this is a

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:28.330
spend too much time with her this is a
 

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.740
spend too much time with her this is a
high level view of her anyways I can

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:31.750
high level view of her anyways I can
 

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:35.160
high level view of her anyways I can
show any bit more later if they want so

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:35.170
show any bit more later if they want so
 

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:38.940
show any bit more later if they want so
we had to stop at that point we didn't

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:38.950
we had to stop at that point we didn't
 

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:40.920
we had to stop at that point we didn't
have the resources to continue to build

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:40.930
have the resources to continue to build

have the resources to continue to build
the tool that was about Emilio and so

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:44.170
the tool that was about Emilio and so
 

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:45.780
the tool that was about Emilio and so
now I'm going to kind of talk about some

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:45.790
now I'm going to kind of talk about some
 

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.870
now I'm going to kind of talk about some
of the tensions and the first one is you

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880
of the tensions and the first one is you
 

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.550
of the tensions and the first one is you
know we have a strong desire in our

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560
know we have a strong desire in our
 

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.960
know we have a strong desire in our
department to improve teaching and

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:51.970
department to improve teaching and
 

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:54.180
department to improve teaching and
learning with new tools but we also

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:54.190
learning with new tools but we also
 

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:56.880
learning with new tools but we also
really have to deal with maintaining our

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:56.890
really have to deal with maintaining our
 

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:58.890
really have to deal with maintaining our
existing mission critical services and

00:10:58.890 --> 00:10:58.900
existing mission critical services and
 

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.900
existing mission critical services and
so that's why we don't have resources

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:00.910
so that's why we don't have resources
 

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.660
so that's why we don't have resources
put on this project on the teaching and

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:03.670
put on this project on the teaching and
 

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.460
put on this project on the teaching and
learning aspect of this project just yet

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:05.470
learning aspect of this project just yet
 

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:06.540
