00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.880
To understand where in our view controller we can write this code,

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.939
we need to investigate our class.

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:09.930
You will notice that it inherits from another class called UIViewController,

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.050
which is a class Apple wrote for managing views.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.630
Let me unpack this relationship with the help of a diagram.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.480
So we know that the view in our app comprises of things like buttons and

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.280
labels, and that this view is controlled or

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.370
managed by a file called ViewController.Swift.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.660
Now this file has a class in it by the same name.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.320
And this class inherits from UIViewController.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.220
UIViewController has several functions defined within it that we also inherit.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.790
One of them is called viewDidLoad.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.710
This is called when our view is first created.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.860
This function is great for

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.640
any initial setup, or any one time only work that we want to do in our app.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.156
By the way, if you go back to the code,

00:00:51.156 --> 00:00:55.170
you will notice that there is a skeletal version of this method viewDidLoad,

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.970
which was created when we first made our project.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.440
Another function we inherit is called ViewWillAppear.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.069
This function is called right before the view appears to the user.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.210
And it's a great place for showing and hiding different things on our screen.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.150
Next on the list is viewDidAppear.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.440
This function is called right after the view appears to the user and

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.030
is a great place for starting any animations.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.220
There are a few more functions like this.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.350
Two of them are viewWillDisappear and viewDidDisappear.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.540
I've added a link in the instructor notes that provides more details about

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.810
all of these.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.920
By the way, don't take my word for the existence of any of these functions.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.850
Let's go back to Xcode and check for documentation.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.320
Here, I can press and hold the Option key on my keyboard.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.550
And then click on UIViewController, to get some documentation on this class.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.700
If you actually want to see the code inside this class UIViewController,

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.950
what you can do is press and

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.140
hold Cmd on your keyboard, and then click on the class name.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.600
Xcode will now show you the code inside of UIViewController.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.600
Here, you can check to see all of the methods inside UIViewController,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.210
like viewDidLoad, viewWillAppear, and the rest.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.920
Once you are done reading through this code,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.820
you can go back to your own class by clicking this back button here.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.380
Okay, so here I am at the question I asked previously.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.780
Now that we know a little bit more about these functions that run at different

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.390
times in the life of a view, let's think about this question one more time.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.100
If you wanted to write this piece of code to hide the Stop button,

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.350
which method would you write this in?
