UDI MANBER: Today
we have as a guest

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.282
Bob Mankoff, who is the cartoon
editor of "The New Yorker,"

00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:12.240
has been the cartoon
editor of "The New Yorker"

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.490
for over 20 years now.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.700
ROBERT MANKOFF: 1997.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.800
He can't even do the math.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.430
This is the guy who
used to head Search.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.420
UDI MANBER: OK.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.556
I think I'd better let
him do the talking.

00:00:27.556 --> 00:00:29.971
ROBERT MANKOFF: All right,
I'm ready, thank you Udi.

00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:30.470
Thank you.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.840
Great to be here.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.725
I have a question,
is this noticeable?

00:00:38.725 --> 00:00:40.600
Actually, the reason
I've been wearing this--

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.600
and I've been wearing it
around "The New Yorker"

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.000
also-- is that when I
actually wear Glass,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.720
it won't be as obnoxious.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.155
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:52.530
ROBERT MANKOFF:
Anyway, I'm going

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.126
to talk a little
bit about my book,

00:00:54.126 --> 00:00:55.500
because I'm here
to sell my book.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.930
I'm running around
California doing that.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.730
"How About Never--Is Never Good
For You?: My Life In Cartoons".

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.920
But I'm also going to talk
about computers and humor,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.985
and the title of the
talk-- well, no, oh, I've

00:01:06.985 --> 00:01:08.360
got to remember
what you guys are

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.350
going to get if
you buy the book.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.620
Hey, GoPro, watch this.

00:01:14.622 --> 00:01:15.330
Is that exciting?

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.880
Forget that wing gliding
stuff, this is dangerous.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.261
I got a paper cut doing this.

00:01:25.261 --> 00:01:26.760
OK, that's what
you're going to get.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.680
You buy the book,
whatever, you get that.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.040
And what I think I want to say
is if that little drawing I did

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.136
makes the book more
valuable, I'd like it back.

00:01:39.136 --> 00:01:43.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.490
OK, come on.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.110
Go, go, go.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.660
Oh yeah, this is the book.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.550
The thing I want
to say about this

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.750
is there's going to be jokes
and information in this lecture.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.670
The jokes will be
the information,

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.590
and the information
will be the joke.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.140
Think about it.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.140
So that's my cartoon.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.850
You see, that's how old I am.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.956
It's my birthday today, I'm 70.

00:02:11.956 --> 00:02:16.189
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:18.230
ROBERT MANKOFF: That's
great, just getting a hand

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.010
for being 70, that's wonderful.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.700
You know, they say 70 is
the new 50, and that's

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.980
good except that dead
isn't the new alive.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.970
That's the bad part of that.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.632
But anyway, I got in the
"Yale Book of Quotations",

00:02:31.632 --> 00:02:34.090
businessman, Thursday's out,
how about never--is never good

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.070
for you?

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.420
Next to that, other well-known
humorists, Mao Zedong.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.860
OK, so that is the title.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.790
There is no algorithm,
you need a brain.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.700
Now the brain doesn't
have to be that big.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.590
It never ceases to amaze me
what little brains people have.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.650
But you need some
sort of brain, I'm

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.840
going contend, to actually
do real human humor.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.350
Now I was up online,
and I watched

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.030
Watson beat Ken Jennings, and
so I have this little clip.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.014
Let me see, make sure.

And we find-- who is Stoker?

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.467

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.220
ROBERT MANKOFF:
Well there, he did

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.840
something Watson couldn't
do, he made a joke.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.320
He was funny, right,
in that situation.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.970
Now, there are computer
programs that do create humor.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.370
This is called Standup, and
that looks pretty impressive.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.580
Wow, a lot of stuff
going on there,

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.390
a lot of processing stuff.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.350
Really good.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.990
But the jokes aren't that good.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.500
Why is an alone region different
from a sole habitation?

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.590
One is a lonely air, the
other is an only lair.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.630
Thank you.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.630
ROBERT MANKOFF: For real humor,
you need more than a brain.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.327
You need a body.

00:04:36.327 --> 00:04:38.410
Actually, I got this mixed
up, but you need a body

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.120
like that, not like that.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.070
Because, see,
that's a funny body.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.052
Humor must always deflate, and
when I say you need a body,

00:04:47.052 --> 00:04:49.260
you need a body because you
need to be a human being.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.480
Because humor is more
than just cognition.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.224
But even if you had robots--
this a great cartoon.

00:04:58.224 --> 00:04:59.890
If I can't feel love,
what was the point

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.306
of making me so
damn good looking.

00:05:03.745 --> 00:05:05.620
Well, of course, the
robots and the computers

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.630
can't feel anything.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.920
Now humor is an emotion.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.470
It's a very, very
strong emotion.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.670
It's an ecstatic promotion.

ROBERT MANKOFF: We don't
know what she's laughing at,

00:05:33.423 --> 00:05:35.882
but it wasn't a computer joke.

00:05:35.882 --> 00:05:37.340
That's my first
wife, incidentally.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.060
You know, it's funny
though, because this thing

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.120
that we think is a good thing--
a little parenthetical point I

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.370
want to make-- was not always
thought that way at all.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.880
This is Lord Chesterfield
in a letter to his son,

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.080
how to conduct himself.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.240
Frequent and loud laughter
is the characteristic

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.690
of folly and ill manners.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.530
How low and unbecoming
a thing laughter

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.090
is, not to mention the
disagreeable noise that it

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.870
makes, and the
shocking distortion

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.120
of the face that is occasions.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.570
I have never laughed in my life.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.500
It's interesting,
our view of laughter

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.470
and the importance
of it has changed.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.150
I can show you
that by, well, this

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.656
is Plato and Aristotle
and Hobbes' views of it.

00:06:19.656 --> 00:06:21.030
Mixture of pleasure
and pain that

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.010
lies in the malice of amusement.

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.130
Aristotle, comedy is
an imitation of people

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.550
worse than themselves.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.840
Hobbes is all about
superiority theory.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.897
You'll be happy to see this.

00:06:31.897 --> 00:06:32.730
It's a Google Ngram.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:41.900
Nobody even had a sense
of humor until about 1870.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:42.930
Isn't that amazing?

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.630
It's actually quite a new thing.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.600
It actually is a new thing.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.180
Before that, based
on what I showed you

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.460
about Aristotle and
Plato, views of humor

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.900
were very, very negative.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:53.500
Why?

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.986
Because the thing that we
call the sense of humor,

00:06:55.986 --> 00:06:57.860
they said the thing was
called either a sense

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.740
of the ridiculous or
a sense of ridicule.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.980
Because that's one of the
primary function of humor.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.170
There's wonderful functions
of humor, but when

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.342
you think, well, why is it
in every culture, everywhere,

00:07:09.342 --> 00:07:10.050
and all the time?

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.760
What does it do?

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.680
What is its function?

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.640
Why is it everywhere?

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.180
You ask, what is it that keeps
everybody doing-- conforming,

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:21.680
basically.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.190
Not at Google, but
everywhere else.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.750
What is it?

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.681
You don't want to be
embarrassed, right?

00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:29.930
You don't want to have that
toilet paper on your shoe,

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.229
you don't want to have
your fly open, right.

00:07:32.229 --> 00:07:34.270
We know what it's like to
be in elementary school

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.620
and high school.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.510
What's the policeman
of embarrassment?

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:38.570
Laughter.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:42.985
So one of the functions of
laughter-- a harsh function,

00:07:42.985 --> 00:07:46.220
a conforming
function-- is ridicule.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.742
People say laughter
is contagious.

00:07:47.742 --> 00:07:49.200
Well, that laughter
was contagious,

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.462
but it's not contagious
when it's behind your back.

00:07:51.462 --> 00:07:53.920
So that's one of the reasons
it wasn't looked on favorably.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.275
Now it's very different,
because a sense of humor

00:07:56.275 --> 00:07:58.570
came to mean something else.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.040
What a sense of
humor came to mean--

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.954
it's easier to see by what you
say if someone doesn't have it.

00:08:03.954 --> 00:08:06.120
Why do we say someone doesn't
have a sense of humor?

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.150
It's more than they're
not funny, right.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.700
They have rigid thinking.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.990
They have no perspective
on themselves.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.040
The transformation is
why it became important,

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.534
and why it's very difficult
for computers to have it.

00:08:17.534 --> 00:08:19.950
Because the sense of humor,
which originally was something

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:23.900
that was directed out to
something deformed, something

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.610
ugly that you didn't
have empathy for, got

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.247
directed back towards ourselves
as something to be perspective.

00:08:30.247 --> 00:08:32.580
That's why it's valued, and
that's part of its function,

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:33.610
now, also.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.780
What does evolution
tell us about humor?

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.419
That's a little cartoon of mine.

to animals playing--

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:42.630
ROBERT MANKOFF:
It's a type of play.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:47.670
-We have heard what appear
to be the sounds of laughter.

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.590
And we studied these
for a couple of years

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.760
without quite understanding
that this might be laughter.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:01.130
And then one day, we decided
to tickle some animals.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:04.620
We realized that we had to
look at the sounds at a very

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.530
different register
than we can hear.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.550
So we obtained these
transducers that

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:14.890
are called bat detectors that
can bring very high frequencies

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.950
down to our auditory range.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:20.530
When we did this
and we listened in,

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:23.650
we could tickle
animals and generate

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:27.750
a lot of vocal activity
that appear to be laughter.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:34.790
These animals would begin
to enjoy our company,

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.430
and they would start
to play with our hands,

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:40.220
and wherever we would put our
hands, they would follow it.

[CHIRPING NOISES]

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.500
-And when we tested
these animals

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.585
to ask whether they were
enjoying this kind of activity,

00:09:50.585 --> 00:09:53.182
the unambiguous answer was yes.

00:09:53.182 --> 00:09:54.015

00:09:54.015 --> 00:09:55.510
ROBERT MANKOFF: An
interesting result

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.259
of that study is that
he has talking rats.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.330
I tried that in the
subway and it bit me,

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.392
so not always the case.

00:10:04.392 --> 00:10:05.850
But one of the
things it shows you,

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.360
it shows how deep
humor is an emotion.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.420
When you look at humor, overall,
you'll see, first of all,

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.250
it's a social phenomenon.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:20.110
Whatever that woman was
doing, she was not alone.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.530
It's a social
phenomenon, there's

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.320
something cognitive
that stimulates it.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.330
There's this emotion,
there's a feeling

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.190
that happens before you laugh.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.560
So you could have people
judge comedy films

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.325
and instruct them not
to laugh, and they still

00:10:37.325 --> 00:10:40.510
will be able to know that it's
funny, and feel the funny.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:44.660
And then there's this
expression in laughter,

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.830
which is a type
of communication.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:47.330
OK.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:10:48.596 --> 00:10:50.110
ROBERT MANKOFF:
So the same thing

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.900
happens with chimps
as we go further up.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.769
-It's coming.

00:10:58.769 --> 00:10:59.685
It's going to get you.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.610
Here it comes, Alfie.

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.618
Here it comes, Alfie.

00:11:07.618 --> 00:11:09.746
It's going to get you.

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:13.078 --> 00:11:16.120
ROBERT MANKOFF: OK.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.840
But this is a little
bit higher up, yet.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.120
This shows you a
lot about humor.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.710
This is a little
game of peekaboo.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:24.520
It's not just tickling.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.680
It's not tickling, and this is
the play face that's happening,

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.930
this is the play face
that's happening.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.560
So we see, when
looking at this, you

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.990
see that humor is
very, very deep, very,

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:36.390
very, very deep in us.

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.810
Very deep as a feeling, and
very deep as a function.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.480
So it's a form of communication.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.240
What it communicates
is that we're playing.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.890
Humor is a form of play.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.270
We're always really
going between two modes.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:55.020
One is sort of the serious,
what's called a telec mode,

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:55.960
purposeful.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.780
OK, we want things to be done.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.180
And the other is the play mode.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.649
When we're in a purposeful mode,
we actually like to be relaxed.

00:12:02.649 --> 00:12:04.190
We don't like to be
anxious, we don't

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:05.720
like to be over stimulated.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:10.050
When we're in a play mode,
exactly the opposite exists.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.200
We want to be excited.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.060
Look at this video.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:13.726

-Here we go.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:27.583
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:27.583 --> 00:12:28.416
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:28.416 --> 00:12:30.244
ROBERT MANKOFF: Well, that's
interesting, he laughs,

00:12:30.244 --> 00:12:30.730
doesn't he.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.104
So the other thing
that shows you

00:12:32.104 --> 00:12:36.360
is that humor is an emotional
regulation mechanism.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.500
Partly it's based on
surprise, but it's

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.920
the surprise we expect.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.580
That's what happened,
the surprise we expect.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.580
Surprise is always
bad for an organism.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.730
You should never be surprised
from an evolutionary point

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:52.460
of view.

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:57.322
I see all these looks, brow
looks furrowed because he said,

00:12:57.322 --> 00:12:58.280
he's going to be funny.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.790
Don't worry, just give me time.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.830
So surprise is always bad
because you should predict.

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:07.770
So originally, when
you're surprised,

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.070
whether it's by a
joke or whatever,

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:11.700
there's a slight
negative valence.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.870
You should know
what's happening.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:16.440
Surprise can be met by
three different things.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:21.230
Fear, obviously,
awe, or laughter.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:23.210
All of them are
respiratory responses

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:26.460
preparing the organism
for something.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.830
In the simplest
cases of laughter,

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:32.030
you have surprise,
which is always bad,

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:33.610
followed by something trivial.

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.160
That's just relief laughter,
you thought something bad.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.040
Jokes and everything
build on this.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.110
Here's interesting--
this is my contract,

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:42.818
because now I want to
get to a little bit

00:13:42.818 --> 00:13:45.151
of the cognitive part--
here's my contract.

00:13:45.151 --> 00:13:47.150
They have this in the
book from "The New Yorker"

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.290
when they gave me a
contract to be a cartoonist.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:51.320
I've blurred out all the
parts about the liquor,

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.650
and the women, and
the money, because I

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.870
didn't think that
was your business.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:58.250
But look at the contract.

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:00.490
This is the contract
for me as a cartoonist.

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:03.196
It doesn't have the
word cartoon anywhere.

00:14:03.196 --> 00:14:06.160
It says idea drawing,
for any idea drawing

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.040
we accept from you
during this period,

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.480
with respect to idea drawing.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.960
So that's the other
part of humor,

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.620
especially for "The New
Yorker," that there is an idea.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:20.180
People ask me how I get my
ideas, and I glibly say,

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.199
I think of them.

00:14:22.199 --> 00:14:26.342
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:26.342 --> 00:14:28.300
ROBERT MANKOFF: Here's
some ideas I thought of.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.780
There is no justice
in the world,

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.029
there is some justice in the
world, the world is just.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.258
It's called what
lemmings believe.

00:14:38.258 --> 00:14:42.002
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:42.002 --> 00:14:45.134
ROBERT MANKOFF: Now, there
are just straight gags,

00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:46.550
and then there are
gags-- and this

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.550
is part of what I write
about in the book-- that

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:51.270
have some other value because
there's some other idea.

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:53.770
There's an idea over
and above the idea

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:56.150
that is happening in the joke.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.280
So the joke works just on
the levels of lemmings,

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.230
but for me, this
is a broader joke.

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:02.730
There's another
meaning to it, which

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.570
is about belief in general.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.040
For me, it's a belief
about religion,

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.740
and it's my
expression of the idea

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.540
that all the arguments--
horrible arguments--

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:16.810
between religions are about who
has the most imaginary friends.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:22.160
OK, this is actually
a little diagram--

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.790
I meant best imaginary
friend-- here's

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:27.530
a diagram of how you
actually get ideas, which

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:29.280
is a mash up of
different concepts.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.690
I was aked by Psychology Today
to show how you get an idea.

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:36.650
So I said, OK, I'm going to
do an idea about the wheel.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:40.220
So originally what I did
was I just drew a wheel.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.640
I drew a wheel, I
drew a square wheel.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.190
And wheel is invention,
fire is invention.

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:47.470
When I saw the
square wheel I said,

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:49.100
oh, that's like a bad thing.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.000
That could be a
clunker or a car.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.910
Trade in for a new
model, I wrote.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:55.850
Wheel, transportation,
car, bicycle, what.

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:58.510
Then I came up with a
cartoon in which I said,

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:04.260
the back part I call the wheel,
the front part, the brake.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.700
Then I didn't know what I would
do, wheel on fire, invention.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.340
I didn't know.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:12.090
That's just a mash up,
that's going to be an idea.

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:14.580
That's an incongruity
that will be an idea.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:18.220
Then, if there was a real
wheel, it could be a car.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:19.730
Dad, can I borrow
the wheel tonight.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:21.970
The interesting thing
about these ideas

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:25.010
is that they don't use up.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:26.710
They create other ideas.

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:30.810
There are actually an infinite
number of ideas like this.

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:32.670
Here's one that we had
in "The New Yorker."

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:37.180
Yeah, yeah, and I
invented the ticket.

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:41.730
And now we've taken it
completely out of that.

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.900
So one of the things
that's happening here

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:50.010
is that you do have the basic
mechanism of surprise working.

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.650
It works very, very fast.

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:55.220
It works very fast because
you see the image which

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:59.930
is incongruous, and then
you put this thing together.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.930
Built on the tiny
little surprise

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.730
is cognitive thrill or pleasure.

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:06.960
One of the things is,
when many things happen

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.030
at the same time-- my
belief anyway, what's

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:12.500
happening in humor-- is
you can't parse them out.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.480
So at the same moment
that the surprise--

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:19.224
so if I tell a joke,
OK, so I'll tell a joke.

00:17:19.224 --> 00:17:20.589
Here's a joke.

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:23.050
So a guy is walking
in a field and he

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:29.394
sees a farmer walking a pig, and
the pig has an artificial leg.

00:17:29.394 --> 00:17:31.560
Now, in your minds, you're
already a little worried.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.106
So this is good.

00:17:33.106 --> 00:17:35.980
I'm deconstructing the
joke a little bit for you.

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.910
E.B. White said analyzing humor
is like dissecting a frog.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.530
Nobody's much interested
and the frog dies.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:43.950
Well I'll kill a frog.

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:45.997
OK, so now the guy
is walking a pig,

00:17:45.997 --> 00:17:48.184
and the pig's got
an artificial leg.

00:17:48.184 --> 00:17:49.350
Now you're a little worried.

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:50.405
Not really, because
you're smart,

00:17:50.405 --> 00:17:52.330
you're from Google, like
what's going on here.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:53.288
I sure hope I get this.

00:17:53.288 --> 00:17:56.372

00:17:56.372 --> 00:17:59.200
ROBERT MANKOFF: Because
really, come on.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.720
OK, so he asks the
farmer, he says

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.140
I've never seen a pig
with an artificial leg.

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.590
He said, you see that house
up there, way up there?

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:09.430
There was a fire in that house.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:14.315
This pig came up, he
saved me, then he went up

00:18:14.315 --> 00:18:18.420
and he saved my wife
and my two children.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.625
He said, so he burned his
leg in the fire, right?

00:18:21.625 --> 00:18:22.460
He said, no, no, no.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.210
You don't eat a pig
like that all at once.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:28.930
[LAUGHTER] Oh, that's horrible.

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:32.300
OK, so all of a sudden, the
narrative completely changed,

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.170
and then you put
the things together.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.870
Whether or not you
like that or don't

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:38.920
like that will depend
on many things.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.670
Your disposition, your
feelings about animal rights,

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:43.120
a million other things.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.550
These are all enhancers or
inhibitors that don't really

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:48.720
have anything to
do with the joke.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.630
If they get enhanced
or inhibited enough

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:51.464
they can inhibit it.

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:52.838
If you have enough
enhancers, you

00:18:52.838 --> 00:18:54.687
could make anyone really
laugh at anything.

00:18:54.687 --> 00:18:56.770
But the point is, there's
a narrative switch which

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:59.800
is the surprise and
then the pleasure.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.260
And the pleasure,
then, could also

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.820
be the pleasure in your own
sadistic and cruel impulses

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.600
towards that pig.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.220
George Orwell said jokes
don't degrade us, they just

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.250
tell us we are degraded.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:14.750
OK.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:15.210
No, Thursday's out.

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:16.660
How about never--is
never good for you.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.140
That's the cartoon,
that's the cartoon that

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.170
put my daughter through
college and everything.

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.280
It's great.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.110
Actually, it's OK.

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:28.140
One of the things they say ask
about it is, why is that part?

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.370
Why can't I just end it?

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:34.190
Why can't I just end
it with no, Thursday's

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:36.801
out, how about never.

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:37.300
Hands?

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:41.730
AUDIENCE: Because
that just sounds mean.

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:42.185
ROBERT MANKOFF: What's that?

00:19:42.185 --> 00:19:42.935
AUDIENCE: It just sounds mean.

00:19:42.935 --> 00:19:44.900
ROBERT MANKOFF: It
just sounds mean?

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.180
Well, what do you mean?

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:49.960
Why is it not mean, because is
never good for you makes it?

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.784
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:51.784 --> 00:19:54.550
ROBERT MANKOFF: I
mean, is never good

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.230
for you rubs it in, doesn't it?

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:59.014
AUDIENCE: But people
say that, right?

00:19:59.014 --> 00:20:01.241
How about 5:00, is
5:00 good for you?

00:20:01.241 --> 00:20:02.240
ROBERT MANKOFF: Exactly.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.070
Well, you're onto something.

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.606
You did more than
just eat that salad.

00:20:07.606 --> 00:20:09.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.416
ROBERT MANKOFF:
What it is is this.

00:20:13.416 --> 00:20:15.880
Arthur Koestler, in a book,
"The Act of Creation",

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:20.250
talked about the similarity
between science, humor,

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:23.460
and art, in that they
involved creating things

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.090
from different matrices,
different associations.

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.090
And humor certainly does that.

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:31.340
What this is doing
is mashing up,

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:35.920
but the mash up here is
between a message that

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:41.560
is absolutely rude with the
syntax continuing to be polite.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.330
So that's what you
were onto, really.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:47.720
That's why is never good for
you continues the politeness.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.630
So what happens is
a cognitive synergy.

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:53.040
At the both time we're
experiencing rudeness

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.520
and politeness, and
I think that's what

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.360
gives it its little frisson.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.050
Humor needs a target.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:03.790
How's my GoPro, all right.

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:07.560
So like I said, it
can be a little cruel.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.950
We've all felt like that.

00:21:13.915 --> 00:21:14.956
Now look at this cartoon.

00:21:14.956 --> 00:21:17.905
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:17.905 --> 00:21:22.390
ROBERT MANKOFF: So that's
fairly benign, you would think.

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:25.170
But is it benign-- once
again, I want to point out

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:27.070
the dispositional
nature of humor, which

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:30.730
means your attitudes and
your opinions will determine

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:33.010
the context of humor
and how you react to it.

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:36.330
So that seems fairly benign,
but let's look at the response.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.140
Email comment on this cartoon.

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:40.030
Another joke on old white male.

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:40.690
Ha ha, the wit.

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:42.398
It's nice, I'm sure
to be young and rude,

00:21:42.398 --> 00:21:44.915
but someday you'll be old,
unless you drop dead as I wish.

00:21:44.915 --> 00:21:47.585
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:47.585 --> 00:21:51.420
ROBERT MANKOFF: So,
cordially, Robert Byron.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.100
Actually, he's making a joke.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.180
You see, he's mashing up, right.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:00.540
He himself is mashing up.

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.070
He actually is
being funny himself,

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:05.040
because he's saying cordially,
Robert Byron, after something

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.790
is completely non-cordial.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:07.330
OK.

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:09.470
Discouraging data on
the antidepressant.

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:13.127
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:13.127 --> 00:22:14.960
ROBERT MANKOFF: So I
like that little pause.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.835
That was a good laugh,
I want that on record.

00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:21.290
Because we had the regular
laugh, the real laugh,

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:25.280
the emotional laugh, ha ha
ha, then we had the ooh.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.840
Which says I drive
a Prius, I'm good,

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.810
I believe in global
warming, you wouldn't

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:33.910
believe the organic
foods, everything.

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:37.240
Honestly, that first
part was a mistake.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.450
Something I regret.

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:43.095
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:43.095 --> 00:22:45.400
ROBERT MANKOFF: This is
a survey I did online

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.470
to see-- this shows
you, actually,

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:49.210
the real diversity of opinion.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:53.440
So people could rate it to
10, and 109 people liked it.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.180
So really, the majority of
people liked, just about.

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.230
Or a lot, anyway.

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:59.630
But look at this person
who did not like it.

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:02.140
They voted only three
and said I like animals.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:03.940
Look how much they liked them.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:06.080
One, two.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.970
You can't like animals more
than five exclamation points.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:11.215
If you do, it's unhealthy.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:15.780
Look at this person.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:20.380
I don't like to see animals
suffer, even in cartoons.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.910
So I am solicitous
to these people.

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:26.630
I wrote back and I
said they don't suffer.

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:32.880
We use anesthetic ink.

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.617
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:36.617 --> 00:23:39.180
ROBERT MANKOFF: Seems just
like the results of my-- so,

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.750
this is actually,
when humor is not

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:45.260
affected by contagion and
the contagion of laughter,

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.500
the diversity of
opinion is very great.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.150
But it depends on what
you're-- actually,

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.580
things that you feel
really strongly about,

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.560
you usually will
not think is funny.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.420
When you have really,
really strong beliefs,

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:02.020
then humor, to you, seems
like some sort of blasphemy.

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:02.520
OK.

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.450
Humor is a type
of entertainment.

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:06.620
This is a type of
entertainment, too.

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:10.010
The tiger in a cage.

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:14.710
What's exciting about it
is, ooh, he could kill us.

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:16.950
What's good about
it is no, he can't.

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:19.020
It's just like the guy
in the roller coaster.

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:21.590
You're safe, but in danger,
safe, but in danger, safe,

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:22.290
but in danger.

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:23.250
Wow, that's fun.

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:26.060
That's sort of fun, I guess.

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.630
That's not that much fun.

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:32.500
That's sort of a bad zoo.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.060
But there are worse zoos.

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.225
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:37.225 --> 00:24:39.280
ROBERT MANKOFF: So
that's the line.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.790
When you look at humor
within context, and this

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:45.370
would be the difficulty for
computers, because not just

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:48.490
in the creation of it, but
in the evaluation of it.

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:52.020
To know-- for my job-- what's
right and wrong for "The New

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:52.706
Yorker."

00:24:52.706 --> 00:24:53.580
Look at this cartoon.

00:24:57.109 --> 00:24:57.775
Oh, I like that.

00:24:57.775 --> 00:25:00.260
We got the oh before.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:03.360
That's definitely-- if you got
the oh before for that one, how

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.075
about this.

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:10.050
Oh, that is sad.

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:11.870
Who did you think was
going up the ramp?

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:19.700
But this is the point
of the titration

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.520
of humor, how you
move it around.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.800
One of the ways to look at
humor, or a lot of humor,

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.840
as the enhancement and not
the essential part of it,

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.760
is the right amount of wrong.

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.650
Like the Las Vegas ad,
the right amount of wrong.

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:35.670
So just enough where you
like the wrongness of it,

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:37.400
because actually,
we want freedom

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.640
from the rightness of our lives.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.450
But with this thing, by
putting the guy up there,

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:47.440
or if I had him hanging,
it's all terrible.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.130
One of things, of course, we
have is our caption contest.

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:52.080
And one of the reasons
I'm here besides,

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.690
I'm a good friend of Udi, he's a
great guy, big fan of cartoons,

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:59.240
is that I have data on
the caption contest.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.860
I have millions of entries.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.870
You are data
people, help me out.

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:07.670
So on the caption contest,
every week there's

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:10.770
a winner, three finalists,
I won't go through it,

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:12.180
and one that you can enter.

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:16.910
So here aliens are coming
right behind the car, right.

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:19.624
I gave you data to
computer linguists

00:26:19.624 --> 00:26:21.290
at the University of
Michigan-- I really

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:23.021
hope you guys can
do better than this.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.780
Actually a very nice guy.

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.580
Dragomir Radev and Ben King.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.930
And what they did
was, they took--

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:34.090
I get about 5,000 to
10,000 captions-- they took

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:37.870
all the words that came in,
compared them to basically all

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:40.000
the words on the
internet, standard words,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.550
and picked out the words of that
were unusual, were not common.

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:49.070
And from that-- I changed
the formula to what the fuck,

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:51.646
because I didn't understand
the first formula.

00:26:51.646 --> 00:26:53.896
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:53.896 --> 00:26:56.270
ROBERT MANKOFF: Oh, they come
up with this mapping, which

00:26:56.270 --> 00:27:00.090
showed the clusters
of words, and really

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:01.960
the clusters of captions.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.320
And from that-- and this
is like a blow up of it--

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:08.415
and from that, you
got basically-- when

00:27:08.415 --> 00:27:10.225
those 5,000 or
10,000 comes in, it's

00:27:10.225 --> 00:27:13.570
not 5,000 or 10,000
different captions.

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:15.000
It's called
collective discourse,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.220
so it's very interesting that no
one knows what other people are

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:19.810
doing, but they doing this.

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:22.590
But the truth is,
the computer did not

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:26.750
create headlight, beam,
alien, UFO, tailgate.

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:30.160
Someone had to look at these
clusters to say, do that.

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:33.080
So it actually was not
tremendously useful to me

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.020
because truthfully,
as it comes in,

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.805
I can see these clusters
very, very fast.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.450
I don't care what
planet they're from,

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:45.580
they can pass on the
left like everyone else.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:49.680
So these were sort of the three
finalists, rather ordinary.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.590
One of the things about humor
is it can be meta humor.

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:55.040
This is a site called
What a Misunderstanding,

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.970
and every single contest
it has the same caption.

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:02.870
What a misunderstanding.

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:06.990
Then, I'm just showing
how complicated humor is.

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:08.850
Then there's the
monkeys you ordered,

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:12.090
which just simply says
what's in the caption.

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:13.830
There's a UFO right behind us.

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:16.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.880
ROBERT MANKOFF: Then there's
the anti-caption contest,

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.800
which I'll read.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.470
Back off, you mother-fucking
alien piece of shit,

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:25.890
and go back to
your own planet you

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:28.920
uninsured little
green cock-sucker.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.760
Which, of course,
is much funnier

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.430
because of the transgression.

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:37.720
That is a complete
enhancer joke.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.130
OK, now look at this.

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:40.910
This is one of them.

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:43.510
And one of the things you see
in the generational of humor

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:46.440
and crowd sourcing, OK, this
was the winning caption.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.390
Objection, your honor,
alleged killer whale.

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:51.526
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:51.526 --> 00:28:53.470
ROBERT MANKOFF: And in
the caption contest,

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:54.850
I get people complaining.

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:59.180
I can't believe it,
someone stole my caption,

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.670
I can't believe it.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:04.020
I was on a plane, I wrote it on
the back of "The New Yorker,"

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.470
I left it in the thing and
then someone clearly stole it.

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:11.540
OK, no they didn't.

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:14.070
Hundreds of basically
the same caption

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:17.450
come in for every
single contest.

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:18.520
OK.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.870
Sometimes the best caption
is the very simplest.

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:25.120
It sort of makes you stop
and think, doesn't it.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.120
And that's what I
hope I've done today,

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.880
and now we can talk about humor.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:29.610
Thank you.

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:33.194
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:33.194 --> 00:29:35.800
ROBERT MANKOFF: Man, this hurts.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.170
We'll sit and talk.

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.230
I'll answer questions
and Udi will moderate.

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:41.450
UDI MANBER: OK.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:44.340
Let me ask the first question
and we'll go from there.

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:46.110
So you mentioned
that surprise is

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:48.960
something against our nature.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.510
Are you still surprise
by seeing cartoons,

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:52.890
can they surprise you?

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:57.050
ROBERT MANKOFF: I am
surprised, in other words,

00:29:57.050 --> 00:30:00.050
I am in the position of not
enjoying humor, but evaluating

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:00.740
it.

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:06.320
So whenever you mediate a
response-- in other words,

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.650
I'll never be as surprised
as you are by the joke,

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:10.400
I'll always sort
of be ahead of it.

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:17.440
I am usually not surprised, but
yet, I can evaluate the humor,

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.280
so I know what's
going to surprise you.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:23.970
That's really what a
professional does in any art.

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:28.510
That I'm aware of the audience,
so when I constructed-- right

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:30.720
now, this thing here,
what I did for you guys--

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.440
when I constructed it, some
jokes were new, some old.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:37.878
And I had to be able
to sort of predict.

00:30:37.878 --> 00:30:40.660
And in that case, I'm
not surprised at all,

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.840
because I know exactly
what I'm going to do.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.340
I know exactly what
I'm going to do.

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.720
I'm going to put
this on, I know it's

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:51.000
going to create tension because
it's weird, looking at me.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.030
I know that actually is the
fuel which humor can work with.

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:56.750
But I'm not going to
be surprised by it,

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:57.620
so I'm not really.

00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:00.590
The things I'm surprised
at are the things

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:02.756
that you're not
going to find funny.

00:31:02.756 --> 00:31:04.610
UDI MANBER: Interesting.

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:06.500
So the cartoons
that make you funny,

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:07.664
nobody here will laugh at.

00:31:07.664 --> 00:31:08.830
ROBERT MANKOFF: What's that?

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:11.890
Well, for the most
part, because you

00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:16.310
tend to laugh at just weird
things or a type of absurdity.

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:19.730
So I made myself laugh for no
reason at all in the airport,

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:20.539
crazy.

00:31:20.539 --> 00:31:22.080
I don't know what
the guy was saying,

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:27.440
he said please watch
your unattended luggage,

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:32.510
it may be confiscated,
damaged, destroyed.

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:33.940
And then I just said, or eaten.

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:35.386
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:35.386 --> 00:31:36.810
ROBERT MANKOFF: I don't know.

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:41.402
It just made me laugh,
I just said, or eaten.

00:31:41.402 --> 00:31:44.960
I would die to have
him say that over that.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.250
But it's interesting.

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:49.860
So one of the things we talk
about is the play frame,

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:52.240
so we're in the play
frame and you heard that.

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:56.440
If you had heard that
at the airport, imagine.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.700
You wouldn't laugh,
you'd be frightened.

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:04.390
What is loose in the airport
that is eating luggage?

00:32:08.122 --> 00:32:09.830
UDI MANBER: So you do
laugh, that's good.

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:12.790
Yeah, any questions?

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:15.216
Go ahead, get a mic in back.

00:32:15.216 --> 00:32:17.290
AUDIENCE: Do you often
come across a cartoon

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:19.615
you don't get at all?

00:32:19.615 --> 00:32:21.840
ROBERT MANKOFF: Well, there
are different varieties

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.510
of don't get.

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:29.570
There's the don't get in which
you're not intended to get.

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:35.470
In some way, you're not
intended to the get Eden.

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:39.310
In other words, it doesn't
have closure in the same way.

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:43.180
It doesn't, like, oh,
oh, now I understand it.

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:46.300
If I tell you about a cartoon
and the title is French Army

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:50.990
Knife, and it has all
corkscrews, you understand it.

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:53.830
You will put together, and
there's complete closure.

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:55.080
I understand the joke.

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:58.630
The other thing, all of a
sudden you've been surprised,

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:02.810
and it's your enjoyment
of the absurd.

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:05.050
And so a lot of that happens
because we definitely

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:07.770
have cartoons like that
in "The New Yorker."

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:11.060
It might have a title,
Paninis of the Old West.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:15.650
Now, in and of itself, the
phrase Paninis of the Old West

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:17.290
is funny.

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:20.380
It's just, if you were to
evaluate funny phrases for one,

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:21.700
you'd say that's funny.

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.524
Do you say, what does it mean?

00:33:23.524 --> 00:33:24.940
Now, I can make
it mean something,

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:31.400
because I can have a villain
on the tracks with a panini,

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.710
so now it's going to be smushed.

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:36.860
So this is going back
to the computer thing,

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.680
this is what makes humor
the difficult problem.

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:42.640
So many different ways that
it can interact, so many ways

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.410
that it interacts
because we're human

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:46.210
beings, because
of how surprised,

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:49.520
how emotion, all of
these come together.

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.960
So I definitely will sometimes
have a cartoon I don't get,

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.220
because I'm not seeing
the association,

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.770
it's some reference I don't get.

00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:57.070
That happens.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:34:00.150
But most of cartoons that people
complain about not getting

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:04.762
are because they have this
very, very loose structure.

00:34:04.762 --> 00:34:07.690
UDI MANBER: Let me ask you
another, actually, an advice.

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:12.860
So Dave Berry was here, he
gave Search very good advice.

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:16.739
He said what you need to do
is, every few minutes, send out

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:19.368
messages saying, now
get back to work.

00:34:19.368 --> 00:34:20.659
Do you have some advice for us?

00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:21.440
ROBERT MANKOFF: I
think whenever you

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.060
need to click Search
it should just

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.502
say search your conscience.

00:34:25.502 --> 00:34:26.960
UDI MANBER: Search
your conscience.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.256
ROBERT MANKOFF: First.

00:34:29.256 --> 00:34:30.130
You know what I mean?

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:31.921
Look at all the wrong
things you did today.

00:34:31.921 --> 00:34:34.690
UDI MANBER: OK.

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:36.150
ROBERT MANKOFF: Then, you know.

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:37.780
UDI MANBER: But what
would I click on?

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:40.139
ROBERT MANKOFF: What?

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:41.239
I'm no interface designer.

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:42.000
UDI MANBER: OK.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:42.732
Good point.

00:34:42.732 --> 00:34:44.766
ROBERT MANKOFF: All of
a sudden, [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:44.766 --> 00:34:45.849
UDI MANBER: Next question.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.210
AUDIENCE: Do
cartoonists actually

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:53.150
do any research on what
lemmings actually look like?

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:53.679
Or do they--

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:54.762
ROBERT MANKOFF: Excuse me?

00:34:54.762 --> 00:34:57.349
AUDIENCE: The lemmings in your
cartoon, do you actually know--

00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:59.390
ROBERT MANKOFF: Those are
completely anatomically

00:34:59.390 --> 00:34:59.970
accurate.

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:01.765
Not only is the
outside accurate,

00:35:01.765 --> 00:35:04.600
the inside of the lemmings.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:07.000
I just don't draw the
outside of the lemming.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.910
First I construct the complete
skeleton on the lemming,

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:12.010
then I clothe it.

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:16.270
So actually, there is fact
checking at "The New Yorker,"

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:18.350
so here's a funny
story about that.

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:23.510
I did a cartoon when
Prozac first came out,

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:27.180
maybe the early '90s, so it's
based on the bluebird cliche,

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:28.690
bluebird of happiness.

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:32.890
So there's a
bluebird, but he's got

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:36.015
a vial of pills in his mouth,
and he's saying hi, hi, you

00:35:36.015 --> 00:35:37.390
guy, I'm the blue
bird of Prozac.

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:38.910
So this is when
it first came out.

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:42.835
So the fact checkers came to
me and said the bird's too big.

00:35:42.835 --> 00:35:44.460
I said, well, it's
hard, because you've

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.610
got to see the pills, and stuff.

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:46.950
Back and forth, back and forth.

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:48.350
They fact check everything.

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:50.850
So I called her over,
her name was Dusty.

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:53.690
I said Dusty, I don't want
anyone else to hear this.

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:56.000
They can't talk.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.190
The birds can't talk.

00:35:57.190 --> 00:36:01.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:02.960
ROBERT MANKOFF: So we do.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.335
Some of the things,
for instance,

00:36:04.335 --> 00:36:05.660
if you draw the
Supreme Court, you're

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.743
going to get the number
of pillars right, columns,

00:36:07.743 --> 00:36:09.750
if there's an American flag.

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:13.010
So there is checking like that.

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:13.950
UDI MANBER: Christina.

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:15.325
AUDIENCE: So I'm
wondering if you

00:36:15.325 --> 00:36:17.330
can talk a little bit
about the cartoons

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:20.120
that David Remnick did
not let you publish.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:25.620
So you said humor is safe,
but in danger, and getting

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:26.850
the right amount of wrong.

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:28.855
So I'm wondering if you
could square that with--

00:36:28.855 --> 00:36:29.646
ROBERT MANKOFF: OK.

00:36:29.646 --> 00:36:33.370
So here, once again, The
New Yorker, like Google,

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:38.220
is a commercial institution that
is supported by advertising.

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:44.060
So the only-- I forget the
guy's name, great comedian,

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:46.920
Stanhope is his last name-- the
only real freedom is stand up

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.470
in a club where you
can say just what you

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:51.130
want, anything you want.

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:54.160
I can't say that
here because why?

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.972
Because there are real
punishments for it.

00:36:55.972 --> 00:36:57.430
You have to decide
whether you want

00:36:57.430 --> 00:37:00.230
those commercial
punishments on you.

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:03.060
But here are cartoons that "The
New Yorker" did not publish.

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:04.740
One of them, which
is funny, I did

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:08.990
this when "The Sopranos"
was a hot show.

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:11.770
There's a Tony
Soprano guy and he's

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:15.670
in a room with his
guys, a closed room,

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:18.302
and he's saying, if
these walls could talk

00:37:18.302 --> 00:37:20.885
and they knew what was good for
them, they'd shut the fuck up.

00:37:20.885 --> 00:37:22.914
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:22.914 --> 00:37:25.502
ROBERT MANKOFF: OK, so
we're not going to use fuck.

00:37:25.502 --> 00:37:26.460
Because we don't do it.

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:28.331
Because a child
might see the word

00:37:28.331 --> 00:37:30.080
fuck, and you know
what would happen then.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:31.710
They would die.

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:34.230
We know all the children who
die every day because they

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:37.280
see the word fuck,
and that happens.

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.280
We can't have on our head.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:41.570
Another cartoon, a
great cartoon, actually,

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:44.120
was done by Sam Gross.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:47.860
It was right after the
Danish cartoon controversy,

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:50.030
and everybody was
running scared,

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:51.970
everybody was scared,
physically scared.

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:56.350
I gave talks on stage with
imams and stuff like that,

00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:58.100
and I was worried,
physically worried

00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:59.975
because of what I
was going to say.

00:37:59.975 --> 00:38:01.640
I was worried.

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:06.360
So during that period, I
said, I remember what I did.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.830
I knew I had to
avoid Muhammad, I

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:09.330
couldn't say anything
about Muhammad

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:11.780
because I was afraid they
were going to kill me.

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:12.540
Honestly.

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:15.230
So I said OK, I'm not
going to say anything,

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:16.480
I'm going right to the top.

00:38:19.197 --> 00:38:21.530
You can make fun of God, you
can't make fun of Muhammad.

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:25.270
But anyway, so after
the controversy

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:29.540
Sam Gross, great cartoonist,
submitted this cartoon.

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:33.030
It's in heaven and
there's a suicide bomber

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:34.450
who's all blown to pieces.

00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:36.810
Different parts, he's got
his head, stuff like that.

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:40.040
And there's a, let's
say, an imam there,

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:43.170
and the imam is
saying to him, you'll

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:45.488
get the virgins when
we find your penis.

00:38:45.488 --> 00:38:49.392
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:49.392 --> 00:38:51.420
ROBERT MANKOFF: So
we didn't print that.

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:57.370
So there are lots of
cartoons that we don't print,

00:38:57.370 --> 00:38:59.780
and that's partly because
"The New Yorker," basically,

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:01.847
its avenue is benign humor.

00:39:01.847 --> 00:39:04.180
I think there are definitely
a place for these cartoons.

00:39:07.291 --> 00:39:09.790
I don't run "The New Yorker,"
and David Remnick doesn't even

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:12.740
run "The New Yorker," and part
of what "The New Yorker" is

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:13.390
is taste.

00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:17.500
But in terms of cartoons,
and this question I always

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:22.110
get asked is, where do you
draw the line between doing

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:23.390
this and offending?

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:26.010
And my real answer to that,
my real feeling about that

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:32.190
is, offending is an
overrated offense.

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:35.840
It's just, OK,
someone was offended.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:36.880
What happened?

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:37.660
Did anybody die?

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.920
OK, a person was offended.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.460
Then what happened
right after that?

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:47.151
Did they have lunch?

00:39:47.151 --> 00:39:49.345
Did they go about the
rest of their day?

00:39:49.345 --> 00:39:51.940
Could they go to sleep at night?

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.150
In other words, the
only thing that happened

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:55.490
is they were offended.

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:58.670
So I don't think it's a big
deal, but in a perfect world,

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:00.960
we could offend more people.

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.976
You have a question.

00:40:02.976 --> 00:40:05.290
AUDIENCE: I was going to
ask in general terms of how

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:07.526
much the cartoons have
changed since 1925,

00:40:07.526 --> 00:40:09.580
but I think I'll
be more specific.

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:12.830
Do you think that one
would have worked in 1925?

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:15.436
ROBERT MANKOFF: That's actually
sort of a more meta-- first

00:40:15.436 --> 00:40:18.260
of all, in 1925 the cartoons in
"The New Yorker" were terrible.

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:20.093
They were just like the
cartoons everywhere,

00:40:20.093 --> 00:40:22.500
they were these long,
drawn out pieces.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.614
They didn't have the
American vernacular,

00:40:25.614 --> 00:40:27.530
I could give you a whole
history of cartooning

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:29.970
going back to Punch in 1843.

00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:32.310
So they were very tedious.

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:35.676
Even the cartoons in "The
New Yorker" in '28 and '29,

00:40:35.676 --> 00:40:37.050
sort of ground-breaking
cartoons,

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:39.260
would seem very mild today.

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:43.660
In 19-- I think it's '28--
by Carl Rose, captioned

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:48.850
by E.B. White was, it's
mother at a dinner table,

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:53.530
and she's saying to a
little Lord Fauntelroy son,

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:55.180
eat your broccoli.

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:59.142
And he says, I say it's
spinach and to hell with it.

00:40:59.142 --> 00:41:01.770
That was actually very
sort of a breakthrough,

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:05.570
just because of the vulgarity
of the language for that time.

00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:09.540
Basically, it would be like
he was saying, well, fuck it.

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:15.170
But it still has a two
he said, she said thing.

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:17.800
The way cartoons actually
changed over time

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:21.080
is, by the '30s and '40s, I
could show that you basically

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:23.210
have this incongruity thing.

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:25.630
A strange picture
and the punch line.

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:28.290
In the '40s and '50s,
most of the humor

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:32.076
is within the cartoon frame
when it's observational humor.

00:41:32.076 --> 00:41:33.950
In other words, the
person within the cartoon

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:35.380
is not making a joke.

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:38.470
So you might have a woman
looking at, in 1947,

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:42.260
at a watch at a
baseball game saying,

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:43.860
annoyed, why didn't
they tell us there

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:46.040
was going to be an extra inning.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.080
OK, she's not making a joke.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.300
An Alex Gregory
joke from the '90s

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:52.820
in which one woman
is saying to another,

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:56.310
I started my vegetarianism
for health concerns, then

00:41:56.310 --> 00:42:00.300
moral reasons, and now,
just to annoy people.

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:02.860
That's a modern
cartoon, and the reason

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:07.070
is that the people who came of
age, their comedy background

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:09.720
is sitcom where people
make their own jokes.

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:12.020
So it keeps changing, it
keeps evolving over time.

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:14.270
One of the things that I've
written about in this book

00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:16.720
is how a whole new generation
of people are doing it,

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.415
and they're bringing
their own take to it.

00:42:19.415 --> 00:42:22.500
UDI MANBER: So let
me ask you another,

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.710
to give you an opportunity.

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:26.120
So you don't think the
computers can generate jokes,

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:26.840
people have tried
it for a while--

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:28.292
ROBERT MANKOFF:
It can generate--

00:42:28.292 --> 00:42:29.250
UDI MANBER: Good jokes.

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:30.990
ROBERT MANKOFF: It can
generate very bad jokes.

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:33.400
It's like a lot of people who
look at a cartoon in "The New

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.730
Yorker" and it's a bad cartoon.

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:38.460
Maybe it is bad, it's a lousy
cartoon, terrible cartoon.

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:40.230
I'm admitting that,
world's most horrible,

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:42.234
I can't believe we
published that cartoon.

00:42:42.234 --> 00:42:44.650
It's like someone who goes to
go a baseball game at Yankee

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:47.240
Stadium and watches the
player strike out and says,

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:48.045
I can do that.

00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:51.960
Let me play.

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:54.740
So here you have the very
worst types of jokes.

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:56.980
I know, computers can't do it.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:58.830
UDI MANBER: So let me
give you a premise.

00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:00.990
The reason I'm saying that,
actually, I found out,

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:02.740
there's a field in
computer science

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:05.402
called computational humor.

00:43:05.402 --> 00:43:06.735
ROBERT MANKOFF: I showed you it.

00:43:06.735 --> 00:43:07.484
UDI MANBER: Right.

00:43:07.484 --> 00:43:09.536
And it's not a very funny name.

00:43:09.536 --> 00:43:11.910
If they want to succeed, they
have to find a better name.

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:16.500
But the point is it reminds
me of chess at the beginning.

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.130
And somebody who
was very famous,

00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:20.400
David Levy was his
name, and he bet

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:23.730
that no computer will
beat him in 10 years.

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:25.880
And he actually got the
10 years exactly right,

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:28.510
because the computer beat
him in ten and a half years.

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:30.350
But in 10 years did
not, so he won the bet.

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:30.825
They did it in 1968.

00:43:30.825 --> 00:43:32.220
ROBERT MANKOFF: Well, it's
simply because there are rules

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:34.095
and there are algorithms,
you can play chess.

00:43:34.095 --> 00:43:35.094
UDI MANBER: Let me just.

00:43:35.094 --> 00:43:37.230
The question is, are you
willing to make this bet?

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:38.480
ROBERT MANKOFF: Oh, of course.

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:39.290
Well, of course.

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:41.330
Even although
these programs that

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:43.040
are generating those
bad jokes, they

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:46.090
don't even know they're bad.

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:48.400
Those are the best that
people have to pick out.

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.640
So there's no way
for it to evaluate.

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.860
What I'm trying
to say-- Udi and I

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:56.610
talked a little about
[INAUDIBLE] is that,

00:43:56.610 --> 00:43:58.318
it really comes back
to the hard problem.

00:43:58.318 --> 00:44:01.350
And the problem is consciousness
and feeling itself.

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:03.650
Which is the hard problem,
that's the hard problem.

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:06.910
That's how we react to humor,
that's how we generate humor.

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:09.990
We generate humor
because we have bodies.

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:11.931
And so there's a
small element of it

00:44:11.931 --> 00:44:13.680
which is this cognitive
development, which

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:16.590
is very, very difficult
in and of itself.

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:18.360
So all the rules I
gave you, they're

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:20.150
just sort of narrative rules.

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:24.740
When I say benign violation,
the right amount of wrong, well,

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:25.600
the right amount.

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.910
Now, there's no question
that you can pair computers

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:31.690
with crowd sourcing
of people to say,

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:34.150
is this the right amount of
wrong, and things like that.

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:35.970
Just computers in
and of themselves,

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:39.620
because all they have
by themselves is syntax,

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:41.720
there's no grounding in reality.

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:42.440
Yeah, I don't--

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:45.180
UDI MANBER: Point is,
we can set up a contest

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:47.020
and we can make it
real, for example.

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:49.969
We can pick up a topic,
and you have half an hour,

00:44:49.969 --> 00:44:52.260
and you generate five jokes,
and the computer generates

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.770
five jokes, and you give
it to random people,

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:56.790
and see which one
they think is funnier.

00:44:56.790 --> 00:45:00.150
So the point is if you
put a name to this bet,

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:02.330
he got very famous
because he made this bet.

00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:03.538
You should make your own bet.

00:45:03.538 --> 00:45:05.250
ROBERT MANKOFF:
I'll make the bet.

00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:09.080
The question is, I don't think
the computer can generate--

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:11.860
it can't simply draw on jokes.

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:15.020
I mean, it can't simply peg
the huge database of jokes.

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:19.810
You actually have to
have a program that

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:23.980
has no human knowledge, no
pointers to say, this is funny,

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:25.520
this is funny, this is funny.

00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:33.320
I pointed out that they have as
much chance of generating jokes

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:36.550
as they do of having sex.

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:39.070
OK, can computers have sex?

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:40.520
Can they enjoy it?

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:41.970
Why would they do it?

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:43.330
Why not, why can't?

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:45.640
Because there's nothing there.

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.630
There's no experience.

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:52.180
The idea that experience itself,
the actual core of our lives,

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:56.290
is somehow irrelevant for one
of the most important things

00:45:56.290 --> 00:46:01.360
in our lives, which is
humor, to me is-- anyway,

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:04.659
I'm willing to be proven wrong.

00:46:04.659 --> 00:46:06.200
And it would be
interesting, too too.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:09.030
But you have to look at those
things that are computational,

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:11.770
driving, or algorithmic
things, or certainly chess,

00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:14.450
and those things that are
actually not computational.

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:16.620
I don't think what I'm
doing now is computational.

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:18.570
I don't think I'm
computing anything.

00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:23.310
I don't think I'm drawing from
a vast database of sentences

00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:25.422
that I'm stringing
together accidentally.

00:46:25.422 --> 00:46:27.380
I think most of the things
I'm saying right now

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:30.300
I have never said
before in this way.

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:33.410
And it's not because there's
a random generator generating

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:35.900
sentences, I'm actually
making sense to you.

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:38.000
Although as I
pointed out to Udi,

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.150
one of the great advantages
of being funny and reasonably

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:44.840
intelligent-- you see, I'm
reasonably intelligent,

00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:46.650
but I'm really not that smart.

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:49.470
But I'm very funny,
so it seems that I'm

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:52.670
more intelligent than I am.

00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:54.180
And because I'm
pretty intelligent,

00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:57.380
it also seems that
I'm funnier than I am.

00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:58.090
That's a joke.

00:46:58.090 --> 00:47:00.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:02.500
UDI MANBER: OK, next question.

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:03.970
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:07.890
So at Google, it's become pretty
popular to share information

00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:09.760
and humor using memes.

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.770
I was wondering if you
enjoy writing memes

00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:12.970
or if there's any
memes you've written

00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:13.575
that you think are funny.

00:47:13.575 --> 00:47:15.480
ROBERT MANKOFF: What
I enjoy, pretty much,

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:19.360
is I do stuff on Twitter.

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.340
I like Twitter for
the one liners,

00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:26.335
so I think I'll put up,
maybe today, because I'm 70--

00:47:26.335 --> 00:47:28.640
as I was saying to
Udi, I like aphorisms--

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:32.130
I said about being 70.

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:36.430
The good news is could be worse,
the bad news is, it will be.

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:41.840
Just think about that.

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:43.881
I don't want to tout that
as the world's greatest

00:47:43.881 --> 00:47:45.120
aphorism or anything.

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:49.850
It demands a very deep type
of understanding of existence

00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:52.290
that is very elliptical.

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:54.960
So much is left out
that you then put

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:58.780
in there to understand, as a
human being, what it means.

00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:00.454
Basically, you have
to understand, oh,

00:48:00.454 --> 00:48:02.120
he looks like he's
in pretty good shape.

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:04.160
He's 70, you say, hey, 70.

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.170
OK.

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:05.980
20 years.

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:07.604
He's not going to
stay in good shape,

00:48:07.604 --> 00:48:09.270
the train's only going
in one direction.

00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:14.560
It could be worse,
and it will be.

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.760
So all of that.

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:19.130
And the thing is, you
immediately process that.

00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:21.620
In fact, to the degree,
the people who laughed

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:24.490
processed it probably a little
faster than less than a half

00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:28.010
a second, and the other people
maybe didn't, or whatever.

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:30.497
So the fact is, for it to
work as a joke-- there's

00:48:30.497 --> 00:48:32.080
some experiments
that show that-- it's

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:34.630
got to take about less than
half a second to put together

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:35.570
all the things.

00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:39.050
And you're putting together
a huge amount in that time.

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:40.490
How are you doing it?

00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:44.360
I don't think it's by searching
very quickly, Google-like,

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:47.040
parallel processing
through vast things.

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:51.450
I think that the fact that we
just exist, feel, have quality,

00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:56.550
have sensation, that it's
immediately happening.

00:48:56.550 --> 00:49:05.430
It's like if I had a
stick that was 186,000---

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:06.852
how fast is the speed of light?

00:49:06.852 --> 00:49:08.143
UDI MANBER: That's about right.

00:49:08.143 --> 00:49:11.026
ROBERT MANKOFF: It's
186,286 miles long, OK?

00:49:11.026 --> 00:49:13.780
And you can't go faster than
the speed of light, right.

00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:17.397
But my stick is 186,286, about.

00:49:17.397 --> 00:49:18.730
And you're on the end of it, uh.

00:49:18.730 --> 00:49:19.470
That's it.

00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:25.160
One faster than light.

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:28.140
I pushed the stick, right?

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:29.760
I transmitted the information.

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:32.940
I know there's a flaw
in it, but I don't care.

00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:34.650
See, one of the great
things about funny

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:37.300
is that when you're
funny, you distract people

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:39.546
from the actual logic
of thinking about it.

00:49:39.546 --> 00:49:41.420
So people say, maybe
he's right, maybe Google

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:44.770
should invent this long stick.

00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:46.700
Maybe this is a
whole new-- let's

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:49.410
give up that whole
self-driving car.

00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:51.690
The stick, the big stick.

00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:53.990
That's going to be the thing.

00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:56.165
So I think something
like that happens,

00:49:56.165 --> 00:49:58.790
and of course I don't know what
happens, and no one-- something

00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:01.100
with that happens in
the mind where somehow

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:03.870
the physical essences
and substances are being

00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:06.640
transmitted almost immediately
for you to do that.

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:08.870
The idea that billions
of computations

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:11.320
are happening through
huge databases and things

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:12.800
just doesn't make sense to me.

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:14.520
I think it's a
limitation of our minds

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:16.600
that the only way we
can think about it

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:18.115
is through computation.

00:50:18.115 --> 00:50:20.400
That's the only way we can
think it could possibly

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:23.121
be done, because
that's what you do.

00:50:23.121 --> 00:50:24.870
UDI MANBER: Since you
mentioned your age--

00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:26.707
ROBERT MANKOFF:
So the bet is on.

00:50:26.707 --> 00:50:27.790
UDI MANBER: The bet is on.

00:50:27.790 --> 00:50:28.840
Well, you have to give a name,
and you have to have rules--

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.480
ROBERT MANKOFF: My
computer overlords.

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:32.396
UDI MANBER: And you have
to promise some money

00:50:32.396 --> 00:50:35.380
to whoever-- OK.

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:38.320
People have looked
at humor in medicine

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:41.860
and showed that, in fact, you
can get better if you laugh

00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:43.557
and if you involve humor.

00:50:43.557 --> 00:50:45.390
And yet, when you go
to the doctor's office,

00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:47.990
you see news magazines,
which depressing,

00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:49.750
rather than cartoon books.

00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:51.720
Why don't you guys
go and try to put

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:53.480
cartoon books all
over hospitals?

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:54.896
ROBERT MANKOFF:
Well first of all,

00:50:54.896 --> 00:50:57.400
let me say about
humor and health.

00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:58.525
Don't give up on the chemo.

00:51:03.450 --> 00:51:05.481
Humor is great as long
as you don't really

00:51:05.481 --> 00:51:06.730
have something wrong with you.

00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:11.640
For all aches and
pains and other things,

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:15.940
if you really have something
bad wrong with you.

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:18.110
I am not a humor evangelist.

00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:22.140
I am fascinated with the
cognitive, emotional,

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:23.670
the functional sides of humor.

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:26.600
But I don't think humor
is this great health cure.

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:30.460
It's OK, it can act
as a mild analgesic.

00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:32.755
You do these things, you
stick the person's hand

00:51:32.755 --> 00:51:34.680
in cold water, and
then you show them

00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:38.200
comedy, and that lasts a little
longer than watching something

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:40.020
depressing, all of that.

00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:42.240
I think in terms of
medicine, though, I

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:46.392
do think it is emotional
regulation mechanism.

00:51:46.392 --> 00:51:48.600
So there's a number of
different ways it can be used.

00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:50.058
There are different
types of humor.

00:51:50.058 --> 00:51:52.230
There's affiliative humor,
which is, basically,

00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:54.700
the humor that, in difficult
situations, we use to cope.

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:58.930
We just kid around
and do things.

00:51:58.930 --> 00:52:03.940
I try to use that a lot
in my-- as you get older,

00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:05.780
you get things wrong with you.

00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:09.700
I'll be at the doctor and
I'll just say to myself hey,

00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:12.280
why not be happy for all
the diseases you don't have.

00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:15.790
So you make a little
joke for yourself.

00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:17.780
And then there's
self-deprecating humor.

00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:23.780
And then there's humor
that works in a social way,

00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:26.470
that just bonds, you
don't feel the doctor is

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:28.510
this impersonal automaton.

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:32.720
But the problem is
you, humor is a skill.

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:35.600
And if you're very
unskilled at it,

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:38.720
it's not a good thing to
use, and most doctors are.

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:43.884
Why don't we sign
some books, right?

00:52:43.884 --> 00:52:45.800
Then these people can
buy the book, oh no, no.

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:47.240
OK, go ahead, some
more questions.

00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:49.156
UDI MANBER: Why don't
we have a last question.

00:52:51.570 --> 00:52:55.080
AUDIENCE: There's some debate
whether we can do a question

00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:57.900
or not, I guess we can.

00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:03.750
The captions that readers
submit, many of them

00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:07.020
are brilliant, but
some of them are not.

00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:10.786
ROBERT MANKOFF: Is this
the caption contest?

00:53:10.786 --> 00:53:11.910
AUDIENCE: I was wondering--

00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:14.810
ROBERT MANKOFF: If it's a
criticism, I can take it.

00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:17.330
AUDIENCE: No, what
sometimes I think

00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:20.616
is that I'd like to see
the original caption.

00:53:20.616 --> 00:53:22.490
ROBERT MANKOFF: Oh, see
the original caption?

00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:23.420
Yeah, yeah.

00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:24.820
I'm going to do that
at a point because I've

00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:26.070
got all the original captions.

00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:30.030
Almost always, whatever
was in the caption contest

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:33.690
as the original caption is
also one of the entries.

00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:35.770
But one of things to
remember is the cartoonists

00:53:35.770 --> 00:53:38.800
do 10,15,20 ideas every week.

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:40.614
Many of them aren't very good.

00:53:40.614 --> 00:53:42.780
The difference between a
professional and an amateur

00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:45.222
is a professional thinks most
of their own work is crap

00:53:45.222 --> 00:53:46.930
and an amateur is
really in love with it.

00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:54.220
So they have a failed idea, and
they just go do another idea.

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:55.640
And people are like that.

00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:57.800
They become very precious
about their ideas.

00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:00.132
Like I get all the time, I
have an idea for a cartoon,

00:54:00.132 --> 00:54:01.840
but the person doesn't
want to tell me it

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:05.010
because they're afraid
I'm going to steal it.

00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:08.460
So I say, OK, I'm not.

00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:10.740
Let me finish with
one story about ideas.

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:13.385
And I think this is for
Google and for cartoons,

00:54:13.385 --> 00:54:14.480
and in general.

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:18.940
So Conde-- Conde's this big,
fancy, wonderful, interesting,

00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:21.650
annoying place, like
every other corporation.

00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:23.990
And there are a lot
of guys in great suits

00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:25.930
and stuff like this,
this isn't one of them,

00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:29.690
this is like a bad Conde suit.

00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:32.760
So I'm in the elevator with
this guy, and we're going down,

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:33.720
I don't know the guy.

00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:34.940
This starts on 20.

00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:37.100
He said, they stole my idea.

00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:39.180
They stole my fucking idea.

00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:42.096
Bitching all the way, I can't
believe it, they stole it,

00:54:42.096 --> 00:54:43.292
they stole my fucking idea.

00:54:43.292 --> 00:54:45.750
Finally get down to the bottom
floor, I don't know the guy.

00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:48.041
I tap him on the shoulder
and I said, get another idea.

00:54:50.566 --> 00:54:52.190
And that's my suggestion
to all of you.

00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.760
Thank you.

00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:54.627
UDI MANBER: Good.

00:54:54.627 --> 00:54:55.460
Thank you very much.

00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:57.860
ROBERT MANKOFF: Thank you, Udi.

00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:01.810
