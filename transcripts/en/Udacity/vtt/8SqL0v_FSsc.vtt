Now that you've got this data, I want you to construct this plot

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.470
that shows the median friend count for each gender as age increases. Now, the

plot should be identical to this one that we created before. You code

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.020
just will look slightly different, and you want to make use of this data frame.
