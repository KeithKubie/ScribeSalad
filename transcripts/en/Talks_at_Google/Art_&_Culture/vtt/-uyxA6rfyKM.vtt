[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.910
PERLA CAMPOS: Thanks, guys,
for coming, and thank you

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.200
to everyone on Livestream.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.210
I can't see you,
but you look great.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.250
My name is Perla Campos, and
I am the PM for Google Doodles

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.080
here at Google.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.350
And we're here-- hopefully,
everyone is in the room

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.060
and everyone on
Livestream are here

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.420
for one reason, a very good
reason, a really awesome

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.610
reason, and dear to my heart.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.150
We will be launching a Google
Doodle for Selena Quintanilla

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.710
on October 17.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.820
We're super excited.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.430
This has been a
huge labor of love,

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.030
and it has also been a
really great collaboration

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.365
with her family, the
Quintanillas, specifically,

00:00:46.365 --> 00:00:48.990
Suzette Quintanilla, who will be
joining us here in one moment.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.980
Suzette is a sister,
older sister, of Selena.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.554
She was also a bandmate
in Selena y Los

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:57.200
Dinos, a pretty cool drummer,
if I do say so myself.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.700
And we're going to
sit down and have

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.120
an awesome chat about the
life and the legacy of Selena,

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.769
as well as how they felt about
the process of the Doodle.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.174
So Suzette, welcome in.

00:01:07.174 --> 00:01:08.174
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: Hi.

00:01:08.174 --> 00:01:09.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:14.210
PERLA CAMPOS: Thank
you so much for coming.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.550
I'm not texting anyone.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.160
Don't worry.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.225
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: OK.

00:01:16.225 --> 00:01:18.660
PERLA CAMPOS: I'm Just going
to pull up the questions here.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.360
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
Hi, everyone.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.400
PERLA CAMPOS: Yeah, then
there's also a lot of people

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.570
that you can't see, but
if you, I don't even know

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.820
where we wave to, like maybe--

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.540
I don't know.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.362
They're cool, all those
people on TV land.

00:01:26.362 --> 00:01:27.820
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
Hi, everybody.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.195
PERLA CAMPOS:
Yeah, so we're just

00:01:29.195 --> 00:01:32.444
going to talking about
like life in the band,

00:01:32.444 --> 00:01:34.360
and I'm just going to
be asking questions just

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.260
so everybody knows.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.587
We'll do about 30 minutes
of just my questions.

00:01:38.587 --> 00:01:39.670
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: Whoa!

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.545
PERLA CAMPOS: I know.

00:01:40.545 --> 00:01:41.210
I know.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.710
I know.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.480
You're probably like, I don't
know if we can talk that long,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.980
Perla.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.670
I don't know if you're able to.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.610
But after those 30 minutes,
I'll open it up for questions.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.140
I don't know if we're able
to take from the Livestream.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.920
Yes, OK, no that's fine.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.840
But if anybody in the
room has any questions,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.720
feel free so I won't
hog up all the time.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.220
Cool.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.290
So Suzette, we're going
to start off with--

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.980
"Tell us about that early days.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.280
How did you guys first
respond to the idea

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.139
of forming a family band?"

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:09.910
And you also are
really, really young,

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.720
so what did your
friends at school think?

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.310
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
Don't you remember

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.850
that part of the movie that's
like girls don't play drums?

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:15.660
PERLA CAMPOS: Yeah.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.090
Yeah.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.548
I remember every
part of the movie.

00:02:17.548 --> 00:02:18.464
It's yes, yes.

00:02:18.464 --> 00:02:20.380
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: You
know, a lot of people

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.220
I get asked that quite often.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.120
This kind of just
happened by chance.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.520
I mean, my father had worked for
Dow Chemical for over 13 years.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.310
His dream was also--

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.530
at one point, he didn't want
that 9 to 5 job anymore,

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.480
so him and a friend decided to
open up a Mexican restaurant.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.670
And it was around in
the '80s, I don't know,

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.230
some of y'all might not have
been born around in the '80s.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.680
But it was around the '80s.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.570
And long story short, it was
when the oil boom happened

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.160
and all that.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.820
And it was open for not even
six months, so we lost it.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.760
At around that time, Abe--

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.540
my dad was teaching Abe
how to play the bass.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.650
And then Selena, of course,
she was the youngest,

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.420
and you know, the
young ones always

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.670
feel the need for attention.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.310
So she just started
humming something,

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.260
and my father picked up on it,
And he was like, wait a minute.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.409
And so that's kind
of how it started.

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:20.950
It's a little bit of everything
of how it just kind of flowed

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.030
into, how we actually started
performing at different parties

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.570
and things like that.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.260
Once he realized that Selena
had the capability of holding

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.120
a tune at such an early age, she
was, I think, like around six,

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.540
my cousin had been living with
this from my mother's side.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.790
And he ended up-- he was
supposed to play the drums.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.240
And so he ended up
going back upstate

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.040
to stay with his father.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.470
And lord behold, there's
a pair of brand-new drums.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.888
I'm the only kid that's
not doing anything.

00:03:54.888 --> 00:03:57.550
So, yeah, you're
going to play drums.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.692
I was like, wait a minute.

00:03:58.692 --> 00:03:59.650
And I really said that.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.050
Girls don't play drums,
because at the time,

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.550
the only female drummer that was
really well known was Sheila E.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.350
I am sure a lot of y'all
know who Sheila E is.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.785
And you know, she was the only
one, and I remember thinking,

00:04:11.785 --> 00:04:12.910
well, Sheila E plays drums.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.118
I am like, well, who is that?

00:04:14.118 --> 00:04:15.040
You know what I mean?

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.329
So that's how we
started playing,

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.649
and then shortly
after that, after we

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:23.860
started performing
as a family band,

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.870
just like for little
parties and things

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.306
like that whenever my dad I
would have friends, over some

00:04:29.306 --> 00:04:31.180
of our friends over,
he'd ask for us to play,

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.805
and we'd play like
three or four songs.

00:04:32.805 --> 00:04:34.390
It seemed forever for us.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.280
And then the restaurant
ended up closing,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.880
and we actually used to
perform at the restaurant.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.055
Yeah, like on Fridays
and Saturdays.

00:04:45.055 --> 00:04:47.012
PERLA CAMPOS: What
was that like?

00:04:47.012 --> 00:04:49.220
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: It was
cool, but it wasn't cool.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.190
You are playing, and
then you can see people

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.950
that you go to school with.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.700
You're embarrassed--
that type of thing.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.460
But it really was a blessing
in disguise, because when

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.410
my father--

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.080
when we lost the restaurant,
we literally lost everything,

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.710
like everything, the house.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.420
My parents really
invested everything

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.890
into that restaurant.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:18.880
So the only thing that
we really knew was music.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.190
And so we started playing
little gigs here and there.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.435
We'd make $300, $400, $500.

00:05:22.435 --> 00:05:24.550
And woo hoo!

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.930
And next thing you know--

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.930
PERLA CAMPOS: Yeah, well
we'll get to that part.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.370
We're definitely-- I'm
about to ask your for that.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.940
Don't worry.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.500
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: That's
really how it started.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.550
PERLA CAMPOS: That's incredible.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.383
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
And it was just kind of

00:05:35.383 --> 00:05:37.910
like also a labor of love
from all of us, you know,

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.130
we were struggling as a family.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.340
And so what do families do?

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.397
We come together
and do we got to do.

00:05:43.397 --> 00:05:44.230
PERLA CAMPOS: Right.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.820
That's so true.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.690
So actually-- so you're talking
about how it is incredible

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.730
a thing to come
together as a family,

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.270
and to produce
this amazing thing,

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.561
and just so happens that all
of you are super talented,

00:05:55.561 --> 00:05:57.550
so that's definitely a plus.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.300
But what were like the pros
and cons of being in it,

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.259
because this idea of
being in a band, and maybe

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:04.424
you can get your friends
together, that's one thing,

00:06:04.424 --> 00:06:07.180
but like being in a band with
your family I think is another.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.790
So what do you say were
like the pros of that

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.045
or also the cons of that?

00:06:11.045 --> 00:06:12.410
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: We're
also a Latino family.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:12.870
PERLA CAMPOS: That's true.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:13.140
That's true.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.700
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
[INAUDIBLE]..

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.050
PERLA CAMPOS: I wasn't going to
say it, but you said it for me.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.040
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
We're a little feisty.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.540
So, yeah, they were butting
heads and everything.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:25.420
But I think one thing that
really helped keep us united

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.450
is that my father and my mother
always treated each of us

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:29.560
equally.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.200
There was none of this like,
oh, Selena is in the front,

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.330
she gets this, or
I play drums, I

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.010
do keep a beat the whole song.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.870
And my brother produces.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.600
You know, nobody
had an ego trip,

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.270
and I think that's one
of the things that really

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.400
kept the unity of our family.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.400
And we also knew-- each one
of us knew our role model.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.490
And I kind of always like
to explain it like a--

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:52.698
kind of like a football team.

00:06:52.698 --> 00:06:54.940
The quarterback knows
what he's got to do,

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.490
the receiver, the coach.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.870
My dad was a coach.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.880
My dad was our manager.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.630
We let him take care of that
part, and we did our part,

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.270
and I think that's
one of the reasons why

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.515
our band was very successful.

00:07:08.515 --> 00:07:09.640
PERLA CAMPOS: Right, right.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.014
Well, to keep the
metaphor going,

00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:13.396
you were probably the best
team that's ever existed

00:07:13.396 --> 00:07:14.562
in the history of the Earth.

00:07:14.562 --> 00:07:14.950
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: Thanks.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:15.910
Very fortunate.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.710
PERLA CAMPOS: IMO, IMO.

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:21.250
OK, next is you talk about
the early beginnings,

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.461
but what is the one moment,
if you remember a moment,

00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:27.460
or when did you actually
know that you guys made

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.090
it, like this feeling
of, oh, my gosh

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.587
this is actually,
like we did it?

00:07:31.587 --> 00:07:33.670
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: To
be honest with you, Perla,

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.100
like I don't even think--

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.581
the day that even when my
sister passed, you know,

00:07:39.581 --> 00:07:41.080
you don't really
realize what you're

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.040
doing when you're doing it.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.400
You know, yeah, clearly
you see here your concerts

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.140
are being sold out.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.290
You're like, oh, you know,
even to that point where

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.140
we were at in your career
right before Selena passed,

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.650
it was kind of like, oh, my
god, I hope we have people.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.620
And I hope people show up,
because you know, as an artist,

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.510
you never really know.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:02.350
You do your thing.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.459
You serve it up, basically,
and if people like it.

00:08:05.459 --> 00:08:06.000
They like it.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.250
And if they don't, they don't.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:12.856
So I think that one
scene in the movie where

00:08:12.856 --> 00:08:14.230
everybody freaks
out, because you

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.027
hear your music on the radio.

00:08:16.027 --> 00:08:17.860
You know, we thought,
oh, my god, we hit it.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.237
Yeah.

00:08:19.237 --> 00:08:21.320
Our music is playing on
the radio, but guess what?

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.480
It's not like that.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.646
Just because your music is
being played on the radio

00:08:24.646 --> 00:08:26.730
doesn't mean that the
ching ching is coming in.

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.540
It's the fact that it
takes-- it's a process.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.740
And this process took
about four, five, six years

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.169
before we actually
started getting known.

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:37.299
So it's not a quick process.

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:39.909
A lot of artists think
that it is, and it's not.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:43.090
We definitely did our time
playing in small little venues

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:43.780
for like--

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:48.270
I remember, Perla, we
used to play for like--

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:51.080
we'd go for the door, you
know, percentage of the door,

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.050
or whatever.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:56.217
And maybe like 25
would show up, and we'd

00:08:56.217 --> 00:08:58.550
be like, OK, so we're not--
we're just going to pack it,

00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:59.000
right?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:08:59.700
We're going to leave, right?

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:00.950
And then my dad was like, nope.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:01.449
What?

00:09:01.449 --> 00:09:02.790
What do you mean no?

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.200
He was like, well, you have to
take this like it's practice,

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.270
but just go play.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.520
These 25 people,
they're going to go--

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.060
they are going to
have a great time.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.600
They're going to turn around
and bring more people next time

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.690
we come.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.607
And that was literally
really the god-honest truth

00:09:18.607 --> 00:09:20.690
how it happened, because
every time we'd come back

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.790
to a town, more
people would come,

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:24.540
and then more people
and more people.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.490
And in regards to seeing
the actual success,

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:31.280
even now that she's
been gone for 22 years,

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.540
I'm still baffled at the fact
that, hey, I am here at Google,

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.346
you know, and we're fixing
to release something amazing.

00:09:38.346 --> 00:09:39.970
And it's just still
being talked about.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:40.803
PERLA CAMPOS: Right.

00:09:40.803 --> 00:09:42.050
Awesome.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.960
So I think part of
your story, obviously,

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.270
there's so much amazing
positivity to it.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.665
But there's also kind of
like the part about hardships

00:09:50.665 --> 00:09:52.410
that you guys
definitely face a lot.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.493
And I think that's part
of the power of your story

00:09:54.493 --> 00:09:56.120
is like overcoming that.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.390
So we know that given the fact
that you were Mexican-Americans

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.070
in the US, but
then also that you

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.690
were this female lead
Tejano group, which

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.110
Tejano was like a male-dominated
genre at the time.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:06.700
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
It still is.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.570
PERLA CAMPOS: Yeah, and it still
is, and you guys definitely

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:09.600
did face those things.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.800
So what was it like when you
were in the thick of everything

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.980
dealing with that,
both because, you know,

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:19.190
you're a [INAUDIBLE]
individual in this country.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:22.700
But then also in this genre
that's so male dominated, what

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.179
was that like?

00:10:24.179 --> 00:10:26.720
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: Definitely,
it was a very difficult one,

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.310
because Selena was so young.

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:30.950
When we started performing, she
started singing when she was 6

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:35.560
and 1/2 professionally
when she was like 9, 9 1/2.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.435
And so that made
me, we're about 14--

00:10:38.435 --> 00:10:41.480
we're four years apart,
so maybe about 13, 14.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.060
And then my brother is
four years older than I am.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:48.740
And you know, I
guess we didn't--

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.620
when we first started, we
really didn't see it see it,

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.530
because we were so young,
and my father kind of

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.310
shielded us from that.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:59.570
And we grew up in Jackson,
Texas, which was--

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:01.880
you know, I didn't
know what a low rider

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.790
was until my ninth grade year.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:04.800
You know what I mean?

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.950
So it was predominately Anglo
people, some black people,

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:14.130
but very not too much
Hispanics going on.

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:17.300
So I really didn't
understand a lot of that

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.560
until we started growing.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.780
And then I could understand
more about, OK, this promoter

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:28.130
doesn't think that we can
draw, because Selena is a girl,

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:29.690
or we're kids, you know?

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:30.780
We were kids back then.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.770
You got to admit that.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:35.720
But that shouldn't be a
factor, because our music still

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.210
sounds good, whether-- you
know, it doesn't matter

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.780
how old we are or what, you
know, if Selena was a female

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.400
or not.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.280
I think my father dealt
more with that aspect of it,

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.440
and saw more, and felt it more.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:53.600
But as we grew, I will tell
you that I did feel it more,

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.110
and you know, and
it's surprising to me

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.780
that it's still like that,
and we're at 22 years later.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.120
I still see it, and I still
vibe it, because you know,

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.372
I see what goes on in the world.

00:12:04.372 --> 00:12:06.080
And I see what goes
on with other artists

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.010
and their difficulties
and struggles.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:11.690
And definitely it is, no
matter what people want to say,

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.940
you know, it is just more
of a struggle for a woman,

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.630
for a female, to make it in
a male-dominated business

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:19.292
than it is for a male.

00:12:19.292 --> 00:12:20.750
PERLA CAMPOS: Right,
right, well, I

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.810
will say that you
guys, I think, we

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.554
can all agree are
like an inspiration

00:12:25.554 --> 00:12:27.720
for a lot of those people
who are dealing with that.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.880
No matter where
you are, I mean, it

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.380
applies to the music industry.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:30.800
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
To everything.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.050
PERLA CAMPOS: It applies to
pretty much every industry,

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:33.549
right?

00:12:33.549 --> 00:12:36.410
So I think that's something
that definitely a lot of people

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:36.910
can say.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:37.340
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
But I will tell you

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.200
one thing about all that.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.160
I think my father--

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.100
my father always told us--

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.020
because we would get very
discouraged whenever promoters

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:48.590
didn't want to book us,
or have us at a venue,

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.420
or things like
that, or something

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:53.670
didn't go right with our
record company, or whatever.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:57.020
But my father always
told us, you know, oh,

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.777
so you're just going to quit?

00:12:58.777 --> 00:13:00.860
Just like that you're going
to quit for everything

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.270
you've worked hard for?

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:05.270
And he would tell us all
the time we need to just--

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:09.170
you need to stand up, brush off
your knees where you've fallen,

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.310
and try again.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:14.540
And that's always been our
philocity-- not philocity--

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:15.275
phil- os- o?

00:13:15.275 --> 00:13:16.566
PERLA CAMPOS: Philosophy, yeah.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:20.830
That's incredible words.

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:26.360
Well, going along those
lines of male-dominated kind

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.970
of like worlds that
females definitely

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:30.590
can hold their own in.

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:32.910
Drumming, you mentioned
this earlier in the talk.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:35.120
So drumming professionally
is definitely-- still

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.730
was, and still is
very male dominated.

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:38.840
What was it like?

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.550
You mentioned kind of
your first reaction

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:42.250
to it when you were
introduced to it?

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.810
But what was like throughout
your experience in the band,

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:48.890
like, what was your experience
in that role, especially also,

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:51.200
like I said, given Tejano
music, I mean, just the fact

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.990
that you were a girl drummer,
and Tejano music was also

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:55.789
like a double whammy in a way.

00:13:55.789 --> 00:13:57.580
Did you ever consider
changing instruments?

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:58.650
Why or why not?

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:00.544
So first, the
experience, and then

00:14:00.544 --> 00:14:02.710
if you've ever thought like
maybe actually changing.

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.260
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: Well,
first of all, no, I cannot sing.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.370
I get that asked so much.

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:07.953
Everybody is like,
why don't you sing?

00:14:07.953 --> 00:14:11.040
I'm like, well, there is a
reason why I don't sing, guys.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.140
No, I mean, I grew
to love performing.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.340
I really did.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.180
It grew on me.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.860
Initially, I didn't like it.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.360
You know, you're
talking about being

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.320
put into a position where you're
like, wait a minute, you know?

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.020
I loved it.

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:27.160
And I love the fact that I
was traveling with my family.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.540
There's pros and cons to that.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.160
Yes, we did argue.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.290
Yes, there is
that-- ah, you know,

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:34.930
and certain things that
we maybe disagreed with.

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:36.740
But at the end, we
always came together,

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.790
and no matter if you
disagreed or agreed,

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:43.690
we always stuck to whatever, you
know, whatever the final say,

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.690
the united say was,
on whatever we did.

00:14:49.206 --> 00:14:52.390
I really didn't find myself
feeling any different,

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:54.790
to be honest with
you, performing as a--

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:58.942
I'm the only-- really was the
only female drummer back then

00:14:58.942 --> 00:15:02.080
in our genre of music,
and for those of you that

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.910
don't understand what
the Tejano music is--

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.410
like the magnitude of it.

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:08.750
The magnitude is about this big.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.720
The magnitude of Tejano
music and Latin music

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.070
is about that big.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:19.510
It is basically a
form of music that

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:22.900
is performed in Texas
and only in Texas,

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.090
basically, unless
you lived in Texas,

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:27.700
and you moved to Chicago,
now, it's in Chicago.

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:31.790
But it's basically that big on
a spectrum of this big in Latin

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:32.290
music.

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:35.090
So you know, I take
pride in saying this

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:38.680
that we, from having a
genre of music this big,

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.430
we took that music, and
we crossed boundaries.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:47.080
And it's very difficult. And
don't ask me how we did it.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.590
I don't know how we did
it, but our music, it

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:52.540
didn't matter whether
you're from Puerto Rico,

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.380
or from Cuba, or from Mexico.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.430
It don't matter what
nationality you were,

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:59.680
our music appealed to everyone.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:00.880
How?

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.720
I don't know.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.370
I don't know.

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:07.370
I think it was a combination
of clearly our music.

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:11.860
We're American Mexican, like
third, fourth generation here.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.167
I grew up on English music.

00:16:13.167 --> 00:16:15.250
I didn't listen to Spanish
music until we actually

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:17.920
started performing.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.890
It was a music that my
father introduced to us,

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:22.960
and we're like, oh, oh, no, no.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:23.650
That's not call.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.318
That is not cool music.

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:26.539
No, I'm being for real.

00:16:26.539 --> 00:16:28.080
We were like, we
were all against it.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.800
And he's like, no,
this is your roots.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.966
You have to understand where
this is coming from you

00:16:31.966 --> 00:16:33.070
know, blah, blah, blah.

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:36.520
And we grew to
love it, you know?

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:40.157
But, you know,
it's just really, I

00:16:40.157 --> 00:16:41.740
think it was a
combination of the fact

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.300
that the fact that we were
raised here in the United

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.320
States and we listened
to Men At Work,

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.770
and I was all about Janet
Jackson, you know, Madonna.

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:52.960
And you grab this--
what we listen to,

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.050
and then my brother,
you know, fused

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:59.590
what my father infused
in us with our culture,

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:02.060
and then that's how
we created our sound.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.690
And then adding the fact
that Selena was very soulful

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.699
in her singing, and you can vibe
that, and you can hear that.

00:17:07.699 --> 00:17:09.490
When she's singing a
cumbia, you can really

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:11.349
hear that soulful vibe.

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:14.230
That comes from the
music that we grew up on.

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:15.814
So it kind of spills over.

00:17:15.814 --> 00:17:17.105
And so it creates this mixture.

00:17:17.105 --> 00:17:18.109
PERLA CAMPOS: Just
a hybrid being.

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:19.510
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
Yeah, hybrid type of music

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.855
that we created.

00:17:19.855 --> 00:17:20.200
PERLA CAMPOS: Right.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.569
Well, it was definitely the
right mix of everything.

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:24.609
So I mean, you
talk about, we talk

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:27.940
about you created
your own thing,

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:32.380
you faced a lot of obstacles,
and you persevered.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.840
Specifically with Selena,
what do you feel like--

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.890
you know, obviously her
sister and very close to her.

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:41.970
When you guys were kind of
out and doing it, was there--

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:44.860
was there something that you
felt like for her just meant

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.900
so much, like one obstacle
that she kind of--

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.540
that she-- that she fought
through and was like,

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:54.244
wow, I'm really proud of
myself for that in my career?

00:17:54.244 --> 00:17:55.910
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
That's an easy one.

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:57.430
That would be the
English crossover

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.800
that she was working
on before she passed.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.440
I mean, that was
something that--

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:07.090
you know, if you're on this
side of music and mainstream

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:08.660
is like a huge--

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.470
who doesn't want
to go mainstream.

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:13.810
And so that was a
thing that from the get

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:15.470
go she wanted to be able to do.

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.530
We wanted to be able
to go mainstream

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:20.200
and to be able to have
a crossover album.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:24.970
And even though
that complete album

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:29.932
wasn't completed because
she was murdered, you know,

00:18:29.932 --> 00:18:31.390
she's still got to
experience that.

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:32.009
And she cried.

00:18:32.009 --> 00:18:34.300
When she found out that she
was actually-- because it's

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.840
really a lengthy process about
picking up the correct song.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:42.470
I remember they sent us to
LA to-- she had recorded

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:44.130
and English song.

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.350
I can't think of the name of it
right now, but she recorded it,

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:51.310
and they felt that her breathing
technique wasn't correct.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.530
Mind you, my sisters
has never had any type

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:55.236
of vocal lessons whatsoever.

00:18:55.236 --> 00:18:57.610
So they felt that her breathing
wasn't right on the song.

00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:59.370
So they sent her to LA.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:01.060
I remember going with her--

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.938
I had a blast, by the way.

00:19:02.938 --> 00:19:04.930
Yeah, so we had a great time.

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:09.010
Anyway, so she went
to go with a coach

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:12.490
that did Michael Jackson,
all these famous singers.

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:14.380
She stayed with
him a whole week.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.300
He coached her.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:17.090
She comes back.

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:18.970
She re-recorded the song.

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:20.590
And then the
executives heard it,

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.980
and they're like, oh, we like
the original version better.

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.500
So they ended up keeping
it the way it was.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.720
It was-- oh, my god,
I'll think about it,

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.280
and I'll just blurt
it in a minute.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.780
But I don't remember
the name of it,

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:36.200
but it's just really
lengthy process.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.410
And I think that that
was her main goal

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.350
was to be able to do the English
crossover in which she actually

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:44.020
was finally able to do it, and
they said, yes, we're doing it,

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.540
finally doing it, because
she had been telling her fans

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:49.690
for like over three years,
it's coming, it's coming.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:53.320
And then it never
did, and she literally

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:57.000
cried to Jose Behar,
who was president

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.470
at the time of EMI Records.

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:01.390
She goes, I promised
my fans this.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:02.350
I want this.

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:04.900
I want it so bad, and
it ended up happening,

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.120
but unfortunately, she didn't
get to finish doing it,

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.010
but she got at least
to do some of it.

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:11.310
PERLA CAMPOS: Yeah,
that's awesome.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:13.720
Talking a little bit more
specifically about Selena,

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.560
before we kind of get into
her legacy, what would you say

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:22.060
was your favorite thing about
Selena or something that you

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.380
really, really feel like--

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.116
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
Come on, everything.

00:20:25.116 --> 00:20:26.140
PERLA CAMPOS: Well, I know.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:26.650
If you could pick one.

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:29.024
I know there are so many, but
like if you had to pick one

00:20:29.024 --> 00:20:30.880
thing-- or rather like--

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.950
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: I could
tell you the one thing.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:32.780
PERLA CAMPOS: Yeah, go ahead.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.180
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: One
thing my sister, of course,

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.150
all of y'all know she had
this beautiful, hearty laugh.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:40.570
But she was extremely
goofy and very--

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:42.550
she was one to always
laugh at her own jokes.

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:46.120
She would never say a joke like
all the way through correct.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.662
And then she would
laugh at herself.

00:20:47.662 --> 00:20:50.245
And then she'd be the only one
really laughing after everybody

00:20:50.245 --> 00:20:50.820
stopped laughing.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:51.550
PERLA CAMPOS: That's
all that mattered.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.200
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
Yeah, and it

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.830
was kind of like, I guess that
was the part, because she was

00:20:55.830 --> 00:21:00.790
such a fun person to be
around, and so easy going,

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.850
and just laughed really
about everything in life.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:05.920
Even when she was
upset about something,

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.920
she would just kind of
blow it off and like, ah,

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.570
and she would crack
a joke about it.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:12.850
So I definitely say
probably that was a thing

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:13.730
that I missed most.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:14.563
PERLA CAMPOS: Right.

00:21:14.563 --> 00:21:15.400
That's awesome.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.430
So moving on to kind of like a
little bit of Selena's legacy,

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:23.470
obviously, it's very clear for
fans, like even people, even

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:25.415
like people very,
very young today

00:21:25.415 --> 00:21:27.040
that, you know,
obviously weren't alive

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.847
whenever she was--

00:21:28.847 --> 00:21:30.430
she's a beacon of
hope and inspiration

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:32.139
for bicultural people
all over the world.

00:21:32.139 --> 00:21:33.679
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
Well, thank you.

00:21:33.679 --> 00:21:34.930
PERLA CAMPOS: When, I guess--

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:38.020
did you really feel
that when you guys were

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.540
in the thick of everything,
and did it feel--

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.330
did you feel a sense of
pressure and like responsibility

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:44.240
because of that?

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.240
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: Of?

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.070
PERLA CAMPOS: Of like, oh,
like we're actually like,

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:49.290
people look up to us.

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:51.700
We're like a source of
inspiration for people,

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.319
like, we kind of--
we feel like that's

00:21:53.319 --> 00:21:54.610
like a weight on our shoulders?

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:56.050
Or did you just kind
of feel like love,

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:56.990
and it was like kind of--

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:59.073
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: We
just really felt all love.

00:21:59.073 --> 00:22:02.030
There was never this, like, we--

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.030
like for instance, when
we played at the Houston

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:05.290
Astrodome, there was--

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:08.950
like, our main goal was,
god, I hope people show up.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:10.429
You know?

00:22:10.429 --> 00:22:12.220
And then we found out
that it was sold out.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.450
Like it was like, what?

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:14.260
We sold it out?

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:18.220
It was never-- there was never
this thinking about that.

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.755
It was more about like
our short-term goals,

00:22:20.755 --> 00:22:21.820
you know what I mean?

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:24.250
And just kind of like
taking it like that

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:28.090
and never really thinking
about what we were

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:30.800
doing while we were doing it.

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.710
So I know some people
plan their life,

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:36.130
and OK, by the time I'm
this age, I want to do this.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.320
And they have certain
goals that they want.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.750
Our goal was just like,
dude, let's just survive,

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:44.909
and get money, and have a
house, and a car, and eat,

00:22:44.909 --> 00:22:46.450
and we're good, you
know what I mean?

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:47.950
That was our goal.

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:49.896
It wasn't to be
able to be this--

00:22:49.896 --> 00:22:52.970
well, oh, my god, this
phenomenal group or anything

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:54.880
like that, or I hope
we're inspiring people.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.430
It wasn't that mindset for us.

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:58.712
It was more like, all
right, let's go play.

00:22:58.712 --> 00:22:59.560
PERLA CAMPOS: Right.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.720
Many popular artists today--

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.020
obviously, I think
you think of Selena

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:08.070
as an inspiration to them,
and you see them, like,

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.090
sharing photos of her
and like wearing her

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:11.920
on their clothes,
and things like that.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.630
So how does-- what
does that mean to you

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:14.861
and your family to see that?

00:23:14.861 --> 00:23:16.360
What kind of goes
through your head?

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.284
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: Did y'all
see the Drake when he was

00:23:18.284 --> 00:23:19.242
wearing a Selena shirt?

00:23:19.242 --> 00:23:20.205
Oh, so cool.

00:23:20.205 --> 00:23:25.600
Just recently, I saw Diplo
wearing a Selena shirt too.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.590
It warms my heart.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:28.990
I mean, you know, it's
pretty incredible,

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:31.540
and it's very far
in between like what

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:34.570
is happening right now with
her legacy and what's going on.

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:36.700
I mean, we're in a
different phase now.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.440
I mean, I've always seen it.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.887
I get asked like, how
do you feel about this?

00:23:41.887 --> 00:23:43.720
And do you see it-- did
you see this coming?

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.900
I was like, well, yeah,
I mean, I remember

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:48.100
when my sister passed away.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.364
One of my father's
goals was to--

00:23:50.364 --> 00:23:51.280
he made it very clear.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.520
He wanted to make sure that
nobody forgot about Selena.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:58.590
And we worked very
hard behind the scenes,

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:00.150
and we're very
selective of things

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:02.820
that we do associate
Selena's name to.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:07.200
And there's a reason for that.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:11.436
You know, we've been offered
to do so many crazy things.

00:24:11.436 --> 00:24:13.560
And we just say, no, that's
not what we want to do.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.850
And no, there's a reason for it.

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:20.940
I think also just having
her presence, you know,

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:25.080
and people knowing about who she
was and what she represented,

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:29.130
not just as a person,
but for our culture.

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:32.650
She is definitely a role
model for us Latinos.

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:35.640
She inspires the youth.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:38.860
She was very much
about not doing drugs.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:43.730
She was all about
speaking out about--

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.480
I don't know if a lot
of people know this,

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.690
but she was a spokesperson
for battered women.

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:50.160
She was about giving back
to her community that way.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:53.250
She was very loving, and she
wanted just like everybody

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.040
to kind of like
understand where she

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.670
was coming from as a person.

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:01.482
And I think that everybody gets
that that's ever heard her.

00:25:01.482 --> 00:25:02.940
And then not only
that, but I think

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:06.270
that how can you not be
captivated by her 22 years

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:07.000
later?

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.170
You look at her now, she
still looks very current.

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:12.720
Selena was what you would
consider an artist that's

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:16.190
timeless, you know?

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:19.170
You know, her look was very
simple, but sheik, and kind of

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:22.842
like cool, but not over the top.

00:25:22.842 --> 00:25:25.300
PERLA CAMPOS: Yeah, people
still like copy her to this day.

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.383
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: Yeah,
yeah, and even at that,

00:25:27.383 --> 00:25:30.090
like, even if you sit down
and just block all that out

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.460
and just listen to
her vocals, you know,

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:36.570
if you listen to her
voice, it captivates you.

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:39.390
If you just listen to it,
it just captivates you.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:41.490
And you know, then
on top of that,

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:45.610
just add the fact that she
had this amazing body, hello.

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:48.120
And she had this
amazing personality

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.150
to go along with it.

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:52.151
So I hope that in
another 20 years,

00:25:52.151 --> 00:25:53.400
we're still talking about her.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:53.700
PERLA CAMPOS: Right.

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.180
I'm sure that will be the case.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:56.130
I will certainly do my part.

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:57.850
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: She was
definitely one of the greats.

00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:59.580
I will say that,
and I can say that.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:00.496
PERLA CAMPOS: I agree.

00:26:00.496 --> 00:26:01.950
I agree.

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:05.790
So actually, you just started
to mention this a little bit.

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:09.480
"Among many other things, Selena
was and is known for her style

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.004
and being a trendsetter."

00:26:11.004 --> 00:26:11.670
This is my note.

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:13.919
Frankly, her performance
wardrobe, everything she wore

00:26:13.919 --> 00:26:15.630
was fierce and on point.

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:17.907
But what was her style
behind the scenes?

00:26:17.907 --> 00:26:18.615
Was it different?

00:26:18.615 --> 00:26:19.140
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
Very different.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.848
PERLA CAMPOS: From
what people would see?

00:26:20.848 --> 00:26:22.370
And what did that entail?

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:26.250
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
T-shirt, baggy jeans, a belt,

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:28.290
her hair slicked
back in a low bun,

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:31.530
and very, very
little bit of makeup.

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:33.880
She always wore makeup,
just very little,

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.090
and a little bit of lip
gloss, and that was her, very

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:37.980
stripped down and very like--

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:41.350
she used to also like
to grab Chris's shirts,

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:43.380
and she used to just like--

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.417
like the "Amor Prohibido" video.

00:26:45.417 --> 00:26:46.500
Are you familiar with her?

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.610
She's wearing the
red-- it's tied?

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:48.727
That's Chris's shirt.

00:26:48.727 --> 00:26:50.435
She had a big old
suitcase full of stuff,

00:26:50.435 --> 00:26:51.518
and what did she pull out?

00:26:51.518 --> 00:26:52.486
Chris's shirt.

00:26:52.486 --> 00:26:54.750
She just tied it, and let's go.

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.700
There's also another
outfit she is wearing.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.200
She's wearing all white.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.380
And it's one of Chris's
shirts she just like tied it,

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:03.450
tucked it under, and
just made it hers.

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:12.600
When she wasn't performing, she
was opening up her boutiques,

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:16.050
and she was actually
working on her makeup line.

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:17.970
She was wanting to
do a makeup line.

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:19.500
She was also looking
into perfumes.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.290
She had already picked
out the tones of a perfume

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:24.370
that she wanted to do.

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:30.840
So she also was attending
a business university here

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:35.310
in LA via correspondence
for business,

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:37.530
because she wanted
to educate herself

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:42.470
more on the business side for
her business, her businesses.

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:45.810
I have her on tape
actually on a thesis.

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:46.980
Nobody's ever heard it.

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:47.550
PERLA CAMPOS: Really?

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:49.091
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
Yeah, it kind of

00:27:49.091 --> 00:27:51.520
sounds crazy, because she's
talking all like smart.

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.520
PERLA CAMPOS: Well, I
actually didn't know that.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.750
That's incredible.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:57.615
I mean, obviously, she
was, I mean, in the time,

00:27:57.615 --> 00:27:59.740
like an entrepreneur for
sure and had that mindset.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.830
So it was really cool
that was something

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:04.770
that behind the scenes, she
was really pursuing kind

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:06.290
of on a more traditional level.

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:07.080
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
That and the fact

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.460
that she wanted to be a mother.

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:11.550
She was-- her and Chris
wanted to have children.

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:13.480
She wanted to have
an army, but Chris

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.116
was like, whoa, calm down.

00:28:15.116 --> 00:28:17.760
And she loved, of
course, animals,

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.760
and she wanted to have-- yeah,
she didn't want to have a farm.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.832
Crazy girl.

00:28:21.832 --> 00:28:23.540
PERLA CAMPOS: The
sky's the limit, right?

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:24.623
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: Yeah.

00:28:24.623 --> 00:28:28.320
PERLA CAMPOS: So we talk
about how Selena was--

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.820
I mean, and you guys
were just an inspiration

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:32.400
to people and a hero.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.742
A lot of people consider her
like a hero, their heroine.

00:28:35.742 --> 00:28:37.200
But who was hers,
do you feel like?

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.660
Did she ever talk about
someone who she really just

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:40.385
looked up to?

00:28:40.385 --> 00:28:41.760
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
That's easy.

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.450
My father-- my
father and my mother.

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:48.620
I mean, my father played
a huge role in guiding us.

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:50.280
He still guides us.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.260
I mean, he still manages us.

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.760
He manages my brother.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:57.050
He's a force that we've
always looked up to.

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:03.225
My mother has been
always also somebody

00:29:03.225 --> 00:29:04.850
that my sister has
always looked up to.

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:07.790
I would definitely say those
two people were the ones,

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:08.940
and I still--

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.940
if you asked me that
question, my answer

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.177
is the same too, my parents.

00:29:13.177 --> 00:29:14.010
PERLA CAMPOS: Right.

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:16.000
I agree.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.620
My mom is also mine.

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:20.600
So it's funny how
that works, right?

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.300
I think the last one before
we kind of go into the Doodle,

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:26.900
and we can open it up
for questions for people.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.480
You mentioned a lot
about the movie.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.530
You like the anecdotes
from the movie.

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:33.860
So how was it working
on that project?

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:36.080
How accurate was it,
because that's also

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.150
something I've always wondered.

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:40.910
What was it like to see
yourself and your family

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:43.639
being portrayed by actors?

00:29:43.639 --> 00:29:45.680
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: Well,
when we first talked--

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.870
when we first--

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:51.340
kind of crazy how
the movie came about.

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:55.550
When she passed away, our
lawyers in LA found out--

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:58.580
our entertainment lawyers
had found out that, you know,

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:01.250
somebody there is already
companies wanting to make

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:03.396
a movie, because we live--

00:30:03.396 --> 00:30:05.270
this freedom of speech,
anybody can basically

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:09.390
do everything without getting
the consent of the family.

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:10.946
So that's the only reason--

00:30:10.946 --> 00:30:13.070
that was one of the main
reasons why the movie came

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:16.934
out two years after she passed,
because if anything was going

00:30:16.934 --> 00:30:18.350
to be done, we
wanted to make sure

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:23.360
that it was done correctly,
and it was done the right way

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.720
and portrayed Selena in
the right light and not

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:30.380
any other light just
to sell movie tickets.

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:33.410
And so the whole process was--

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:37.390
it's pretty insane, like what--

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:39.350
you know, the whole
process of trying

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:43.440
to pick a Selena, you know,
that they narrowed it down

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.290
out of like, I don't
know how many girls,

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:47.930
like 70-something
girls, to like five,

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:49.940
and Jennifer Lopez
was one of them.

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:53.180
And actually, the girl who
played Constance Marie,

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:56.030
the one who played
my mom, she actually

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:58.490
auditioned for the Selena part.

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:03.170
And so you know, they
narrowed it down.

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:07.360
And this one girl, she wasn't
a professional actress,

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:10.820
and I wasn't on the
set, but they all

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:15.140
did taping, like a live taping
type of thing, like filming,

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:19.240
and this girl looked
like my sister so much.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.250
It was crazy.

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:22.580
They dressed her up,
and I was, like, whoa,

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.080
but she could not act.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.750
And after like the
30-something take,

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:28.510
you could hear all
the-- like my dad said

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:32.475
you could here everybody
working, you know, like, ohhh.

00:31:32.475 --> 00:31:33.690
You know what I mean?

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:36.260
So that right there is
an indication that--

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:39.680
making a movie, it wouldn't
be good to make a movie.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:42.470
So then Jennifer came
in, and they just

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:45.410
thought that they all agreed,
the director, the executives,

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:48.170
and everybody agreed
alongside with our family

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:53.180
that Jennifer was a perfect
part for Selena, you know?

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.490
But the crazy thing
was, what surprised us,

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:56.810
is that a lot of the--

00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:59.600
like, once they announced that
Jennifer was going to do it,

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.012
there was a lot of backlash
from Selena, from the fans,

00:32:02.012 --> 00:32:03.470
because they were
like, oh, my god,

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:06.320
how can a Puerto Rican
portray a Mexican?

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.910
You know, blah, blah.

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:14.555
That freaked me out, because you
know, we're all the same here,

00:32:14.555 --> 00:32:15.430
you know what I mean?

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:16.830
I am like, it doesn't matter.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:18.320
She's Latina.

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:18.960
You know?

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.080
And that's the important
thing and the fact

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:24.470
that she physically
looks like my sister,

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:30.620
I mean, like body-wise,
the fact that she has dance

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:34.520
you know, Jennifer has a
dance background, I mean,

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.980
I thought it was perfect.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:37.847
Like we were-- we
were super happy.

00:32:37.847 --> 00:32:39.930
Once everybody calmed down,
I think everybody was,

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:42.380
but the whole process,
Jennifer worked her butt off.

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:46.520
She stayed with me for
about a month at my house.

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.620
I will share a story with y'all.

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:51.400
She totally freaked me out.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.630
She came in like-- you
know, after a while

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:55.510
when you're hanging out
at somebody's house,

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:56.760
you get comfortable?

00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:00.115
Well, she came downstairs,
and we were in the kitchen,

00:33:00.115 --> 00:33:01.490
and we're going
to eat, and we're

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:02.990
preparing food or
whatever, and then

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:05.240
she comes, and I
have a sectional.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:09.200
And my sister, Jennifer came in,
and she sat right in the middle

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:13.990
where my sister would sit,
and she brought her feet up,

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.980
and she grabbed--

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:18.310
I have a little wrap thing like
when you get cold, you know?

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:21.540
I call it a throw, and
she covered herself,

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:22.860
and I'll never forget this.

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:26.243
I looked at my husband, and
he looked at me, and I'm like,

00:33:26.243 --> 00:33:26.930
what?

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:30.020
My sister did the
same exact thing.

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:30.770
PERLA CAMPOS: Wow!

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:32.270
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
Freaked me out.

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:33.060
It freaked me out.

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.936
And then we're
cooking, and I'm like,

00:33:34.936 --> 00:33:37.509
do you think she's still acting?

00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:39.550
PERLA CAMPOS: She's really
getting into character

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:40.220
right now.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:40.830
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
And then my husband

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:43.151
was like, do you think,
but how would she know?

00:33:43.151 --> 00:33:43.650
You know?

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:44.960
Like stuff like that.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.790
She was so cool to work with.

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:49.300
Constance, Eddie
Olmos, all of them,

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:51.180
it's a lot of work
to do a movie.

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:52.430
I just want to let y'all know.

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:55.647
I think the sets at
the house, you know,

00:33:55.647 --> 00:33:57.480
where I'm cutting Chris's
hair and all that,

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.669
that was all they created.

00:33:59.669 --> 00:34:00.210
They went in.

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:03.370
They took pictures of our house,
and they reconstructed it.

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:06.570
And the scene in the movie
with the bus where, you know,

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:08.760
I'm pissed off, because
of the Doritos situation?

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:09.899
PERLA CAMPOS: Right.

00:34:09.899 --> 00:34:11.940
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: That
was pretty interesting,

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:15.179
because they created a bus,
and it wasn't really a bus.

00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:17.760
It was like in a
big, old studio area,

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.460
and it had big,
old air tire things

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.533
to get it that movement
it was like on a bus.

00:34:22.533 --> 00:34:23.449
PERLA CAMPOS: Oh, wow!

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:25.074
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
It was super cool.

00:34:25.074 --> 00:34:27.260
Little things like,
it was really cool.

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.940
And it was very difficult too.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:34.800
There were some times that I
clearly I went there every day.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.920
It was also very
difficult, especially

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:44.280
the scene where, you know,
the hospital scene at the end,

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.339
I completely--

00:34:45.339 --> 00:34:46.475
I showed up all like, hey!

00:34:46.475 --> 00:34:47.850
And then they told
me what scene.

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:49.139
I was like, OK, bye, guys.

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:51.719
And I left, and I just
heard that it just everybody

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:54.040
was in tears, you know?

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:58.020
And Jennifer, and
Jackie, and the whole--

00:35:00.407 --> 00:35:01.740
PERLA CAMPOS: Crew and everyone.

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:02.580
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: The
whole crew and everybody just

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:04.890
said that it was probably
the most difficult thing

00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:07.570
that they've ever
had to do, you know?

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:08.957
Because it felt so real.

00:35:08.957 --> 00:35:10.290
But I will share on a good note.

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:12.360
We'll end this section
on a good note.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.730
Jennifer, when she
came out of the trailer

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:17.920
with the white dress where they
are recreating the scene where

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.180
Selena won the Grammy,
I ain't going to lie,

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:25.900
that was probably the only
time that I truly freaked out.

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:29.070
Like I got chills all over my
body, because when she stepped

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:32.190
out, she kind of scooted
her little dress down,

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:34.246
and she looked up, and
for a split second,

00:35:34.246 --> 00:35:35.370
I thought it was my sister.

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:38.620
Like, I like-- and she
goes, what do you think?

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:42.194
And I was like, oh,
wow, you look amazing.

00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.860
And then we would
just kind of sit back,

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.970
and I just sat back
with my father and go--

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:47.407
we were just like freaking out.

00:35:47.407 --> 00:35:48.240
PERLA CAMPOS: Right.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.420
Well, it sounds like you
said, it was a lot of work,

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:53.330
but I know if anyone out there--

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:54.880
I have seen it many, many times.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:55.070
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: I
know it's always on, right?

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:56.250
PERLA CAMPOS: It's
a family favorite.

00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:57.200
It's a family favorite.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.620
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
I know, yeah.

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:00.930
PERLA CAMPOS: And I will
definitely see it more times.

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:03.149
And so you can tell that
it was a labor of love.

00:36:03.149 --> 00:36:04.565
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
It definitely

00:36:04.565 --> 00:36:05.130
was the right [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:05.910
PERLA CAMPOS: And I
love that it's there,

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:08.940
because it's something that, not
only for people who loved her,

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:10.590
but it's just like a great way.

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:12.300
I'm so glad you guys
had a hand in it

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.430
so you could tell the story
the way you wanted to tell it.

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:15.900
And it's just a great
way for a lot of people

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:16.990
to learn about her story.

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:18.140
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: And
I think that it helps

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.826
us keep Selena's memory alive.

00:36:19.826 --> 00:36:20.700
That's how a lot of--

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:24.630
I feel like a lot of millennials
can identify or understand

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:27.167
who she was, because
the movie is always on.

00:36:27.167 --> 00:36:28.000
They hear the music.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.545
They start seeing
what's going on.

00:36:29.545 --> 00:36:30.810
PERLA CAMPOS: Right.

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:33.240
Well, that's a perfect
segue into another thing

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.330
that I hope we'll do a
similar thing, the Google

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:39.490
Doodle that we'll be launching
next week on October 17.

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:40.740
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: Yeah.

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.240
PERLA CAMPOS: My
last final question

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.060
before I open it
up for people is

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:47.640
kind of what-- kind of
with your head, whatever,

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.130
because I, full disclosure,
gave Suzette a call.

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:52.029
I was like, hey,
we want to do this.

00:36:52.029 --> 00:36:54.570
What was kind of the first thing
that went through your mind?

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:57.082
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
Are you really Google?

00:36:57.082 --> 00:36:58.180
PERLA CAMPOS: Oh, yes.

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:01.410
Yes, also like, yeah,
you're [INAUDIBLE] Latina.

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:02.936
Like, this is great.

00:37:02.936 --> 00:37:04.590
But yeah, so kind
of what was your--

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:07.830
what was your thought when
we first approached you,

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:11.360
and how has the
process been for you?

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.160
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: I was
pleasantly surprised, you know,

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.700
that I got a call
from you, Perla.

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:19.110
I initially you know that
when you and I started

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:21.030
talking on the
phone, I instantly

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:23.400
found this connection with you.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.520
I could hear the
passion that you had in

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.800
presenting what you
guys wanted to do,

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.020
and it's always-- it's
been that from day one.

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:34.110
You know, there's definitely
passion in this creation

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:36.410
that you guys are fixing to see.

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:38.130
I sat down with [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:42.840
I got to meet you and
Kevin, talked about details

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.940
of certain things and
what your idea was,

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:47.050
and we kind of twerked
it here and there.

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:50.460
And I think that Google
wraps up Selena completely,

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:54.120
even though it's very
short in the sense of-- it

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.080
doesn't tell--

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.940
it's not like a whole
hour long really,

00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:03.030
but it's perfect, because
it sends a huge message

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:06.020
that, you know, you can do
anything you really want.

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:08.100
Selena started when
she was really young,

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:11.490
and she became this
amazing artist,

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:13.950
and she's still being
remembered, and you know,

00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:15.580
I will end it with this.

00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:18.610
Selena's favorite saying is the
impossible is always possible,

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:21.510
and it is, and I think
that this Google--

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:23.730
there is that form of
that totally in that,

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:26.600
because it shows the passion
that you guys put into it

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:31.855
and the whole creativity
of having her young into--

00:38:31.855 --> 00:38:33.980
PERLA CAMPOS: Showing the
story throughout to the--

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:37.230
yeah, and we hope that
everyone, like I said,

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:39.690
both fans and people who
don't know about Selena,

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:42.150
will be able to learn about it.

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:46.560
And along with it, we're also
going to be launching-- sorry,

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.050
launching a digital
exhibit of select items

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:50.430
from the Selena
museum, so that's

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:52.500
another amazing
collaboration we have

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:54.160
with the Quintanilla family.

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:57.500
And we're excited for people to
see a lot of the things there,

00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.439
a lot of great-- a lot
of great, iconic items.

00:38:59.439 --> 00:39:00.980
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
Yes, definitely.

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.480
But I think the
hardest thing for me

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:05.055
is, you know, you already
know, Latinos are really

00:39:05.055 --> 00:39:05.930
hard to keep secrets.

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:06.680
I'm like, come on.

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.208
Come on.

00:39:08.208 --> 00:39:09.636
Hurry up.

00:39:09.636 --> 00:39:11.064
I haven't told
anybody in a month.

00:39:11.064 --> 00:39:13.063
They're like why are you
going to San Francisco.

00:39:13.063 --> 00:39:15.229
I'm like business.

00:39:15.229 --> 00:39:16.270
Well, what are you doing?

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:17.797
I'm like, I'll tell you later.

00:39:17.797 --> 00:39:19.630
PERLA CAMPOS: What are
you doing on the 17th

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:23.775
at 12:01, because
I'll give you a call.

00:39:23.775 --> 00:39:25.050
Cool.

00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:27.360
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you for being here.

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.860
Yeah, I was just wondering if
there were any things that you

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:32.230
do for your sister just
to honor her memory that

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:34.930
are personal to you that
you're open to sharing?

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:37.270
I think when you lose
someone like having

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:41.350
these special things, it
really makes a big difference.

00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:43.990
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
As a family,

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:49.090
from the get go, from the first
anniversary of her passing,

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:52.360
we kind of just
don't get together.

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:55.290
We don't make it an event.

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:58.280
Clearly, it's a day
that she lost her life.

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:02.160
We just kind of like
call each other, hey, hi.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.870
Hey, just checking on
you, seeing if you're OK.

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:07.310
That's basically all we do.

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:10.825
In regards to me, you
know, remembering her

00:40:10.825 --> 00:40:15.540
or anything like that, I don't
do anything special like that.

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:19.830
I just keep her here
and here, and I'm good.

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:22.210
And I just try to
keep her always--

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:23.835
and even when I'm
shopping, it's crazy,

00:40:23.835 --> 00:40:26.043
because I'll be shopping,
and I'll be with my mother,

00:40:26.043 --> 00:40:27.850
and we're like, oh,
my god, that's Selena.

00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:29.620
Like, oh, my gosh, she would
totally buy this-- you know,

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:30.320
stuff like that.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.880
So I keep her alive like
that in little things,

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.470
you know, throughout my day.

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:37.480
This right here is a
total labor of love.

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:40.060
This is one of the
things that brings me

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:44.500
great joy, coming here and
speaking about her to you

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:47.830
guys means a lot to me.

00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:50.589
You know, I do this,
because I love her,

00:40:50.589 --> 00:40:52.630
because I know if the shoe
was on the other foot,

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:54.550
and I wasn't here,
I know for a fact

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:58.310
that she would be here
doing this for me, you know?

00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:01.690
And so it's definitely
a labor of love.

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:03.850
And going back to
your answer, no,

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:06.700
I don't do anything in
particular, none of us

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:07.780
do, not even Chris.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.340
We just kind of check on each
other and make sure we're good.

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:13.540
And it's crazy, because
it has been 22 years,

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:18.180
and last year was really bad.

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:21.760
You just want to stay in bed
and cry your butt off, you know?

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.940
And then the other days, I
mean, some years, you just

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.250
want to like, you're OK.

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:29.860
And you want to talk about it,
and you don't have no problem,

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:31.699
and then you want
to blast the music.

00:41:31.699 --> 00:41:34.240
There are some days that I don't
even want to hear our music,

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.500
because it hurts.

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:40.540
It's just I remember
when she passed away,

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:43.690
this older man, a friend
of my father's, told me,

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:47.320
you know, with time, time
will heal your heart,

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:50.770
and I found out it
doesn't heal your heart.

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:52.430
There is a void
there in your heart

00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:54.400
that will be there forever.

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.470
You can never feel that.

00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:58.840
What time does,
it helps you deal

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.540
with what's been
put in front of you,

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:03.130
and you have a choice to
either move forward or just

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:05.280
stay where you are at,
and you don't do any good

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.405
in staying where you're at.

00:42:06.405 --> 00:42:08.380
I learned that, because
I went-- you know,

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:12.760
I took about 2 and 1/2 years
before I figured out me again.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:16.602
That's how long it took me to
figure out who I was again.

00:42:16.602 --> 00:42:17.935
PERLA CAMPOS: But you do a lot--

00:42:17.935 --> 00:42:19.450
I think the things that you do--

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:21.370
I mean, just having gone
and spent some time with you

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:24.010
guys in Corpus Christi, which
was like a really awesome thing

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:27.070
for me to do, just
seeing the museum

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:30.700
and how you treat the people
who come there that really want

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:33.720
to learn about Selena
and cherish her memory

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.540
is just really awesome.

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:37.760
And just watching you
guys do the day to day,

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:40.600
and all the calls, and
answering questions and all

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:44.270
of those things, I think, all
of those in your day to day,

00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:46.510
I see you guys honoring
her and making sure

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:48.670
that people who love
her and people who want

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:50.000
to learn about her do that.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.469
And I think that
yeah, in that way,

00:42:52.469 --> 00:42:55.010
it's a really awesome thing that
I was able to see in person.

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:56.598
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
Thank you [INAUDIBLE]..

00:42:56.598 --> 00:42:57.430
PERLA CAMPOS: Yeah.

00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:58.347
AUDIENCE: So I had a--

00:42:58.347 --> 00:43:00.013
PERLA CAMPOS: Oh, I
didn't even see you.

00:43:00.013 --> 00:43:00.850
OK, go ahead.

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:02.740
AUDIENCE: From the back.

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:06.010
So working with
Perla this Doodle,

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:08.920
and the team has been amazing,
and getting to meet you today

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.880
is just fantastic.

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.000
But I think what
surprised me is I always

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.850
knew that Selena was
so popular, but seeing

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:19.540
how devoted her fan
base is, basically

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:22.810
throughout this project.

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:25.450
What is the fan interaction
like with you now?

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:27.760
Do you still get a lot
of artwork or things

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:30.830
that people are sharing
with you and your family?

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:31.789
What is that like?

00:43:31.789 --> 00:43:33.205
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
It's awesome.

00:43:33.205 --> 00:43:37.450
We have pretty creative people
send some pretty amazing

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:39.040
paintings on Selena.

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:42.850
I love interacting
with Selena's fans.

00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:47.750
I like to hear
stories about what

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:50.140
Selena means to them,
how she inspires them,

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:52.960
how they look up to her.

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:54.080
I love hearing that.

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:56.900
I mean, it's amazing,
and it's a good feeling.

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.820
It definitely leaves
that good feeling.

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:02.692
And you know, going back to
like when you lose someone,

00:44:02.692 --> 00:44:07.820
people have died, people lose
their loved ones all the time,

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:09.847
and I'm super blessed.

00:44:09.847 --> 00:44:11.180
I try to look at life like that.

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:15.650
I'm super blessed having to be
able to hear my sister's voice.

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:18.350
I'm able to see her on YouTube.

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:21.530
I'm able to hear stories
about how she inspires people,

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:23.030
and that's part of the legacy.

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:29.690
That is part of her legacy, and
I feel that I'm doing my part

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:32.630
to help that, you know, along
with her fans, because clearly,

00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:34.940
we cannot do this
without her fans.

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:36.949
So I feel blessed.

00:44:36.949 --> 00:44:37.740
PERLA CAMPOS: Cool.

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:38.365
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:44:38.365 --> 00:44:39.510
Hey, thanks for coming.

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:40.970
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: Thank you.

00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:42.261
AUDIENCE: I have two questions.

00:44:42.261 --> 00:44:44.230
One is on behalf of my sisters.

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:47.720
They want to know what
was Selena's favorite shoe

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:49.252
designer?

00:44:49.252 --> 00:44:50.528
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: Ummm.

00:44:50.528 --> 00:44:51.236
AUDIENCE: I know.

00:44:51.236 --> 00:44:51.736
I looked--

00:44:51.736 --> 00:44:53.722
PERLA CAMPOS: I like
how specific this is.

00:44:53.722 --> 00:44:55.680
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: I
don't think she had any.

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:59.780
Selena was one to just
really shop anywhere.

00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:05.110
She wasn't always like
about designer stuff.

00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:07.640
She literally just--
if she found something.

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.410
I remember one time
we were shopping,

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:11.580
and this lady goes,
oh, I like your dress.

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:13.250
She goes, thank you,
I got it at Kmart.

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:14.874
I was like, I knew
she got it at Kmart,

00:45:14.874 --> 00:45:17.000
but I said, why did you
tell that lady that?

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.940
She was like, well,
I got it at Kmart.

00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:21.840
So my sister loved shopping.

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:24.360
If it was cool, and she
liked it, she bought it.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:28.245
So she wasn't really into
designer things back then.

00:45:28.245 --> 00:45:32.460
Mind you, she liked the good
stuff, but what girl doesn't.

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:34.290
She didn't have any
favorite favorite.

00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:36.260
She wore a lot of boots
too when she performed.

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:37.970
So she would always
look out for boots.

00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:38.720
AUDIENCE: Perfect.

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:39.595
I'll tell them Kmart.

00:45:39.595 --> 00:45:40.181
So thank you.

00:45:40.181 --> 00:45:42.222
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: Tell
them to keep it simple.

00:45:42.222 --> 00:45:44.450
AUDIENCE: Keep it
simple In the movie

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:47.480
Edward James Olmos, who I
think is a fantastic actor,

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.130
played your father--

00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:52.670
sort of a very
dominant, machismo role.

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:55.160
I think Latinos across the
country could resonate that,

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:56.510
whether it's the
mother or the father.

00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:57.020
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: Yes.

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.976
AUDIENCE: How was that
dynamic in a band group

00:45:58.976 --> 00:46:01.600
though when you know that's your
father, but also your manager?

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.016
And how much
pushback did the kids

00:46:03.016 --> 00:46:05.350
give to make sure things got
done at the end of the day?

00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:06.932
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
At the beginning,

00:46:06.932 --> 00:46:09.110
I mean, clearly, yes,
it was at, first of all,

00:46:09.110 --> 00:46:12.580
pretty much all Latinos
understand what you just

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:15.840
said, because, yes,
there's that male machismo,

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:19.610
and it's just the
way our culture is.

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:22.610
At the beginning, I think
that's what helped us,

00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:24.290
because it was pretty
much, hey, we're

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:25.960
going to do this this way.

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:28.610
And as we started
getting growing,

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:31.550
we started having
more say about what.

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:33.260
And actually, that's
how my brother

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:36.590
started producing our
music, because Abe

00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:39.230
was complaining about--

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:42.170
complaining to my
father that the music

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:43.872
that they were sending us was--

00:46:43.872 --> 00:46:45.830
and they were treating
AB kind of like, ah, you

00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:47.510
know, kid get away, you know?

00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:49.760
Other producers that were
in our genre of music,

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.950
they were like, oh, you know?

00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:53.960
And Abe was getting
really frustrated,

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:58.591
so my dad said, well, you don't
like it, then do it yourself,

00:46:58.591 --> 00:46:59.090
you know?

00:46:59.090 --> 00:47:01.820
And that's how he
became a producer.

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:03.370
From him-- what
I'm trying to say,

00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:06.590
that machisimo part of my father
and that strict part of him

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:09.530
pushing us, and pushing
us, and pushing us,

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:12.445
and one thing I think that was--

00:47:12.445 --> 00:47:14.320
it didn't bother us,
because clearly you were

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:15.520
raised in that environment.

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:17.570
So I was like, OK,
it's dad being dad.

00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:18.410
You know?

00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:21.740
But now in hindsight,
I look back,

00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:24.290
and I think, what a blessing,
because if he wouldn't

00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:27.290
have pushed us and
pushed us and never

00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:30.180
let us stop doing
what we were doing,

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:33.680
then this wouldn't
have been, you know?

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.380
You know, and so
it's a blessing.

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:37.860
And yes, was there arguments?

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:38.360
Yeah.

00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.430
There was arguments.

00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:42.020
But we pretty much were
OK with things the way

00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:44.337
that they were being
handled, you know?

00:47:44.337 --> 00:47:45.920
There were a little
bit of complaints,

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:50.630
but nothing on a kaboom type
of thing, like a situation.

00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:52.430
We pretty much
were in agreement.

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:53.900
We're always like,
OK, if you feel

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:55.370
that that's what we need to do.

00:47:55.370 --> 00:48:00.680
Perfect example, when we
got signed to Capitol EMI,

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:03.651
which is our first major
album, which is what--

00:48:03.651 --> 00:48:05.150
PERLA CAMPOS: The
date of the Doodle

00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:06.800
is actually the day of this.

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:07.250
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: October 17.

00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:07.800
PERLA CAMPOS: The
first [INAUDIBLE]..

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.633
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
October 17, the Doodle,

00:48:09.633 --> 00:48:12.380
day it's going to come
out, it's actually

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:16.460
celebrating our first album
released with Capitol EMI,

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:17.630
which is our record company.

00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:20.090
That was our first
big record company,

00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:23.300
and when we were going
to sign with EMI,

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.970
Sony was also interested in us.

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:31.600
And Sony was offering us way
more money to sign versus EMI.

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.746
But my father told--

00:48:33.746 --> 00:48:36.120
my father was like, no, I
don't think that's a good idea.

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.710
I think we need
to stay with EM--

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:39.120
let's go with EMI.

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:41.365
We're all three going,
what are you talking about?

00:48:41.365 --> 00:48:42.740
They are offering
way more money.

00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:44.550
He's like, it's not
about the money.

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:48.230
It's the fact that EMI doesn't--
this is a new thing for them,

00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:50.210
a new venture into Tejano music.

00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:52.374
They don't have any
artists right now signed.

00:48:52.374 --> 00:48:54.040
So that means that
they're going to give

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.620
full force in whatever
they do to make sure

00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:58.317
that whoever is
signed with them,

00:48:58.317 --> 00:49:00.400
they're going to back them
and make sure that they

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:01.441
go where they need to go.

00:49:02.046 --> 00:49:04.170
So it was more of a business
decision that we took.

00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:05.620
And so we allowed.

00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:08.010
We stepped back, and we
said, all right, you know,

00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:09.470
we'll let you do your thing.

00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:11.560
And thank goodness, because it
was probably the best decision

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:12.670
that we could have ever made.

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:12.970
PERLA CAMPOS: Wow!

00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:13.350
Cool.

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:14.810
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thank you,
and your T-shirts are fresh,

00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:15.270
by the way.

00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:16.728
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
Oh, thank you.

00:49:16.728 --> 00:49:17.570
Thank you.

00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:18.858
That's awesome.

00:49:18.858 --> 00:49:19.774
AUDIENCE: Hi, Suzette.

00:49:19.774 --> 00:49:20.186
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: Hi.

00:49:20.186 --> 00:49:21.080
AUDIENCE: My name's Cynthia.

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:22.091
It's nice to meet you.

00:49:22.091 --> 00:49:23.090
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: Hi.

00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:24.640
AUDIENCE: First of all, I just
want to say I love Selena,

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:26.570
and anytime anybody
ever ask me who

00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:29.110
my favorite artist of all
time is, I always say Selena.

00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:29.680
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
Oh, thank you.

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:30.180
Thank you.

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:31.100
AUDIENCE: Of course.

00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:35.060
My question is, what is
your favorite Selena song,

00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:38.080
and do you know which one was
Selena's favorite to perform.

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:39.247
PERLA CAMPOS: Good question.

00:49:39.247 --> 00:49:40.788
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
She used to love

00:49:40.788 --> 00:49:42.110
performing Rocio Durcal songs.

00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:43.090
AUDIENCE: Which one?

00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:48.140
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
Rocio Durcal cover tunes.

00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:49.310
I don't know.

00:49:49.310 --> 00:49:53.050
She used to-- her
favorite English song--

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:55.057
whenever-- I don't
know about performing.

00:49:55.057 --> 00:49:56.640
Off the top of my
head, I really can't

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:59.450
say as regards to
what her favorite was.

00:49:59.450 --> 00:50:02.570
But her favorite
song was by Extreme

00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:04.920
"More Than Words," that
was her all-time favorite

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:07.570
to the point we would tell
her to shut up in the bus.

00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:09.382
She would sing it over,
and over, and over.

00:50:09.382 --> 00:50:11.090
We told her to go to
the back of the bus,

00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:14.510
because she wouldn't shut
up about that stupid song.

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:17.960
My all-time favorite is--

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:23.880
"Yo Fui Aquella," or a lot of
the rancheras, "No Me Queda

00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:28.580
Mas" clearly, but more of the
rancheras like "Que Creias."

00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:32.960
You know, stuff like that, now,
to me, all of them are amazing.

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.746
I never listened to
our music back then,

00:50:34.746 --> 00:50:37.370
but I tell you what, when I lost
her, that's all I listened to,

00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:40.670
and I actually carried
our music and my car,

00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:42.670
because I didn't do that before.

00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:45.340
Like, people would be like,
hey, give me one of your CDs.

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:46.480
I am like, are you kidding?

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.984
I don't have my music,
you know what I mean?

00:50:48.984 --> 00:50:50.950
Or a cassette tape, I'm
sorry, cassette tape.

00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:52.950
It wasn't CDs back then.

00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:55.980
So I don't know,
that's a good question.

00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:57.944
I don't know what Selena's
favorite song was.

00:50:57.944 --> 00:50:58.860
AUDIENCE: That's good.

00:50:58.860 --> 00:50:59.700
Thanks.

00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:00.070
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
I think-- what

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:02.420
is the one that she's
like telling the guy off,

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.580
because she really got into it?

00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:05.540
"Que Creias."

00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:06.205
PERLA CAMPOS: That's a good one.

00:51:06.205 --> 00:51:06.575
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
Remember when

00:51:06.575 --> 00:51:08.230
she's like singing to
the guy, she gets down.

00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:08.780
She's grabbing him.

00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:11.030
She's like, she calls somebody
out from the audience.

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.988
There's a video of her.

00:51:11.988 --> 00:51:14.700
She calls somebody out, and
she goes, she invites a guy up,

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:16.910
when she tells them, you're
going to be my boyfriend.

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:18.765
And the guy gets all happy,
and she starts telling him off

00:51:18.765 --> 00:51:19.130
in Spanish.

00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:21.606
PERLA CAMPOS: Now you're not
going to be so happy about it.

00:51:21.606 --> 00:51:22.814
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: So yeah.

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:26.220
Hi.

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:28.309
AUDIENCE: Hey, yeah,
thanks for coming.

00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:29.850
So, obviously, you
spoke a little bit

00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:35.220
about how this was a family
endeavor getting into the band

00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:36.230
and doing this together.

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:38.880
But I was just
wondering what were

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:42.630
your own personal musical
inspirations back then?

00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:44.670
And also, what are
you listening to now?

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:50.980
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
Back then, I really--

00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:57.730
back then, I was all about Janet
Jackson, Madonna, Men at Work,

00:51:57.730 --> 00:52:00.430
you know?

00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:02.470
Pretty much what
every other kid was

00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:03.910
into in like, what, the '80s?

00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:05.820
Oh, my, god, I sound old.

00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:08.740
But yeah, in regards
to now, I mean,

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.780
I pretty much listen
to everything that's

00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:12.100
on the radio, Bruno Mars.

00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:12.950
I like all the--

00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:13.840
I like Drake.

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:17.350
I like, you know, Travis Scott.

00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:19.610
I mean, I listen to a
little bit of everything.

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:21.310
One thing I didn't
listen to back then,

00:52:21.310 --> 00:52:23.650
which I was like, eh, was
country music, which is weird,

00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:25.210
because I'm from Texas.

00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:27.620
But I really didn't
listen to country music.

00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:31.970
But I find myself gravitating
more towards it now,

00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:33.550
as I'm a little older.

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:34.900
But I listen to everything.

00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:35.530
You name it.

00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:37.600
I'll listen to it.

00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:38.980
I have no set preference.

00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:42.670
In regards to like, you
know, the whole musician

00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:51.080
aspect of it, you know, I
think growing up and being

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:53.380
self-taught, because
I learned how

00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:57.950
to play the drums from
my dad, which is weird.

00:52:57.950 --> 00:53:00.850
Because he is not a drummer
and also a friend of mine

00:53:00.850 --> 00:53:04.000
that was a drummer,
and my cousin as well,

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.350
just getting the basics down.

00:53:05.350 --> 00:53:07.949
I never learned how
to play as a musician.

00:53:07.949 --> 00:53:08.740
Are you a musician?

00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:09.530
AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:10.240
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: Yeah.

00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:10.990
Are you a drummer?

00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:13.870
OK, well, drummers, they
have to play with their rest.

00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:14.990
I tended to play--

00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:17.110
I taught myself, because
I was self-taught,

00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:19.950
I play more with my forearm
than I do with my wrists.

00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:24.340
So my rolls aren't as fast
as what they should be.

00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:28.780
But one thing I do say
that, am I fancy drummer?

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:29.410
No.

00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:32.156
But I tell you what,
I am a solid drummer.

00:53:32.156 --> 00:53:33.280
That's what I've been told.

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:35.310
To Everybody tells
me I can keep a beat.

00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:37.060
And that's one thing
I think that's really

00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:40.990
cool about our music
too is that we never--

00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:42.586
there was never a fight.

00:53:42.586 --> 00:53:44.710
When my brother produced
our music, there was like,

00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:47.830
you know, sometimes you get
a whole bunch of musicians

00:53:47.830 --> 00:53:51.270
together, and everybody wants to
take the lead, and ahh, la, la,

00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:52.570
you know, and all that stuff.

00:53:52.570 --> 00:53:55.540
We kept it pretty
much simple and clean,

00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:58.120
and I think that that also
was another reason why

00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:00.700
our music still
resonates 22 years later

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:02.910
with a lot of people.

00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:04.000
It's the drummer.

00:54:06.569 --> 00:54:07.360
PERLA CAMPOS: Cool.

00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:08.640
I think we have--

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:10.730
Tracy, have time for
one more question?

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:19.639
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you for being here.

00:54:19.639 --> 00:54:20.930
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: Thank you.

00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:22.430
AUDIENCE: I just
want to share too--

00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:26.830
building on what Perla
said, but I remember seeing,

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:29.030
I was really little
when Selena passed away.

00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:30.157
I think I was like 10.

00:54:30.157 --> 00:54:31.990
And I'd heard her music,
but I didn't really

00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:34.420
understand her story
until I saw the movie when

00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:38.620
I was in junior high, and it was
the first time I saw a Latino

00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:42.130
woman in such a leading
role, and it was really

00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:47.770
just incredible for me to see
my culture, my mother's culture,

00:54:47.770 --> 00:54:51.370
being represented in such a
positive way in like a stage

00:54:51.370 --> 00:54:53.310
that, you know,
that the world sees.

00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:58.690
And it just it stuck with
me forever to this day.

00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:01.300
I thank you guys for
wanting to make sure

00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:04.540
that the world continued to
know her story, even people who

00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:06.790
weren't obviously
there at the time.

00:55:06.790 --> 00:55:08.890
It's like being able
to have shared that

00:55:08.890 --> 00:55:11.110
and continuing to
share it today is just

00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:14.919
so incredible for the
entire world really.

00:55:14.919 --> 00:55:16.210
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: Thank you.

00:55:16.210 --> 00:55:21.070
AUDIENCE: Bu t my question for
you is, what is exciting you

00:55:21.070 --> 00:55:22.420
musically these days?

00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:28.510
Or do you have any personal
music plans as a drummer

00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:33.400
yourself that is on the horizon
or that you could share?

00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:35.180
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
Well, first of all,

00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:36.250
thank you for your words.

00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:37.855
I almost cried
right now seriously.

00:55:37.855 --> 00:55:42.250
They are very, heartfelt,
and I appreciate that.

00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:43.690
I don't have any plans.

00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:47.620
Right now, I
stepped out of that.

00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:49.450
When Selena passed
away, like I said,

00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:53.750
it took me about 2 and 1/2,
3 years to find myself again.

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:57.880
And I didn't find the
need to play anymore,

00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:00.250
to be honest with you.

00:56:00.250 --> 00:56:04.260
My brother continued with his
band, you know, Kumbia Kings.

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:07.850
He created a band that
has been very successful.

00:56:07.850 --> 00:56:10.990
But I just didn't
find myself being

00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:16.220
OK with playing with anyone.

00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:18.630
I didn't want to
start my own band.

00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:20.410
I do feel like--

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:21.130
I don't know.

00:56:21.130 --> 00:56:23.060
It just didn't feel right.

00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:26.220
And then I just kind
of gravitated into--

00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:28.330
we have a production company.

00:56:28.330 --> 00:56:32.110
Our production company has
three recording studios,

00:56:32.110 --> 00:56:35.440
and we have like-- we do-- we
have an editing department,

00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.570
and we have a
graphic designer now.

00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:41.710
So we do layouts for CDs and
DVDs for other bands and things

00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:43.430
like that.

00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:46.340
So I just kind of found
myself helping my father

00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:49.510
and just so many people
calling and doing things,

00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:52.610
and I don't know, it just kind
of felt right just to be there.

00:56:52.610 --> 00:56:55.930
And so now I'm CEO and
president of our company,

00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:59.320
and I wear a lot
of different hats.

00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:03.070
And will I ever play again?

00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:05.650
We have a yearly festival
in Corpus Christi called

00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:08.260
Fiesta de la Flor in our city.

00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:11.630
I got up, and I jammed with
my brother and Jackie Cruz

00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:13.600
with "Orange is the New Black."

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:15.250
She was down visiting for that.

00:57:15.250 --> 00:57:15.970
We had her sing.

00:57:15.970 --> 00:57:17.420
We're like, get up there.

00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:19.360
And it wasn't planned.

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:21.460
Literally, my brother
is like, hey, you

00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:22.886
want to play with me tomorrow?

00:57:22.886 --> 00:57:23.700
I am like, what?

00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:25.690
I haven't played.

00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:29.230
I was so freaking
nervous, you have no idea.

00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:31.660
Like, it was insane.

00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:33.940
It was probably
the coolest insane.

00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:35.500
I felt panicky.

00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:38.610
I didn't remember the
count of our song,

00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:43.110
like, I had a couple of drinks
and turned out, not gonna lie.

00:57:43.110 --> 00:57:44.920
But it was crazy,
because as soon

00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:49.240
as I-- as soon as that
second or third beat came in,

00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:50.530
it was like riding a bike.

00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:52.732
It was like, oh, I got this.

00:57:52.732 --> 00:57:54.910
Oh, oh, yeah, I
remember this song.

00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:57.260
It was "Como la Flor."

00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:58.750
And I don't know.

00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:01.210
I don't know what
the future holds.

00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:01.842
I don't know.

00:58:01.842 --> 00:58:02.800
Will I ever play again?

00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:03.910
I don't know.

00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:05.980
I'm one of those that
I'm very spontaneous,

00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:08.680
and I'm like, if I feel
like it, maybe when

00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:10.020
I get a little older.

00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:11.140
Yeah, maybe, why not?

00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:11.890
I mean, not that--

00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:12.705
I'm already old.

00:58:12.705 --> 00:58:14.830
But one thing I will say
that was really cool about

00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:17.470
that night was
that I have a son.

00:58:17.470 --> 00:58:19.730
He's 19, and he
got to see me play.

00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:20.590
So how cool am I?

00:58:20.590 --> 00:58:21.365
PERLA CAMPOS:
Yeah, that is cool.

00:58:21.365 --> 00:58:23.680
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
How cool am I to my son?

00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:25.650
So I don't know, maybe.

00:58:25.650 --> 00:58:26.909
Maybe one day.

00:58:26.909 --> 00:58:27.700
PERLA CAMPOS: Cool.

00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:28.720
Well, thank you, Tracy--

00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:28.970
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: Thank you

00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:30.386
PERLA CAMPOS: --for
your question.

00:58:30.386 --> 00:58:33.380
And thank you guys
again for coming,

00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:35.409
and thank you to
Suzette and your family.

00:58:35.409 --> 00:58:36.700
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: Thank you.

00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:40.090
PERLA CAMPOS: I mean, this was
like a dream project for me

00:58:40.090 --> 00:58:45.250
and obviously just super
meaningful for a lot of people

00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:46.030
at Google.

00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:47.982
And on October 17,
hopefully it will

00:58:47.982 --> 00:58:50.440
be extremely meaningful to a
lot of people out in the world

00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:51.050
as well.

00:58:51.050 --> 00:58:51.620
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: I love it.

00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:52.070
I love it.

00:58:52.070 --> 00:58:52.569
I love it.

00:58:52.569 --> 00:58:57.310
This is just-- this is
just another thing that

00:58:57.310 --> 00:58:59.870
just elevates Selena, and
just kind of helps us.

00:58:59.870 --> 00:59:00.890
So thank you so much.

00:59:00.890 --> 00:59:04.270
And thank you to Google
for coming to our family

00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:06.220
and wanting to do
this to honor her.

00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:08.290
And I think that
her fans, you guys

00:59:08.290 --> 00:59:10.230
are going to make so
many people happy.

00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:10.570
PERLA CAMPOS: I think so too.

00:59:10.570 --> 00:59:11.460
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA:
It's going to crazy.

00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:12.280
Y'all just wait.

00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:12.610
PERLA CAMPOS: I know.

00:59:12.610 --> 00:59:14.200
I'm so ready to
break the internet.

00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:15.310
I just want to do it.

00:59:15.310 --> 00:59:18.220
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: I just
want to tell somebody right now.

00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:19.070
PERLA CAMPOS: That
will come soon.

00:59:19.070 --> 00:59:19.800
But thanks so much.

00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:20.980
I really want to
thank you, Suzette.

00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:22.271
SUZETTE QUINTANILLA: Thank you.

00:59:22.271 --> 00:59:24.030
[APPLAUSE]
