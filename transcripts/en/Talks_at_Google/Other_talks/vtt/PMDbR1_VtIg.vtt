00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.240
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
welcome everybody.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.570
Welcome to a conversation I'm
going to have with a woman

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.460
I admire very much.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.880
Ellen Gustafson.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.750
And she has just
released "We the Eaters."

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.270
She is quite a powerful woman.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.590
And she's put
together two things--

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.620
food and writing-- which
are usually very quiet,

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:30.110
small things in this small book
with a very powerful message.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.130
And it's pretty revolutionary.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.886
So I want to welcome
you to Google.

00:00:33.886 --> 00:00:35.010
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: Thank you.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.740
FEMALE SPEAKER: And
thank you for coming.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.760
ELLEN GUSTAFSON:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.060
FEMALE SPEAKER: So why
should we be eating.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.740
And even more
important than that,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.820
why should we be
eating dinner-- which

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.690
is one of your main points.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.750
And dinner just
sounds so traditional.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.360
We sit down to dinner.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.660
Grandma, mom, makes
a roast chicken.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.860
But why is eating
dinner together now

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.670
such a revolutionary act?

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.600
You've put it on
these pages for us.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.489
Can you tell us?

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.197
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: It's
interesting to kind

00:01:06.197 --> 00:01:10.850
of frame food in a lot of the
different areas of our lives

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.470
and of global issues that
sometimes food doesn't

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.080
get kind of plugged into.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.500
Obviously we know that food
is incredibly connected

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.940
to our health, and our
personal health, and maybe even

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.030
community health.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.150
But sometimes we miss a
lot of the other elements

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.820
that food brings us to.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.350
And in this book I talk
a lot about politics--

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.820
big, global politics issues.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.450
But also even relationships
at a much more personal level.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.520
And so dinner is such
an iconic example

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.840
of when the family-- the
very small body politic--

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.750
gets together and talks.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.550
And the family life
is really borne

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.490
from that experience of spending
time together, and talking

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.490
and learning, and learning
about family history,

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.660
and learning about
the food itself.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.250
And it's really something
that many of us have lost.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.070
And I think that that can
then be sort of extrapolated

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.860
to a lot of other
big picture issues.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.550
Where if this meal is something
that we think of as just a

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.900
throwaway, cheap, pick
up on the way home,

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.539
drive-through-- well
think about what

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.260
that's done to
culture in general,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.720
and then to a lot of these
other big global issues.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.490
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think the
very radical act of sitting down

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.920
with people you live with or
care about is so compelling now

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.000
in the days when people stand
by their kitchen sink and eat.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.830
Or as you say, drive by.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.110
Or don't even eat.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.870
Maybe it's just a snack.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.030
Maybe it's a piece
of something that you

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.160
can put boiling water on and be
through eating in five minutes.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.340
What brought you to this?

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.245
Why did you put it at
the center of your life?

00:02:45.245 --> 00:02:46.870
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: Well
I didn't actually

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.640
start working on
food issues as all.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.670
I'm myself an eater.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.420
I love to eat.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.580
And I think as a
woman-- especially

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.830
as a young woman--
eating actually

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.810
posed a lot of
challenges for me.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.990
I mean, even just
fitting into your jeans

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.069
is challenging in our
modern culture of food.

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.360
And so that was always
something in the back of my head

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.680
just as a young person
growing up in America,

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.540
and being frustrated that
you hit a point where

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.300
everyone notices.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.080
OK, I guess you're
going to be at the age

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.038
now where you're going
to start gaining weight.

00:03:15.038 --> 00:03:16.800
And that seems like
a foregone conclusion

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.340
in our modern society.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.520
Which is silly.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.740
It shouldn't be the case.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.830
But actually my work--
my professional life

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.450
and my focus-- was much
more on big global issues

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.660
like terrorism and
security issues.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.310
And when I was in a senior
at college in New York City,

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.910
9/11 happened.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.100
I was very, very focused
on understanding terrorism

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.210
and why these things
happen in the world,

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.670
and what's gone on in
our modern society that

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.300
led to this really radical
shift in people's beliefs

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.550
about Americans and
about Western culture.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.550
And actually those
two things together

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.800
brought me to my current work.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.320
And it seems kind of crazy,
but in one of my jobs

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.880
working on terrorism issues
as an investigative reporter,

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.780
I was looking at the global
map of terrorism and places

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.020
where terrorist
groups are operating.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.510
And I also randomly saw this map
from the World Food Program--

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.300
the hunger map.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.170
And I noticed that, my God,
they're incredibly similar.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.440
Places around the world
where people are hungry

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.870
are always connected to
places around the world

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.344
where people are violent,
and uprisings occur,

00:04:18.344 --> 00:04:20.750
and terrorism then eventually
festers and happens.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.150
And that to me was such
an unbelievable link

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.917
and connection, and
it led me to switch

00:04:26.917 --> 00:04:29.250
from working on terrorism to
working on fundamental food

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.690
security and hunger,
and kind of move along

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.630
in my career in a
totally different way.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.130
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
interesting to me

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.610
that you went from
the sexier topic

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.210
of-- if you will-- terrorism.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.170
If it bleeds, it leads.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:48.730
Kind of investigative reportage
that brought you to this way

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.294
quieter, less sexy subject,
but so fundamental.

00:04:52.294 --> 00:04:53.460
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: Absolutely.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.690
FEMALE SPEAKER: To
culture, society, politics.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:56.606
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: Yeah.

00:04:56.606 --> 00:04:58.060
I mean, people miss that.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.570
We think of the after-effects.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.341
How are we going to
fight these people?

00:05:02.341 --> 00:05:03.840
How are we going
to fight terrorism?

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.859
And not maybe the
fundamental issues

00:05:05.859 --> 00:05:07.150
of how are we going to prevent?

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.650
It's actually the same thing we
look at when we look at health.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.270
Instead of thinking of how
we're going to prevent disease,

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.145
we think of how we're
going to fight disease.

00:05:13.145 --> 00:05:15.620
And it's this whole look at
fighting the problem after it

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.411
happens, instead of
preventing these issues

00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:18.710
from ever happening again.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.751
FEMALE SPEAKER: So all
the downstream things that

00:05:20.751 --> 00:05:22.482
are so much more easy
to talk about then

00:05:22.482 --> 00:05:23.440
the fundamental things.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.590
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: Right exactly.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.090
Exactly.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.490
FEMALE SPEAKER: So OK.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.830
9/11.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.790
Tell us a little of the
personal journey that

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.165
brought you to
what you do today.

00:05:31.165 --> 00:05:32.990
Because you have
done so many things.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.220
You're called an activist.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.270
But you're really
a person who cares

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.779
so much about
fundamental values.

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:38.820
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: So yeah.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.361
I didn't really
start as an activist.

00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:43.370
I shifted over from my
work as a journalist

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.520
to the UN World
Food Program itself,

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.600
working in the organization.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.620
It's the largest humanitarian
organization in the world.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.170
And I started my job there as
a public information officer,

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.354
as a spokesperson.

00:05:55.354 --> 00:05:57.270
And so one of my jobs
was talking to the media

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.590
and getting to
understand hunger,

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.173
and why they should
care about hunger.

00:06:00.173 --> 00:06:02.140
And of course I always
brought in this angle

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.080
that we should care about hunger
because we care about terrorism

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.460
and the downstream effects.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.700
But also we were
looking for ways

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.530
to get young people
engaged in hunger.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.400
Actually, when I started
working there in 2006,

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.610
although food security now
is maybe a little bit sexier,

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.230
it really wasn't at all then.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.340
And I met one of the
celebrity ambassadors

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.470
that was representing the
UN World Food Program.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.630
And she and I kind of
developed this idea

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.740
to start a company that sold
products-- the products were

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.280
called feed bag-- and each
feed bag sold would give money

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.975
back to the UN World Food
Program to raise money

00:06:38.975 --> 00:06:41.100
and to raise awareness
about the problem of hunger,

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.500
and let people have a
tangible way to give.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.360
It's funny.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.010
We started this company in
a complete vacuum really.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.620
In New York, but
not really knowing

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.745
there was a whole movement.

00:06:50.745 --> 00:06:53.717
And Tom's Shoes-- this
other iconic accessories

00:06:53.717 --> 00:06:55.300
brand about giving
back-- was starting

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.370
at the exact same time.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.815
So there was almost
this zeitgeist

00:06:58.815 --> 00:07:00.940
happening around this whole
social entrepreneurship

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.190
movement, and caring
about global issues,

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.660
but through your
consumer dollars.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.070
And so starting Feed was
a huge, huge thing for me.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.045
It was an incredible experience
running a business, a fashion

00:07:12.045 --> 00:07:13.420
business, but also
getting people

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.690
to care through their
consumer purchases

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.450
about this issue of hunger.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:21.980
But eventually as my years
working on global hunger

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.290
continued, I had this aha
moment that I talk about

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:29.170
in the book where I
was in Uganda working

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.200
on hunger issues,
as you might expect.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.480
And I went into a
store to get food

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.640
to take with me out to a
day's work in the field--

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.550
while visiting projects
that we were funding,

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.530
and visiting different things
that aid organizations were

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:44.140
working on.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:48.390
And going into a little store
in this small city in Uganda.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.150
I mean, really not Kumpala.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.470
Not [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.980
Not one of the main cities.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.270
And it was literally
packed with junk.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.590
And I remember driving
through these dirt roads.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:00.420
There's soda.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.639
Pringles are everywhere.

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:03.180
I don't know how
they get everywhere.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.200
There's ice cream
in so many places

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.030
that have barely safe water.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:14.260
And chips and packaged
sweets and pastries.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.590
And I was like how have we
got somehow, this system where

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.490
we can get people
Coca-Cola literally

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.510
in 200 countries, more countries
than are recognized by the UN,

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.220
and somehow we can't get
healthy basic food that's

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.000
grown locally.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.770
And it really struck me when
I flew back to the States

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.480
and went into one of those
Hudson new stores, that

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.960
are in every airport, and
it's literally all junk.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.600
It's the same stuff.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.340
And I had this aha moment
of like, wait a minute.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.570
This is much more similar
than it is different.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:46.915
Our problems at home of obesity
and fitting into our jeans,

00:08:46.915 --> 00:08:49.290
and everybody gaining weight,
and all the health problems

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:50.260
related to that.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.019
And this hunger
problem that I've

00:08:52.019 --> 00:08:53.560
been working that
seemed so far away,

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.259
are so much more similar
than they are different.

00:08:56.259 --> 00:08:58.800
And then I started working on
the connection between the two.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.637
And eventually this book.

00:09:00.637 --> 00:09:01.720
FEMALE SPEAKER: Beautiful.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.520
So it's malnutrition.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.329
It's eating bad food.

00:09:06.329 --> 00:09:07.370
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: Exactly.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.050
FEMALE SPEAKER: Food that
causes disease, and doesn't

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.230
maintain and sustain you.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:13.390
What a journey.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:17.027
And Feed-- did I read
that you fed 6 million?

00:09:17.027 --> 00:09:18.110
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: Well yes.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.360
So actually, the
numbers today of Feed--

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.340
which has continued and
been really successful

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.670
over the years since we
started in 2007-- they've

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:29.962
provided 80 million school
meals to kids around the world.

00:09:29.962 --> 00:09:31.670
And while I was there,
it was 60 million.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:32.990
So the numbers keep going.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:36.970
And what's interesting too,
the timing of my own journey

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.686
is while I was at Feed--
started in 2006-- in 2008,

00:09:40.686 --> 00:09:42.060
there was this
global food crisis

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.300
and hunger was skyrocketing.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.420
And so we were at our best year.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.040
We are providing so many
millions of school meals.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.750
But the problem of hunger
was growing so dramatically.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.500
And it really made
me think that there's

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.820
something so much bigger here.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.912
The system is
really the problem.

00:09:57.912 --> 00:10:00.370
This is not something that we
can just only throw money at.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.240
We have to figure
out fundamentally

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.114
how to change this system.

00:10:05.114 --> 00:10:07.280
FEMALE SPEAKER: And how
should we change the system?

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.292
Where should each
one of us begin?

00:10:09.292 --> 00:10:11.000
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: Well
it comes eventually

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.420
through thinking,
and researching,

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.560
and writing this book.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.750
But also just really
deeply looking

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.300
at how the interconnection
between our food system at home

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.180
and these food systems I've
seen overseas is-- Americans

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.500
decide what the world eats.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.970
And the more you travel,
the more you see it.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.330
In countries and cultures
that people have always

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:33.410
eaten incredible traditional
diets, and diverse crops

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:37.010
from their own regions and
soils, now more and more,

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.620
it's what we eat.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.060
And its our varieties, and
it's our agricultural systems,

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.500
and it made me
think that Americans

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.290
have a huge responsibility.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.290
Hence "We the Eaters."

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:51.140
We have a huge
responsibility to understand

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.640
that our eating
habits themselves

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.270
have a massive impact
around the world.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:59.300
And if we don't get them
right-- if we export the junk

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.800
food and the fast
food and the soda,

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.527
as we have been
doing-- that is what

00:11:02.527 --> 00:11:03.860
the world is going to look like.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.536
They're going to look just like
us as they're starting to do.

00:11:06.536 --> 00:11:08.160
And so if we get it
right here at home,

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.290
if we figure out how
to make a system work,

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.661
like we figured out how to
get cell phones to be really

00:11:12.661 --> 00:11:15.160
successful, and now there's
more African cellphone consumers

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.284
than there are North American
cell phone consumers.

00:11:17.284 --> 00:11:18.810
We can do that
with food systems.

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:20.590
We just haven't
figured out yet how.

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:22.520
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think
China and India are

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.044
vying for diabetes
capital of the world.

00:11:25.044 --> 00:11:25.960
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: Yeah.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:26.580
Mexico.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.420
I mean, all these countries.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:31.610
And it's not because their
own people are somehow

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.760
changed and lazy, like
the messaging we hear.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.530
And their personal
responsibility

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.580
has gone down the toilet.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.038
No it's because
they're eating more

00:11:39.038 --> 00:11:40.254
and more of the Western diet.

00:11:40.254 --> 00:11:41.920
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's
the fast food diet.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:49.330
And it fits in such a
weird way and so quickly

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.210
into their cultures.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.740
I think what it took
America since the '50s

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.340
in the last century to do,
it's taken them 10, 20 years

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.075
to get to this place of
disease and non-health.

00:12:00.075 --> 00:12:01.700
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: Well
and the flip side

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:06.180
of that is that we built this
system-- the fast food system,

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:09.519
the soda system, the junk
food proliferation system.

00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:10.560
And it works really well.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.320
And we've perfected it.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.880
And now it works really well.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.410
And so there is
absolutely no reason

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.440
we can't do that
with healthy foods.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.274
It's not like a
foregone conclusion

00:12:20.274 --> 00:12:21.690
that this is the
only food that we

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:26.410
can make in a way that's
produced and available.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:27.860
The systems have
to be different,

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.340
but we can-- and actually
here we are in the Bay Area,

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.660
and we can see that the
alternative can work.

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.600
In almost every small
place you go into now

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.020
in the San Francisco
Bay Area has

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.580
some semblance of
local purchasing,

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:45.447
or healthier food, or
green juice, or kale.

00:12:45.447 --> 00:12:47.280
FEMALE SPEAKER: And
more kale and more kale.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.130
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: And
more kale and more kale.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:50.750
And so the fact is, we can
make these systems work

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:52.080
for healthier foods.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.340
It's just a matter
of the entrepreneurs

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:59.250
and the eaters joining forces
to make the better system work.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.830
FEMALE SPEAKER: It is going to
look different though, right?

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:05.220
You envision a future where we
sit down to dinner together.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.480
It may be in a traditional
nuclear family.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:12.450
It may be me and a friend on
a webcam across the country.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.110
Or what would it look like?

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:14.610
Tell us.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:16.220
Give us an idea of what you see.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:16.820
ELLEN GUSTAFSON:
Well it's funny.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.611
I mean, we've obviously
kept eating dinner.

00:13:18.611 --> 00:13:21.130
That hasn't gone away.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.910
What we've eaten has
changed so dramatically.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:30.999
And so I think sometimes
I'm always kind of amused--

00:13:30.999 --> 00:13:33.540
I guess that's the only way to
describe it-- when people talk

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.999
about how incredibly
busy they are,

00:13:34.999 --> 00:13:36.414
and how they have
to stay at work,

00:13:36.414 --> 00:13:38.020
and that's why they
can't cook dinner.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.510
And these are not people
that have their finger

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:40.426
on the big red button.

00:13:40.426 --> 00:13:42.920
I mean, we're just people
who are working our jobs.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.121
That's a culture shift that
we can take some control of,

00:13:46.121 --> 00:13:48.370
and say no, it's actually
important to go home and eat

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:51.720
dinner with people, and
sit, and take the time.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.670
So I think that's something
that we have to really invest

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:56.590
time and energy into
as a culture shift.

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.390
And it's totally possible.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.290
But the flip side
is we have to find

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:05.100
ways to make healthier food
options more available,

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.960
and I hate to say
it, but easier.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.500
You know, it's ridiculous
that the easiest thing is

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:15.640
this wildly subsidized, actually
incredibly expensive hamburger

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.030
meal is somehow the
cheapest, easiest thing.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.637
And we have got to
find ways, and we

00:14:19.637 --> 00:14:21.220
have to find the
entrepreneurs, and we

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:25.480
have to find the systems, and
the farmers, and the politics,

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.930
and the policies that
work to make the easier

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:32.630
thing, and the cheaper thing
the healthier thing like it

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:34.450
always should have been.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:37.870
FEMALE SPEAKER: And so you're
saying, have a hamburger.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:40.580
Have it maybe not so often.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.390
Go buy your grass-fed beef.

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:47.020
Buy a beautiful artisan-made
bread, maybe whole wheat.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.920
And nothing wrong
with a hamburger,

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.484
but make it from scratch.

00:14:50.484 --> 00:14:51.400
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: Yeah.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.339
I try-- I mean myself,
I love burgers.

00:14:54.339 --> 00:14:56.130
So I'm certainly never
going to tell anyone

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:58.700
to eat a certain diet.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.304
And I'm not a
nutritionist nor a doctor.

00:15:01.304 --> 00:15:02.470
That's not my role, I think.

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:05.970
But I think we've gotten so far
off-kilter that the only way

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:09.590
to be healthy is
to eschew foods.

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.520
But the reason
that we think that

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.710
is because the foods are
actually not really the foods.

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:16.109
I mean, the burger
that you think

00:15:16.109 --> 00:15:18.150
of that you might get at
the fast food restaurant

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.910
is certainly terrible for you.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.750
But it's not because red
meat itself is the devil,

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:26.990
or we shouldn't be eating
these entire food groups.

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:29.210
I think what we've done
to the food group-- what

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:30.870
the modern version
of the food group

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:34.010
is, is certainly like
a bastardized version.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:35.240
But it's not the food itself.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.540
And that's something I
think we're wrestling with.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.680
And I think as young
people-- there's

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:45.110
a generation of my
friends, my generation

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:46.777
is starting to really
think differently.

00:15:46.777 --> 00:15:48.485
Do we want to spend
the rest of our lives

00:15:48.485 --> 00:15:49.900
on a highly restrictive diet?

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.370
Or do we want to really
think about where

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:52.203
our food comes from?

00:15:52.203 --> 00:15:54.670
And maybe that is
the restrictive diet

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:58.320
that helps us both maintain
our health goals and our weight

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.430
goals, but also
happens to be better

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:02.580
for the whole world and
the environment too.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.130
FEMALE SPEAKER: And I think
it is starting to happen.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.810
With some of the research
that's coming out.

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:11.860
So I have one more question
before I open the conversation

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:16.990
up to everybody in the room,
which is you were a journalist.

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.820
And so what made
you say I'm going

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.440
to stop investigating
and reporting about it.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.860
I'm actually going to
do something about it.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:28.020
That's a very courageous
switch to make.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.132
What happened in
here, or in here?

00:16:31.132 --> 00:16:32.590
ELLEN GUSTAFSON:
Well I think first

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:37.330
of all, just incredible
frustration and maybe more

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.480
than a journalist--
at my core, I'm

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.800
more of an entrepreneur, because
I love when people say no,

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.740
and that just means I have
to find a way around it.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:51.970
But I think it's so frustrating
to read about especially

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:53.929
health in our
country, and to read

00:16:53.929 --> 00:16:55.470
about the environment
in our country,

00:16:55.470 --> 00:17:00.540
and to read about global
hunger-- children starving

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:05.130
in a world of well enough
calories for everybody

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:06.930
to survive and thrive.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:10.310
And just to see that, and
read that, and report on it

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:13.910
was really personally
very frustrating.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:18.141
And then to work on the flip
side at a major organization--

00:17:18.141 --> 00:17:20.390
the World Food Program--
which does so much good work,

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:22.230
but to even see in
that organization

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:25.750
how our American food
system has in some ways

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:27.450
even bastardized food aid.

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:31.110
We're giving a lot of
corn and soy excess

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:33.320
that American farmers
are growing probably

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.800
too much of,
sending it overseas,

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.040
and then embedding those
systems of corn-based food

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.720
systems in countries around the
world where people are needy,

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.242
where they should be growing
their own local foods that

00:17:45.242 --> 00:17:46.200
probably are healthier.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.450
And so all of this together.

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:54.070
Seeing this so clearly, I just
couldn't stand aside anymore

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:56.250
and watch it without
trying to find

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.937
ways to fix it and change it.

00:17:58.937 --> 00:18:00.270
FEMALE SPEAKER: Wonderful story.

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:03.130
And I think the
book will tell more,

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:07.310
but you've done many other
activities-- entrepreneurial

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:11.220
as well as policy stuff--
that's really exciting.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.990
Thank you so much for
doing what you do.

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:14.115
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: Thank you.

00:18:14.115 --> 00:18:15.300
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.020
I'm going to let everybody
else join in the conversation.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:24.000
If you have a question, Ellen
is happy to answer them.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.360
AUDIENCE: What would you tell
to a Coca-Cola exec or a Pepsi

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:28.860
exec?

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:29.815
And it's funny,
because Pepsi just

00:18:29.815 --> 00:18:31.577
released their "a
real sugar drink."

00:18:31.577 --> 00:18:33.785
Which is funny that they
put that label on the bottle

00:18:33.785 --> 00:18:34.380
to begin with.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.200
But what would you
tell them to make

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.720
their case, via you're making
millions, billions of dollars,

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.520
but we want you to
do this instead.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.379
What's the case for
them saying, "I agree?"

00:18:44.379 --> 00:18:46.170
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: Well
what's interesting is

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:49.600
that I feel-- especially
coming into this

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.586
and this book being
released in 2014--

00:18:52.586 --> 00:18:54.460
is I almost don't have
to tell them anything,

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.710
because the marketplace is
telling them everything.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:59.520
You know, the young
women, myself included,

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.600
who in college used
to drink Diet Coke,

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.690
thinking that was
the healthier option.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.510
Our wildly moving
away from drinks

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:09.770
like that because of the
artificial ingredients.

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:13.770
And I don't see where the future
is for those products when

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:17.110
the hard-core consumer
of those products

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:19.030
is now completely leaving.

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:20.186
They're not coming back.

00:19:20.186 --> 00:19:21.560
It's not like all
of a sudden I'm

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.620
going to have to
start feeding Diet

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.480
Coke to my children
in the future.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:29.570
So I think that the consumer
has spoken in many ways.

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:32.290
And so what's been interesting
to watch is a couple things.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:35.100
Coca-Cola specifically is
investing a lot more in water.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.650
They're investing
a ton in juice.

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:40.579
They're investing in-- even
in juice facilities overseas,

00:19:40.579 --> 00:19:42.620
they've done some interesting
projects in Africa,

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.280
building mango juice
processing facilities

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.400
for African consumers.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.040
Because the messages are
trickling around the world

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.920
so much faster,
because of obviously

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.530
tools like Google
and the internet,

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:56.115
but people are
learning about health

00:19:56.115 --> 00:19:58.240
not just here as Western
consumers, but everywhere.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.240
So people are drinking
less soda because they're

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.560
realizing the impacts of it.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.310
So I think that that's
really interesting.

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:06.731
That Coke is hearing that
message without major activists

00:20:06.731 --> 00:20:07.980
or whatever speaking about it.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.438
But what's also
interesting though,

00:20:09.438 --> 00:20:13.290
is that it's a system
that they live in.

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:15.580
So one of the things-- they're
this really interesting

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:19.790
nonprofit in Africa, I
think it's called Cola Life.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:23.825
But what they use is the
same facilities and logistics

00:20:23.825 --> 00:20:25.390
and infrastructure
that brings soda

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:27.270
to literally every
corner of the planet,

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.920
is now being used to
bring medicine and just

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.264
basic needs for communities.

00:20:32.264 --> 00:20:33.930
And what's interesting
is, that's great.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:37.100
And that is using the
system for better, right?

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.930
Bringing medicine to
people who need it.

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:41.880
But isn't it really the system
that we have to think about?

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.880
Should we have a
centralized American company

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.810
based in Atlanta providing
beverages for the entire world?

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:48.210
I don't know.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:52.940
What's funny about food
is it's not a widget.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.720
It's not a cellphone.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.450
It's great that you can
make widgets and cellphones

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:03.380
in one factory, centralized
probably in Asia, highly

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.450
replicable and mechanized.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:07.920
That, unfortunately,
is not what food is.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.810
And I don't think that
most eaters want food

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:12.320
to go that way.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:15.220
So I think what we have
to really investigate

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:19.740
is can Coca-Cola be successful
in a decentralized way?

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:22.490
Can they really just
be a holding company

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:25.380
for a lot of local companies
that do their own business

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.910
and their own production
around the world?

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:32.480
Is there a way for them to
succeed in an environment

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.330
where people don't want
super-centralized food systems,

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:40.982
and they want local, and
healthier, and more fresh food.

00:21:40.982 --> 00:21:42.440
And I think that's
their challenge.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.260
And I think they're
listening to it.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.160
And they're trying
to figure that out.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.535
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Maybe fortunately

00:21:47.535 --> 00:21:50.384
rather than unfortunately
that food is so local.

00:21:50.384 --> 00:21:51.300
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: Yeah.

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:55.990
No one else can sleep for you.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:57.710
No one else can
exercise for you.

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:00.007
I don't know why we've
become conditioned

00:22:00.007 --> 00:22:01.840
to think that somebody
else can eat for you,

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.720
or can cook every
single thing you're

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.850
going to put in your mouth.

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:07.414
And people laugh, it's so funny.

00:22:07.414 --> 00:22:09.830
I always think about this
image, but you know that machine

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:12.163
where you stood there, and
like the band would shake you

00:22:12.163 --> 00:22:12.920
back and forth?

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:13.100
OK.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.558
Everyone laughs at
that, but that's

00:22:14.558 --> 00:22:15.946
exactly what we do with food.

00:22:15.946 --> 00:22:18.570
We think we can just stand there
and have somebody else give it

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:20.050
to us.

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:23.230
And we know how ridiculous it is
that that machine can exercise

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:26.464
for us, but we don't see how
ridiculous the same thing is

00:22:26.464 --> 00:22:28.130
that we just stand
there with a conveyor

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:30.130
belt of food coming
into our mouths.

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:30.780
FEMALE SPEAKER: Great image.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:31.545
ELLEN GUSTAFSON:
But it really is

00:22:31.545 --> 00:22:32.850
something we have
to think about.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:35.141
Although I want one of those
machines, because it looks

00:22:35.141 --> 00:22:37.850
like a lot of fun.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:38.850
AUDIENCE: Thanks, Ellen.

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:41.180
I'm skipping to the
last part of your book,

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:44.124
because I think
anyone that is trying

00:22:44.124 --> 00:22:46.415
to make a change-- whether
they're improving their food

00:22:46.415 --> 00:22:49.300
literacy skills-- or just trying
to make a change in general,

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.860
you offer 30 points here.

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:56.690
And I guess the question
is, for you specifically,

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:59.413
what were some of the ones that
you grasped early on to make

00:22:59.413 --> 00:23:01.996
a change, and what would be some
of the ones that ;you brought

00:23:01.996 --> 00:23:04.895
to the audience as simple
things as early wins?

00:23:04.895 --> 00:23:07.604
Because trying to make
a complete change in how

00:23:07.604 --> 00:23:12.460
you deal with food, see food,
consume food is daunting.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.150
Especially with what
we've been eating.

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:16.330
So for someone who's
trying to make a change,

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.498
where would some of the tips
be to say, hey start with this.

00:23:18.498 --> 00:23:19.039
And try this.

00:23:19.039 --> 00:23:20.290
And then go to the next one.

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:21.998
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: That's
a great question.

00:23:21.998 --> 00:23:23.740
What's interesting
is I think people

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:28.340
come at food for
mostly health reasons.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.180
And so I think
those tend to be--

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.390
the health-related
changes-- tend

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:36.940
to be the easiest for
people to understand.

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:38.110
Cutting back the sugar.

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:40.170
Just reading labels
and noticing,

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:42.660
if sugar or a form of sugar
is the first ingredient,

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.990
this is probably not a
great food to be eating.

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:46.490
Cutting out
high-fructose corn syrup

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:49.680
is something that-- especially
my generation of young moms--

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:54.000
is just wildly shifting
their purchasing habits.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.449
Looking for that
product and just

00:23:55.449 --> 00:23:57.740
saying I'm not buying something
with that product in it

00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:59.320
is a really interesting change.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.165
Shifting to healthier
raised meats

00:24:01.165 --> 00:24:04.370
is something that a lot
of young, aware consumers

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:04.870
are doing.

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:07.660
And then paying attention
to vegetables and fruits

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.210
and saying, can I get something
that's more in season.

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:11.700
Can I get something
that's organic?

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.390
Can I get something
that's local?

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:15.130
That's all so much easier now.

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:18.290
The proliferation of
farmers' markets, and CSAs,

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.120
and ways to buy directly
from local farms

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:25.630
is really a radical shift in
like the last 10 to 15 years.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:26.610
And so that's easy.

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:29.000
And I say that sitting
in San Francisco,

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.740
but I really want
to stress that I

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.850
do a lot of speaking
on college campuses,

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:38.050
and I was at the University
of South Dakota in April.

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:42.490
And I witnessed the
most incredible array

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:44.690
of student food projects.

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:46.250
They actually made
different foods,

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:47.750
which is like the
greatest job ever,

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.374
I got to taste all
the stuff they made.

00:24:49.374 --> 00:24:52.869
But raw whole milk
from a local dairy.

00:24:52.869 --> 00:24:54.410
Stuff from the
farmer's market that's

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:56.900
twice a week in
Vermillion, South Dakota.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.505
I went to Eastern Kentucky
University on a day

00:25:00.505 --> 00:25:02.870
that they had a farmer's
market, and they offered me

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:04.640
a vegan option in the cafeteria.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.490
So this is not stuff
that's just happening

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:08.840
in our bubble of the Bay Area.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.660
It's actually really happening
all across the country, which

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.340
is amazing and really
important I think.

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:17.220
So I think those health-related
food changes are a great start.

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:20.190
But I also included some
steps-- one of them,

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:21.650
just to highlight
it, I think is so

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:25.200
interesting-- is to try
to walk to your meal.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.610
And it's something--
young people

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:29.990
want walkable environments.

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:32.351
We go to college, we
can walk to everything.

00:25:32.351 --> 00:25:34.850
And then all of a sudden you
go out to the rest of universe,

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:36.770
unless you live in a
major city, you literally

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:38.250
can't walk to get anything.

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:41.210
But I think that idea of livable
communities where you can just

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:44.090
walk to buy a food
item is something

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:49.550
that helps to shift
our societies.

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:51.511
And so that is like a
non-food related change,

00:25:51.511 --> 00:25:53.260
but something that I
think a lot of people

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:53.960
would become aware of.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.730
And say, "Wow.

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:57.610
Can I walk to get
a piece of food?

00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:58.340
Maybe not.

00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.798
And maybe is that
something I would

00:25:59.798 --> 00:26:02.840
like to investigate
and try to figure out."

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.800
And then the other thing
is, of course, a big thing.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.960
But getting people
to just try to cook.

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:14.220
I always was frustrated a couple
years ago during the Occupy

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:14.940
Movement.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.010
And this became one of
the points in my book,

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:21.380
is if you want to really be a
radical, occupy your kitchen.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:25.460
Don't sit there sleeping out
on the tent, where you clearly

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.030
can't cook for yourself, and
you would see the images where

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:32.090
there's like the big thing of
Coca-Cola and Heinz ketchup.

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:33.550
And I'm like, are you serious?

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:35.840
You're trying to rail
against large companies,

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.640
but you're literally
ingesting the large companies.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.850
Like talk about taking
it from the man.

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:42.820
You're eating the man right now.

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:45.990
And so I always think, if
you want to be a radical,

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:49.060
if you want to
really be the change,

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.930
the first thing
you can do is cook.

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:52.680
And it doesn't matter
what you make, even.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.054
You're just kind
of saying, screw

00:26:54.054 --> 00:26:56.191
the man by getting
in the kitchen.

00:26:56.191 --> 00:26:58.690
And so I think whether you come
at it from that kind of more

00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:00.981
political side, or you come
at it from the health side,

00:27:00.981 --> 00:27:04.100
there's so many
things that do add up

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.470
to major changes in
our food economy.

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:08.562
AUDIENCE: Maybe even a
step before that too,

00:27:08.562 --> 00:27:11.010
is before even knowing your
kitchen, knowing your food.

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:11.860
Planting some things too.

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:13.880
So there's a lot of people
out there who are farming.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.150
You look all around
the Google campus,

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:16.535
and there are garden everywhere.

00:27:16.535 --> 00:27:19.035
But would you say that more and
more people are getting back

00:27:19.035 --> 00:27:21.800
into understanding a
little about how to farm,

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.351
even if it's just
a pot of herbs.

00:27:23.351 --> 00:27:25.350
You can get herbs in
almost any supermarket now.

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.477
That might be another
way to engage people

00:27:27.477 --> 00:27:29.940
to understand,
oh, this is basil.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:31.210
This is what this tastes like.

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:31.330
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: Yeah.

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:31.830
Totally.

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:34.310
I mean it's interesting.

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:36.200
First of all, it's
really rewarding.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.100
And I think most people see that
even with a small pot of herbs.

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:42.070
And it's very prolific too.

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:45.090
You can get so much food
from a single plant.

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:46.840
You can do so much
with relatively little.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.340
And I think that's actually a
great wake-up call for people.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.250
Like, oh wow.

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:54.470
The reason that-- when food
stamps started, one of the main

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:57.430
reasons that people got food
stamps was to get seeds.

00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:59.750
Because it's wildly
less expensive to buy

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:01.597
a seed and then grow
the food yourself.

00:28:01.597 --> 00:28:03.680
So I think people are
starting to wake up to that.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.490
But also, there's
an amazing movement

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:08.750
of young people interested
in agriculture itself.

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:12.370
Young people farming, WWOOF'ing,
going around the world,

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:14.920
staying on farms
and volunteering.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.820
And in America, people
interning at farms

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:18.940
and apprenticing at farms.

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:23.244
And it's not like kids that are
growing up just in farmland.

00:28:23.244 --> 00:28:25.160
It's actually a lot of
kids who are growing up

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.400
in suburban America
who are like,

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.530
I have no idea where
my food comes from.

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:31.280
Maybe that's something
I should learn.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:34.580
And so it's very cool to see
the whole spectrum of people

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.460
being interested in growing.

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:38.580
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think
that is inevitable.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:42.320
If you start cooking and you
keep asking questions, it goes,

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.790
where does that come from?

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:45.100
And where does that come from?

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:48.701
And maybe at some point you
get to the health of the soil.

00:28:48.701 --> 00:28:50.450
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: Well,
which is also huge.

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:51.760
I mean, it's funny.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.460
Because your original
point about how--

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:58.170
it's terrorism and some of
these even local security

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:00.440
issues of inner city
security issues--

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.680
all those things
seem much more sexy.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.600
But what's really sexy
is actually the soil.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:10.170
And when you look at a
big massive cornfield

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:13.780
where most of our corn-based
ingredients come from,

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:16.570
it is dead soil with
nothing growing in it.

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:19.780
And just like a sprout
of crop coming up

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:22.030
out of it miraculously.

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:24.170
And that I think is a
really great education

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:25.160
for people to see.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.410
That's not really how
stuff is supposed to grow.

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:32.350
And I think more and more, both
in our domestic food systems

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:34.850
and also in our understanding
of international food systems,

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:37.122
we've realized we
don't invest in soil.

00:29:37.122 --> 00:29:38.580
And we keep the
runoff going and we

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.630
keep the chemicals pouring on.

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:43.520
That is not the answer to
long-term food security.

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.980
FEMALE SPEAKER: And there is
investigation and connecting

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:49.269
our gut biome with
the biome in the soil.

00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:50.310
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: Exactly.

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:52.826
FEMALE SPEAKER: And we're
really connected to the Earth.

00:29:52.826 --> 00:29:54.700
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: It's
amazing even last year,

00:29:54.700 --> 00:30:01.175
how much I've seen about
the probiotic, prebiotic.

00:30:01.175 --> 00:30:02.550
It's all of that,
but it's funny,

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:05.120
because it's great marketing
for a lot of companies.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:08.700
It's just like eat
healthy, real food.

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:09.720
And you've got it.

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.970
You know what I mean?

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:14.400
But it is funny how we as
consumers are like, wait!

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.580
It's like high fiber, no
GMO, prebiotic something.

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:18.080
OK.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.040
I'll buy it.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.660
Well maybe it's just like
yogurt with fruit in it.

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:23.785
FEMALE SPEAKER: Good point.

00:30:23.785 --> 00:30:26.560
Good point.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:30.810
AUDIENCE: How do you foresee us
balancing the educating adults

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:34.510
who might have children versus
educating children directly.

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:37.034
I remember people-- when I
had economics in high school--

00:30:37.034 --> 00:30:38.450
but people always
said they should

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:41.210
have personal finance should
actually be the class.

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:43.960
Who cares about economics,
what happens to your wallet.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:48.930
We had Home Ec in school, but
we never had food education.

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:51.470
Where's that come into play?

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:53.260
Just teaching adults
and hoping they

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.384
teach their children versus
just teaching the kids.

00:30:55.384 --> 00:30:56.760
FEMALE SPEAKER: You had Home Ec?

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.170
ELLEN GUSTAFSON:
I had Home Ec too.

00:30:58.170 --> 00:30:58.590
FEMALE SPEAKER: Wow.

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.230
I thought that was
dead in the water.

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.710
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: No.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:02.590
Most of what we did
was try to figure out

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:05.580
how to get pasta to
stick to the ceiling.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:07.582
Seriously, that's
definitely what we did.

00:31:07.582 --> 00:31:10.060
And it does work.

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:14.360
It's the right al
dente consistency.

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.350
But no.

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:16.430
I mean, it's interesting.

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:22.277
Cause there's people that are
so focused on kids, kids, kids,

00:31:22.277 --> 00:31:23.110
and then going home.

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:25.822
But then what's sad is if
you're focusing on giving kids

00:31:25.822 --> 00:31:27.780
healthier food in school,
but they won't eat it

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:29.752
because nothing that
they're eating at home

00:31:29.752 --> 00:31:32.210
reflects any of the stuff that's
the healthier school meal.

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:33.280
It's very hard.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.170
They're going to
reject it and then

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:35.610
it's going to look
like a failure.

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:38.294
But the flip side is if parents
are at home banging their head

00:31:38.294 --> 00:31:40.460
against the wall to get
their kids to eat healthier,

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:43.400
but then every week in
their kid's classroom

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.830
is a cupcake party for
someone's birthday,

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:48.990
I mean, it's really
a push pull, right?

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:52.360
But I think what has to
happen, and what did happen,

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:56.590
and what has happened in every
single major culture shift

00:31:56.590 --> 00:32:00.340
is things kind of go
in a demographic wave.

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:07.349
And so I don't foresee that
young parents of my-- not every

00:32:07.349 --> 00:32:09.140
single young parent in
my generation-- yes,

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:10.900
some people still
will take their kids

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.816
regulatory to McDonald's
because they have to.

00:32:12.816 --> 00:32:16.030
Or because it's really the
much more convenient option.

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:20.630
I don't see most young parents
regularly taking their kids

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:21.410
to fast food.

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:24.130
Where as I grew up
going to fast food

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:27.000
not because my mom wasn't
educated about food and health,

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.330
because she didn't realize.

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:30.270
I think that's
where demographics

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.490
are very interesting.

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:36.457
The mom who starts her child
on organic milk and she

00:32:36.457 --> 00:32:37.290
gets it at Wal-Mart.

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:39.640
It's the only thing she can
do, but she's read all about it

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:41.179
and she wants to
do the right thing.

00:32:41.179 --> 00:32:42.970
I don't think that mom
is going to go back.

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:46.360
And in the recession,
that mom didn't go back.

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:48.440
So I kind of see
the demographics

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:51.920
moving and shifting
as we get older

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:56.580
and as we are continuing to be
the more powerful consumers,

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.580
and then our kids grow up behind
that, I actually see the wave

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.810
totally going in
the right direction.

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:04.936
Whereas you know, we who grew
up in the '80s, the wave kind of

00:33:04.936 --> 00:33:06.560
went in the wrong
direction for awhile.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.910
And of course, all
different age groups

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:13.700
are getting interested in
food in a different way.

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.960
I've seen some cool
entrepreneurial projects

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.022
where retirement
communities are being

00:33:19.022 --> 00:33:21.230
built around a central farm
instead of a central golf

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:22.740
course.

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:25.530
Which is much better use
of the land, by the way.

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:28.670
And golf is kind
of boring to me.

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:32.230
But I think that's kind
of a cool response,

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:34.560
that people are
realizing that maybe--

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.530
and actually there's all these
great data about as people age

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:41.880
and if they garden as they age,
they age better and healthier.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.471
So I think there's
an interesting move

00:33:44.471 --> 00:33:45.970
along the entire
spectrum of people,

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:47.600
but really there's
a demographic wave

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:51.330
that-- there's going to be a
generation of kids who doesn't

00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:53.340
grow up assuming that the
Happy Meal is the best

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:54.230
thing in the world.

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:59.085
And that's I think, where the
change will eventually come.

00:33:59.085 --> 00:34:00.710
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
think in the same way

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:06.940
that television commercials are
pointed at kids to get parents

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:13.650
to buy sugared cereal,
if we know the same truth

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:16.100
and we feed the
kids cereal-- I mean

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:18.780
if we feed the kids
quinoa, the kid might

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.380
go home and ask for quinoa.

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:23.000
And ideally, the young
parent will go, oh,

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.469
I'll learn how to make quinoa.

00:34:24.469 --> 00:34:25.560
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: Right.

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:26.850
FEMALE SPEAKER: And I
think that's happening.

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:27.280
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: Yeah.

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:27.949
I really do.

00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:31.110
I really do think
that's happening.

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:33.190
This is where I get frustrated.

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:37.590
A lot of people point to
an elitist element of food.

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:39.880
And it's just not true.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.250
I mean it really--
it's not true.

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:46.570
There are barriers right now,
because the other system,

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:49.880
the system that is, the
structure of our current food

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:51.860
system is highly subsidized.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:57.110
And that makes it harder for the
mom doesn't have as much money

00:34:57.110 --> 00:35:00.610
to just throw her
hands up and say, OK.

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:03.470
Look, let's just go and
get the expedient thing.

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:07.230
But the fact that
Wal-Mart is continuing

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:09.610
to expand its organic
options is showing

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:14.910
that every single group
of people of eaters,

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:18.240
especially in our country,
is learning about this.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.150
People are not dumb.

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:21.360
They might not have as
much financial resources,

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:26.140
but they're not asleep to
the changes that probably

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.902
need to happen for them
and their family's diet.

00:35:28.902 --> 00:35:31.110
And I think that's also
really important to remember,

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:34.930
that it's so easy
to just say, well,

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:37.790
poor people can't
afford organic food.

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:40.642
But poor people couldn't
afford cellphones either,

00:35:40.642 --> 00:35:42.100
until cellphones
were made in a way

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.160
that the system
made it so everybody

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.470
could get a cell phone.

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:47.024
And food has to follow that.

00:35:47.024 --> 00:35:48.440
The entrepreneurs
have to come in,

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.670
the systems have to be
built, the food options

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:51.860
have to be available.

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:53.630
And then everybody
can afford it.

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.970
FEMALE SPEAKER: Wonderful.

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:55.690
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: And the
policies have to change.

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:56.470
Can't forget that.

00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:58.270
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh that.

00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:59.607
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: Yeah.

00:35:59.607 --> 00:36:00.690
FEMALE SPEAKER: Any other?

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.260
AUDIENCE: What do you see
as the most promising policy

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:09.560
directions for making
the good options?

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.810
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: You know
what what's been interesting

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:18.930
is what's now kind of in debate,
but I think the-- especially

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:23.730
at the USDA, there was a great
leader, Kathleen Merrigan, who

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:26.302
was there, and was really
kind of a voice for the more

00:36:26.302 --> 00:36:27.260
sustainable food women.

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:30.350
And the fact that she was
even picked to be at the USDA

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:33.400
in a senior position
was pretty interesting.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.540
Because that's a
pretty radical shift

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:38.410
away from a former Monsanto
executive, which everybody else

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:40.230
around her probably was.

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:44.870
But I think what people have
seen through the first lady's

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:47.260
leadership and the
school food shifts

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:49.910
is actually much bigger
than just school food.

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:52.770
The buying power
and the legislation

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:55.790
around how school food
is purchased really

00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:58.450
has set the tone for a lot of
the rest of our food system.

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:01.200
So an example of
that is that we used

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:05.430
to have rules that a school
district couldn't preference

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:10.920
a local or regional source
for their food supply.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.960
And those rules changed
in the last few years.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.250
So now they can preference
a local or regional source.

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:19.130
Which I mean, is such
a no-brainer, right?

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:21.660
But that big food
service would now say,

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:23.590
oh, I can look to
my local community

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:25.500
and say what are
the farmers growing?

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:28.180
Can I buy that instead of just
whatever the commodity product

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:31.800
is for the DOD fresh offering?

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:36.080
So at that level,
the policy changes

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.260
to help schools
get healthier food

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.420
first of all into
their cafeterias

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:44.470
and then eventually to the
kids, is a pretty big change.

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:46.830
I mean it's not
anywhere near the change

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:49.250
that we need in
school food, but I

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:51.180
think that's a
really interesting--

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:54.419
and it seems like there
are still of course now,

00:37:54.419 --> 00:37:55.460
people are debating this.

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:58.640
And saying, oh parents
should have the choice.

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.720
The choice argument
is so ridiculous,

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.960
because there's no
choice whether subsidies.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.700
It's a completely false
choice because everyone

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:11.300
is very influenced by the
pricing differentials.

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.390
But I do think that the fact
that some movement in school

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:16.790
food has been able
to be successful

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:20.030
is a very big indication
that people are recognizing

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:23.200
that these changes
are going to happen.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:27.190
And they need to happen.

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:29.790
FEMALE SPEAKER: What's the one
thing that could trip us up?

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:31.600
You're saying this
wave is happening,

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.644
the demographics are right,
but what's our vulnerability?

00:38:34.644 --> 00:38:36.560
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: I think
our big vulnerability

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:42.190
is just how in deep we've
gotten with monocultures

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:44.650
of very few crops.

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:47.010
Corn, soy, wheat, cotton.

00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:49.990
Kind of sums it up.

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:51.740
FEMALE SPEAKER: And
one variety of each.

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:52.615
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: Yes.

00:38:52.615 --> 00:38:53.290
Exactly.

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:55.030
Exactly.

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:56.640
At leasf of soy and corn.

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:59.910
The GMO version of those crops.

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:04.540
The power that that
one variety of one crop

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:09.130
now has in our food
system is just insane.

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:13.230
But what's interesting, I
frame the ethanol debate

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:15.320
in terms of answering
this question

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:19.530
that we've been so
good at growing corn.

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:21.840
Farmers were told, grow
corn fence row to fence row.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:22.609
And they did it.

00:39:22.609 --> 00:39:25.150
Which by the way, means that if
you tell them something else,

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:26.484
they can do that too.

00:39:26.484 --> 00:39:27.900
American farmers
are really smart,

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:30.290
entrepreneurial,
hardworking people.

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:34.380
Whatever we the eaters ask
them to grow, they'll grow.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:36.690
But what they've been asked
to grow is tons of corn.

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:40.690
And when corn has fallen out
of favor maybe in soft drinks,

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:43.360
or in people are eating
more grass-fed meat,

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:46.860
or whatever the shifts
are, we find uses for it,

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:48.790
instead of thinking
well maybe we

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:50.470
should just stop
growing so much corn.

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:51.640
We've put it in our cars.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:55.060
We send it overseas more
and more to hungry kids

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:55.960
or to other markets.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:59.130
And it's not just the
global marketplace at work,

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:02.057
it's subsidies at work,
and it's us finding ways

00:40:02.057 --> 00:40:03.640
for these very few
crops because we're

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.370
so dependent on this system.

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:07.590
Instead of us saying, let's
just shift the system.

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:09.680
And that's I think
the biggest fear,

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.310
is that there won't
ever be enough

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:13.280
political will to
fight the entrenched

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.450
power of that system,
and get farmers to really

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:18.900
have the ability to shift
what they're growing,

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:22.720
and make real money and a
living growing other things that

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:23.930
are healthier.

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:25.870
FEMALE SPEAKER: So mono
cropping and growing

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:28.130
on unbelievable scales.

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:29.040
Just huge.

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:29.956
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: Huge.

00:40:29.956 --> 00:40:32.610
I mean, and just these few
crops that are literally

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:36.037
dominating our diet and the
global diet in such a big way.

00:40:36.037 --> 00:40:38.120
And the power that that
brings to those companies.

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.740
So that's why part
of my argument

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:44.860
is that disempowering those
few stakeholders by not buying

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:50.790
those crops is a way to shift
the balance of power, at least.

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:54.034
It's very small at first,
but it has to happen,

00:40:54.034 --> 00:40:55.450
because if we don't
pull money out

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:57.190
of those industries,
the industries who

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:58.020
are going to have
the most money,

00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:00.294
they're going to be the
largest force in Washington.

00:41:00.294 --> 00:41:01.544
AUDIENCE: I've got a question.

00:41:01.544 --> 00:41:05.508
So I'm surprised that you
said our food choices aren't

00:41:05.508 --> 00:41:06.008
the problem.

00:41:06.008 --> 00:41:11.464
The reason we grow so much corn
and soy is to feed the animals.

00:41:11.464 --> 00:41:15.928
And that with meat requiring
20 times as much protein

00:41:15.928 --> 00:41:19.896
from plants to make protein
for meat, with that 20 to 1

00:41:19.896 --> 00:41:23.790
multiplier effect,
I don't see how,

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:29.050
unless we change our eating
habits to shift away from meat,

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:33.532
we can have a sustainable--
enough to feed the whole world.

00:41:33.532 --> 00:41:35.815
I think even if we
ate what Americans

00:41:35.815 --> 00:41:39.501
think of as a healthy diet, the
world couldn't eat that way.

00:41:39.501 --> 00:41:40.501
There's not enough land.

00:41:40.501 --> 00:41:42.751
Even is it's grass-fed, and
that takes even more land.

00:41:42.751 --> 00:41:49.110
So I think that there really
are some fundamental issues

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:53.432
with a meat-based diet
that have to be looked at.

00:41:53.432 --> 00:41:55.640
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: I don't
argue that at all, actually.

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:59.130
What I argue is that
choice is not the issue.

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:00.890
Because American
consumers are being

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:05.350
told that you can
have the choice

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:07.210
to buy a $0.99 hamburger.

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:11.340
When we agree-- I'm sure--
that that's not realistic.

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:13.500
A hamburger doesn't
actually cost $0.99.

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:14.540
It can't.

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:17.634
If you actually added
in the real cost

00:42:17.634 --> 00:42:19.550
of growing all that corn,
the real cost of all

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:21.110
the petrochemicals
that are involved,

00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:24.690
the real cost of
the drugs it takes

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:28.350
to keep the animals alive, the
real cost of the transportation

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:30.850
to get the animal back and forth
to all the different places

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:32.690
it goes before it
gets to your plate.

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:36.710
That's not built into the cost,
therefore it's a false choice.

00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:40.220
It's letting people think that
we can eat meat at this level

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:42.235
from an economic
perspective, and we can't.

00:42:42.235 --> 00:42:43.110
You're exactly right.

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:45.760
We can't eat the amount
of meat that we eat

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:50.090
and the way we eat it without
high levels of subsidies going

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:54.680
into these products from
so many different places.

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:58.420
And so what I'm arguing is
that if the consumer saw

00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:01.220
the real price of
that meat, we actually

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:03.790
couldn't afford to
eat it every day.

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:06.410
And therefore, we
would eat less of it,

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:07.690
and we'd eat better quality.

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:09.065
And therefore,
the rest the world

00:43:09.065 --> 00:43:12.380
wouldn't be sold down the
river that you can produce meat

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:15.550
in this way, and all these
hamburgers just overflowing

00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:16.990
from McDonald's
every single day.

00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:19.990
Or whatever other
places there are.

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:22.470
I think I'm looking at
it from the perspective

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:25.630
that if we the
consumer, we the eater,

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:29.060
knew really what the
cost of that burger was,

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:32.790
we couldn't choose to
have it as often as we do.

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:35.880
And then our eating habits, of
course, would have to change,

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:36.954
and would change.

00:43:36.954 --> 00:43:39.120
Because that would mean
that our diets would reflect

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:43.100
more of what makes rational
sense from what we can grow

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.310
and what we can afford.

00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:50.590
So yeah, it's sad
that we're coming

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:53.630
to this place from
a health perspective

00:43:53.630 --> 00:44:01.230
now after we've sold China, and
Brazil, and India, and Africa,

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:05.540
and all these other
population rich places

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:07.960
with our diet and our systems.

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.437
Now all the sudden we're
coming to this realization

00:44:10.437 --> 00:44:11.020
that, oh wait.

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.790
Maybe this diet and the
system doesn't work very well.

00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:17.600
And so if you look at
the data, Americans

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.880
are actually eating less meat.

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:20.630
But I mean, right.

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:21.755
It's not a dramatic change.

00:44:21.755 --> 00:44:25.400
But it's a downward slope.

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:28.770
And it's a shame that we've
been pushing the upward slope

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:31.560
to everybody else before
we kind of realized this.

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:35.360
But I do think that
if we radically

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:39.430
change-- if Americans
wake up to these issues

00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:41.340
and really change
the type of meat

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:43.850
that we eat, the quantities
in which we eat it,

00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:47.940
we don't waste it, we change
the way our meat is produced,

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:50.480
and we have a little bit more
concern for the environmental,

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:54.630
and also the humanitarian
and animal welfare elements

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:58.060
of the way we've been producing
meat, that has the ability

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:01.760
to radically change the
way we Americans eat meat.

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.369
The hope is can that
then be reflected

00:45:04.369 --> 00:45:06.660
in the global marketplace
and how the rest of the world

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:07.910
eats meat also.

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:11.700
Just pulling our money, and
we are pulling our money away

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:15.060
from that system, by not
buying corn-based products

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:20.780
in the same way, by not
buying-- buying soda helps feed

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:22.170
into that system.

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:23.930
I mean it's so interconnected.

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:27.510
Buying high fructose
corn syrup Concorde jelly

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:29.990
instead of a real jam
feeds into that system.

00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:31.840
So it's amazing
how interconnected

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:33.720
and how expansive it is.

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:37.600
But I would say that if
we look at the system

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:44.750
and we say, where can I remove
my lobbying dollars from that

00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:48.620
system-- the powers
that be, that I think

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:50.670
is the way that the
consumer can help break

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:54.240
the stranglehold on
Washington and on policies

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.470
that these very
few interests have.

00:45:56.470 --> 00:46:00.760
And so I would argue that you
get people from the health,

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.680
from the personal,
from the community,

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:07.040
from the "my jeans don't fit,"
and then you can bring them

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.340
to-- oh, the reason
for all of this.

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:11.590
The reason we've gone so far
off the rails, the reason

00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:14.690
that we now have this raging
obesity crisis that literally

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:17.414
didn't exist before, is
because of this system.

00:46:17.414 --> 00:46:18.330
And here's the system.

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:19.450
And here's the players.

00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:20.812
And here's how we change it.

00:46:20.812 --> 00:46:22.020
And call your congressperson.

00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:27.030
One thing I've
been frustrated by,

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:30.980
especially working
on global aid issues,

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:34.450
is you've got a lot of people
that really mean well and care

00:46:34.450 --> 00:46:36.320
about helping to
feed the hungry,

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:39.280
but then I would argue eat
in a way that perpetuates

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.150
the systems that
keep people hungry.

00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:43.460
A great example
of that is eating

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:48.410
the typical cheap bananas
and coffee and sugar

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:53.540
that we all eat every
day really hurts

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:56.430
some of the largest
populations of hungry people

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:58.750
that are right to our
south that then end up

00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:01.080
becoming immigrants.

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:03.540
Honduras and Guatemala are
places that grow our food.

00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:05.290
We want them to
grow our food cheap.

00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:07.480
We don't want to pay them
real prices for that food.

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:09.530
We get pissed that
they or their kids

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:11.131
are coming in and
immigrating here.

00:47:11.131 --> 00:47:13.630
And then we go to Washington
to bitch about the immigration,

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:15.110
instead of saying,
let's actually

00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:17.150
look at this whole system
here and realize that,

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:20.980
maybe if we actually paid a
fair price for all the hard work

00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:24.630
that these people are
doing to grow our food,

00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:27.270
and a realistic system is set
up where people can actually

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:32.010
be compensated for all of
this incredible variety

00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:33.679
that we have in
our supermarkets,

00:47:33.679 --> 00:47:36.220
maybe then we wouldn't have the
downstream political effects.

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:37.595
And I think that's
the same thing

00:47:37.595 --> 00:47:43.230
we need to come to with the big
picture food policy issues too.

00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:46.520
Until people realize that
there are only four major meat

00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:47.620
companies.

00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:51.010
One dairy company controls
40% of the dairy market,

00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:54.210
including a huge chunk
of the organic market.

00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:56.250
Until people realize
that, we're not

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:59.110
going to get them to
understand what that means

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:01.660
when they call their
congressperson.

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:05.650
So I'm certainly
arguing that we've

00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:08.950
got to get the dollars to shift.

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:12.630
And I know that there are
also amazing organizations

00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:14.290
and people that
are totally focused

00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:16.550
on the high-level
political shifts too.

00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:18.270
But we have to pull
the dollars out.

00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:20.710
We can't just say, hey,
Congressperson change,

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:22.570
until we pull the dollars out.

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:23.330
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Thank you so much.

00:48:23.330 --> 00:48:23.870
ELLEN GUSTAFSON: Thank you.

00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:24.750
FEMALE SPEAKER:
For being with us.

00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:26.600
ELLEN GUSTAFSON:
Thanks for having me.
