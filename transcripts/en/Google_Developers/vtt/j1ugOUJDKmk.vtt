REBECCA CHAVEZ: Welcome back, or
welcome to the second session.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.370
The last talk we're
going to do today

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.790
is Getting Code Out the Door.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.720
It's a panel discussion,
as you can see,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.630
so we're really hoping
that it can be interactive,

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.010
and we're really going to be
looking for your involvement,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.900
questions and answers.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.980
But first, please allow me
to make a public service

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.250
announcement.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.220
Next Wednesday,
March 12 at 6:00 PM,

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.900
there's going to be a
Google Developer group,

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.190
another panel discussion.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.870
It's going to be here
on Google Campus,

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.410
it's open to the public.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.190
For more details,
there's a website,

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.290
you can just google
Google Developer Group.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.060
Van in the back has
some details on it.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.870
He's a program manager with
our Developer Relations team.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.700
I also have the details,
so if anyone's interested,

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.740
look for one of us
afterwards or google it.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.510
OK.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.700
Cool.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.550
Again, hi.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.670
Some of you have seen
me all afternoon.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.790
I'm almost done.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.380
My name, again,
is Rebecca Chavez,

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.720
I'm a technical program manager.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.537
Here on the panel
we have Subha--

00:01:17.537 --> 00:01:18.870
I knew this was going to get me.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.190
SUBHA SUBRAMANIAN: Subramanian.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.023
REBECCA CHAVEZ: Mhm.

00:01:20.023 --> 00:01:21.000
Thank you.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
She's a product manager.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.560
We have Anya Kogan, she is
an interaction designer.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.190
We have Irene Chung,
SWE, Software Engineer

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.700
here at Google, a
software engineer lead.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.220
So we'll get to hear from her.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.600
Sabrina Williams, she's a
software engineer in test,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.030
she's going to talk to
us about what she does.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.260
And then Sabrina Farmer, and
she is another engineering

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.780
lead here on our SRE team.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.079
And so the general idea of
getting code out the door,

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.620
we're going to make
it pretty simple.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.280
We're just going to talk
about a very general pipeline.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.180
Again, I mentioned
some of the roles here.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.970
The ladies will
go into what they

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.320
do more specifically, but
just to give you a high level.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.970
Subha's role, the
product manager,

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.480
it's really the strategic
aspect of Product.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.770
Understanding user
requirements, helping prioritize

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.330
feature development.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.000
Anya then makes it the
best experience ever.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.040
So her team really works
closely with Product team

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.910
to get the right visuals or
get the right user experience.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.890
Irene, then, her groups are
where the rubber gets the road.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.830
They codify it, they
code that experience.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.040
Sabrina's groups, they
make sure that when

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.980
you are launching
this code, you're not,

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.790
in the process, breaking
somebody else's code.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.200
They build out the test
suites, and the tooling,

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.120
and the framework to
make sure that when

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.300
you launch the feature it's
going to work as you expect it.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.590
And then Sabrina Farmer,
her groups just make it run.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.610
There's a lot of unique
challenges to Google's scale

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.470
and complexity, and
Sabrina's team really

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.020
are the guardians in Production
and making sure that that code,

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.530
once it's out there, it's
healthy and running well.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.110
Oh, and I'm a program manager.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.130
I get the opportunity
of working with all

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.070
of these different phases, and
it's not like serial at all,

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.820
this pipeline.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.710
It's very iterative and
we have an opportunity

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.700
to work across, not in this
kind of cyclical idea of product

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.930
development.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.440
Yes, I get to work with all
of these really amazing women.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.280
So I'm going to turn it over
and let these ladies introduce

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.640
themselves and talk a
bit more about their role

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.550
in getting code out the door.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.986
And then we will
go to questions.

00:04:03.986 --> 00:04:05.860
SUBHA SUBRAMANIAN: Hi,
I'm Subha Subramanian,

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.710
and I'm a product
manager at Google.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.180
Specifically, I work on Google+.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.460
My role is to
basically work on all

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.524
of the data that is
created in the stream

00:04:16.524 --> 00:04:18.440
and then share it across
other Google products

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.070
and with third parties.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.920
I have been at Google
for eight years now,

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.550
and I've worked in a
couple different capacities

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.870
at Google, as a web developer,
and then as a UI designer,

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.540
and I'm now a product manager.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.540
As a product
manager I definitely

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.670
have to come up with a
strategy for my product,

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.347
and then help prioritize a whole
bunch of different problems

00:04:39.347 --> 00:04:41.430
that we could be trying
to solve with the product.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.470
Then see which one of those
we could attack first,

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.440
which ones are feasible
to do, and which

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.450
ones we need to put
on the back burner.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.200
I end up working with
all of these ladies,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.310
and as Rebecca mentioned, it's
not usually typically like,

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.080
first I come up with an idea,
and then I go talk to Anya.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.964
Ideas come from a lot
of different places.

00:05:00.964 --> 00:05:02.380
Sometimes Eng comes
up with ideas,

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.171
sometimes our users
come up with the ideas,

00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:07.190
or we get a mandate
from leadership

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.600
like, this is the direction
we should be going in.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.132
Then we'll kind of
think about, OK,

00:05:11.132 --> 00:05:12.840
if this is the direction
we need to go in

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.310
or if this is the
problem we need to solve,

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.860
what is the right
strategy to do that?

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.234
How do we get
that, and how do we

00:05:17.234 --> 00:05:20.190
do it for the short
term and the long term.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.440
I also end up working
with a lot of other folks

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.400
who are not
represented here, folks

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.930
who are in security, privacy,
legal teams, et cetera.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.781
I'll let you talk.

00:05:33.781 --> 00:05:36.410
ANYA KOGAN: I'm Anya, I'm
the user experience designer,

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.520
and my job is to take
the product or business

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.070
strategy that someone like
Subha would have come up with

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.800
and, with that in
mind, go and talk

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.140
to all the various people
who might be using a product.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.630
So in my case, I
work for AdWords,

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.430
I've worked for AdWords
for two and a half years.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.510
It's our main
advertising platform

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.550
where businesses use to sell
their products and services.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.190
So I will talk to
those businesses,

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.520
I will talk to the
people using AdWords,

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.103
and get a better
understanding of what

00:06:05.103 --> 00:06:06.880
their needs and behaviors are.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.360
Then with that in
mind, I create mockups,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.020
I might create prototypes
using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.830
That's about as far
as I get into code.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.630
I'll let the rest of these
ladies handle the rest of that,

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.480
and I often partner with
a Tech Lead or a SWE

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.080
to help guide me in
understanding what

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.460
the constraints are
of the platform.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.460
AdWords in particular
is extremely complex

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.420
and I need to be aware
of what's possible.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.600
Also, by partnering
with Engineering,

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.570
I get a chance to learn about
everything that's possible

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.540
and all the technical
innovation that I

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.190
could put into my designs.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.030
Then I hand those designs
over to an engineer,

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.770
and then we work
closely together

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.182
to ensure the quality
of o product design.

00:06:53.182 --> 00:06:54.390
IRENE CHUNG: Hello everybody.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.630
My name is Irene, and
I'm a software engineer,

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:58.797
a technical lead, and a
manager on the Google+ team.

00:06:58.797 --> 00:07:01.004
I've been at Google for
about seven and a half years,

00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:03.100
and I previously also
worked on AdSense, Buzz,

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.856
and Google Calendar.

00:07:04.856 --> 00:07:06.230
The role of the
software engineer

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.604
is actually to really focus
on building the right product

00:07:08.604 --> 00:07:10.710
and getting that shipped
at the right time.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.700
So a lot of our work,
we work very closely

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.900
with product and user
experience experts

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.430
to make sure we're defining
the right experience together.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.759
A lot of it is a balancing
act in terms of making sure

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:24.300
that what we're building is the
right technical solution that

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.620
scales properly
and is extendable,

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.720
but also something that
we can get to users very,

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.264
very quickly.

00:07:29.264 --> 00:07:30.680
And on the other
side, we also get

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.164
to work with the Production
folk, so test engineering,

00:07:33.164 --> 00:07:35.580
also release engineering and
site reliability engineering,

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.820
and just making sure
that we have the latest

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.990
best practices in place.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.140
That is pretty much
impervious to anything

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.166
that the world can throw at us.

00:07:45.166 --> 00:07:47.130
SABRINA WILLIAMS: Hi,
I am Sabrina Williams,

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.380
I am a software
engineer in test.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.560
I've been at Google for
two and a half years now.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.660
I'm on the Glass team,
but before that, I

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.674
was on Chrome working on
something called Cloud Print.

00:07:57.674 --> 00:07:59.590
So I'm actually going
to take this opportunity

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.214
to explain a couple
of different roles,

00:08:01.214 --> 00:08:03.190
because people think
they're the same thing.

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.980
We have two roles called Test
Engineer and Software Engineer

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:06.960
in Test.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.501
A test engineer is more
of your typical Q--

00:08:11.501 --> 00:08:14.000
I won't even say typical QA,
but it's more like your QA type

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.030
role where they're in
charge of the test plans,

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.420
they do work in
automating tests,

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.920
they're the user
advocate, they make

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.220
sure that what they decide
the product is supposed to do,

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.947
the test engineer makes
sure it actually does that.

00:08:26.947 --> 00:08:28.780
The software engineer
in test, I think of it

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.760
more as a productivity engineer.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.330
We help make everybody
else more productive.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:37.037
We create frameworks,
if a test engineer

00:08:37.037 --> 00:08:39.120
is trying to figure out
how to automate something,

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.100
we'll help them figure
out how to do that.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.069
If the software engineers
are figuring out

00:08:43.069 --> 00:08:44.610
how to design their
code so that it's

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:46.170
more maintainable
long-term, we'll

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:49.740
help them figure
out how to do that.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.100
We are very focused on
quality and making sure

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.330
that the development environment
produces quality code

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.190
at the end of the day.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.316
So that's pretty much what I do.

00:09:00.316 --> 00:09:02.350
SABRINA FARMER: And
I am Sabrina Farmer,

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:05.240
and I am a site reliability
engineer here at Google.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.080
I've been at Google,
now, for nine years,

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.260
I think in two days or
something like that.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.590
SUBHA SUBRAMANIAN:
Happy anniversary.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.920
SABRINA FARMER: Site
reliability at Google

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.520
is essentially a peer team
with the software engineers,

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.470
but our focus is
on the production

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:23.170
side of running
the product, which

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.640
includes failover and
includes capacity management

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.870
and performance of the products.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:32.640
We're often the first
responders to issues

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.990
when they are identified, either
with scaling or difficulties

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.500
in the infrastructure.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:44.930
What we do is we work with
each of these different parts

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:48.420
of engineering to, at the
early stage, when the product

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.070
managers say hey,
we want to do this,

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.980
we explain the speed of
light, which is often

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.774
required with the new features
that they want to add.

00:09:56.774 --> 00:09:59.190
Then we work with the software
engineers during the design

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.140
phase to make sure
they understand

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.890
the infrastructure
that they're running on

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:05.270
and some of the limitations
of that infrastructure

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:06.570
so they can work around that.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.990
Site reliability is about 50% of
software engineers, 50% systems

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.890
engineers, and so we often
have to build the systems that

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.500
would mitigate the
different kinds of failures.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.130
So how users are
distributed globally,

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:25.590
that's often something
that the SREs will develop.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:29.570
So that's the kind
of engineering we do.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:31.410
REBECCA CHAVEZ: Great.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.820
So Irene, she touched
on it a little bit,

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:37.110
of the balancing act
that is engineering.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.930
And I was curious if we could
quickly go through maybe

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.670
what are some trade-offs
in your role that you see,

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:47.730
like getting code
out the door, what

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.890
are the constraints or the
trade-offs that you have

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:55.060
to make when either you're
forced to get something out

00:10:55.060 --> 00:11:02.537
by x date or maybe a major
bug fix, something like that.

00:11:02.537 --> 00:11:04.120
So maybe some
trade-offs that you guys

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:08.314
do when you're getting
code out the door.

00:11:08.314 --> 00:11:10.480
SABRINA FARMER: I think for
SREs, some of the things

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.020
that we have to often work
with the different teams

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.710
on-- because they really care
about the velocity of getting

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:17.620
things out the
door-- and when you

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:21.280
work on a product
like GMail, you're

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.540
going to instantly hit
millions and millions of users

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:25.760
all at one time.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.850
So we often have to put controls
in front of the releases

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.180
that they want to
do, and phase it out.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.030
So we put a lot of
limitations on what they do

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:39.560
and how often we want it-- how
slowly it needs to roll out,

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.300
and things like that.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.830
They're driving towards
getting it out the door

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:45.690
as soon as possible,
we're doing it

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.990
so that we want to minimize the
impact to the user or the risk

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:51.300
to the user.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.010
We often compromise on that.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.260
IRENE CHUNG: I would also
add that trade-offs are just

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.260
kind of a fact of life.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.890
It's just something that
you have to be prepared for.

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:01.850
What we try to do when
we look at trade-offs

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:05.280
is make informed,
intentioned trade-offs.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.260
So actually looking at what are
the reasons why we're actually

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.620
doing something, what is the
right path to the long term

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.870
ideal, and then what are the
right increments that you

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:15.161
can do quickly to meet any
sort of demands or deadlines

00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:16.210
that need to happen.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.168
As long as they're made
with informed intention

00:12:18.168 --> 00:12:21.390
and you have a path to the ideal
solution, they're usually OK.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:25.625
But it's just something
that we work through.

00:12:25.625 --> 00:12:26.940
REBECCA CHAVEZ: Anyone else?

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.356
SUBHA SUBRAMANIAN:
Well, I mean, I

00:12:28.356 --> 00:12:30.190
can add that
sometimes we may need

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:33.000
to leave certain
features out if we're not

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.745
able to make those
part of the release.

00:12:35.745 --> 00:12:37.370
So that's one of the
trade-offs that we

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:40.532
may be making sometimes.

00:12:40.532 --> 00:12:42.870
REBECCA CHAVEZ: OK.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:46.890
Anybody from the audience have
any questions about the roles,

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.920
or maybe some of the challenges?

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:51.990
Yes, please.

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:53.610
AUDIENCE: You didn't
say what you did.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:54.901
REBECCA CHAVEZ: Oh, sorry, yes.

00:12:54.901 --> 00:12:56.370
So I'm a technical
program manager,

00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:01.480
and I usually describe
that as a project manager.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:07.060
So I get engaged in efforts
that can be very large in scope,

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.350
from across Google,
and coordinating

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:13.970
many different engineering
teams or functional areas,

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:17.620
to something maybe more intimate
and specific, working maybe

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:22.540
with Engineering.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.715
Like a specific team for
either a feature launch

00:13:24.715 --> 00:13:28.010
or optimizing their velocity.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:34.440
So the TPM role at Google
is, in my opinion, I love it.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:38.390
There's a lot of opportunity
to apply different skills

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.250
at different times.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:40.755
And then, of course,
you get to work

00:13:40.755 --> 00:13:42.670
with all of these cool people.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.000
We have, also, a mic.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.400
So if anyone doesn't hear the
question, we'll repeat it.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.595
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:13:51.595 --> 00:13:53.470
I have a question for
the software engineers.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.500
How quickly or how regularly
do deployments happen,

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.170
and how does that affect a
timeline of releasing new

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:01.191
features out on
the Google+ team.

00:14:01.191 --> 00:14:01.940
IRENE CHUNG: Sure.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.400
So on the Google+ team, we
actually developed a method

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.000
of releasing code to production
every single business day.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.580
This is unprecedented at
Google, previous to that

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.590
I believe the record
holder was Gmail, which

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:13.714
managed to get the production
release schedule down

00:14:13.714 --> 00:14:14.520
to once a week.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.353
Then we sort of stole
their release engineer

00:14:16.353 --> 00:14:17.610
because he's awesome.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.580
We basically gave
him all the resources

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.380
he needed and said
make this better.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.870
Do what you can to make
this absolutely awesome,

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:26.910
so we can get features to our
users as quickly as possible.

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:29.530
So it's actually a really
interesting process.

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:31.540
I would say that
everybody's involved,

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.520
so there are a core set
of release engineers

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.720
who are responsible for making
sure the thing ships every day.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.330
But we have an
on-call rotation that

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.650
includes software
engineering, it includes test,

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:43.630
it includes all other
aspects of the pipeline

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.840
to make sure that you're really
aggressive about rolling back

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.000
code that is broken.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.729
Instead of saying
slowly debug the error,

00:14:49.729 --> 00:14:51.520
when you have hundreds
of engineers writing

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.130
into a single code base, look
at what is the root cause,

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:56.380
roll that back, and then you
can roll it forward again

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.470
with the correct fix.

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:58.980
That way, we have
a clean cut that

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.740
goes to production
every single day.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.660
We usually also have a different
test build every single day

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.930
that test is working with.

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:08.750
So we have this very clean
pipeline that goes through,

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.740
and each day we make
sure it happens.

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:14.520
I think we've only missed maybe
two releases or something.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:15.420
I'm not sure.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.491
It's some very small
single digit number.

00:15:17.491 --> 00:15:18.990
SABRINA FARMER: I
think people often

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:22.491
think that releasing more
frequently adds a lot of risk,

00:15:22.491 --> 00:15:22.990
right?

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:25.150
But it actually takes
away a lot of risk,

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.750
because you're not
releasing something

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:30.840
that has hundreds of
features all at one time that

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:34.090
are trying to work together,
and then you have a problem

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:36.260
and you have to figure
out exactly what happened.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.490
So releasing more
often is actually

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:40.355
mitigating your
risk to your users.

00:15:43.941 --> 00:15:45.040
REBECCA CHAVEZ: Great.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.730
Let's see, here.

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:47.980
Oh yeah, a question over here.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.021
We've got the mic, sorry.

00:15:49.021 --> 00:15:50.800
AUDIENCE: I have a
question for Subha.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.420
You mentioned that you moved
from an engineering role

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:54.920
to a product management role.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.570
What were the sort
of skills that you

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.030
had to learn as you
moved into this new role,

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:02.680
and how did you help
a product move out

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:07.050
or the code move out of the
door by learning these skills?

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:08.580
SUBHA SUBRAMANIAN:
I think what I

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.155
had to learn was I needed
to kind of come out of this,

00:16:11.155 --> 00:16:12.530
like, I'm going
to sit at my desk

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:16.310
and do my role, versus
learning a little bit more

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:20.030
about what are the problems
and learn to prioritize

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.280
those problems better and
say, which of these are

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.170
more meaningful to tackle first.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:27.560
So get my head out of the
part that I was focused on

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.630
and think broadly
across the product.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:32.848
And what is the second part
of your question, I'm sorry?

00:16:32.848 --> 00:16:35.817
AUDIENCE: It's just how
have these skills helped you

00:16:35.817 --> 00:16:37.150
in getting code out of the door?

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.233
SUBHA SUBRAMANIAN: How
have these skills helped me

00:16:39.233 --> 00:16:40.550
in getting code out the door.

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:43.490
So like I mentioned in the
beginning, a lot of my work

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:46.090
is actually acting as liaison
between the different teams

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:47.220
that I work with.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.246
So product management
is definitely not like,

00:16:49.246 --> 00:16:50.745
I'm not the one
writing all the code

00:16:50.745 --> 00:16:52.680
and getting things out the door.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.630
I think my part
is to actually be

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.650
an evangelist for the
product and to keep

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:01.210
selling the product, both to
people in upper management

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:02.960
and kind of saying,
hey, this is a feature

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.920
that needs to go out the
door, this will really

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.780
have this impact
on this product.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.930
But also to sell it
to everybody else.

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.477
For example to Anya,
who says, but how

00:17:11.477 --> 00:17:12.810
is this going to help our users?

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.300
Right, because that's going
to be her first question.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:20.160
And so kind of get buyoff from
people on what we are building,

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.150
and to then get it
through the [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:24.556
so we can get it out the door.

00:17:24.556 --> 00:17:25.896
Sure.

00:17:25.896 --> 00:17:27.270
REBECCA CHAVEZ:
All right, sorry.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.870
IRENE CHUNG: I
think microphones.

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:30.510
REBECCA CHAVEZ: Yeah, sorry,
we'll get to everyone.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:33.990
AUDIENCE: So do you have any
advice for smaller companies

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:36.930
that maybe don't have
the resources to have

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.690
teams and teams of
highly talented people?

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.300
Are there things that
maybe can be streamlined

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.380
in the process, in the pipeline,
getting started to build up

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:48.632
an organization with
that sort of resource?

00:17:48.632 --> 00:17:51.090
SUBHA SUBRAMANIAN: Sorry, was
your question directed at me?

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:51.799
AUDIENCE: Oh, no.

00:17:51.799 --> 00:17:53.048
SUBHA SUBRAMANIAN: In general.

00:17:53.048 --> 00:17:54.250
REBECCA CHAVEZ: In general.

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.690
Would anyone like to--

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:56.740
SABRINA WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.260
One thing I would
say for sure is

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.620
to make sure that you take
advantage of open source tools.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.040
Anything from a continuous
build environment,

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.990
to project tracking tools,
to bug tracking tools,

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.200
using automated test
framework-- first of all,

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.970
anything you can automate
will help save you manpower

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.900
because you don't have
to have manual testers,

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.691
and don't have to pay
them to manually test

00:18:19.691 --> 00:18:21.380
your stuff if it's
automated, and you

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.250
can run it continuously.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.810
So setting those sorts
of systems up early

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:29.292
is really, really helpful.

00:18:29.292 --> 00:18:31.770
ANYA KOGAN: And I can
also add that if it's

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:35.670
a user-facing tool or feature or
product that you're working on,

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.680
just go and talk to people who
will be using your product as

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.660
soon as possible,
even if you don't know

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.395
exactly what questions
to ask or don't

00:18:42.395 --> 00:18:43.520
know the process to follow.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.910
Just talking to them and
telling them what you're doing,

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:48.490
you'll already get a lot
of feedback and insight,

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:51.566
and better get that
earlier rather than later.

00:18:51.566 --> 00:18:54.360
REBECCA CHAVEZ: And I would
also just quickly add,

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:58.420
general framework, keeping
things light and adaptable.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.840
So not really going
in and prescribing

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:06.080
any sort of process, but
really looking at the workflow

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.040
and figuring out, OK, maybe this
is where we can tweak it a bit

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.320
to make it a little easier.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:17.527
That would just be seconding
all the other comments there.

00:19:17.527 --> 00:19:19.110
ANYA KOGAN: It looks
like she's been--

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.972
SUBHA SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah.

00:19:20.972 --> 00:19:23.810
AUDIENCE: After being
here for a whole day

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:27.090
and seeing so many women,
I feel like girls really

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:30.500
do run the world, or
maybe women run the world.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.000
Or maybe even that
women run Google,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.290
but I know that may
not be the case.

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:40.200
What is it like working
here, what challenges

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.840
did you face to get here
and work here every day,

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.100
and are women running
Google or having

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:51.810
a serious impact on
Google and the way that it

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:53.280
seems right now.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.490
Because it just seems
like there are no men.

00:19:55.490 --> 00:20:00.474
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:00.474 --> 00:20:01.390
REBECCA CHAVEZ: Great.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:05.530
Well, there certainly
are men at Google,

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:10.370
but Google is very
interested in women

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:13.350
in leadership and
diversity of the workforce.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:18.650
So I think we all probably have
different experiences, but also

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:19.680
similar experiences.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.950
That I feel, as a woman at
Google, I'm very supported.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:29.370
And as Kimber mentioned, if
you are there and believing

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:34.080
in yourself to go do it, really
I don't see any restrictions.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.460
Certainly not at Google.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.030
SUBHA SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah.

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:38.113
I want to add that I
mentioned that I've been here

00:20:38.113 --> 00:20:42.530
for eight years, and it's only
I think in the last two or three

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.840
years I have noticed that
when I go into meeting rooms,

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.760
I'm no longer the
sole woman there.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:50.270
In fact, I worked on the display
ads team prior to coming onto

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:52.552
the Google+ team, and I've
worked with Anya before.

00:20:52.552 --> 00:20:54.010
There was actually
meeting in which

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:57.370
there were eight women, three
of whom were technical leads,

00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.965
Anya was representing UX,
there was a tech editor

00:21:00.965 --> 00:21:03.090
who was a woman, and there
were no men in the room.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:05.990
And we all just went
like, what happened here?

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:08.800
And we have a lot of mentoring
programs for women too.

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.530
And I know Sabrina is
on quite a few of those,

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:13.154
she was just mentioning
to me earlier.

00:21:13.154 --> 00:21:15.355
SABRINA WILLIAMS: Yeah,
golly, where to start?

00:21:15.355 --> 00:21:16.512
SABRINA FARMER: Both of us.

00:21:16.512 --> 00:21:17.095
Both Sabrinas.

00:21:17.095 --> 00:21:19.270
SABRINA WILLIAMS: Both Sabrinas.

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:20.940
One thing I'll add
is that I think

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:24.590
this is a really great
company for two reasons.

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:26.670
One reason is because we
have a lot of programs

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:31.130
that are supporting
any sort of minority,

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:34.100
either women, or
a racial minority,

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.240
or gender orientation,
all that kind of stuff.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.910
So it's really nice that
we support those things,

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:43.040
but it's also really
neat because when you're

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.140
part of Google, and get
to be a part of supporting

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.290
those things, and it
actually supports yourself

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:49.630
in a weird way.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:51.620
I've actually become
much more comfortable

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:53.700
as a black female
engineer since I've

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:57.570
been here because of all of
the things that Google does.

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:00.166
I don't want to get into a big
list of those sorts of things,

00:22:00.166 --> 00:22:02.040
but I'd be happy to talk
to anyone afterwards

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:06.360
who wants to find out more
about programs that we have.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.350
AUDIENCE: Hi, my question
is for Subha and Irene.

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:11.700
When you mentioned
daily releases of code,

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:12.820
I was totally baffled.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:16.750
I worked at Expedia in the past,
and we had reduced our cycle

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:19.640
from six months
down to two weeks.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.600
Beyond that, we didn't
even think about daily.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.880
So what kind of challenges
do you face as a developer,

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.140
and even for a product manager,
when you lay out the feature,

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:29.430
do you divide the iterations?

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:31.900
That these are the
dates that you meet,

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:35.187
and how do you even get
to it on a daily basis?

00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:37.520
SUBHA SUBRAMANIAN: I'll let
Irene answer her part first.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.410
IRENE CHUNG: Sure.

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:39.930
So I'll take a
first hack at that.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:41.263
How do we get to daily releases?

00:22:41.263 --> 00:22:43.930
One is just a very, very good
tools and very good hygiene.

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.670
So a lot of what the software
engineering and test team does

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.080
is making sure that we have
a lot of automated processes

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.530
in place that can
automatically catch the code

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:52.660
and run tests on things.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.118
So when you check
something in, you

00:22:54.118 --> 00:22:57.250
should within a few
minutes to a few hours,

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:59.250
depending on what you're
running, whether or not

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:00.662
that broken anything.

00:23:00.662 --> 00:23:01.620
That's the first layer.

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.494
And then we also have
manual testers in place

00:23:03.494 --> 00:23:05.160
who do the next layer.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.040
So every single
day, we have a cut

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.840
that goes out which the
test team takes a hard look.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.420
They start filing
bugs immediately.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.800
So when we come into work the
next morning as engineers,

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.258
we can start boiling
down this list

00:23:16.258 --> 00:23:18.750
and looking at things very
directly as this is release

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:20.410
blocking, this is
not release blocking.

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:22.890
So there's very good hygiene
about saying what is blocking,

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:23.704
what is not.

00:23:23.704 --> 00:23:25.120
And then when
things are blocking,

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.975
you go and you chase
those things down.

00:23:26.975 --> 00:23:28.600
Those are the things
that we would say,

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.140
you don't leave your
desk until you're

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.120
done finding out what the
root cause actually is

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.340
or getting it to the right team.

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:35.631
Because a lot of times it
may not be in your code base,

00:23:35.631 --> 00:23:37.020
but it may be in
somebody else's.

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:39.469
And it's all about fast
response, fast routing.

00:23:39.469 --> 00:23:41.260
So just really good
hygiene and really good

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.635
tools for getting
that stuff through.

00:23:43.635 --> 00:23:46.180
SUBHA SUBRAMANIAN: For
my part, I actually find

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:50.460
it makes my life a lot easier,
because if the release date was

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.570
like two weeks away
and we didn't make it,

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:55.300
and then we have to wait for
two more weeks to release it,

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:56.980
it's actually a pain.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.162
So if it didn't make
the next day's cut,

00:23:59.162 --> 00:24:01.120
then we'll make the day
after that if possible.

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.160
So it actually streamlines
the development cycle

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.966
and helps us get the
product out the door faster.

00:24:06.966 --> 00:24:10.088
AUDIENCE: So do you divide it
on a daily basis, when you--

00:24:10.088 --> 00:24:12.860
SUBHA SUBRAMANIAN: So I don't
know if you are talking more

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:18.250
about dividing the release,
like what goes out when.

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:22.190
We do have a sense of timeline
of what goes out when.

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:24.420
Sometimes that is actually
complicated by the fact

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:26.730
that there are different
teams involved in it,

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:30.870
so it's a cross-functional
team launch.

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:33.330
So we are not very
specific about, it

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:34.630
has to go out on x day.

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:37.420
If we couldn't make x day, we
know why we couldn't make it

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:39.680
and we know how we can fix it.

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:43.870
We'll really aim to get it out
the very next possible moment

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:44.480
that we can.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.320
So we are not
really tied down to,

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.362
we didn't make it on this
day, now what do we do.

00:24:48.362 --> 00:24:50.403
IRENE CHUNG: I would say,
also, there's generally

00:24:50.403 --> 00:24:53.197
an understanding of it goes
out when it's ready to go out.

00:24:53.197 --> 00:24:55.030
We do all our best
efforts to basically say,

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:56.310
here's a code completion
date that we're

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:58.601
targeting based on the
estimates and the features we've

00:24:58.601 --> 00:25:00.201
agreed upon.

00:25:00.201 --> 00:25:02.450
We communicate very, very
early if that's not actually

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:04.720
going to happen so that we
can throw the right resources

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.045
behind actually
saying, well, is it

00:25:06.045 --> 00:25:07.850
just we can put more
engineers behind this

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:09.590
and it can happen, or do
we need to cut something

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:11.660
and that can happen, or is
the date just not important

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.784
and it's more important to
get the right experience

00:25:13.784 --> 00:25:14.750
out a little bit later.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:15.385
SUBHA SUBRAMANIAN: I
would agree with that.

00:25:15.385 --> 00:25:17.093
IRENE CHUNG: It's a
lot of communication.

00:25:19.466 --> 00:25:22.442
REBECCA CHAVEZ: Do we have-- OK.

00:25:22.442 --> 00:25:23.970
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:25.880
I'm curious about the
specific distinctions

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.780
at Google between the product
manager and the program

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:31.680
manager, and about how
those two teams of managers

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.280
work together to balance the
priorities on their engineers

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.620
between Google-wide
projects as well

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:39.274
as product-specific projects.

00:25:39.274 --> 00:25:40.940
REBECCA CHAVEZ: Do
you want to go first?

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.670
SUBHA SUBRAMANIAN: OK.

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:45.070
So as I mentioned
earlier, my role

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:48.180
is more to look at the strategy
and come up with the features

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:51.864
that we can ship to
make the product better.

00:25:51.864 --> 00:25:53.280
Things get really
complicated when

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.310
you're talking
about multiple teams

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:56.610
across different functions.

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:58.901
For example, a launch that
we did recently with Google+

00:25:58.901 --> 00:26:01.029
and the local team.

00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:03.070
Those kinds of things can
get really complicated,

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:05.361
because then you have two
sets of product managers, two

00:26:05.361 --> 00:26:08.660
sets of UI designers,
basically everything.

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.770
And plus, they talk
to backend teams,

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:13.660
we talk to backend teams, all
kinds of fancy stuff like that.

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.680
And then project managers
or program managers really

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:22.050
come in and help us all see the
timelines, keep us on our toes,

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:24.580
and they're the ones that
really drive the project through

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.490
and make sure that
it goes on time.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:28.014
And Rebecca can
speak more to that.

00:26:28.014 --> 00:26:29.180
REBECCA CHAVEZ: Yeah, right.

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:34.370
So we do partner very closely.

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:36.860
Project managers
are usually the ones

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:40.550
talking schedules and
timelines and priorities,

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:44.460
and trying to help fit
this sequence of work

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:48.680
and development together
for a reasonable outcome,

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:54.490
whether it be a feature launch
or something along those lines.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:56.800
We all partner together,
the program managers

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.795
and the product-- thank you.

00:26:59.795 --> 00:27:01.920
I think we have time, maybe,
for one more question.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.100
OK.

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:06.370
And we can always pick
it up afterwards as well,

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:07.553
just find us.

00:27:07.553 --> 00:27:08.240
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.430
I'm a UX designer, so this
is mostly directed at Anya.

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:14.230
One of the themes that
came up several times

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:16.100
in the earlier talk
and sessions is

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.470
the importance of prototyping.

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:19.780
So I was wondering what
the role of prototyping

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:23.786
is at Google in getting
code out the door?

00:27:23.786 --> 00:27:26.590
ANYA KOGAN: A really
important one.

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:28.400
So it is product dependent.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.140
I think people throw different
products, the prototype,

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:33.900
and using different tools.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.830
We typically do have
at least one or two

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:41.390
dedicated prototypers
per product group.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:44.040
So in my case with AdWords,
we have one prototyper,

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.910
and she's actually doing
some amazing work right now.

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:49.550
And it's another she.

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:51.790
Collaborating with
prototypers across all

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.620
of ads, which is really,
really big group,

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:59.350
to create a single prototyping
platform, which is basically

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:04.110
a set of established CSS, a
set of widgets that we can all

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:08.072
share so that we can more
quickly produce the prototypes.

00:28:08.072 --> 00:28:09.530
So that's been
really awesome, it's

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:11.570
made it a lot faster and
easier to create them.

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:14.440
And as far as what is the role?

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.250
We often use them to
sell a product idea,

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:19.710
sometimes we use
them for reviews.

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:22.960
Any time people see
things moving and seeing

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.450
things actually interacting,
it's a lot easier

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:27.320
to sell that design idea.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.075
Somehow click-through
mocks don't always

00:28:29.075 --> 00:28:32.392
have that same wow factor.

00:28:32.392 --> 00:28:34.100
As far as the role,
I think it's to sell,

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.980
to demonstrate functionality.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:38.660
Especially transitions,
for instance,

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:41.130
which you can't really
do with static mocks.

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:43.219
And also, of course,
usability testing.

00:28:43.219 --> 00:28:45.010
I think it's a lot
easier to test something

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:46.885
that you can actually
interact with than have

00:28:46.885 --> 00:28:48.765
to linearly clickthrough.

00:28:48.765 --> 00:28:50.140
IRENE CHUNG: If
it's OK, I'd like

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:51.800
to give an example
of a great prototype

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.114
that we had experience with.

00:28:53.114 --> 00:28:55.530
I don't know how many of you
are familiar with the Google+

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:58.537
rewrite that we delivered
last year during IO 2013,

00:28:58.537 --> 00:29:00.870
but it was a total rewrite
of the system that introduced

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:03.537
a multi-column grid that had
responsive layout and morphed

00:29:03.537 --> 00:29:05.870
between multiple different
columns based on your browser

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:06.700
size.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.370
Now, it would have been really
difficult to try this out

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:12.339
on production quality code
really, really quickly.

00:29:12.339 --> 00:29:14.380
So we had a couple different
prototypers actually

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.739
build this prototype,
do user testing with it,

00:29:16.739 --> 00:29:18.780
actually say these are
the features that we want,

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.530
these are the features that
we thought were really awesome

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:21.905
but actually, once
we wrote them,

00:29:21.905 --> 00:29:23.720
they really don't want them.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.410
And that was a very good
way of testing out new ideas

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:28.400
extremely quickly
and iterating quickly

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.650
without having to build on
the production stack, which

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:31.830
can take a lot longer.

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:33.690
So we use prototyping
a lot to make sure

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:35.724
that these ideas are
fleshed out and that they

00:29:35.724 --> 00:29:38.140
are solid before we actually
dedicate a lot of engineering

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:39.015
time to them as well.

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:43.630
REBECCA CHAVEZ: Great.

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:48.080
Well, thank you for attending
and thank you, panelists.
