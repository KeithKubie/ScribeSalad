00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.750
In the last video I gave a
little bit of a hand wavy

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.289
explanation about why S-waves
don't travel in liquid or air.

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:10.830
What I want to do in this video
is give you a little bit more

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.780
intuitive understanding
of that, and really

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.530
go down to the molecular level.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.790
So let's draw a solid.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.170
And it has nice covalent
bonds, strong bonds

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.020
between the different molecules.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.950
And the bonds are drawn
by these lines in between.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.979
So if I were to
hit this solid, you

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:31.020
know I have this really
small hammer where I just

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.860
hit at a molecular
level, but if I

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.580
were to hit these molecules
hard enough so that they move

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.260
but not so hard enough
that it breaks the bonds,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.020
then essentially what
it's going to look

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.260
like is this kind
of row of molecules

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.100
is going to move to the left.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.220
So you're going to have
that row of molecules

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.630
moving to the left.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.690
And then the row above it
won't fully move to the left

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.730
just yet, but it will
start to get pulled.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.040
So let me just draw
all of the bonds.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.810
I'm just drawing all
of the same bonds.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.250
Because these are strong bonds
that we have in a solid--

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.090
Actually, they could
be ionic bonds as well.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.260
Because they are strong bonds
that we have in this solid,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.560
they'll essentially be pulled.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.380
The top row will be
pulled in the direction

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.450
of the bottom row.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.280
And so they'll start kind
of moving in that direction.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.940
And then the bottom row will
essentially recoil back.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.700
And then you fast
forward a little bit.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.180
And so then the top row
will have moved to the left.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.220
And now the bottom
row will start

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:43.670
to move back, especially
because, remember,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.030
it's bonded to other
things down here.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.194
It's bonded to more of
the solid down here.

00:01:49.194 --> 00:01:50.110
So it would move back.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.140
And you can see this
transverse wave,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.740
you can see this
S-wave propagating.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.790
Essentially right over here
the kind of peak of the S-wave

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.570
is here.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.602
Now it has moved up.

00:02:00.602 --> 00:02:02.560
Now, let's think about
the exact same situation

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.590
with the liquids.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.920
In liquids you don't have these
strong ionic or covalent bonds

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.900
between the different molecules.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.900
You just have these
weak kind of bonds,

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.240
usually formed due to polarity.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.600
So in a liquid,
water's a good example,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.260
you just have these kind
of weaker bonds formed

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.290
because water is
a polar molecule.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.250
So the kind of
half-way polar sides

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.460
or the half-way positive
sides are somewhat

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.500
attracted to the
half-way negative sides.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.840
So they kind of flow
past each other.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.330
But if I were to hit these
water molecules right here

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.030
with my hammer,
what would happen?

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.722
Well, they're definitely going
to start moving to the left.

00:02:41.722 --> 00:02:44.180
And actually, this one's going
to bump into that one, which

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.170
is going to bump
into that, which

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.050
is going to bump into that one.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.466
They're going to
move to the left.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.454
But these molecules aren't
going to move with them.

00:02:53.454 --> 00:02:55.120
You could view it as
it's going to break

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.540
that very weak bond
due to polarity.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.420
They're going to move
away from each other.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.440
Let me draw these top
molecules in green.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.410
They're essentially just
going to flow past each other.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.270
They're going to
flow past each other.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.130
And this guy might have had also
weak bonds with stuff below it,

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.630
too.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.004
I should draw it
as dotted lines.

00:03:15.243 --> 00:03:19.422
But because of the
impact here, these guys

00:03:19.422 --> 00:03:20.380
are just going to flow.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.588
They're actually going to
compress in this direction.

00:03:22.588 --> 00:03:24.870
You're going to have a
P-wave, a compression wave,

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.840
go in this direction, where
this one bumps into that one,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.840
and then goes back, and then
this one bumps into that one

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.048
and goes back, and then this
one bumps into that one.

00:03:31.048 --> 00:03:33.900
But the bonds aren't
strong enough,

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.770
and it's even more
the case with air,

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.530
but the bonds aren't strong
enough for these blue guys

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.720
to take these green
guys for a ride.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.570
And the bonds are
also not strong enough

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.040
for the adjacent
molecules to kind of help

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.870
these blue guys to retract
to their original position.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.840
So when I talked about the
elasticity in the last video

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.314
that's what I was talking about.

00:03:55.314 --> 00:03:57.605
The bonds aren't strong enough
to cause the things that

00:03:57.605 --> 00:04:00.330
have deformed to kind of
move back to where they were,

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.120
and also the bonds
aren't strong enough

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.780
to allow the things
that are deformed

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.280
to pull other things with it.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.530
And so that's why, in general,
S-waves only travel in solid,

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.190
and they won't travel
in liquid or air.
