00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.090
Does this image look familiar?

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.310
You may know it as an album cover for the
famous post-punk band ‘The Strokes’, but

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.800
I’ve got a surprise for you.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.520
It’s really a picture of charged subatomic
particles inside a giant bubble chamber.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.090
Yeah, you heard me right.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.249
This artistic, iconic image is a visualization
generated by one of the many interesting ways

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:23.149
we’ve tried to ‘see’ the subatomic particles
in our world...which is harder than it sounds.

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:26.409
And that’s because subatomic particles can
be...tricky.

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:27.460
Take neutrinos, for example.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.619
They’re a fundamental particle of the universe,
and they are quite literally everywhere around

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.719
us, all the time--you have neutrinos passing
through you right now!

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.280
But the catch is they have no charge and a
miniscule mass--some even say no mass at all.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.589
This means they interact so little with the
matter around them, we don’t notice them

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.070
zinging through the earth and our bodies at
nearly the speed of light all day long.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.129
And that’s also what makes them so hard
to find, measure and understand!

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.609
How do you look at a thing that doesn’t
interact with anything?

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.569
‘Very creatively’ is the answer.

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:03.839
Which brings us back to this album cover.

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.799
Like I mentioned, this dreamy image was generated
by the equally dreamy-sounding bubble chamber.

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.369
The Gargamelle, for example, was a bubble
chamber used at CERN in the 70’s, consisting

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.600
of a muon-neutrino beam and nearly 12 cubic
meters of heavy-liquid freon.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.000
Using Gargamelle, researchers could observe
the charged particles set in motion by the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.240
neutrinos...kind of like seeing the ‘shadow’
of the neutrino.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.860
This is the reason the neutrino is sometimes
referred to as the ghost particle--you can’t

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.170
see the neutrino itself, but you can see them
knocking stuff around if you arrange things

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.220
properly.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.909
Not only did this instrument help us ‘see’
neutrinos, but also provided crucial early

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.840
evidence that quarks exist, . And even though
it was short-lived due to some cracks in its

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.979
structure, this particular bubble chamber
played a pretty important role on the road

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.969
to our current understanding of particle physics.

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:53.969
That image is an actual picture of the real
interaction.

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:54.969
It’s not a visualization generated abstractly
from some other data, it’s the real picture

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:55.969
of the real thing in real time.

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:57.979
Since then we’ve moved on to some more sophisticated
methods of neutrino detection, which you can

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.420
learn more about here.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.700
But what about some more of the ones that
just look cool?

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.090
Like liquid argon time projections, for example!

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.979
Remember how Gargamelle used heavy-liquid
freon?

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.350
Well, after that we moved on to argon, which
can be kept in its liquid phase more easily

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.300
than the rest of the noble gases.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:21.080
In a liquid argon time projection chamber
(TPCs), one charged particle produces 55,000

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.110
electrons with every centimeter it travels.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.240
The way the electric and magnetic fields in
a TPC are set up allows the electrons to travel

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.690
uniformly through the argon, and there are
tons of them.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.690
Both of these things mean that TPCs give really
clean, crisp high-resolution details of neutrino

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.930
interactions and they’re able to capture
lots of them simultaneously.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.830
And last but not least, my favorite: Cherenkov
radiation.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.770
Which just looks like something out of a movie,
honestly.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.190
Nothing travels faster than the speed of light,
right?

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.480
Well, that’s only true in a vacuum.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.840
Here on earth, light actually travels a bit
slower than its peak speed through transparent

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.770
media like water, for example.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.230
When other subatomic particles, like electrons
given off as radiation from a nuclear reactor,

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.030
travel through water faster than light does...it
produces this radically cool blue glow.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.460
Some of the neutrino observatories we use
today incorporate what we call water Cherenkov

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.460
detectors.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.930
Like the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, a neutrino
detection facility that happens to also be

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.850
the deepest clean room in the world at 2 kilometers
below the earth’s surface!

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.570
In this detector, a neutrino passing through
a special water tank sets a muon or an electron

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.060
in motion, producing Cherenkov radiation.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.930
Scientists can see and reconstruct the moment
that light begins, therefore essentially ‘seeing’

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.340
the moment the neutrino hit that muon or electron.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.050
Sometimes science imitates art, I guess.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:04:04.800
Which one is

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.940
your favorite?

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:15.880
Fun fact, that Strokes album is called ‘Is
This It’, which kinda melds perfectly with

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.560
the whole concept behind the cover.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.490
I can picture scientists standing around looking
at each other asking themselves…’is this

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.490
it?

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.889
Is this the neutrino?’.
