01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:19.970
mother brought her up because of our
stereotypes of who people are and so I

01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:19.980
stereotypes of who people are and so I
 

01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:21.709
stereotypes of who people are and so I
tell the kids could they asked me and

01:19:21.709 --> 01:19:21.719
tell the kids could they asked me and
 

01:19:21.719 --> 01:19:22.939
