00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:22.020
How “911” Became the Emergency Call Number
in North America

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.840
Before the 1960s, the United States didn’t
have one universal phone number for Americans

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.060
to call if they needed help from the police
or fire department.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.250
Callers simply had to know the phone number
for each department in the area they were

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.269
currently in.

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:37.980
In the case of large cities, there were often
multiple police and fire departments covering

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.980
different areas.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.350
Los Angeles, for example, had fifty different
police departments and just as many phone

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.350
numbers.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.179
Telephone operators would usually be left
to direct emergency calls if the caller wasn’t

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:50.750
sure which department or phone number they
needed.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.030
Oftentimes there would be further delays upon
getting the police or fire department on the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.739
line if the clerks who answered the phone
were busy with another caller.

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.550
Needless to say, this system wasn’t optimized
to get emergency help where it needed to go

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.969
very quickly.

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.260
To solve this problem, the National Fire Chief’s
Association suggested a national emergency

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.400
phone number in 1957.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.450
But it wasn’t until 1967 that President
Lyndon B. Johnson helped get the ball rolling.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.940
A report to President Johnson’s Commission
on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.590
suggested that a single telephone number should
be designated for callers to use in emergencies

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.140
nationwide, or at least in major cities.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.330
The report also recommended that police departments
have two phone lines: one for emergencies

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.560
and another for regular business calls.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.310
That way callers looking to report an emergency
wouldn’t be stuck on hold while the clerk

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.090
helped someone who was simply looking for
information.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.540
To make this universal emergency number a
reality, the Federal Communications Commission

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.540
(FCC) partnered with the American Telephone
and Telegraph Company (also known as AT&amp;T)

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.920
in late 1967 to figure out what the number
should be.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.440
After mulling it over, AT&amp;T proposed in 1968
that the numbers 9-1-1 should make up the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.460
new universal emergency phone number.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.170
Why the numbers 9-1-1 specifically?

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.150
Simply put, the phone number 9-1-1 is short,
easy to remember, and can be dialed relatively

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.209
quickly given the few digits.

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.379
This was particularly important in old-style
rotary/pulse-dialing phones, which were still

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.209
popular when the 9-1-1 system was first implemented.

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.239
(The touch-tone phone wasn’t first widely
introduced until 1963 and took a few decades

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.709
to completely supplant rotary phones.)

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.739
In addition, the fact that it was only three
digits meant the number could easily be distinguished

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.689
from other, normal phone numbers in AT&amp;T’s
internal system and routed to a special location

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.250
without too many changes to the AT&amp;T network.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.799
(A few years earlier, AT&amp;T had implemented
their 6-1-1 and 4-1-1 numbers, so recommending

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.110
9-1-1 made this a relatively simple upgrade
for them.)

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.700
Congress supported AT&amp;T’s proposal for 9-1-1
as the national emergency number and passed

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.499
legislation to that affect.

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.950
In order to make things fair for telephone
companies that needed to update their equipment

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.330
and offices in order to handle the new 9-1-1
call system, the Bell System policy was created.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.079
The policy merged the costs of improvements
into the basic rates that telephone companies

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.870
charged their customers.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.120
Just over ten years after Congress established
9-1-1 as the country’s universal emergency

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.200
phone number, approximately 26% of United
States citizens could dial 9-1-1 and be connected

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.349
with their local emergency services.

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.420
It might surprise you to learn that even just
about 25 years ago, in 1989, that number had

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.569
risen only to 50%.

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.230
However, just a decade after that, it rose
to 93% of the U.S.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.490
Today, approximately 99% of people in the
United States have access to the 9-1-1 emergency

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.219
phone number system.

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:37.170
Bonus Facts:
• Great Britain was the first country to

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.930
establish a universal emergency number (999)
in 1937.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.780
It was established after five people died
in a fire.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.920
• Cell and VoIP phones have introduced some
new problems to the old 9-1-1 and Enhanced

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.930
9-1-1 system, namely trying to figure out
where the person in question is making the

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:54.930
phone call from.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.530
For cell phones, the FCC requires very strict
location parameters either via GPS tracking

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.319
of the cell phone or by cell network location.

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.010
In the former case, it needs to be accurate
to within 150 meters for a minimum of 90%

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.260
of the 9-1-1 calls and within 50 meters for
a minimum of 67% of the calls.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.919
In the latter network location case, it needs
to be accurate to within 300 meters for 90%

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.400
of the calls and 100 meters for 67% of the
calls.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.729
It is expected that over time the FCC will
continue to require these systems to be more

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:25.770
and more accurate.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.419
Beyond these types of upgrades to the system,
a shift to cell phone usage has introduced

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.590
the possibility of texting 9-1-1 to receive
help.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.480
While the system is still being rolled out,
many carriers such as AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile,

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.699
and Verizon now support this.

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.509
To get around the problem of the individual
sending the text knowing whether the texting

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:46.509
9-1-1 system is available in their area, if
you send one where this isn’t available

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:51.190
yet, you should receive an automatic response
text message telling you it’s not available.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.389
• Other “N-1-1″ numbers include 2-1-1:
which is for community services information;

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:02.610
3-1-1 for non-emergency municipal government
services; 4-1-1: directory assistance; 5-1-1:

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.590
traffic information and non-emergency police
services; 6-1-1: telephone company customer

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.550
service; 7-1-1: Telecommunications Device
for the Deaf (TDD) relay; 8-1-1: underground

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:26.449
public utility services.
