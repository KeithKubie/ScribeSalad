00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.120
There�s no denying that superhero movies
are the thing in Hollywood these days.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.780
Thanks to their portrayal of fan-favorite
characters with decades of mythology and the

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.160
ability to blend multiple genres, they have
been going strong for years.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.170
We could even argue that superhero films have
joined the ranks of the Western and the action

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.189
flick as one of the most iconic types in the
industry�s history.

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.840
Here are Screen Rant�s 10 Greatest Superhero
Movies Ever Made.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.120
Superman: The Movie

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.110
Long before the movement in the early 2000s
pushed superhero films to the forefront of

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.130
pop culture, director Richard Donner set out
to prove a man could fly in 1978.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.420
Most of the film�s success is due to the
pitch-perfect casting of Christopher Reeve

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.650
as The Man of Steel.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.580
Reeve was able to convey the All-American
charm of Clark Kent and the strong values

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.580
of Superman to make a memorable protagonist.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.861
Like other blockbusters of that era, Superman
also set out to wow audiences with a sense

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:06.079
of wonder and amazement, with a joyous tone
that made the movie wildly entertaining and

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:09.420
exciting to watch.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.130
Blade

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.260
Bryan Singer�s X-Men gets a lot of credit
for launching the new wave of superhero movies,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.530
but Blade got there first.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.840
Blade showed how comic book films could be
a viable enterprise in a modern Hollywood.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.890
Wesley Snipes� performance as the half vampire
hero sold audiences.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.400
Blade also received praise for its stylized
action sequences.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.270
Director Stephen Norrington really delivered,
crafting scenes that are thrilling to watch.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.340
Blade also illustrated how superhero movies
could combine various genres.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.070
The film's horror and thriller elements gave
it a unique flair that showed how filmmakers

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.600
could get creative with superhero flicks.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.600
The Incredibles

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.709
Brad Bird�s Oscar-winning original superhero
tale really struck a chord with audiences

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:57.219
young and old.

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:00.850
Its a heartfelt story of a family looking
to overcome their differences while coming

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.329
together to save the world.

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:07.179
The themes and subplots of dealing with a
midlife crisis and finding your place in society

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.039
were considered to be bold and mature for
an animated �kids� film and made the Incredibles

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.170
something all audiences could appreciate.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.810
It also didn�t hurt that all of the characters
� from Mr. Incredible to Edna Mode � felt

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.480
like real people and provided several touching
and hilarious moments we�ll remember forever.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:33.140
Bring on the sequel!

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.870
Spider-Man 2

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.670
It wasn�t too long ago that Peter Parker
was at the top of the superhero movie food

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.580
chain, and 2004�s Spider-Man 2 is why.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.180
Director Sam Raimi expanded on the 2002 original
and treated moviegoers to an emotional character-driven

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.450
story.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.030
Peter's struggle with tough choices we all
have to make in life showed why Spider-Man

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.510
is one of the most relatable superheroes.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.400
The film had standout action sequences, but
it's the villain that made Spider-Man 2 an

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.590
all-time classic.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.620
Alfred Molina injected a sense of ambition
in Docter Octopus.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.840
He gave Octavius a human side, making him
one of the more complex characters in the

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.920
trilogy.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:20.590
His sacrifice was a perfect representation
of the series� overarching themes.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.310
The Dark Knight

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.880
Christopher Nolan�s Batman trilogy is one
of the watershed film series of the 21st century,

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.630
and this middle chapter is why.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.860
The film built on the �escalation� teased
in Batman Begins and treated audiences to

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.580
an engrossing movie that explored the darker
side of justice and heroism.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.340
The tone and techniques Nolan employed became
so revolutionary that Dark Knight spawned

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.810
countless imitators � including other iconic
franchises.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.690
We�d be crazy not to mention Heath Ledger�s
Joker, which raised the bar for movie bad

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:57.280
guys to a whole other level thanks to Ledger's
unhinged and terrifying performance.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.100
Iron Man

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.740
Iron Man is a film that could have gone horribly
wrong for many reasons, but Jon Favreau and

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.069
Robert Downey, Jr. churned out an elite superhero
film.

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.960
As one of the few Marvel projects �free�
from the shared universe building of other

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.690
films, Iron Man was able to focus solely on
developing the character of Tony Stark.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.830
The film also set up the basic template that
future Marvel releases followed.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:30.440
It embraced a tight balance between comedy
and drama that made it a captivating and entertaining

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.820
watch.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.530
If only every Marvel movie could have such
a rich and interesting arc as this one.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:44.500
The Avengers

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.840
Joss Whedon�s massive crossover made fans�
dreams come true and s studio�s gamble pay

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.040
off.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.120
It broke box office records and earned critical
acclaim doing it.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.680
The novelty of seeing so many characters fighting
alongside each other for the first time instantly

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.910
made Avengers an event, and Whedon�s writing
made everything matter.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.910
Between sharp, witty dialogue and the chemistry
between actors, the Avengers was able to deliver

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:17.620
style and substance in spades.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.380
And don�t forget about Tom Hiddleston who
cemented his status as the Marvel Cinematic

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.040
Universe�s best evildoer as the plotting
and scheming villain Loki.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.210
The Avengers had a huge impact on Hollywood
in numerous ways and changed the superhero

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.310
game forever.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.750
Guardians of the Galaxy

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.540
Once upon a time, this film was a huge risk,
but now it�s hard to envision the Marvel

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.030
Cinematic Universe without the Guardians.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.750
James Gunn used his creativity and enthusiasm
to create an awe-inspiring space opera complete

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:53.440
with great characters we can�t wait to see
again.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.060
The cosmic setting of the film was certainly
different than what we�re accustomed to

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.330
seeing in the genre, but somehow it worked.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.889
Guardians was still grounded by a big sense
of heart that made it instantly relatable

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:06.100
to casual audiences and die-hards alike.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.620
We�re all hooked on a feeling.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.699
Captain America: The Winter Soldier

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:17.870
Joe and Anthony Russo are going to have a
big role to play in Marvel�s Phase 3, and

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.620
their work on Captain America 2 is why.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.210
The Winter Soldier sports some of the most
sophisticated and thrilling Marvel action

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.330
sequences to date, and the film's villain
made a big impression with viewers.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.580
He was impossible to stop every time he was
on-screen, and his dynamic with Steve Rogers

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.970
was fascinating to watch.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.860
But it wasn�t just the action that made
this stand out from the crowd.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.620
The Russos added layers of governmental intrigue
and espionage to the film, giving it real-world

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.570
sensibilities and smart social commentary.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.560
X-Men: Days of Future Past

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:53.900
X-Men: First Class brought the franchise back
to respectability, and Days of Future Past

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.740
became the most successful film in the series
yet.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.430
Fans couldn�t wait to see Bryan Singer return
to the director's chair and do the iconic

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.610
storyline justice.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.170
The film was ambitious.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:08.150
It didn�t just operate as a solid time-travel
sci-fi story.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.080
The action sequences really set a new standard,
and the acclaimed cast brought their characters

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.080
to life.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.330
Plus, the film provided a soft-reboot and
wiped out the lesser X-Men films.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.790
Win-win all around.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:26.620
Those are our picks for the best superhero
movies ever made.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.990
Are there any we missed?
