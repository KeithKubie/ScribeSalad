SATYAJEET SALGAR: Hi,
I'm Satyajeet.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.320
I'm here with Ibrahim and we're
here to tell you about

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.770
our session at Google I/O,
which is about using the

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.000
YouTube Live APIs to stream
content onto YouTube, either

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.170
as a content partner or as a
developer to build tools to

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.590
stream live onto YouTube.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.210
I'm going to tell you a little
bit about YouTube, the Live

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.880
platform and the APIs.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.220
And Ibrahim is going to dive
into the details of what we're

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.030
going to talk about
at Google I/O.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.930
Ibrahim, does that sound
like a plan?

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:35.330
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Sure.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.730
Sounds good.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.290
SATYAJEET SALGAR: All right.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.320
First, let me tell you a little
bit about YouTube.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.290
YouTube is a great place
to watch video.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.550
Over 1 billion users
every single

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.810
month come onto YouTube.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.510
They watch over 4 billion
hours of content.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.000
72 hours of video are
uploaded to YouTube

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.300
every single minute.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.970
And YouTube, at this point,
is a truly cross-platform

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.080
experience, about 25% of
our views globally

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.780
are on mobile devices.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.960
We're also a great place
to search for video.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.780
In fact, YouTube is the second
largest search engine in the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.960
world today.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.590
We're extremely proud
of the work we've

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.480
done with Live recently.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.520
We have an incredible stream
quality and some great

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.150
features on the Live platform.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.290
As a developer or a content
partner, you only need to send

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.720
us one stream.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.570
We transcode it to different
resolutions and device formats

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.510
and deliver the right stream
to the user based on their

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.110
device and the bandwidth
they have available.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.260
We also let users get
back and forth in

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.600
the stream very easily.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.600
We make it easy for you to add
add cues and slates into the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.160
stream as well.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.250
We recently released the YouTube
live APIs so that you

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.080
can either make it easier for
you as developers to stream

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.120
content on the platform or build
apps that take advantage

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.500
of the platform and help content
partners build great

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.420
experiences.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.060
Ibrahim, do you want to say more
about what you're going

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.680
to talk about at Google I/O?

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.620
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Sure.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.780
As Satyajeet mentioned, we have
a great live streaming

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.010
platform, and a well designed
live streaming API that will

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.340
let you schedule, update, and
manage your broadcast.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.760
Create reusable streaming points
with their settings and

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.200
inserting ads for the YouTube
content partners.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.450
You will have a nice
introduction of the API and

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.980
its resources.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.442
I will also go over a few
samples showing you how it's

00:02:29.442 --> 00:02:31.880
easy to get started
and how it can be

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.300
applied to your use case.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.370
If you would like to get an
earlier look of the API, the

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.140
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:47.270
are at developers.googl
e.com/youtube/v3/live.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.730
If you want to go over the
examples of the language or

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.220
your choice, you can also check
out YouTube API samples

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.545
project at code.google.com/
p/youtube-api-samples.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.736
In those examples, news
broadcast, livestreams and

00:03:05.736 --> 00:03:07.150
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.590
of live streaming API.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.210
You can also see them
in [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.860
documentation.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.090
Last, but definitely not the
least, we will have mobile and

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.700
cloud streaming demos using
the API [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.760
On the other hand, we have also
partner integrations in

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.250
our sandbox area.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.580
Wouldn't it be fun if we
showed it all now?

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.100
Right?

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.660
Come and see the next
[INAUDIBLE].

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.650
SATYAJEET SALGAR: We're really
excited to see you at Google

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.110
I/O and tell you more about
our platform, our APIs, as

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.000
well as introduce you to
partners that are taking

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.800
advantage of the platform.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.380
Look forward to seeing you
in San Francisco in May.
