00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.200
Content routing concerns how to direct clients to a

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.720
particular server. One might do this in a number

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.320
of ways. One could use the routing system, for

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.800
example, Anycast. So one could number all of the replicas

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.080
with the same IP address and then rely on

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.580
routing to take the client to the closest replica

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.645
based on the routes, that the internet routers choose.

00:00:21.645 --> 00:00:25.660
Routing-based redirection is simple but it provides the service providers

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.770
with very little control over which servers the

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.159
clients ultimately get redirected to, because the redirection is

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.010
at the whims, of internet routing. Another way to

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.100
do redirection is application based. For example, by using

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.520
an HTTP redirect. This is effective but it requires

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.320
the client to first go to the origin server

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.990
to get the redirect in the first place, increasing

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.960
latency. The third, and most common way that service

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.020
selection is performed is as part of

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.270
the naming system, using DNS. In this approach,

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.370
a client looks up a particular domain

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.110
name, such as Google.com, and the response contains

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.970
an IP address of a nearby cache.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.790
Naming base redirection provides significant flexibility in directing

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.050
different clients to different server replicas. So in

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.320
summary routing based redirection is simple but its

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.070
very coarse. Application based routing is also fairly

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.740
simple but it incurs significant delays which operators

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.400
really care about as well as users. Naming

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.660
based redirection provides fine-grained control and its also fast.
