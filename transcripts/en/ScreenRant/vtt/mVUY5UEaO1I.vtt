00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.080
Stars on the A-list are there for a reason.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.990
They’ve made a series of smart career choices,
carefully selecting the projects they act

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.640
in so they have continued success.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.640
When was the last time Leonardo DiCaprio was
in a film that was outright bad?

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.580
Still, everyone is prone to mistakes, and
even the biggest names in Hollywood can have

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.860
a misstep or two on their résumé.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.210
You may be surprised that some Oscar winners
and box office icons don’t always make the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.210
best decisions.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.619
Here are 10 popular actors who you didn’t
think made bad career choices.

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.050
Robert De Niro

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.450
The legendary actor declined the role of Captain
Jack Sparrow for the first Pirates of the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.370
Caribbean movie since he felt it would flop
like so many other pirate films of years past.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.950
De Niro was proven wrong when The Curse of
the Black Pearl was a huge hit and earned

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.780
Johnny Depp a Best Actor nomination, so he
tried to make up for it by signing on for

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.780
Stardust.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.440
Unfortunately, that film was hardly the box
office success Pirates was and only made $38

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.440
million in the States.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.600
De Niro has a filmography full of iconic roles
and performances, but in this instance he

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.220
wasn’t so… savvy.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.270
Matthew Broderick

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.170
Broderick will always be Ferris Bueller to
viewers, but the actor could have added another

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.640
great character to his résumé.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.640
He was offered the chance to play Walter White
on Breaking Bad, but he turned it down for

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.640
reasons unknown.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.990
Bryan Cranston became the one who knocked
and won countless accolades for his performances

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.950
over the span of five seasons – including
three consecutive Primetime Emmys.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.439
Broderick has had a successful career, working
in a variety of projects from awards contenders

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.080
to beloved animated classics, but he probably
wishes he could go back in time to cook some

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.220
(fictional) crystal meth and be Heisenberg.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.220
Sean Connery

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.569
From James Bond to Indiana Jones to the Untouchables,
Sean Connery starred in several great films

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:49.590
throughout his career.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.039
He has few regrets, but there is one that
haunts him to this day.

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.240
Connery was one of Peter Jackson’s choices
for Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings trilogy,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.329
but the actor turned it down because he didn’t
understand the script.

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.009
Even when Connery was offered $10 million
per film and 15 percent of the box office

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.649
totals, he still said no.

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.751
Not only did he miss a chance to leave another
major impact on pop culture, Connery’s decision

00:02:10.751 --> 00:02:13.690
cost him a whopping $480 million.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.320
His last film, The League of Extraordinary
Gentlemen, was nowhere near that kind of payday.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.320
Paul Giamatti

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.000
In his career, Paul Giamatti has been nominated
for – and won in some cases – Oscars,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.210
Golden Globes, and Emmys.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.540
He’s one of the industry’s finest character
actors and always gives it his all, but not

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.380
every decision he’s made has been a winner.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.400
Giamatti could have been Michael Scott in
the U.S. version of the sitcom The Office,

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.560
but he turned the part down.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.580
Steve Carell took it instead and was launched
into superstardom by the show’s success.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.430
Looking over Giamatti’s résumé, it’s
hard to say he’s had a bad run, but he arguably

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.430
lacks that one truly iconic character.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.320
Maybe Michael Scott was the one that got away.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.320
Harrison Ford

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.900
Harrison Ford is Han Solo and Indiana Jones,
but one thing he is not is an Oscar winner.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.090
In fact, Ford has only been nominated once
by the Academy, but that could have been different

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.180
if he accepted a role for the 2005 drama Syriana.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.010
Ford was offered the part of Bob Barnes, but
turned it down.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.530
George Clooney stepped in and took home a
golden statue on Oscar night.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.930
Ford says it’s one of the few decisions
in his career he regrets, and it’s easy

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:17.930
to see why.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.370
Hopefully the right script comes across his
desk soon and he too can receive film’s

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.900
highest honor.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.480
Michelle Pfeiffer

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.930
The glamorous actress has put together a storied
career full of tremendous performances and

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.100
owned the role of Catwoman in Batman Returns,
but there’s one great part that she didn’t

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.100
put her stamp on.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.600
Pfeiffer was offered the role of Clarice in
Silence of the Lambs, but she turned it down

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.960
because she was put off by the violence and
heavy themes of the story.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.650
Jodie Foster, who was intent on having the
part, got it and won Best Actress at that

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.650
year’s Oscars.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.500
Silence of the Lambs even pulled off the rare
feat of winning the “big five” at the

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.320
ceremony, going down as one of the greatest
films ever made.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:59.300
Pfeiffer has plenty to be proud of, but this
was the chance of a lifetime.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.300
Denzel Washington

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.430
Denzel is in contention to win his third Oscar
this year for his performance in Fences, but

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.380
he’s had his fair share of screw-ups too.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.380
In 1995, Washington was offered the chance
to play Detective Mills in the serial killer

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.210
drama Se7en, but he chose to work on another
detective thriller – Devil in a Blue Dress.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.560
While David Fincher’s Se7en was a big commercial
hit and critical success, Denzel’s movie

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.870
struggled at the box office despite doing
well with critics.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.479
It’s the biggest regret of Washington’s
career, but it may have pushed him to take

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:31.479
Training Day, which won him several awards
in 2001.

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:32.479
Matt Damon

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.520
After the original Bourne trilogy wrapped
up in 2007, Matt Damon had trouble replicating

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.340
the action franchise’s success.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.100
Prior to The Martian, several of his projects
struggled either critically or commercially,

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.449
but he could have been part of one of the
defining films of this generation.

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.150
Damon turned down the role of Harvey Dent
in The Dark Knight, a juicy part that went

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.160
to Aaron Eckhart.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.689
Damon eventually got a chance to work with
Christopher Nolan in Interstellar, but there’s

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:57.479
no denying Harvey Dent was the larger role
that would have been a great showcase for

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:58.479
Damon.

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.150
With all the comic book movies coming through
the pipeline, he’s bound to find something

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.270
in that genre soon.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.270
Will Smith

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.370
The Fresh Prince has slipped a bit in recent
years, but back in the 1990s, he was the biggest

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.029
movie star on the planet.

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:14.469
Coming off the success of Independence Day
and Men in Black, Smith could have chosen

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:16.770
anything he wanted for his next role.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.590
He was offered the part of Neo in the groundbreaking
sci-fi film The Matrix, but he turned it down

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.660
to work on a different genre picture.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.590
That would be Wild, Wild West, and it’s
safe to say that was not a wise choice.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.659
While The Matrix went on to revolutionize
the industry with is incredible special effects,

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:40.500
Wild, Wild West flopped both critically and
commercially, despite Smith’s best efforts.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.500
Chloe Grace-Moretz

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.599
Bursting on to the scene thanks to her role
as Hit Girl in Kick-Ass, Chloe Grace-Moretz

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:49.780
and has been busy ever since, picking up parts
in everything from Best Picture nominees to

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.780
horror remakes.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.300
She’s become omnipresent on the big screen,
but that will change now that she’s stepping

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.570
away from the limelight.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.870
Grace-Moretz dropped out of all her in-development
projects earlier this year, including a live-action

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.099
take of The Little Mermaid.

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:04.960
The actress doesn’t expect her break to
be long, but she wants to reevaluate her career

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.289
and perhaps be more selective about the films
she makes so each one really counts.

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:14.270
Her fans might be upset about this now, but
if it works out for the better, it’ll be

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.060
good for everyone.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.759
Conclusion
Those are just some highly successful actors

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:20.990
that made some puzzling decisions in their
careers.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.059
Are there any we missed?
