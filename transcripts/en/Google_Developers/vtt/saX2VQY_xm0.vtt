TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hey, everybody!

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.746
I'm here at the Google Launchpad
Space in San Francisco.

00:00:06.746 --> 00:00:08.870
Now, one of the cool things
about a space like this

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.532
is all the great people
that you get to run into.

00:00:11.532 --> 00:00:13.906
For example, the crew that
does the Google Cloud Platform

00:00:13.906 --> 00:00:18.240
Podcast is recording
in this room right now.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.110
And I kind of want
to crash the party.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.054
Want to come with me?

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:25.750
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hey, guys!

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.190
BOTH: Hey!

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.480
- How you doing?

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.438
- You recording a podcast
or something in here?

00:00:28.438 --> 00:00:29.180
- Yeah, kind of.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.513
- You mind if I crash the party?

00:00:30.513 --> 00:00:32.424
- Please join us.

00:00:32.424 --> 00:00:33.090
- Hi, everybody!

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.270
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.460
- Yeah, Timothy Jordan
from the Developer Show

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.880
just crashing our podcast.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.640
- It's what we do.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.139
- Yeah!

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.950
How are you doing?

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:40.170
- How am I doing?

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.670
Great!

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.890
I hear that you guys have
a question of the week,

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.050
and I would like to
ask that question.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.400
May I?

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.750
- Please.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:45.735
Please go right ahead right.

00:00:45.735 --> 00:00:48.360
- OK, so, on the Developer Show,
we've been talking a lot about

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.500
machine-learning recently.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.580
And a lot developers
know that TensorFlow

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.830
is a fast, flexible, and
scalable open-source source

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.020
machine learning framework.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.750
But what they don't
all seem to know

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.390
is that you can train
and run TensorFlow models

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.640
on Google Cloud Platform.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.260
Can you tell us a little
bit more about the details?

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.360
- Yeah, that's a great question.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.260
So I think that what
you are referring to

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.125
is what we call the Google Cloud
Machine Learning Platform--

00:01:10.125 --> 00:01:12.400
Cloud ML for short--
and, basically,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.996
it allows you to train models
on Google Cloud Platform

00:01:14.996 --> 00:01:15.620
infrastructure.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.930
Yeah.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.446
- And that's, I
think, really key,

00:01:17.446 --> 00:01:19.820
because once you get into
machine learning pretty deeply,

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.040
your data is so
large and training

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.260
takes so long on
your desktop at home

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.480
that having a scalable
infrastructure to train on

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.316
becomes critical.

00:01:28.316 --> 00:01:30.190
- Yeah, it is definitely
very, very important

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.109
if you're going to
start training models.

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:33.900
So you can start with
either your own model

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.310
or choose one from the
pencil flow framework, which

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.380
is open source.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.150
And then you're going to
need to train those models.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.170
And no matter how big
the data you're using is,

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.980
you're going to be able to do
that on Manage and completely

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.410
scalable infrastructure
on Google Cloud Platform.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.020
And then once
you're done, you're

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.440
going to be able to
serve those train models,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.520
so you can do predictions based
on that with live traffic--

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.630
again, on Google Cloud ML.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.380
- Awesome.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.754
- It's also worth
noting, though,

00:01:59.754 --> 00:02:02.060
if machine learning isn't
particularly your thing,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.380
we have pre-baked
services that you can use.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.490
So we have the Vision API
Speech, natural language

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.378
processing, and the
Translation API.

00:02:09.378 --> 00:02:10.919
These are REST APIs
that have already

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.640
had all the machine-learning
training, and research, all

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.234
done for you.

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:15.400
And they're a REST endpoint.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.608
So if you can call a REST
endpoint from any language,

00:02:17.608 --> 00:02:18.750
you can use those things.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.740
- Well, I will consider
my question answered.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.350
Thank you, gentlemen.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.524
- Awesome.

00:02:21.524 --> 00:02:21.980
Thank you.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:22.480
- Thank you.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.818
- I'll let you get back to your
regularly scheduled podcast.

00:02:25.818 --> 00:02:26.494

- See you, guys!
