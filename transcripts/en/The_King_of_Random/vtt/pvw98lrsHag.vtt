00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.680
After so many hours of use,

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.120
our trash can metal foundry is falling apart.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.900
So in today's video,

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.200
we'll be making an upgrade using
a new bucket and some fire brick.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.200
[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.680
This is a type of brick made from a silica
that is designed to withstand a lot of heat.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.360
This is very similar to the
type of brick as found inside kilns

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.990
designed for firing
ceramics and similar things.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.740
And we want to try and use
this kind of brick

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.020
to line and protect the
inside of our foundry.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.160
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.300
We'll draw up some patterns for
the inside of this foundry,

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.899
and cut our fire bricks into shape so
they fit nicely around the edges.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.100
We'll use Kaowool to fill in any gaps,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.460
and to line the lid.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.240
The Kaowool will be attached to the lid
using some stainless steel hardware.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.560
As with our previous designs,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.140
we'll have two holes in the sides,

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.570
and two holes in the top.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.380
Now, I chose this bucket
because it's a great size.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.220
It seems like it has a pretty
solid handle on it and it's got a lid.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.260
All of those things are necessary.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.020
However,

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.500
you can see that this bucket is black,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.160
and that's not the normal
color of the steel.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.580
This has been powder coated.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.780
That powder coating will burn off
probably the first time we fired it up,

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.120
so just to get ahead of things,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.000
we're going to take a torch
and burn it all off right now.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.300
It's not going to look
as pretty afterward,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.380
but it will work well.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:19.860
[Music]

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.080
It's taking me a while to burn all of
the paint off using our small propane torch,

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.730
so what I'm going to try is to
drill the two holes that I know

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.080
I need in the sides of my bucket,

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.820
hook up the large propane tank,

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.160
and then just let it burn with
no insulation in there at all.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.740
That should heat the
whole thing up really nicely,

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.460
and burn off all the excess paint,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.240
and then we can continue on from there.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.420
I probably need to change the height
of where our burners enter our furnace.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.540
In the past, we had a pretty
thin bottom on here,

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.439
and this time, I think we're going
to use a half of one of these bricks,

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.260
which is going to be about
an inch and half thick.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.040
So that's going to stick up a little bit
more than what we've used before.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.470
So I have a mark where it was before,

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.820
let's go up to about right there.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:17.980
[Music]

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.320
While I'm cutting holes in metal,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.880
might as well cut the
holes in the lid as well.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:36.100
[Music]

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.040
It's probably inevitable,

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.380
that at some point, this handle is 
going to burn up.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.200
But I might be able
to prolong that just a little bit.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.000
[Music]

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.740
This is going so much faster.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.760
I think we are just about there.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.240
Beautiful.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.240
Well, I mean it's ugly.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.980
But how well it worked was beautiful.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.690
Now, we just need to give this
a few minutes to cool off.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.659
While our metal bucket is cooling down,

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.360
and before we clean it
off and do the next steps,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.760
we're going to take some of these
fire bricks and cut them down.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.400
We want the bottom to be about
half of one brick,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.220
and the sides,

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.459
we're going to try and cut
these bricks into thirds.

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.440
So we have about 1 inch slices.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.980
[Music]

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.060
All right. I suspect this is going to make
more dust than pretty much anything

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.980
I've ever done before,

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.460
so I'm going to do it outside,

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.160
and I'm going to be wearing a dust mask.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.920
This fire brick is really fragile stuff.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.879
It's so full of air that it doesn't
have nearly the structural strength

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.680
of regular bricks.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.540
But one advantage of that is that you
can cut it really easily with just a hand saw.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.660
[Music]

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.920
Just because you can cut it easily,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.860
doesn't mean you can cut it well.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.280
So I have to be really careful
to cut in nice straight lines,

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.760
or I'm going to end up with two pieces
that are wildly different thicknesses.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:04:02.600
[Music]

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.620
Not bad.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.880
It's not 100% perfect,

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.940
but that is pretty close
to a nice flat base.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.920
I like it.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.500
Now, we've got to cut
two more bricks into thirds.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.220
This is a million times better in the shade.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:30.720
[Music]

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.800
Now, in the past,

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.240
when we've made these foundries,

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.280
we have used a galvanized steel bucket.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.260
Not one of these black powder coated ones.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.080
And I was trying to switch to
something that was steel,

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.740
but not galvanized steel.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.280
Honestly, I'm not sure if this worked or not,

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.820
the label just said that it was steel.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.980
It didn't specify whether
it was or was not.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.986
The main reason is that
galvanized steel puts off fumes

00:04:51.986 --> 00:04:55.320
that you really don't want to breathe in
when it gets heated up too much.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.360
I always try and avoid the fumes
when I've got my foundry running.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.140
I just like to stand upwind of it,

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.140
and not be breathing in
whatever it's putting off.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.780
So I don't think that really affects
one way or the other too badly.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:06.840
I just thought I would try,

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.180
and if I can get a
non-galvanized steel one,

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.240
I'd use that.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.419
We're going to be using these two bricks,

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.240
which is one brick cut in half as
the very base for our foundry.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.520
However, as you can see they are
larger than the base at the moment,

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.040
so we need to trim them down.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.540
So to cut them down to just the right size,

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.000
we're going to measure the size
of the bottom of our bucket,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.200
trace a circle out that same size,

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.860
place our bricks on top of that,

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.740
and line up where we need
to make some cuts

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.780
so they fit nicely into
the bottom of the bucket.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.980
Excellent.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.260
Let's go trim those corners.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:43.480
[Music]

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.140
All right.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.880
Let's see if this fits or if we need
to do a little bit more trimming.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.820
[Music]

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.400
That fits.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.160
That should give us a nice solid base.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.160
That will do a great job insulating heat,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.870
and not go anywhere.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.500
This firebrick stuff should withstand
quite a bit of stress testing.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.440
Now, we do have a
slightly slant wall bucket,

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.800
so measuring the diameter of the
height above the base

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.500
gives us approximately 10 inches.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.520
Because now, what we need to do
is take our six 1-inch pieces of brick,

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.360
and cut those so that they will
all fit down inside our bucket,

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.660
providing some walls.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.640
[Music]

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.980
You can see the idea of
how we want these bricks to go,

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.020
but they don't fit super
nicely right now

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.720
because they're just a little
bit too wide in places.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.920
So we got to figure out just
how much to trim those

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.740
to make them all fit in nicely together.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.360
Shouldn't take too much trimming,

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.140
I don't think.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.380
To get those measurements,

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:49.410
instead of just cutting up
actually pieces of brick,

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.910
we're going to trace out pieces of
this foam with the same dimensions

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.100
of one end of the brick,

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.860
and lay them out on this circle.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.220
That should let us see
how much they overlap

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.880
and what needs to be trimmed.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.660
[Music]

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.240
By lining these six pieces
up around in a circle,

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.560
we can see how much overlap we have,

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.700
and that gives us a pretty good
idea of what we need to cut.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:17.800
[Music]

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.440
You can see that by trimming off
the corners of all six pieces,

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.180
we should get something that
fits nicely together,

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.840
and backs right up against the
very edges of the bucket.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.500
So what we need to do is
take down these long corners

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.980
to match up with what we've
cut out of the foam here.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.280
And to do that, I'm going
to try using a belt sander,

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.210
and boy, I thought sawing these
was going to be dusty,

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.820
I think the belt sander
is going to put that to shame.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.120
We'll see how well it does.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:57.140
[Music]

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.820
They may have gotten trimmed
a little bit more than necessary,

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:00.850
but do all fit together,

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.340
and I think we can make this work.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.580
We need to be able to pass our torch
heads through two of the brick panels,

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.480
one on each side.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.620
Let's cut those holes.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:16.400
[Music]

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.680
I think it's time to add in our kaowool.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.300
We're going to use that to fill in some
of the gaps around the sides,

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.280
and hold the fire bricks just
where we want them.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.840
And as I said,
we'll use them to line the lid.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:48.540
[Music]

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.220
In the past,

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.660
we've had our kaowool stuck
to the lid using just friction,

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.540
and that works pretty well for a while.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:55.720
As the Kaowool degrades,

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.149
it starts to be a little bit smaller and
lose some of its structural integrity.

00:08:58.149 --> 00:09:00.240
At which point, it starts to just falling out.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.200
So as an upgrade,
we're going to do something,

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.600
like we did with our giant metal foundry,

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.200
and we're gonna use some stainless
steel hardware to hold that all in place.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:12.160
[Music]

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.920
Now, I have an idea for
how I want this to go,

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.600
and I'm actually going to install these
bolts with the head down inside of the lid,

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.140
and my goal is to sort of
make a couple of little feet

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.160
that I can have sticking
down on the bottom,

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.320
so when I remove the lid off of the foundry,

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.540
I can just set it down,

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.620
and the bolts will just
hold it off of the ground.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:36.500
[Music]

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.620
[Music]

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.780
Hey, that's standing.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:46.440
All right. Let's see if this works.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.840
Now, those might be long enough at
this point that they hit the fire brick inside,

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.060
but if they are, we can just
adjust them so they're shorter.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.580
[Music]

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.700
I think that works out nicely.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.660
[Music]

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.760
It fits within the kaowool barrier,

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.300
and does not quite reach the brick.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.310
So, we've now got a lid that goes down on.

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:08.260
The kaowool should be able to stay on,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.300
even after it gets old and start
losing some of its integrity,

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.300
and when we want to remove our lid,

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.820
we can just set it down,

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.660
and it stays off of the ground.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:18.980
The kaowool doesn't hit the dirt.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.750
I don't have to worry about
flipping it over,

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.061
and being quite so careful with it.

00:10:23.061 --> 00:10:24.220
I can just set it down,

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.980
and that will hold itself up.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.680
We've got the bricks lining
the bottom and the sides,

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:30.920
we've got kaowool holding the
bricks right where we want,

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.079
and insulating the top.

00:10:32.079 --> 00:10:34.910
I think all that we need now
is to test this bad boy.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:36.800
Let's get some propane going around in it.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.060
See how it does.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:53.660
[Music]

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.000
I like that feature.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.300
Of course, the real test is going to be
seeing how well this holds up over time.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.580
I'm pretty sure that the bricks are going
to do a better job than just kaowool,

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.160
of staying intact,

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.980
and not starting to fall to pieces.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:09.240
Stay tuned for future videos to see
how it holds up under stress.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.880
Guys, its not over yet.

00:11:11.899 --> 00:11:13.030
There's more for you to see.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:14.920
If you missed our last video
and need to see it again,

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.820
the box up at the top will
take you right there.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.860
The box at the bottom will show you what 
YouTube thinks you need to do watching now,

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.120
and this bomb in the middle will
subscribe you to the channel,

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.700
so you never miss a video.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.740
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:25.880
and we'll see in the next one.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.580
Talk to you then.
