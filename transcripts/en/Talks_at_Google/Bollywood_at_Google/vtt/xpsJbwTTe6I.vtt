[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.180
ROHIT KAPOOR: Good
afternoon, Googlers.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.270
My name is Rohit Kapoor,
and I'm a business manager

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.070
on the global business team.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.370
It is a great honor for
me today to host this talk

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.060
with the magician of
melody, one of the most

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.100
established and versatile
singers in Bollywood, Shaan.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.300
He needs no introduction.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.770
We all know he has sung songs
in more than 12 languages

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.560
for pretty much any big name
we can think of in Bollywood,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.640
right?

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.880
He has also composed music
and has written a lot of songs

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.200
as well.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.790
If you were born
in '80s or '90s,

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.660
you've grown up most
likely singing and dancing

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.730
to his songs.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.240
To name a few popular numbers--

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.050
"Subha Ho Gayi Mamu," "Musu
Musu Hasi," "Woh Pehli Baar,"

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.940
"It's the Time to Disco,"
"Chand Sifarish," "Chaar Kadam,"

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.780
and so many more.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.710
Without further ado,
we are proud, honored,

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.530
and privileged to
have with us here

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.930
the ever-smiling, romantic,
always energetic, the man

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.224
himself, Shantanu Mukherjee.

00:01:18.224 --> 00:01:19.390
Please welcome him on stage.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.425
Welcome, Shaan.

00:01:26.425 --> 00:01:28.300
SHAAN: I have to confess,
I'm very impressed.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.850
I had no clue you were going
to really speak so eloquently

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.715
until [NON-ENGLISH]

00:01:33.715 --> 00:01:35.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.290
You spoke very well.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.290
ROHIT KAPOOR: Thank you.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.810
Thank you.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.940
SHAAN: The guests that come,
in general, you do this?

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:40.770
ROHIT KAPOOR: No, I don't.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.269
I don't.

00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:44.129
SHAAN: [LAUGHS] Big round
of applause for Rohit there.

00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:44.920
He did pretty well.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.560
ROHIT KAPOOR:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Right?

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.003
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.050
SHAAN: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.974
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.470
That was good.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.053
That was good.

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:06.820
I'd like to invite my very, very
dear friend and amazing guitar

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.190
player, Suresh,
Suresh [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.162
He's on tour with me
since the last 16 years--

00:02:12.162 --> 00:02:13.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.550
--with not just myself,
with Asha Bhoslaji,

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.080
with Shankar Ehsaan
Loy, with [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.870
And I heard some squeals
when I said [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.780
Expected.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.280
So Suresh.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.635
ROHIT KAPOOR: Welcome to Google.

00:02:25.635 --> 00:02:27.010
Welcome to Google.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.272
All right, let's have a seat.

00:02:28.272 --> 00:02:30.730
SHAAN: I don't even both-- you
can just Google and find out

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.396
about all of us.

00:02:31.396 --> 00:02:32.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.098
ROHIT KAPOOR: Yeah, we're
going to get to that.

00:02:34.098 --> 00:02:36.370
SHAAN: No wonder we can
get too many people here.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.190
ROHIT KAPOOR: They're going
to watch you live on YouTube.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.315
Not live-- what we call it?

00:02:39.315 --> 00:02:40.190
SHAAN: YouTube, yeah.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.981
ROHIT KAPOOR: Yeah.

00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:41.832
That's a big one.

00:02:41.832 --> 00:02:42.540
But it's pretty--

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.140
SHAAN: I have more
questions for you.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.110
ROHIT KAPOOR: Oh, yes, we're
going to talk about that.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.330
SHAAN: My YouTube's
subscription's not going up.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.871
What do I do?

00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:48.182
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:48.182 --> 00:02:50.390
ROHIT KAPOOR: That's what
I do for my living as well.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.550
So I'm going help you with that.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.466
SHAAN: You're going to
charge me for this now?

00:02:53.466 --> 00:02:54.710
ROHIT KAPOOR: Yeah.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:55.900
Only the food is free.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.866
SHAAN: Whoever says
YouTube gives you money?

00:02:57.866 --> 00:02:59.419
They charge you for everything.

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:01.210
ROHIT KAPOOR: They take
some money as well.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.370
SHAAN: I had the
food that was free.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.000
Next time, I'll pay for it.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.474
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:06.474 --> 00:03:08.140
How can people eat--
what is that farro?

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.114
What is farro?

00:03:10.114 --> 00:03:11.530
ROHIT KAPOOR: I've
never had that.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.210
You can probably tell.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.866
I'm not into
healthy food at all.

00:03:16.866 --> 00:03:17.990
SHAAN: But who's had farro?

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.480
Who likes farro?

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.336
Really?

00:03:21.336 --> 00:03:23.520
AUDIENCE: I ate it today.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.190
SHAAN: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
And then you--

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.641
you've continued to have it?

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:32.427
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:32.427 --> 00:03:34.010
ROHIT KAPOOR: But
it is pretty evident

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.190
your charming and smiling
personality has brought

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.590
a lot more than just
a "Musu Musu Hasi"

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.970
on everyone's face here.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.820
So thank you so much for that.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.094
SHAAN: You know, we've
been on tour now.

00:03:47.094 --> 00:03:48.760
This is the sixth
show here in San Jose.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.400
ROHIT KAPOOR: Wow.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.640
SHAAN: So [NON-ENGLISH],, as
soon as we enter-- oh, my god,

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.556
it's not a full house.

00:03:52.556 --> 00:03:53.560
What's happening?

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.870
Bring in the people.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.370
ROHIT KAPOOR: Not
quite used to this.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.786
SHAAN: Tell them we have one
ticket free with another one.

00:03:57.786 --> 00:03:58.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.730
Luckily for me, the shows
have gone really well.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.271
And we've had full
houses everywhere.

00:04:02.271 --> 00:04:04.147
And the San Jose one
was absolutely fabulous.

00:04:04.147 --> 00:04:05.229
ROHIT KAPOOR: As expected.

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:06.490
SHAAN: And so yeah.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.572
That's in [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:07.572 --> 00:04:09.280
But from here, it
looks fine, because you

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.363
can't see the empty seats.

00:04:10.363 --> 00:04:12.660
You guys blocked them well.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.852
So yeah, now, let
me start talking.

00:04:14.852 --> 00:04:16.060
ROHIT KAPOOR: We are talking.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.976
SHAAN: Start the song?

00:04:16.976 --> 00:04:18.050
Start the song, guys?

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.060
ROHIT KAPOOR: Yeah,
let's do that.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.120
SHAAN: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.130
ROHIT KAPOOR: Oh,
yeah, let's do that.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.379
Let's warm it up a little bit.

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:23.590
SHAAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.090
ROHIT KAPOOR: Let's start with
your Google connection first.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.780
Like, Google--

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:27.940
SHAAN: Google
connection, of course.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:28.220
Of course, of course.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.248
ROHIT KAPOOR: Your life has
been a search throughout.

00:04:31.248 --> 00:04:34.510
Your journey of music and being
a part of the music industry

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.580
has been focused on searching
what I'm going to do next.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.700
And Google, as you know,
is a search engine.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.030
So anything you can
tell us about that,

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.300
and then probably start
off with a song as well.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.800
SHAAN: Once I've got over being
so impressed by you, I will.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.341
It's amazing.

00:04:49.341 --> 00:04:50.310
You have this connect.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.856
Of course, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:04:51.856 --> 00:04:52.850
Yeah, I have also--

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.755
I've never really been
very proactively seeking,

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:58.960
so I'd rather call
myself more of a

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.742
searching types
and browsing types.

00:05:01.742 --> 00:05:03.200
And one thing led
to another thing,

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.690
and things just kind
of happened for me.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:07.690
I didn't make it happen.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.189
[SNEEZING]

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:11.095
So yeah, just like that sneeze.

00:05:11.095 --> 00:05:12.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.866
It just happened.

00:05:14.866 --> 00:05:18.626
So [NON-ENGLISH]

00:05:18.626 --> 00:05:21.116
[GUITAR PLAYING]

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.610
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:05:26.821 --> 00:05:27.794
CREW: It's on.

00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:28.294
It just--

00:05:28.294 --> 00:05:29.502
ROHIT KAPOOR: [INAUDIBLE] OK.

00:05:29.502 --> 00:05:30.770
SHAAN: [NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:07:15.478 --> 00:07:17.954
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:17.954 --> 00:07:18.454
Thank you.

00:07:18.454 --> 00:07:20.438
Thank you.

00:07:20.438 --> 00:07:26.110
That's a song I often
sing for my voice.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:31.760
Like at the moment [NON-ENGLISH]
Bring that voice back.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.516
So yeah, not having a
great voice day today.

00:07:34.516 --> 00:07:36.390
ROHIT KAPOOR: Fantastic
start, though, right?

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.940
SHAAN: Self-attestment
is very important.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:41.830
ROHIT KAPOOR: It is.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:42.329
It is, yeah.

00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:43.590
SHAAN: People can flatter you.

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:44.380
It's easy.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.810
[NON-ENGLISH] especially
on [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.880
You put something
out on YouTube.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.930
You know it's not good.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.320
And it's strange-- wow!

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.120
Awesome!

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.230
Emoji, emoji, emoji,
super, super, super, super.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.420
I wonder when
they're doing it what

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.806
must be on their state of mind.

00:08:00.806 --> 00:08:01.750
[NON-ENGLISH]

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:02.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:04.764 --> 00:08:06.180
ROHIT KAPOOR:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:12.950
SHAAN: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.720
Fantastic, awesome,
loved it, superb.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.470
ROHIT KAPOOR: OK, let's
not get into that.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.600
Yeah, it could take us a couple
of days just on that one.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.970
But, yeah, OK,
awesome, awesome start.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:26.910
Thank you again.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.610
But let's go back to the agenda.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.230
I was really curious
as well to know

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:38.000
about your family's involvement
in the music industry,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.480
and their journey a little
bit, and how then you grew up

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.740
into the musical family.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.600
SHAAN: Ah, totally,
it's a family business

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.994
for three generations.

00:08:46.994 --> 00:08:48.410
The business hasn't
done too well,

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:49.880
but it is a family business.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.900
ROHIT KAPOOR: It's
doing really well.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.691
SHAAN: Because we don't
know anything else.

00:08:52.691 --> 00:08:56.810
But yes, my grandfather
was a composer, a singer.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:59.270
He was also a wonderful
teacher of music.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:02.810
He had a lot of students
would come in and learn music

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:06.550
from him, classically trained.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:12.260
His genre is Bengali
devotional music.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.330
They do this Shyama Sangeet.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:15.440
Any Bengalis here?

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.155
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:16.871
SHAAN: Huh.

00:09:16.871 --> 00:09:18.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.420
Can you explain Shyama Sangeet?

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.410
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sure.

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.990
SHAAN: Because I
just know he's--

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:25.790
OK, she's going to--

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.030
oh, there's a mic there.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.830
Ah.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.700
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so Shyama is
another name for Goddess Kali,

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:32.260
as you know.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.330
And Bengalis are
very much, you know--

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.280
they're in love
with Goddess Kali,

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.870
because anything black
is beautiful for us.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:44.120
So Shyama Sangeet is a special
devotional kind of song

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.360
just to offer our love and
prayer to Goddess Kali.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.730
And all the
Bengalis, I think, we

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.350
are in love with Shyama Sangeet.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.286
SHAAN: Yeah, there's a strange--

00:09:53.286 --> 00:09:54.410
AUDIENCE: Connection to it.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.150
SHAAN: Yeah, it makes me cry.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.340
ROHIT KAPOOR: Oh, wow.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.240
SHAAN: Shyama Sangeet,
it's beautiful.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:57.420
You must hear it.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.836
AUDIENCE: Then we
would definitely

00:09:58.836 --> 00:10:01.590
like to hear a few lines
of Shyama Sangeet from you.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:06.810
SHAAN: I just dug a really big
hole and buried myself in it.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.870
ROHIT KAPOOR: Don't get
emotional yet, though.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.926
We don't want you to
get emotional yet.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:15.319

00:10:15.319 --> 00:10:16.610
ROHIT KAPOOR: You asked for it.

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:17.620
You know that.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.930
SHAAN: No, I was talking
about my grandfather,

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.340
but there's a lot of
[INAUDIBLE] in that, you know?

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.284
ROHIT KAPOOR: Yeah.

00:10:24.284 --> 00:10:26.228
[VOCALIZING]

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.338
SHAAN: It has that kind
of feel, but I don't know.

00:10:31.338 --> 00:10:32.802
[VOCALIZING]

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.510
That's, of course, [INAUDIBLE]
I think [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:40.856
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.920
It's similar notes,
but I'm obviously not

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.240
an expert on Shyama Sangeet.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.490
And I think we
started off on a--

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:04.350
thank you.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:04.850
Thank you.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:05.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:06.500
ROHIT KAPOOR: Thank you for--

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.870
SHAAN: You didn't
have to do this.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.100
ROHIT KAPOOR: Thank
you for the explanation

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.330
and putting him on the spot.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.202
AUDIENCE: It's all
about the devotion,

00:11:12.202 --> 00:11:14.666
and [INAUDIBLE] a
beautiful devotion song.

00:11:14.666 --> 00:11:17.510
So Goddess Kali
will be overwhelmed

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.360
with this [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.360
ROHIT KAPOOR: Thank you.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.080
And for people like me, who have
heard this for the first time.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:27.030
SHAAN: So we've been a
family of Kali devotees.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:31.370
No, that doesn't explain
my complexion at all, guys.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:32.420
These guys, huh?

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.390
Under breath.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:34.890
I can hear under breath.

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:36.930
I'm very good at that.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.430
So that was my
grandfather's story.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.350
Then my father, of course,
came down to Bombay

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:42.090
and pursued his
career as a composer.

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:44.040
And he composed with
quite a few friends,

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.636
but I lost him very early.

00:11:45.636 --> 00:11:47.010
The industry lost
him very early.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:50.670
He was all of 43, and then I
lost him to a heart attack.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:53.670
I was just 14 then.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:55.740
Of course, he was a
huge romantic too.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:00.390
So my mother, again, they
met at [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:03.030
It was a music school.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.555
Yeah.

00:12:03.555 --> 00:12:03.810
So--

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.434
ROHIT KAPOOR: So it
started from there?

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:10.920
SHAAN: So yeah, my mom, too,
sang in the industry in chorus,

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.140
you know, group singing.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:17.350
So she did that for 30
years from 1970 to 2000.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.710
She won a Phalke,
Dadasaheb Phalke

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:22.780
Award for her contribution
in that field.

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:24.210
So that is wonderful.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:25.600
So she sang until 2000.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.992
2000 is when my career
got a bit of a kickstart.

00:12:29.992 --> 00:12:31.950
ROHIT KAPOOR: A lot more
than just a kickstart.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:35.379
SHAAN: Yeah, it was a
turning point for me.

00:12:35.379 --> 00:12:37.920
And so very sweetly, she went
and told all the then-composers

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.370
that we made a [NON-ENGLISH],, so
it's a little hard for me to be

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:45.540
singing in chorus if
he's there singing.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.550
So she pulled out.

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:50.820
So, yeah, dad, mom, sister
Sagarika, of course.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.200
ROHIT KAPOOR: Of course.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.450
SHAAN: So yeah, that's
our family business.

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:55.200
ROHIT KAPOOR: Wow.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.460
Fantastic.

"Love-ology [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.510
That song was awesome, and
the video was even better.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.280
Was it your idea
to be dressed up

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.940
as a scholarly, nerdy guy in
the video and make it really

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.554
quirky?

00:13:10.554 --> 00:13:12.720
SHAAN: No, see, at that
point, I wasn't very serious

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:16.710
about my career or
about singing, honestly.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:21.210
I just had a very, very
terrible growing up times--

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:25.645
acne, no money, no women.

00:13:25.645 --> 00:13:27.270

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:30.540
ROHIT KAPOOR: I relate
to the last one.

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:31.485
SHAAN: --I really
thought of this--

ROHIT KAPOOR: I relate
to the last one.

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:32.700
SHAAN: What?

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:33.600
You didn't have acne?

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.920
ROHIT KAPOOR: No.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.580
SHAAN: Really?

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.190
ROHIT KAPOOR: I
didn't have women.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:40.060
SHAAN: So I guess the
want wasn't there.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:45.960
I had acne, so the want
was there, but no women.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.370
[NON-ENGLISH] But anyway.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.619
So yes, it's hormonal, right?

00:13:50.619 --> 00:13:51.410
ROHIT KAPOOR: Yeah.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:53.210
SHAAN: Acne.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:55.090 --> 00:14:00.810
So then I made this song, and
"Love-ology" [NON-ENGLISH]

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:04.810
I was a good student, but
that was the one subject

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:05.940
that I was terrible at.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.770
So I said, I'll do the song.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.100
I'll go to Ken Ghosh, who
is a dear friend of mine,

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.725
who was making the
videos for everyone,

00:14:11.725 --> 00:14:14.070
and tell him, now,
make me look good.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.210
And get these girls
to swoon over me,

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:17.730
and create a video like that.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:20.380
And he wouldn't stop laughing.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.020
He said, you honestly don't have
a mirror at home and whatever.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.247
So I can't do that.

00:14:24.247 --> 00:14:25.830
I'll have to spend
too much money on--

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.970

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.030
Thanks again for
doing that for us.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:24.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:26.046
SHAAN: You don't have
friends in the industry.

00:16:26.046 --> 00:16:28.460
You don't see it.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:32.717
ROHIT KAPOOR: And then you
did "Q-Funk Is Here to Stay."

00:16:32.717 --> 00:16:34.050
SHAAN: "Q-Funk" was before that.

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:34.910
ROHIT KAPOOR: Oh,
it was before that?

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:35.410
SHAAN: Yeah.

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:38.490
"Q-Funk" started off-- we were
just signed up by this company,

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:39.529
Magna Sound.

00:16:39.529 --> 00:16:40.320
And God bless them.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.970
They have been
instrumental in creating

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.809
that whole '90s, non-film,
[INAUDIBLE] thing.

00:16:44.809 --> 00:16:46.100
ROHIT KAPOOR: Indian pop music.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:46.601
SHAAN: Yeah.

00:16:46.601 --> 00:16:48.100
I was talking to
Vikas, and he said,

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.225
don't you miss those times?

00:16:49.225 --> 00:16:50.224
ROHIT KAPOOR: I miss it.

00:16:50.224 --> 00:16:51.760
I mostly miss those
times for sure.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.450
SHAAN: Those times,
they are a blur for me,

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:57.480
because I'm an '80s person.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.695
So yeah, the '90s.

00:16:58.695 --> 00:17:01.280
But yeah, I know that,
for a lot of '90s people,

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.255
was a fantastic time.

00:17:04.255 --> 00:17:05.630
Most of you are
born in the '90s,

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:06.796
so you can't be '90s people.

00:17:06.796 --> 00:17:11.369
But anyway, so that's
how it happened.

00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:14.825
Magna Sound, we did a
lot of sessions singing

00:17:14.825 --> 00:17:15.950
for some of their artists--

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:16.774
Sarita Sethi.

00:17:16.774 --> 00:17:18.190
There's a guy
called [INAUDIBLE]..

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:19.480
He was from this
part of the world.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.730
ROHIT KAPOOR: Bombay, the
number one has [INAUDIBLE]..

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:25.230
SHAAN: [SINGING] [INAUDIBLE]
Sagarika did all the hooks

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:26.829
for him.

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:28.640
And I did a song on his album.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.940
ROHIT KAPOOR: Nice.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.180
SHAAN: So then they took us
on, saying, let's get you

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.910
guys recording contracts.

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:37.680
I had just gone
to [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.450
So I went then, and I
had just shaved my head.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:43.560
Do you say shave your
head or shave your hair?

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:44.630
No, shave your head, of course.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.780
ROHIT KAPOOR: Head.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:45.860
SHAAN: Terrible.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:50.090
So anyway, so then they were
like, no, we can't sign you up.

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:51.430
I was like, why?

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.750
You got a terrible hairstyle.

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:55.140
I said, but it's going to grow.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.890
This is crazy.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:00.030
You can't let me not have a deal
because I'm not actually bald.

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:02.010
I've just shaved my head.

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:03.480
It was fickle then.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.290
It's gotten even more
fickle now, though,

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:06.600
but that was the industry.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.120
Then I came back
with that long hair.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.230
I didn't cut my hair.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.110
And I said, [NON-ENGLISH]

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:13.540
If it's all about--

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:14.250
yay.

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:15.090
Yeah.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:16.673
ROHIT KAPOOR: And
that was [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:16.673 --> 00:18:19.294
SHAAN: Yeah, it reminded me
of telling them, balls to you.

00:18:19.294 --> 00:18:20.490
[NON-ENGLISH]

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.995
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:24.121 --> 00:18:25.620
ROHIT KAPOOR: Oh,
man, balls to you.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:26.010
SHAAN: They signed
me up on that.

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:27.120
ROHIT KAPOOR: I
love balls to you.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:27.620
SHAAN: Yeah.

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:29.790
They signed me up.

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:31.470
You've got long hair now.

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:32.450
ROHIT KAPOOR: Oh,
man, that's fantastic.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:33.120
SHAAN: And yeah, that was it.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.286
And then I see those videos.

00:18:34.286 --> 00:18:35.880
Have you all seen those videos?

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:40.240
Oh, my god, it's
like "Caveman 2--"

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.360
hair everywhere and
unkempt and crazy.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:47.240
But anyway, "Love-ology,"
[NON-ENGLISH] and "50/50,"

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.580
so all those initial--

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:49.210
"Q-Funk."

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:51.740
ROHIT KAPOOR: "Q-Funk" and
then some remixes as well.

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.161
[NON-ENGLISH] and what not.

00:18:53.161 --> 00:18:53.660
Fantastic.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:54.950
SHAAN: So all that
happened with that company.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:55.800
It was brilliant.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:00.030
ROHIT KAPOOR: And then after
that, [NON-ENGLISH] happened.

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:03.560
What a project to bring
such amazing artists

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.395
to bring together and create
a magical masterpiece.

00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:07.199
SHAAN: True.

00:19:07.199 --> 00:19:09.740
ROHIT KAPOOR: "Musu Musu Hasi,"
"Wo Pehli Baar" and all that.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.070
Tell us something
about that project.

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.320
SHAAN: Yeah, that was amazing.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.070
That was the idea.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.730
They wanted to have all
first-timers to work on it.

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:19.430
Obviously, the film
didn't do well.

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:20.940
Experienced people
[NON-ENGLISH]..

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.730
But they got a
lot of guys right.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:27.870
I mean, almost everyone
involved in that film

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:32.470
went on to doing really well,
if not in their careers,

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:34.639
then in their lives.

00:19:34.639 --> 00:19:36.930
Because some didn't do well
in their careers afterward.

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:38.280
And I said, I have to
back it with something.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.321
ROHIT KAPOOR: You have to
be politically correct.

00:19:40.321 --> 00:19:43.650
SHAAN: But in terms of
music, if you look at music,

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:46.650
it launched Vishal
Dadlani as a composer, who

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:50.430
then, during that time, teamed
up with Shekhar Ravjiani, who

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:53.010
was also launched
as a composer-singer

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.030
in the same film.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.820
He sang a duet with a lady
called Mahalakshmi Iyer, who

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.370
went on to singing.

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:00.599
Everyone knows Mahalakshmi.

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:01.140
There was me.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.190
There was Salim-Sulaiman.

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:03.510
It was their first project.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.340
There was [? KK ?]
in that project.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:09.090
So it was an amazing project,
which is like Halley's comet

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:13.690
[NON-ENGLISH]

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:14.850
So that was a good start.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:17.840
ROHIT KAPOOR: And what happened
with deu nalai lai and deu

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.337
malai lai?

00:20:20.337 --> 00:20:22.420
SHAAN: We were very
dedicated, both me and Vishal.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:23.430
It was our first song.

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:25.620
We really wanted to
give it everything.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.320
So we hung in there all of
20 minutes in the studio.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.160
And we were like, bro, let's--

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.430
ROHIT KAPOOR: Oh, yeah.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.720
SHAAN: So we went out
and sitting on the sofas,

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.690
having free coffee.

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.190
I still don't miss
a free coffee.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:38.750
ROHIT KAPOOR: Oh, yeah.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:39.390
SHAAN: Google [NON-ENGLISH]

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:41.180
ROHIT KAPOOR: We'll get you
a coffee in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.250
SHAAN: Anyway, so we
were sitting there,

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:43.645
and then suddenly, they
rushed out and said that there

00:20:43.645 --> 00:20:45.330
is a pronunciation problem.

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:46.440
It's a Nepali thing.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.480
And it's deu nalai lai.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.440
There's no deu malai.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.523
There's no malai in Nepal.

00:20:50.523 --> 00:20:53.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:57.600
So it was like,
really, now, Vishal?

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:03.370
You want to go back in and then
drop all that all over again?

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.560
He's like, ah, forget it.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.890
Keep it like that.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:08.100
We were very dedicated.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.620
We didn't want to have done--

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.550
leave no stone unturned.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:16.810
And see, that dedication
has gotten us so far.

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:17.650
Yeah.

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:20.470

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:22.720
For sure.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.560
SHAAN: So should we sing that?

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.600
Should we sing that?

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.260
Oh, we can do that little--

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.217
should we do that
on a trick thing?

00:21:28.217 --> 00:21:29.800
My voice is too bad,
but we'll try it.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.485
We can try it.

SURESH: The Police?

00:21:31.276 --> 00:21:33.820
SHAAN: Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, let's try.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.410
We're going to play
a riff of a song.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.290
If you guess the song,
then we'll sing it for you.

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:37.880
ROHIT KAPOOR: OK.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.060
SHAAN: OK?

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:39.550
ROHIT KAPOOR: Yeah, up for it.

Google it, dude.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:49.950
No.

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:53.030
Use your ears.

Because I forgot I
could sing anything,

and no one would know.

00:23:10.764 --> 00:23:12.230
No one knows this song.

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:13.820
It's a shame.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:19.630
It's the greatest hit ever by
Police, but from another era.

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:20.220

huge, huge classic.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.010
ROHIT KAPOOR: Thank
you for the rendition.

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:36.830
That was fantastic.

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:38.500

heard of Sting, I'm sure.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.460
ROHIT KAPOOR: Oh, yeah.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:43.507
SHAAN: Yeah, so Police was the
band that he started off with.

00:23:43.507 --> 00:23:45.090
ROHIT KAPOOR: And
then after that, you

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:50.160
got a project with
Anu Malik and SRK,

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.875
almost acted in that movie.

00:23:51.875 --> 00:23:53.250

said, after that,

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:54.720
you meant, like, we
spoke about Sting

and now, we'll talk about--

00:23:55.845 --> 00:23:57.769
ROHIT KAPOOR: Yeah.

00:23:57.769 --> 00:23:58.560
Totally after that.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.290
After "Mus Musu Hasi" happened.

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:02.140
SHAAN: Sting [NON-ENGLISH]

00:24:05.571 --> 00:24:08.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.680
It's not a laughing matter.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.830
I want to take that back.

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:15.380
I've been around from--

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:16.340
no, honestly.

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:17.049
I don't want to--

00:24:17.049 --> 00:24:18.673
you guys are going
to laugh, and you'll

00:24:18.673 --> 00:24:20.400
think I'm just
making fun of Anuji.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.300
And I've done it--

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:22.591
ROHIT KAPOOR: You've done that.

00:24:22.591 --> 00:24:24.310
SHAAN: --many times
in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:26.710
He publicly has appreciated
it, but then personally

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:28.805
has flogged me for that.

00:24:28.805 --> 00:24:31.620
I haven't worked with him
for the longest time since.

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.510
No, kidding, kidding.

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:38.070
Anuji is truly the
only composer who's

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:44.010
actually had the longest career
span any composer in Bollywood

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:45.430
has had--

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:46.640
successful, longest stint.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.970
So that's pretty amazing.

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:52.026
And for me, he's been a mentor
of sorts from all the songs

00:24:52.026 --> 00:24:52.650
that I've sung.

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:54.274
I've not sung too
many hits with Anuji,

00:24:54.274 --> 00:24:56.660
but I've sung a lot of
songs, 50-odd songs for him.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.000
ROHIT KAPOOR: Wow.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.865
SHAAN: Yeah, and so
it's been fantastic.

00:25:03.865 --> 00:25:04.527
And SRK?

00:25:04.527 --> 00:25:06.110
ROHIT KAPOOR: Did
you end up featuring

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:07.370
in that song with SRK?

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:09.172
SHAAN: Oh, that's
a song [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:09.172 --> 00:25:10.130
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:11.710
"Asoka," "Asoka."

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:12.250
Yeah.

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.166
Do you know they're both
born on the same day?

00:25:14.166 --> 00:25:15.270
ROHIT KAPOOR: Who?

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:16.590
SHAAN: On the same date--

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:17.650
November 2.

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:18.840
Anuji and SRK.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.548
ROHIT KAPOOR: Oh, no,
I didn't know that.

00:25:20.548 --> 00:25:21.390
SHAAN: Yeah.

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:25.098
Any of you born on November 2?

00:25:25.098 --> 00:25:27.560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.000
SHAAN: Really?

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.220
SHAAN: No, I'm sure
you know him better.

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.430
Yeah, that's a
silly think to ask.

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:35.860
Really?

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:36.892
No.

00:25:36.892 --> 00:25:37.710
November 2?

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:39.655
Yeah, can I see your ID?

00:25:39.655 --> 00:25:41.240
No, but that's amazing.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.040
That's amazing.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.610
I think you're going
to be a very tenacious

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:48.490
and a very, very brave person.

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:49.740
ROHIT KAPOOR: She probably is.

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:50.900
SHAAN: What do her
friends think of her?

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:51.770
AUDIENCE: I can vouch for her.

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:53.269
SHAAN: Does she
have friends at all?

00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:54.784
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:54.784 --> 00:25:55.620
OK, that's good.

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:55.910
That's good.

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:57.660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
I can vouch for her.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:58.850
SHAAN: Yes.

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:02.180
So OK, we'll talk
about anything, but--

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:03.390
sorry, I've digressed.

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:04.099
ROHIT KAPOOR: No.

00:26:04.099 --> 00:26:05.556
Did you end up
acting in that song?

00:26:05.556 --> 00:26:07.310
SHAAN: Oh, that song,
I did get an offer.

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:07.850
I did get an offer.

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:08.600
I was too nervous.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.350
It was very early.

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:12.680
I didn't know that if you
were featured in big films,

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:17.990
and you give into
being a part of--

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:20.240
I didn't know how that
worked at that point.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.871
I asked for money.

00:26:21.871 --> 00:26:22.870
ROHIT KAPOOR: Of course.

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.430
SHAAN: And they were
like, dude, you're

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:31.640
going to be featuring in a film
with SRK and Karina Kapoor.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.822
And I was like, yeah,
I want more money.

00:26:34.822 --> 00:26:35.786
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:35.786 --> 00:26:36.300
ROHIT KAPOOR: Why not, right?

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.050
SHAAN: I just realized
this is a big film.

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:41.780
God bless his soul.

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.230
The person isn't here anymore.

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:46.070
But we had that little
telephone-- two or three--

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.780
conversations.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:47.900
He was very sweet.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:51.300
He was Juhi Chawlaji's
brother, Bobby Chawla.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.600
He was handling the production.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.450
So I remember the conversation.

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:54.390
He was shocked.

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:56.640
He's like, do you
even know how this--

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.322
I mean, really?

00:26:58.322 --> 00:26:59.530
So he even offered something.

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:00.361
I said, no, no.

00:27:00.361 --> 00:27:01.860
Three days work and
that much money?

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.750
No, no, no, I want more money.

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:06.276
So I was quite stupid then.

00:27:06.276 --> 00:27:07.180
Yeah.

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:09.120
ROHIT KAPOOR: So you
didn't end up doing it?

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.250
SHAAN: No, I didn't
end up doing it.

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:14.430
And, you know, later, when
I saw the video, of course,

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:16.009
there was the man himself.

00:27:16.009 --> 00:27:18.300
But I thought I was going to
get the little tribal part

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.210
in the beginning before
Sharukh Khan actually

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:22.110
comes into the frame.

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:22.760
ROHIT KAPOOR: Thank
you for not doing it.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.010
SHAAN: Did you see that video?

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:28.174
It's that song
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:27:28.174 --> 00:27:30.090
He should play the guitar
for me for this one.

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:30.629
I'm kidding.

00:27:30.629 --> 00:27:31.670
I think it's in E, right?

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:32.970
[GUITAR PLAYING]

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:35.370
Ah!

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:36.810
[CLAPPING]

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:44.970
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:28:12.052 --> 00:28:13.052
ROHIT KAPOOR: Fantastic.

00:28:13.052 --> 00:28:15.522
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:18.380
SHAAN: That was [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.660
So yeah, there was a little
story with this song.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.840
When I went to
adopt this song, I

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.630
was supposed to be in
Nagpur for a concert

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:29.075
that I didn't want to
go to because it was--

00:28:29.075 --> 00:28:30.500
it's a long story, anyway.

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:31.958
There were some
gangsters involved.

00:28:31.958 --> 00:28:34.010
And it was all crazy,
and I hate being

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:38.036
sort of bullied into doing
things that I don't want to do.

00:28:38.036 --> 00:28:39.630
ROHIT KAPOOR: Sure.

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:42.200
SHAAN: And I was young,
again, not just foolish,

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.770
but very foolish to take
chances like this then.

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:49.010
I thought it was being gutsy,
but I learned the hard way

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:49.890
that it's not.

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:53.740
Anyway, so Anuji
was [NON-ENGLISH]

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.046
You must go for that.

00:28:55.046 --> 00:28:56.795
So for the first time,
we used technology.

00:28:56.795 --> 00:29:00.175
So in this song, I've only
sung about four lines.

00:29:00.175 --> 00:29:01.550
ROHIT KAPOOR: In
the entire song?

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:02.049
SHAAN: Yes.

00:29:02.049 --> 00:29:03.680
And he's just placed it.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.125
ROHIT KAPOOR: Oh, wow.

00:29:05.125 --> 00:29:06.750
So was that the first
time you did this

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:07.806
or in previous recording?

00:29:07.806 --> 00:29:09.180
SHAAN: I told him,
don't do this.

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:09.610
I'll do it.

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:10.110
I'll do it.

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:10.710
I'll sing it.

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.980
I'll sing it.

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.270
But I think Anuji
was just too excited

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:14.519
about this whole new technology
that had just come in,

00:29:14.519 --> 00:29:16.730
so he just wanted to
try it any which way.

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.080
So he said, hey, just
sing four lines probably,

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.794
and I'll paste it everywhere.

00:29:20.794 --> 00:29:22.710
ROHIT KAPOOR: Probably
22 years later we get--

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:25.299
SHAAN: Every time [INAUDIBLE]
comes, it's the same line.

00:29:25.299 --> 00:29:26.840
There's another song
that's happened.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.340
And strangely, both
these songs have

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.940
been written by my favorite and
the one and only [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.640
The other song was a song
in a film called "Yahaan,"

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:40.540
beautiful song, Shreya Goshal,
Shantanu Moitra's music.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.200
So that happened
that I came in and I

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.940
was supposed to sing two lines.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:46.610
I think it was a song
that obviously we

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:48.440
don't do in a concert so much.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.240
Because it's a total
Shreya Goshal song.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.084
I just have two lines in it.

00:29:53.084 --> 00:29:54.500

So I just have, if you
notice the whole thing,

00:29:58.690 --> 00:29:59.675
there are actually
just three lines,

00:29:59.675 --> 00:30:01.190
but they keep coming
back in the song.

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:02.315

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:09.260
There are these two or
three lines that I've sung.

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:10.700
And it turned into a duet.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.230
They kept bringing
those lines back.

great work, Shaan.

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:16.380
SHAAN: Google can tell you.

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:18.650
How I sang it
identically the same way.

00:30:21.165 --> 00:30:23.290
ROHIT KAPOOR: Actually,
thank you for sharing that.

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:25.160
And now you just
mentioned something

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.230
that Google can share with us.

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:28.672

that this is going to be out,

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:31.629
they will.

00:30:31.629 --> 00:30:32.660

a sucker for social issues.

they haven't

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:02.192
And just waiting for
the blame game thing--

00:31:02.192 --> 00:31:04.400
blaming for the bureaucrats,
blaming the bureaucrats,

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.620
blaming the government.

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:08.630
It's not going to help.

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:11.910
I feel that people are there.

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:13.220
They're here listening to you.

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:16.160
You may as well make
the right noises.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:22.720
We all have our social model,
I'd also like to say ethical--

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:23.720
ROHIT KAPOOR: Principle.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:24.803
SHAAN: --responsibilities.

00:31:24.803 --> 00:31:28.520
And we have to use
those responsibly.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:32.120
So whenever I've had a chance
to be a part of any social,

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:35.210
through song, or even
through campaign,

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:37.160
I've always been a part of it.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:42.200
And in that sense, I think I may
have the record for the highest

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:47.240
number of social cause songs
any artist in the world

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:47.810
may have had.

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:48.305
ROHIT KAPOOR: That's fantastic.

00:31:48.305 --> 00:31:48.935

00:31:48.935 --> 00:31:51.800
SHAAN: If I start
counting, it's crazy.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.380
Almost every river song--
suddenly, there was the thing.

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:55.690
They made songs on rivers.

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:57.410
So I was a part of
every river song,

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:59.494
even the Rally for
River thing by Sadhguru.

00:31:59.494 --> 00:32:01.160
There was a river for
Brahmaputra River.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.440
There was another river
in Assam I didn't know of.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.170
I found it out when I
went to do the song.

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:10.850
And I forgot the name now, but
it runs from another angle.

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:12.475
Comes in from Bangladesh.

00:32:12.475 --> 00:32:13.850
Anyone knows which
river this is?

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:18.410
It crosses-- OK, forget it.

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:21.089
It's not a course on geography.

00:32:21.089 --> 00:32:22.380
ROHIT KAPOOR: We can Google it.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:26.184
SHAAN: But then Narmada
River, so lots of rivers.

00:32:26.184 --> 00:32:28.100
Then of course, the
regular ones when it comes

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:30.620
to AIDS and child education.

ROHIT KAPOOR: Tobacco.

00:32:31.645 --> 00:32:32.270
SHAAN: Tobacco.

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:34.832
I made a song on tobacco
called "Life Se Panga."

00:32:34.832 --> 00:32:35.540
I don't know if--

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:36.040
Suresh.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.020
SHAAN: --he can play it.

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:44.694
He puts me in a
spot all the time.

00:32:44.694 --> 00:32:45.610
ROHIT KAPOOR: He does?

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:48.417
SHAAN: Sometimes someone
makes a [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:32:48.417 --> 00:32:49.750
And he starts playing the intro.

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:51.500

don't know the song.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:54.850
And then he'll do
a little whisper.

00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:55.520
He'll call me.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.490
I'll come, and he
knows the song too.

00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:58.390
ROHIT KAPOOR: Thank you, Suresh.

00:32:58.390 --> 00:32:58.889
Thank you.

00:32:58.889 --> 00:33:02.900

jazz, to any genre of music--

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:03.970

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:05.959
--he can play for you.

00:33:05.959 --> 00:33:07.750
ROHIT KAPOOR: So let's
do the tobacco song.

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:09.110

much more on Suresh than on me.

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:10.026
ROHIT KAPOOR: Exactly.

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:12.490

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:13.166
He's fantastic.

00:33:13.166 --> 00:33:14.290
So this one-- you remember?

00:33:17.169 --> 00:33:18.210
Because I don't actually.

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:19.350
But anyway, it's long back.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:21.100
We did this wonderful
campaign, because we

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:24.149
got to know that from age 13 to
15 is when you get this habit.

00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:26.190
And once you've got this
habit at that early age,

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:27.882
it's very difficult
for you to lose it.

00:33:27.882 --> 00:33:30.340
And I realized that's exactly
what took my father away too.

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:31.506
He started very early at 13.

00:33:31.506 --> 00:33:36.000
And by the time he was 43,
he had this nicotine patch,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.980
not the nicotine
patch people put.

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:38.981
It was inside his lungs.

ROHIT KAPOOR: A deposit.

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:40.746
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:33:40.746 --> 00:33:42.120
SHAAN: Like a
cloud in his lungs,

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.866
which caused his heart attack.

00:33:45.866 --> 00:33:49.585
It was called "Life
Se Punga Mat Le Yaar."

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.390
It was a fun song.

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:08.590
See, he put me on the spot.

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:10.340
I could have easily
claimed Suresh, oh, he

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:12.673
doesn't know the music, so
I'll sing it some other time.

00:34:12.673 --> 00:34:14.060
But that was the kind of song.

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:16.050
So it did really well.

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:16.550
It worked.

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:20.370
And not just a song--
then we went to Delhi.

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:25.360
We spoke at the
health ministry thing.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.570
We went to Tata Hospital.

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:27.139
We visited.

00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:29.090
You know, the
cancer cells there.

00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:33.639
And eventually, we got a ban
on tobacco in Maharashtra,

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:36.650
in the state, with
the NGO, of course,

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:39.247
doing most of the
work, Salaam Mumbai.

00:34:39.247 --> 00:34:41.580
So I've been connected to
Salaam Mumbai for a long time.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:43.413
We've been doing a lot
of work through them.

00:34:43.413 --> 00:34:44.560
So that was one.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:49.171
When the Swachh Barat thing came
in, so we did a lot of songs

00:34:49.171 --> 00:34:49.670
on that.

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:52.820
Then we did a song for
Indore, Swachh Indore.

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:58.130
And incidentally, it
became the number-one city.

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:00.650

to me, and thank you, sir.

it motivated people.

I tell them, [NON-ENGLISH]

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:15.360
ROHIT KAPOOR: I hope
you get to do that.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.193
SHAAN: I think they
make them feel powerful.

00:35:17.193 --> 00:35:19.200
No, but it's just
coincidence that happened.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:24.677
More recently, I did a song
on the plastic ban thing.

00:35:24.677 --> 00:35:26.760
No, the ban was already
proclaimed, then the song.

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:29.220
So I wasn't the cause for this.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:35.370
But it was done with
the UN, and we actually

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:40.830
had UN spokesman flew in
on Earth Day, 5th of June

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:42.580
in India, because
we had hosted that.

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.420
And we put the song out.

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:47.670
We had 11 artists singing it,
right from Shankar Mahadevan,

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:51.035
Sonu Nigam, Sunidhi Chauhan.

00:35:51.035 --> 00:35:52.410
I'd like to think
that they sang,

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:55.319
because I called them and
said, dude, sing for me.

00:35:55.319 --> 00:35:57.110
But no, they sang for
the cause, of course.

00:35:57.110 --> 00:36:02.180

Khuranna, Armaan Malik.

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:05.520

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:08.410
So we had them.

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:12.890
Shiamak Davar choreographed it,
so the song did really well.

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:17.830

In 2005.

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:45.980
But they kind of used it for
the soundtrack of "Narnia."

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:47.460
It was a song
called "Shuruaat--"

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:48.460
"Ye hi ant ki Shuruaat."

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:51.552

very little time.

We messed up to
such a large extent.

00:37:58.294 --> 00:37:59.710
But for some reason,
they thought,

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:01.600
instead of doing
a song and making

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:06.750

I did a song that
was created by Blue--

it's a band in the UK,
a very popular band--

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:29.865
called "One Love," which was
created after the 9/11 tragedy.

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.830
So they wanted to
create this Asian mix.

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:39.950
So they had gotten artists
from various parts of Asia.

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:42.630
Also, they wanted
people in America

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:45.630
to know the Asians are not just
Chinese or Korean or Japanese.

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:47.570

[APPLAUSE]

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:41.060
Incidentally, all the songs
I've sung-- almost all of them--

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:43.840
I've written the lyrics
to, except for "Musu Musu

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.980

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:46.575

00:40:46.575 --> 00:40:48.580
But yeah.

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:51.489
So that's another thing I do.

00:40:51.489 --> 00:40:53.030
ROHIT KAPOOR: It's
a passion as well.

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.969
SHAAN: Lyrics too.

00:40:53.969 --> 00:40:55.760
When you know you're
not good at one thing,

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.667
you try to do too many
other things also.

00:40:57.667 --> 00:40:59.000
So you kind of keep it balanced.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.550
ROHIT KAPOOR: In your case,
it works out perfectly well.

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:01.049
SHAAN: Yeah.

00:41:01.049 --> 00:41:02.997
But coming back to
this song, then it

00:41:02.997 --> 00:41:04.580
came in to a film
called [INAUDIBLE],,

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:09.060
where [INAUDIBLE] just
did a hip-hop thing on it.

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:13.620
So it happens sometimes,
lost in translation.

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:15.760
I should have known people
don't listen to lyric.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:16.968

00:41:16.968 --> 00:41:18.230
SHAAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:20.450
That day, I went to a very--
it was a very, you know,

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:23.570
sort of a program.

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:28.510
It was semi-devotional,
spiritual, rather, where

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:31.160
you can't have random songs.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:34.880
So I had to choose even from
my songs that are almost

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.200

maybe I won't do
this one, you know?

00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:00.809

No, I'll just do that.

just cigarettes.

3% or 5% of it now.

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:26.660
Apparently, every
two weeks in the US

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:29.140
alone, you have deaths that
amount to the number of deaths

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:31.350
of the 9/11-- every two weeks.

00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:34.660

that we are talking

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:38.350

you heard, I said,

00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:48.550
I don't know if I'm naughty

you really want me
to tell you that?

I audible or not?

00:51:02.050 --> 00:51:06.610
Recently, I went to a recording
studio with my sister.

00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:08.280
She did awesome singing.

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.250
And I'm like, maybe it's easy.

00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:12.760
So I went up, and
I tried to sing.

00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:22.570

00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:24.270

like, let me hear.

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:26.440

was your experience--

00:51:28.357 --> 00:51:29.231
SHAAN: You know what?

00:51:29.231 --> 00:51:30.730
Lately, there's
been a lot of talk

00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:33.040
that just about anyone
can sing these days.

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:33.710
It's so easy.

00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:36.040
There's autotuning
and things like that.

00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:40.610
But you have to sing
to a certain level.

00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:43.910
It's not like just about
anyone can be made to sing.

00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:46.077
A lot of singers
from my generation

00:51:46.077 --> 00:51:48.160
have been venting out and
saying things like that.

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:49.070
[NON-ENGLISH]

00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:56.920
You need to know your music.

00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:58.900
So you're right about that.

00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:01.015
And it's also quite
intimidating-- the headphone

00:52:01.015 --> 00:52:01.807
and all that stuff.

00:52:01.807 --> 00:52:02.556
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:52:02.556 --> 00:52:04.450
So I wanted to know how
was your experience?

00:52:04.450 --> 00:52:07.840
First time when you went to
the studio, what did you feel?

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:09.042
Was it a cake walk?

00:52:09.042 --> 00:52:11.500
SHAAN: Strangely, you know how
your earliest memories would

00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:14.050
be when you were, like,
four and stuff like that?

00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:16.600
I started singing from
that age, professionally.

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:17.320
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:21.099
SHAAN: So I really don't
know what it's like.

00:52:21.099 --> 00:52:22.390
I used to think everyone sings.

00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:26.950
Because at home, everyone sang.

00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:29.620
Because my dad being a composer,
only singers would come in.

00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:31.600
So they would also sing.

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:33.640
And so I just thought
everyone sings.

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:34.844
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:34.844 --> 00:52:35.344
It's true.

00:52:35.344 --> 00:52:37.010
It's like that.

00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:39.490
So the first song I
sang I was 4 and 1/2.

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:42.434
And it's on record.

00:52:42.434 --> 00:52:44.100
A lot of people say
a lot of things now,

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:45.400
and it's, that boy lies.

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:49.170
[NON-ENGLISH]

00:52:49.170 --> 00:52:51.870
The company was then called
HMV, which is now Saregama.

00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:53.980
It was a Bengali
nursery rhyme album.

00:52:53.980 --> 00:53:01.640
And it was [NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:03.910
Yeah, it was put
on those platforms.

00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:06.370
Then, the headphones
were even bulkier.

00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:07.780
You can trust me on that.

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:08.897
It was crazy.

00:53:08.897 --> 00:53:10.480
I would have been a
few inches taller,

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:17.910
but wearing these headphones,
I shrunk my spine.

00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:21.130
So I used to sing for children,
advertising and stuff,

00:53:21.130 --> 00:53:23.800
all those advertisements
of certain products

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:26.070
that probably don't
even exist anymore.

00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:28.319
It's through the '70s.

00:53:28.319 --> 00:53:30.610
But I don't think we can
mention products, because this

00:53:30.610 --> 00:53:32.160
is going on YouTube, nah?

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:33.010

stay away from that.

00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:35.260

00:53:37.043 --> 00:53:37.930

00:53:37.930 --> 00:53:40.054
ROHIT KAPOOR: Let's talk
about the number of views,

00:53:40.054 --> 00:53:42.662
then, offline.

00:53:42.662 --> 00:53:44.620
SHAAN: I think we can
then approach them later,

00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:46.540
saying so many
people got to know

00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:48.897
that I sang for your company,
and can we crack a deal?

00:53:48.897 --> 00:53:50.730
ROHIT KAPOOR: Let's
talk about this offline.

00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:51.354
SHAAN: Offline?

00:53:51.354 --> 00:53:52.330
OK.

00:53:52.330 --> 00:53:54.750
So I sang for jingles and
stuff, so I started very early.

00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:55.750
So that's the one thing.

00:53:55.750 --> 00:54:00.400
I never got intimidated
by singing or recording.

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:01.900
Live singing started
a little late.

00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:05.680
And live singing is something
that always intimidates me.

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:06.820
I don't know.

00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:10.060
Because some guys probably have
a shot, but I don't do that.

00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:13.240
I just do my 20 push-ups
and get on stage.

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:16.510
But even today, it's always
scary to be on stage, even

00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:19.660
right now, singing, because I
just came and started singing.

00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:20.980
AUDIENCE: You were awesome.

00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:24.120
SHAAN: It's not in top
shape, in terms of my throat.

00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:26.350
But life is always scary.

00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:28.570
And life is real today.

00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:30.940
So when you sing
for a recording,

00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:32.490
some singers are quick.

00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:35.730
We finish in, like, 40
minutes at the most.

00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:36.745
Some singers take days.

00:54:40.554 --> 00:54:42.220
You can do it again
and again and again.

00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:44.190
Then you have technology
that can set it up.

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:45.136
But live is real.

00:54:45.136 --> 00:54:46.010
AUDIENCE: True, true.

00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:48.051
SHAAN: Then the same person
comes and sings live,

00:54:48.051 --> 00:54:49.232
and you're like, huh?

00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:56.440
I remember doing a show
with this lovely lady.

00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:58.540
So she had a very,
very popular song,

00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:00.280
and it was completely autotuned.

00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:02.290
So when she sang
live, these guys

00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:03.995
kept on saying neh,
neh, neh, neh, neh.

00:55:03.995 --> 00:55:05.880
[NON-ENGLISH]

00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:07.780
You know, the kind of
autotuning that was

00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:09.910
done when Cher did that song?

00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:12.200
[HUMMING "BELIEVE"]

00:55:12.795 --> 00:55:14.370
So it was obvious.

00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:17.020
They did it intentionally
to create a sound.

00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:19.330
So this song was also created
that way intentionally

00:55:19.330 --> 00:55:20.440
for that sound.

00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:22.840
So when she was singing it
live, they would stop her.

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:23.340
No, no, no.

00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:24.690
It's not sounding the same.

00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:26.640
How is she going to sing it?

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:29.310
They wanted her to sing
that autotuned style.

00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:30.110
That's so strange.

00:55:30.110 --> 00:55:30.940

00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:07.260
That song is truly a
philosophy that I believe,

00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:09.640
because we never
really get anywhere.

an hour, so what?

00:56:25.830 --> 00:56:28.552
That fantastic campus--
and you get Google,

00:56:28.552 --> 00:56:30.510
and you realize you want
something more, right?

00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:32.070
ROHIT KAPOOR: Yeah, always.

OK, last two minutes.

00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:52.130
SHAAN: She mentioned
the song, got up,

00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:54.210
and started dancing to it.

00:57:54.210 --> 00:57:55.560
There was a slight movement.

00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:57.752
ROHIT KAPOOR: You
cannot say no to that.

00:57:57.752 --> 00:57:58.460
SHAAN: Of course.

00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:02.284
And this is, of course, a song I
am sure many of you connect to.

00:58:02.284 --> 00:58:03.325
I think that's important.

00:58:03.325 --> 00:58:04.730
When I write a
song, I don't want

00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:06.750
to write a song that's
been written before.

00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:08.690
So if I wrote a song
like, "Gujjar," I

00:58:08.690 --> 00:58:10.270
felt way back
then-- now, they're

00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:12.640
talking about depression
and all that kind of stuff.

00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:16.370
Amit.

00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:17.820
You know, Amit Padukone.

00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:19.970
He apparently has a
cousin who's very popular.

00:58:22.192 --> 00:58:23.900
ROHIT KAPOOR: That's
what he's known for.

00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:25.490
SHAAN: He was doing a
lot about depression now.

00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:27.830
It is a serious situation,
but I had a solution to it

00:58:27.830 --> 00:58:30.710
way back then with
"Gujjar," in terms of song.

00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:33.050
"Tanha Dil," again,
was about when

00:58:33.050 --> 00:58:36.200
you leave your roots, your
country, and you go somewhere.

00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:37.540
But you have to carry on.

00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:44.170
So don't ask me why I
wrote a song like Kenny

00:58:44.170 --> 00:58:46.897
G. or any other frivolous song.

00:58:46.897 --> 00:58:48.230
But obviously, that didn't work.

00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:51.970
So I'll stick to writing
songs with meaning and sense.
