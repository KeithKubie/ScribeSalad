seriously in their strategy right and
 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.900
seriously in their strategy right and
actually the success of many of you is

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910
actually the success of many of you is
 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.330
actually the success of many of you is
linked to the fact that all traditional

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340
linked to the fact that all traditional
 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.550
linked to the fact that all traditional
players were not taking into their

players were not taking into their
 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.120
players were not taking into their
strategy mobile seriously and we hope

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130
strategy mobile seriously and we hope
 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.890
strategy mobile seriously and we hope
that you not gonna do the same mistake

thinking about machine learning and
 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.440
thinking about machine learning and
starting by thinking okay are you

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450
starting by thinking okay are you
 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.240
starting by thinking okay are you
machine learning ready okay so what are

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250
machine learning ready okay so what are
 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.050
machine learning ready okay so what are
the key initial conditions before taking

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060
the key initial conditions before taking

so first of all do you have a problem

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860
so first of all do you have a problem
 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.790
so first of all do you have a problem
sounds a bit silly but this is probably

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800
sounds a bit silly but this is probably
 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.350
sounds a bit silly but this is probably
one of the most common mistake we

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360
one of the most common mistake we

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.230
problem the other way around right you
should look at your problems and not

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240
should look at your problems and not
 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.300

machine learning feature but it's
 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:37.180
machine learning feature but it's
useless because it's not actually not

once you have a problem obviously you

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229
once you have a problem obviously you
 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:43.659
once you have a problem obviously you
need data you need a lot of data you

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669
need data you need a lot of data you
 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.149
need data you need a lot of data you
need a lot of quality data large volume

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:46.159
need a lot of quality data large volume
 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:48.249
need a lot of quality data large volume
and you need to be able to kind of

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259
and you need to be able to kind of
 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:51.100
and you need to be able to kind of
access it and process it acts at scale

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110
access it and process it acts at scale
 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.629
access it and process it acts at scale
so that means that you might have to go

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639
so that means that you might have to go
 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.749
so that means that you might have to go
through a process of improvement of your

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759
through a process of improvement of your
 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:57.189
through a process of improvement of your
infrastructure you have to clean your

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199
infrastructure you have to clean your
 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.409
infrastructure you have to clean your
data and you might have to even think

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419
data and you might have to even think
 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:01.629

is the presence or not of labels within
 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.860
is the presence or not of labels within
your data so in the example of image

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870
your data so in the example of image
 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.240
your data so in the example of image
recognition you might have data that

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250
recognition you might have data that
 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.310
recognition you might have data that
will tell you the object that is present

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:44.320
will tell you the object that is present
 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.170
will tell you the object that is present
within your image right but

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180
within your image right but
 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.480
within your image right but
unfortunately often this might not be

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490
unfortunately often this might not be
 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.580
unfortunately often this might not be
the case in this case you might have to

the case in this case you might have to
 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.370
the case in this case you might have to
consider starting to collect these

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:53.380
consider starting to collect these
 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.620
consider starting to collect these
labels or even think about choosing

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:55.630
labels or even think about choosing
 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.140

with using machine learning to before
 

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:21.610
with using machine learning to before
but how many of you actually have

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:21.620
but how many of you actually have
 

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.810
but how many of you actually have
delivered product using machine learning

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:24.820

right so not as many so it's obvious

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:27.320
right so not as many so it's obvious
 

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.630
right so not as many so it's obvious
that everybody's really excited about

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640
that everybody's really excited about
 

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.540
that everybody's really excited about
the possibilities of machine learning

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:30.550
the possibilities of machine learning
 

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:34.030
the possibilities of machine learning
but it's not as easy to get from having

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:34.040
but it's not as easy to get from having
 

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.620
but it's not as easy to get from having
ideas and using the technology to get

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:35.630
ideas and using the technology to get
 

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:37.329
ideas and using the technology to get
something out there

00:10:37.329 --> 00:10:37.339
something out there
 

00:10:37.339 --> 00:10:41.230

so we we're doing hackathons on a

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:41.240
so we we're doing hackathons on a
 

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.329
so we we're doing hackathons on a
regular basis like every six weeks and

00:10:43.329 --> 00:10:43.339
regular basis like every six weeks and
 

00:10:43.339 --> 00:10:45.280

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.160
that in place after the hack there was
thought okay this is really cool how can

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:21.170
thought okay this is really cool how can
 

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.170
thought okay this is really cool how can
we take this and actually make this

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:23.180
we take this and actually make this
 

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.790
we take this and actually make this
something that we can give to our users

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800
something that we can give to our users
 

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.420
something that we can give to our users
so don't we we started kind of looking

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:28.430
so don't we we started kind of looking
 

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.250
so don't we we started kind of looking
at the product and try to define it

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:30.260
at the product and try to define it
 

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.310
at the product and try to define it
better and what we what we knew we want

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:33.320
better and what we what we knew we want
 

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.110
better and what we what we knew we want
to have we want to make sure that it's

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120
to have we want to make sure that it's
 

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.880
to have we want to make sure that it's
very accurate because we teach people

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:36.890
very accurate because we teach people
 

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:38.199
very accurate because we teach people
languages we can teach them the wrong

00:11:38.199 --> 00:11:38.209
languages we can teach them the wrong
 

00:11:38.209 --> 00:11:39.970
languages we can teach them the wrong
thing it has to be in the right

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:39.980
thing it has to be in the right
 

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.370
thing it has to be in the right
difficulty level it and it has to be

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:42.380
difficulty level it and it has to be
 

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.470
difficulty level it and it has to be
really fast and give like oh wow this is

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480
really fast and give like oh wow this is
 

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:44.809
really fast and give like oh wow this is
my

00:11:44.809 --> 00:11:44.819
my
 

00:11:44.819 --> 00:11:46.609
my
like really bringing the technology

00:11:46.609 --> 00:11:46.619
like really bringing the technology
 

00:11:46.619 --> 00:11:50.529
like really bringing the technology
forward the interesting thing is that

00:11:50.529 --> 00:11:50.539
forward the interesting thing is that
 

00:11:50.539 --> 00:11:52.549
forward the interesting thing is that
actually getting a machine learning

00:11:52.549 --> 00:11:52.559
actually getting a machine learning
 

00:11:52.559 --> 00:11:55.099
actually getting a machine learning
model or in this particular case object

00:11:55.099 --> 00:11:55.109
model or in this particular case object
 

00:11:55.109 --> 00:11:57.469
model or in this particular case object
recognition was really the easy part

00:11:57.469 --> 00:11:57.479
recognition was really the easy part
 

00:11:57.479 --> 00:12:00.199
recognition was really the easy part
the more difficult part was to get it to

00:12:00.199 --> 00:12:00.209
the more difficult part was to get it to
 

00:12:00.209 --> 00:12:02.900
the more difficult part was to get it to
recognize the right things so if you

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:02.910
recognize the right things so if you
 

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:04.009
recognize the right things so if you
guys look at that picture what do you

00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:04.019
guys look at that picture what do you
 

00:12:04.019 --> 00:12:09.169
guys look at that picture what do you
see yeah so a guy a man if I look at

00:12:09.169 --> 00:12:09.179
see yeah so a guy a man if I look at
 

00:12:09.179 --> 00:12:10.639
see yeah so a guy a man if I look at
that which actually I see James who's

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:10.649
that which actually I see James who's
 

00:12:10.649 --> 00:12:12.349
that which actually I see James who's
one of the people that worked on this

00:12:12.349 --> 00:12:12.359
one of the people that worked on this
 

00:12:12.359 --> 00:12:14.779
one of the people that worked on this
project now we took this image and we

00:12:14.779 --> 00:12:14.789
project now we took this image and we
 

00:12:14.789 --> 00:12:17.419
project now we took this image and we
gave it to Google vision API which is an

00:12:17.419 --> 00:12:17.429
gave it to Google vision API which is an
 

00:12:17.429 --> 00:12:19.249
gave it to Google vision API which is an
amazing piece of technology and this is

00:12:19.249 --> 00:12:19.259
amazing piece of technology and this is
 

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:22.189
amazing piece of technology and this is
what it came up with so hair facial hair

00:12:22.189 --> 00:12:22.199
what it came up with so hair facial hair
 

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:24.739
what it came up with so hair facial hair
beard well this picture is definitely

00:12:24.739 --> 00:12:24.749
beard well this picture is definitely
 

00:12:24.749 --> 00:12:27.199
beard well this picture is definitely
very much fun but I think that's not the

00:12:27.199 --> 00:12:27.209
very much fun but I think that's not the
 

00:12:27.209 --> 00:12:29.059
very much fun but I think that's not the
first thing when we look at the picture

00:12:29.059 --> 00:12:29.069
first thing when we look at the picture
 

00:12:29.069 --> 00:12:31.549
first thing when we look at the picture
we think it so I think context is really

00:12:31.549 --> 00:12:31.559
we think it so I think context is really
 

00:12:31.559 --> 00:12:33.079
we think it so I think context is really
really important it's not about

00:12:33.079 --> 00:12:33.089
really important it's not about
 

00:12:33.089 --> 00:12:35.329
really important it's not about
recognizing object is recognizing the

00:12:35.329 --> 00:12:35.339
recognizing object is recognizing the
 

00:12:35.339 --> 00:12:38.299
recognizing object is recognizing the
right objects and we spend most of the

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:38.309
right objects and we spend most of the
 

00:12:38.309 --> 00:12:44.229
right objects and we spend most of the
time really focusing on that so once we

00:12:44.229 --> 00:12:44.239
time really focusing on that so once we
 

00:12:44.239 --> 00:12:46.609
time really focusing on that so once we
after playing around with a lot of

00:12:46.609 --> 00:12:46.619
after playing around with a lot of
 

00:12:46.619 --> 00:12:48.590
after playing around with a lot of
models and the quite a few out there we

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.600
models and the quite a few out there we
 

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.149
models and the quite a few out there we
actually decide to train our own model

00:12:50.149 --> 00:12:50.159
actually decide to train our own model
 

00:12:50.159 --> 00:12:52.519
actually decide to train our own model
so we used the based on was using

00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:52.529
so we used the based on was using
 

00:12:52.529 --> 00:12:54.109
so we used the based on was using
Inception v3 which is a model which

00:12:54.109 --> 00:12:54.119
Inception v3 which is a model which
 

00:12:54.119 --> 00:12:55.819
Inception v3 which is a model which
exists on on top of that we trained our

00:12:55.819 --> 00:12:55.829
exists on on top of that we trained our
 

00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:58.669
exists on on top of that we trained our
own model so what we actually did is we

00:12:58.669 --> 00:12:58.679
own model so what we actually did is we
 

00:12:58.679 --> 00:13:04.489
own model so what we actually did is we
got product managers to to collect a lot

00:13:04.489 --> 00:13:04.499
got product managers to to collect a lot
 

00:13:04.499 --> 00:13:06.710
got product managers to to collect a lot
of images we first define the images

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720
of images we first define the images
 

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.809
of images we first define the images
that we care about so we do a lot of

00:13:08.809 --> 00:13:08.819
that we care about so we do a lot of
 

00:13:08.819 --> 00:13:10.639
that we care about so we do a lot of
user surveys which was done somehow our

00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:10.649
user surveys which was done somehow our
 

00:13:10.649 --> 00:13:13.999
user surveys which was done somehow our
users use the app and we know they often

00:13:13.999 --> 00:13:14.009
users use the app and we know they often
 

00:13:14.009 --> 00:13:15.829
users use the app and we know they often
time for example they use it at their

00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839
time for example they use it at their
 

00:13:15.839 --> 00:13:18.109
time for example they use it at their
homes so we thought about okay so which

00:13:18.109 --> 00:13:18.119
homes so we thought about okay so which
 

00:13:18.119 --> 00:13:19.789
homes so we thought about okay so which
objects are available in their immediate

00:13:19.789 --> 00:13:19.799
objects are available in their immediate
 

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:22.129
objects are available in their immediate
surroundings so we try to define that

00:13:22.129 --> 00:13:22.139
surroundings so we try to define that
 

00:13:22.139 --> 00:13:23.869
surroundings so we try to define that
list of objects which were in the

00:13:23.869 --> 00:13:23.879
list of objects which were in the
 

00:13:23.879 --> 00:13:26.319
list of objects which were in the
hundreds and then start collecting

00:13:26.319 --> 00:13:26.329
hundreds and then start collecting
 

00:13:26.329 --> 00:13:30.369
hundreds and then start collecting
collecting the images and actually

00:13:30.369 --> 00:13:30.379
collecting the images and actually
 

00:13:30.379 --> 00:13:32.449
collecting the images and actually
product managers spend a lot of time

00:13:32.449 --> 00:13:32.459
product managers spend a lot of time
 

00:13:32.459 --> 00:13:36.259
product managers spend a lot of time
collecting images from from different

00:13:36.259 --> 00:13:36.269
collecting images from from different
 

00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:38.239
collecting images from from different
sources and we found out that actually

00:13:38.239 --> 00:13:38.249
sources and we found out that actually
 

00:13:38.249 --> 00:13:40.219
sources and we found out that actually
we need quite a few example and like

00:13:40.219 --> 00:13:40.229
we need quite a few example and like
 

00:13:40.229 --> 00:13:42.259
we need quite a few example and like
some objects needed more than others for

00:13:42.259 --> 00:13:42.269
some objects needed more than others for
 

00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:44.449
some objects needed more than others for
example people so as you can see here

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:44.459
example people so as you can see here
 

00:13:44.459 --> 00:13:46.669
example people so as you can see here
there is a one example of has a secured

00:13:46.669 --> 00:13:46.679
there is a one example of has a secured
 

00:13:46.679 --> 00:13:48.710
there is a one example of has a secured
engineer which is not quite a hair dryer

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720
engineer which is not quite a hair dryer
 

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.849
engineer which is not quite a hair dryer
maybe needs one but but yeah but so this

00:13:52.849 --> 00:13:52.859
maybe needs one but but yeah but so this
 

00:13:52.859 --> 00:13:54.319
maybe needs one but but yeah but so this
was an example of something which was a

00:13:54.319 --> 00:13:54.329
was an example of something which was a
 

00:13:54.329 --> 00:13:56.239
was an example of something which was a
bit difficult and as you can see there

00:13:56.239 --> 00:13:56.249
bit difficult and as you can see there
 

00:13:56.249 --> 00:13:57.059
bit difficult and as you can see there
there

00:13:57.059 --> 00:13:57.069
there
 

00:13:57.069 --> 00:13:58.710
there
a picture of bicycle and a picture of

00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720
a picture of bicycle and a picture of
 

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.600
a picture of bicycle and a picture of
glasses and they're both recognized as

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:00.610
glasses and they're both recognized as
 

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:02.340
glasses and they're both recognized as
glasses something that we wouldn't

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:02.350
glasses something that we wouldn't
 

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:04.739
glasses something that we wouldn't
imagine that it will you would never

00:14:04.739 --> 00:14:04.749
imagine that it will you would never
 

00:14:04.749 --> 00:14:06.150
imagine that it will you would never
look at the bicycle sir oh it's glasses

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160
look at the bicycle sir oh it's glasses
 

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.280
look at the bicycle sir oh it's glasses
but it's actually a problems that emerge

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:08.290
but it's actually a problems that emerge
 

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:10.439
but it's actually a problems that emerge
and we had to do a lot of back-and-forth

00:14:10.439 --> 00:14:10.449
and we had to do a lot of back-and-forth
 

00:14:10.449 --> 00:14:13.229
and we had to do a lot of back-and-forth
collecting more and more images focusing

00:14:13.229 --> 00:14:13.239
collecting more and more images focusing
 

00:14:13.239 --> 00:14:16.199
collecting more and more images focusing
on amateur photography and also

00:14:16.199 --> 00:14:16.209
on amateur photography and also
 

00:14:16.209 --> 00:14:18.869
on amateur photography and also
different sizes and shapes of the

00:14:18.869 --> 00:14:18.879
different sizes and shapes of the
 

00:14:18.879 --> 00:14:22.710
different sizes and shapes of the
objects that we really care about so

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720
objects that we really care about so
 

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.759
objects that we really care about so
there are a lot of interesting examples

00:14:23.759 --> 00:14:23.769
there are a lot of interesting examples
 

00:14:23.769 --> 00:14:26.509
there are a lot of interesting examples
in the slides were there were problems

00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:26.519
in the slides were there were problems
 

00:14:26.519 --> 00:14:29.429
in the slides were there were problems
but by iterating and understand what it

00:14:29.429 --> 00:14:29.439
but by iterating and understand what it
 

00:14:29.439 --> 00:14:31.079
but by iterating and understand what it
is that we want to build and what we

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:31.089
is that we want to build and what we
 

00:14:31.089 --> 00:14:34.739
is that we want to build and what we
care what we care about being the final

00:14:34.739 --> 00:14:34.749
care what we care about being the final
 

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:36.629
care what we care about being the final
result we came up with a really neat

00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639
result we came up with a really neat
 

00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:39.359
result we came up with a really neat
product so it's just a few images from

00:14:39.359 --> 00:14:39.369
product so it's just a few images from
 

00:14:39.369 --> 00:14:41.039
product so it's just a few images from
the finished product that actually

00:14:41.039 --> 00:14:41.049
the finished product that actually
 

00:14:41.049 --> 00:14:42.840
the finished product that actually
trekking has really nice things like

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:42.850
trekking has really nice things like
 

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:44.609
trekking has really nice things like
airplanes and stuff like that and now

00:14:44.609 --> 00:14:44.619
airplanes and stuff like that and now
 

00:14:44.619 --> 00:14:46.590
airplanes and stuff like that and now
were in the process of finding how to

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:46.600
were in the process of finding how to
 

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:50.100
were in the process of finding how to
integrate it best with our product so

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:50.110
integrate it best with our product so
 

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:53.100
integrate it best with our product so
just a few lessons learned I think like

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:53.110
just a few lessons learned I think like
 

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:56.819
just a few lessons learned I think like
I like I said I think even with a really

00:14:56.819 --> 00:14:56.829
I like I said I think even with a really
 

00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:58.889
I like I said I think even with a really
good model different data sets really

00:14:58.889 --> 00:14:58.899
good model different data sets really
 

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:01.379
good model different data sets really
equal different products so like you see

00:15:01.379 --> 00:15:01.389
equal different products so like you see
 

00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:03.809
equal different products so like you see
so in the Google vision API it's not

00:15:03.809 --> 00:15:03.819
so in the Google vision API it's not

megabytes or gigabytes and that's that's
 

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:58.510
megabytes or gigabytes and that's that's
a concern when you
